A chromogenic reaction believed to be specific for iron was evaluated as a means to improve the visualization of the ferric phytate on the gels. The results suggest that white bands, which are formed when protein-phytate complexes on polyacrylamide gels are treated with iron solution, could be the result of nonspecific protein-iron interaction in addition to phytate-iron interaction. These findings were supported by experiments in which proteins containing no phytate gave positive staining for the reaction believed to be specific for phytate-iron complex. 3aphytic acid 3aproteins 3abeans 3afood analysis 3achemical analysis 0ainteractions1 aAlli, I.1 aKermasha, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1991 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.2128-2130x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00012a0053Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001300139245011700152300001600269520112700285650002001412650002701432650004401459650001301503650001601516653001401532653001501546700001701561700001501578773010001593852000901693856007901702939003301781946001301814655001201827IND9203768320221116211932.0920612e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920376832DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00015a0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, J.Y.10aDetection of solidlike components in starch using cross-relaxation and Fouier transform wide-line 1H NMR methods  ap. 449-455.  aA new proton (1H) NMR method, nuclear magnetic cross-relaxation spectroscopy, permits sensitive detection of immobilized polymer in starch samples. The 1H cross-relaxation spectrum reflects the amount and relative rigidity of immobilized starch chains. Cross-relaxation integrated spectral intensities for freshly gelatinized waxy maize starch were found to depend sensitively on starch concentration above 10 wt %. Retrogradation is observed to introduce a broad component to the cross-relaxation spectrum, interpreted as an increase in fraction of immobilized starch chains. Kinetics of aging may thus be expressed in terms of the changes in amount and relative rigidity of solidlike components. The complementary wide-line Fourier transform 1H NMR spectrum obtained with magic angle spinning verifies the presence of immobilized starch with a very wide 1H resonance and simultaneously shows narrow starch resonances, indicating a highly mobile starch fraction. The combined evidence demonstrates a very wide distribution of starch chain segmental mobilities and that the distribution changes as gelatinized starch ages. 3astarch granules 3amolecular conformation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3acorn starch 0astructure 0aproperties1 aBryant, R.G.1 aEads, T.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.449-455x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00015a0173Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02013naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245009400157300001600251500001500267520099100282650001501273650001701288650002001305650002001325650002601345653001201371653001201383700001701395700001701412773010001429852000901529856007901538939003301617946001301650655001201663IND9203768020221116211624.0920612e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920376802DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00015a0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemsley, E.K.10aPotential of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fiber optics for process control  ap. 435-438.  a2019-12-04  aFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is well-established as an off-line analytical technique. In this work, the spectrometer is adapted through the addition of an optical fiber system to provide a powerful tool for on-line analysis and control. A multiplexed fiber interface has been constructed, enabling rapid sequential analysis of up to six different samples. Novel fiber optic sampling cells developed for the system include a transmission cell for use in the near-infrared (near-IR) and an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell for the mid-infrared (mid-IR). A number of commercially available optical fibers with varying transmission properties have been investigated. High-quality spectra have been acquired from a variety of food samples and calibrations obtained for components such as carbohydrates and ethanol in soft and alcoholic drinks. A prototype process control system uses the calibration data to control simple processes such as additions and dilutions. 3amonitoring 3afiber optics 3ainstrumentation 3afood processing 3ainfrared spectroscopy 0asensors 0aon line1 aWilson, R.H.1 aBelton, P.S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.435-438x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00015a0143Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02102naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001100139245011500150300001600265520098700281650001401268650002401282650000901306650002001315650001001335650001501345650001801360650001301378650002501391653002101416700001501437700001701452700001301469773010001482852000901582856007901591939003301670946001301703655001201716IND9203768720221116211819.0920612e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920376872DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00015a0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOi, Y.10aInduction of capsaicin-hydrolyzing enzyme activity in rat liver by continuous oral administration of capsaicin  ap. 467-470.  aEffects of continuous oral administration of capsaicin (CAP) on the CAP-hydrolyzing enzyme activity in liver were investigated in rats. Rats were given a standard laboratory diet supplemented with 14 mg of CAP/100 g of diet, ad libitum, for 3 days and 1 and 3 weeks. It was found that CAP administration for 1 and 3 weeks significantly increased the CAP-hydrolyzing enzyme activity compared with that of each control group. Reaction products were chromatographically identified as vanillyl alcohol, vanillin, and vanillic acid. The CAP-hydrolyzing enzyme activity found in rat liver was also detected in chicken, hog, and bovine livers. It was suggested that the initial step of CAP metabolism was the hydrolysis reaction of the acid-amide bond in the CAP molecule and that this hydrolysis would be the rate-limiting step in CAP metabolism. These results suggest that the CAP-hydrolyzing enzyme activity reached maximum induction by continuous oral administration of CAP for 1 week. 3acapsaicin 3aoral administration 3arats 3aenzyme activity 3aliver 3ametabolism 3avanillic acid 3avanillin 3anutrition physiology 0avanillyl alcohol1 aKawada, T.1 aWatanabe, T.1 aIwai, K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.467-470x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00015a0213Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01514naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245010600156300001800262500002300280520050600303650002100809650002300830650002900853650003200882650001600914650002300930653002300953773010300976856007901079939003301158852000901191655001201200IND9205353020221116211613.0920826e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920535302DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00012a0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepine, F.L.10aEffects of ionizing radiation on pesticides in a food irradiation perspective: a bibliographic review  ap. 2112-2118.  aLiterature review.  aThe effects of gamma irradiation on pesticides in solution or in food are reviewed.

The most favorable combination of several ELISA formats and a variety of synthesized hapten-enzyme conjugates resulted in a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay with 50% inhibition (I50) at 0.25 micrograms/L and a detection limit of 0.03 micrograms/L. This assay is the most sensitive atrazine assay, based on monoclonal antibodies published so far, and can be performed in less than 1 h. All formats were based on the use of hapten-enzyme conjugates (enzyme tracers). Direct coating and precoating with goat anti-mouse antibodies or protein A were used. The formats using precoating steps turned out to be the most sensitive. Enzyme tracers based on two different atrazine and simazine haptens each with two different spacers (C3 or C6) were conjugated using either alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. The atrazine derivative with the C6 spacer arm conjugated to horseradish peroxidase provided highest sensitivity. 3atriazine herbicides 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0aimmunoassays1 aHammock, B.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.525-530x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00015a0333Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01775naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245013200157300001600289520051200305650001700817650001000834650002400844650002400868650002600892650002400918653002100942700001700963700001800980700001800998700001801016700001801034700001801052700001501070700001801085700001601103773010001119852000901219856007901228939003301307946001301340655001201353IND9203765320221116211916.0920612e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920376532DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00014a0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, K.A.10aDeveloping physical property-based rules which govern the greenhouse activity of herbicidal 2-aryl-1,2,4-triazole-5(1H)-thiones  ap. 306-311.  aThe understanding of physical properties which significantly influence greenhouse efficacy of a series of soil-applied pre-emergent herbicides is discussed.

One of the most active compounds of this class is 2-methylcinnolinium-4-(O-methyl phosphonate) (MCP). The symptoms of phytotoxicity include desiccation, chlorosis, and necrosis, and are very similar to those caused by methylviologen. Both MCP and methylviologen have reversible oxidation-reduction waves as measured by cyclic voltammetry, and both molecules have reduction potentials that are sufficiently positive to compete for electrons with the endogenous electron acceptors of photosystem I (PS I). MCP is a highly active inhibitor of whole-chain electron transport, similar to methylviologen, with an I50 of about 25 micromoles. This compound is not an inhibitor of photosystem II (PS II). However, when PS Il is inhibited by diuron, partial-chain electron transport from the artificial electron donor DPIPH2 to NADP is still strongly inhibited (I50 = 40 micromoles) by this molecule. We conclude that MCP acts in the same fashion as methylviologen (Bowyer, J. R.; Camilleri, P. In Herbicides; Hutson, D. H., Roberts, T. R., Eds.; Wiley: New York, 1987; pp 105-145), by competing with endogenous acceptors for electrons that would normally flow through the reducing side of PSI to NADP. 3aherbicides 3aphosphonates 3afoliar application 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3aelectron transfer 0ainhibition1 aSteffens, J.J.1 aGrayson, B.T.1 aKleier, D.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.318-321x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00014a0303Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02189naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245010700157300001600264520115000280650001501430650002901445650001501474650002201489650001901511650001601530653001101546700001901557700001401576700001501590773010001605852000901705856007901714939003301793946001301826655001201839IND9203765020221116212201.0920612e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920376502DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00014a0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoorman, T.B.10aProduction of hydroxybenzoic acids by Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains after treatment with glyphosate  ap. 289-293.  aGlyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] effects on the growth and metabolism of the nitrogen-fixing soybean (Glycine max) symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum were investigated. In higher plants glyphosate inhibits the shikimic acid pathway, causing accumulations of shikimic acid and certain benzoic acids, such as protocatechuic (PCA) and gallic acid. We sought to determine whether glyphosate also causes the accumulation of shikimic acid-derived benzoic acids in B. japonicum. Three strains (USDA 110, 123, and 138) were grown in defined media lacking aromatic amino acids. Glyphosate at concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mM was inhibitory but not lethal. Cell death occurred in response to 5 mM glyphosate, and rapid death was observed at 10 mM. Accumulations of 1 mM PCA were observed in the culture media of strains 123 and 138. Only trace amounts of PCA accumulated in untreated controls or in strain 110 cultures. AH strains were able to metabolize PCA in the absence of glyphosate. The high levels of PCA produced by B. japonicum strains may alter the symbiotic interactions between this bacterium and glyphosate-resistant varieties of soybean. 3aglyphosate 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3ametabolism 3anitrogen fixation 3aphenolic acids 3aGlycine max 0agrowth1 aBecerril, J.M.1 aLydon, J.1 aDuke, S.O.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.289-293x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00014a0253Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02218naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245007300155300001600228500001500244520100400259650001401263650001201277650002001289650001201309650002101321650002101342650001301363650001601376650002701392650001301419650001201432650001801444651001201462653001601474653001401490700001801504700001601522773010001538852000901638856007901647939003301726946001301759655001201772IND9203766720221116212459.0920612e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920376672DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00015a0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiacs, P.A.10aFactors affecting stability of colored substances in paprika powders  ap. 363-367.  a2019-12-04  aA study was undertaken to investigate the change in carotenoid pigment as well as natural effective antioxidant content of paprika during fruit ripening and storage period of the ground products. By means of modern analytical procedure, paprika fruit was found to contain alpha-tocopherol in the pericarp and, gamma-tocopherol in the seeds. Ascorbic acid approached maximum level when the fruit turned red and then declined. Both antioxidants when added to the ground products have substantially reduced color impairment occurring during storage. The color degradation was estimated after 150 days of storage to be 27%, 20%, and 15% at ambient storage conditions and 15%, 13%, and 5% under refrigeration in untreated, delta-tocopherol-treated, and ascorbic acid-treated powders, respectively. Among different paprika cultivars the seeds of F-03 (hot) showed the highest level of tocopherol content, and the powder of such cultivar showed the lowest degradation of carotenoid pigments during storage. 3acultivars 3astorage 3aCapsicum annuum 3apaprika 3agamma-tocopherol 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aripening 3acarotenoids 3apostharvest physiology 3apigments 3apowders 3aascorbic acid 3aHungary 0atocopherols 0astability1 aCzinkotai, B.1 aHoschke, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.363-367x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00015a0013Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02949naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245011600186300001400302520138000316650004301696650002501739650003001764650005201794650003001846650003701876650001101913650004901924650006101973650002502034650002402059650004202083653001602125653002102141653002402162653002102186653002502207773012602232852000902358856009202367930003302459946001102492655001202503IND4406757820221116212152.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440675782DNAL7 a185771592pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00846.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaccah, D.10aOptions for the intensification of insulin therapy when basal insulin is not enough in type 2 diabetes mellitus  ap. 76-82.  aIn the early treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the addition of a basal insulin, such as insulin glargine, to existing oral therapy can help patients attain recommended glycaemic control targets, including haemoglobin A₁c (HbA₁c) <7% and fasting blood glucose <5.5 mmol/l (<100 mg/dl). For patients close to but not at target, the management of postprandial glucose excursions with a rapid-acting insulin, such as insulin glulisine, can provide further improvements in glycaemic control. In this review, the options for intensifying insulin therapy with the addition of one or more daily doses of prandial insulin are discussed. In addition, the advantages/disadvantages of choosing a basal-bolus vs. a premixed insulin strategy are discussed. A conceptually simple approach for the treatment of T2DM is for optimization of the basal insulin dose (added to oral antidiabetic drugs) to target fasting glycaemia followed by the addition of a single prandial dose of rapid-acting insulin to target the largest glucose excursion. A second and third dose of prandial insulin can then be added if HbA₁c remains above target and to manage postprandial glucose excursions at other meals. Prospective studies are underway to further examine this concept and determine the benefit of this approach not only on overall glycaemic control but also on cardiovascular risk. 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAdministration, Oral 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapy. 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aInsulinxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives. 2aInsulin, Long-Acting 2aPostprandial Period 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 0abasal-bolus 0ainsulin glargine 0along-acting insulin 0apremixed insulin 0arapid-acting insulin0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2008 July, v. 10, no. s2 p.76-82dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00846.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02441naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008700173300001800260520127400278650003501552650001201587650002601599650001101625650001801636650001701654650001201671650001701683650001701700650001501717700002201732700002301754700002001777773011301797852000901910856009201919930003302011946001102044655001202055IND4406766120221116212437.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440676612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06478.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcaraz, Luis A.10aStructural mobility of the monomeric C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein  ap. 3299-3311.  aThe capsid protein of HIV-1 (p24) (CA) forms the mature capsid of the human immunodeficiency virus. Capsid assembly involves hexamerization of the N-terminal domain and dimerization of the C-terminal domain of CA (CAC), and both domains constitute potential targets for anti-HIV therapy. CAC homodimerization occurs mainly through its second helix, and it is abolished when its sole tryptophan is mutated to alanine. This mutant, CACW40A, resembles a transient monomeric intermediate formed during dimerization. Its tertiary structure is similar to that of the subunits in the dimeric, non-mutated CAC, but the segment corresponding to the second helix samples different conformations. The present study comprises a comprehensive examination of the CACW40A internal dynamics. The results obtained, with movements sampling a wide time regime (from pico- to milliseconds), demonstrate the high flexibility of the whole monomeric protein. The conformational exchange phenomena on the micro-to-millisecond time scale suggest a role for internal motions in the monomer-monomer interactions and, thus, flexibility of the polypeptide chain is likely to contribute to the ability of the protein to adopt different conformational states, depending on the biological environment. 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aalanine 3aantiretroviral agents 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3adimerization 3amutants 3apolypeptides 3atherapeutics 3atryptophan1 adel Álamo, Marta1 aMateu, Mauricio G.1 aNeira, José L.0 tFEBS journal.g2008 July, v. 275, no. 13 p.3299-3311dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06478.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02965naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011300171300001800284520160300302650002101905650002101926650002801947650001301975650001501988650002402003650001002027650001202037650001102049650002502060650001102085650001302096650001602109700001902125700002202144700001802166700001902184700002402203700002202227773011302249852000902362856009202371930003302463946001102496655001202507IND4406766020221116212203.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440676602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06477.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarder, Daniel10aDtpB (YhiP) and DtpA (TppB, YdgR) are prototypical proton-dependent peptide transporters of Escherichia coli  ap. 3290-3298.  aThe genome of Escherichia coli contains four genes assigned to the peptide transporter (PTR) family. Of these, only tppB (ydgR) has been characterized, and named tripeptide permease, whereas protein functions encoded by the yhiP, ybgH and yjdL genes have remained unknown. Here we describe the overexpression of yhiP as a His-tagged fusion protein in E. coli and show saturable transport of glycyl-sarcosine (Gly-Sar) with an apparent affinity constant of 6.5 m m. Overexpression of the gene also increased the susceptibility of cells to the toxic dipeptide alafosfalin. Transport was strongly decreased in the presence of a protonophore but unaffected by sodium depletion, suggesting H⁺-dependence. This was confirmed by purification of YhiP and TppB by nickel affinity chromatography and reconstitution into liposomes. Both transporters showed Gly-Sar influx in the presence of an artificial proton gradient and generated transport currents on a chip-based sensor. Competition experiments established that YhiP transported dipeptides and tripeptides. Western blot analysis revealed an apparent mass of YhiP of 40 kDa. Taken together, these findings show that yhiP encodes a protein that mediates proton-dependent electrogenic transport of dipeptides and tripeptides with similarities to mammalian PEPT1. On the basis of our results, we propose to rename YhiP as DtpB (dipeptide and tripeptide permease B), by analogy with the nomenclature in other bacteria. We also propose to rename TppB as DtpA, to better describe its function as the first protein of the PTR family characterized in E. coli. 3aEscherichia coli 3aWestern blotting 3aaffinity chromatography 3abacteria 3adipeptides 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amammals 3anickel 3apeptide transporters 3asodium 3atoxicity 3atripeptides1 aStolz, Jürgen1 aCasagrande, Fabio1 aObrdlik, Petr1 aWeitz, Dietmar1 aFotiadis, Dimitrios1 aDaniel, Hannelore0 tFEBS journal.g2008 July, v. 275, no. 13 p.3290-3298dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06477.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02247naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245007100176300001800247520111200265650001701377650001201394650002301406650001701429650002401446650001701470650001901487650001101506650002001517650001101537650000901548700002401557700002201581773011301603852000901716856009201725930003301817946001101850655001201861IND4406766820221116212130.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440676682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06487.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtiz-Costa, Susana10aBetaine protects urea-induced denaturation of myosin subfragment-1  ap. 3388-3396.  aWe have demonstrated previously that urea inhibits the activity and alters the tertiary structure of skeletal muscle myosin in a biphasic manner. This was attributed to differential effects on its globular and filamentous portion. The inhibition of catalytic activity was counteracted by methylamines. With the aim of comprehending the effects of urea on the catalytic (globular) portion of myosin, this study examines the effects of urea and the countereffects of betaine on the catalytic activity and structure of myosin subfragment-1. It is shown that urea inactivates subfragment-1 in parallel with its ability to induce exposure of the enzyme hydrophobic domains, as assessed using intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence. Both effects are counteracted by betaine, which alone does not significantly affect subfragment-1. Urea also enhances the accessibility of thiol groups, promotes aggregation and decreases the α-helix content of S1, effects that are also counteracted by betaine. We conclude that urea-induced inactivation of the enzyme is caused by partial unfolding of the myosin catalytic domain. 3aactive sites 3abetaine 3acatalytic activity 3adenaturation 3aenzyme inactivation 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3amyosin 3askeletal muscle 3athiols 3aurea1 aSorenson, Martha M.1 aSola-Penna, Mauro0 tFEBS journal.g2008 July, v. 275, no. 13 p.3388-3396dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06487.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03090naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245011400142300001400256500001500270520108200285650001801367650001101385650002401396650002101420650002201441650001301463650002601476650001101502650002501513650002001538650002201558650001001580650001201590650002101602650002101623650004501644650002401689650002701713650002401740650001801764650002301782650002701805650003301832650003801865650002801903650002501931650002801956650004601984650003102030650002302061653002802084653001902112653002302131653001302154653002502167653001302192700001402205700001802219700001302237773006402250852000902314930003302323945001302356946001102369655001202380IND2060330720221116212524.0971029e19970411ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206033072DNAL7 a91614122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, K.10aGenomic structure and expression analyses of serine acetyltransferase gene in Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon)  ap. 57-63.  a2019-12-05  aThe genomic clones of Sat gene encoding serine acetyltransferase (SATase), a key enzyme in cysteine biosynthesis in plants, were isolated from the genomic library of Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon). The determination of nucleotide sequence of 5.7 kilobase pair (kbp) length revealed the presence of two introns of 1939 basepair (bp) and 515 bp length in the gene. The transcription start point was determined by primer extension experiments. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of a single copy of the Sat gene and a couple of additional related sequences in the genome of C. vulgaris. The expression of Sat was analyzed in watermelon plants grown under sulfur- and/or nitrogen-starved conditions and in the presence of pyrazole, O-acetylserine and N-acetylserine. Only slight increment (ca. 1.5-2-fold) of Sat gene expression was observed upon sulfur starvation for 48 h. Interestingly, the addition of pyrazole, which is a precursor of beta-pyrazolealanine (beta-PA) synthesized by SATase and cysteine/beta-PA synthase, enhanced the expression of Sat by ca. 2-fold. 3amessenger RNA 3asulfur 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3aazoles 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aexons 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 3aacyltransferases 2aAcetyltransferasesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acidsxchemistry 2aAmino Acids, Cyclic 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCysteinexbiosynthesis 2aFruitxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogenxdeficiency 2aPyrazolesxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aSerine O-Acetyltransferase 2aSulfurxdeficiency 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d85624 0agenetic regulation 0apyrazole 0anucleotide sequences 0asat gene1 aInoue, K.1 aFukushima, R.1 aNoji, M.0 tGene.g1997 Apr. 11, v. 189, no. 1 p.57-63x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03149naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245013500170300001800305520185600323650001702179650001902196650002002215650003102235650002402266650003402290650001802324650001602342650001202358650001202370650000902382650002302391650002702414700002202441700001802463773011302481852000902594856009202603930003302695946001102728655001202739IND4406766920221116212350.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440676692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06490.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Anil K.10aRegulation of luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA expression by mevalonate kinase - role of the catalytic center in mRNA recognition  ap. 3397-3407.  aWe have shown that hormone-induced downregulation of luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) in the ovary is post-transcriptionally regulated by an mRNA binding protein. This protein, later identified as mevalonate kinase (MVK), binds to the coding region of LHR mRNA, suppresses its translation, and the resulting ribonucleoprotein complex is targeted for degradation. Mutagenesis and crystallographic studies of rat MVK have established Ser146, Glu193, Asp204 and Lys13 as being crucial for its catalytic function. The present study examined the structural aspects of MVK required for LHR mRNA recognition and translational suppression. Single MVK mutants (S146A, E193Q, D204N and K13A) were overexpressed in 293T cells. Cytosolic fractions were examined for LHR mRNA binding activities by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. All the single MVK mutants showed decreased LHR mRNA binding activity compared with the wild-type MVK. Double mutants (S146A & E193Q, E193Q & D204N and E193Q & K13A) of MVK also showed a significant decrease in binding to LHR mRNA, suggesting that the residues required for catalytic function are also involved in LHR mRNA recognition. Mutation of the residues outside the catalytic site (D316A and S314A) did not cause any change in LHR mRNA binding activity of MVK when compared with wild-type MVK. To examine the biological effects of these mutants on LHR mRNA expression, a full-length capped rat LHR mRNA was synthesized and translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the presence or absence of the MVK mutant proteins. The results showed that mutations of the active site residues of MVK abrogated the inhibitory effect on LHR mRNA translation. Therefore, these data indicate that an intact active site of MVK is required for its binding to rat LHR mRNA and for its translational suppressor function. 3aactive sites 3aanimal ovaries 3aelectrophoresis 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3aluteinizing hormone receptors 3amessenger RNA 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3arabbits 3arats 3aribonucleoproteins 3atranslation (genetics)1 aYoung, Matthew A.1 aMenon, K.M.J.0 tFEBS journal.g2008 July, v. 275, no. 13 p.3397-3407dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06490.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03780naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245012600147300001400273500001500287520147100302650001801773650001901791650002201810650002101832650002001853650000901873650002701882650002101909650002501930650002201955650002001977650001101997650001702008650001002025650001202035650003502047650002402082650001202106650001802118650001102136650001602147650002702163650001902190650001002209650001102219650001202230650001402242650003002256650002802286650001902314650003002333650004902363650004802412650004802460650002302508650003402531650003602565650003702601653001902638653001602657653002802673653002502701653002502726700001702751700001202768700001702780700001802797700001702815773006402832852000902896930003302905945001302938946001102951655001202962IND2061302520221116212405.0980115e19970718ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206130252DNAL7 a92666712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhmedov, N.B.10aStructure and analysis of the transducin beta 3-subunit gene, a candidate for inherited cone degeneration (cd) in the dog  ap. 47-56.  a2019-12-05  aThe cDNA for the beta 3-subunit of cone-specific transducin (T beta 3) was cloned and characterized from wild type dogs, and used in linkage studies as a candidate gene for cone degeneration. Sequence analysis of the T beta 3 cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 1020 bp, potentially coding for a protein of 340 amino acids (aa). The deduced aa sequence of canine T beta 3 shares 97% identity with the previously identified human T beta 3, and 82% identity with bovine rod-specific transducin (T beta 1). RT-PCR and sequencing of the amplified products demonstrated that the retinal canine T beta 3 gene is expressed in two different transcripts which can be generated by alternative splicing of the intron in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). The short and the long mRNAs differ in the length of their 3'- UTR by 456 nt. We have also determined the genomic organization of the canine T beta 3 gene; it consists of ten exons and the first exon is in the 5'-UTR. The cDNA encoding T beta 3 from cd-affected dogs was also cloned and sequenced. We found no differences at the nucleotide level between the cDNAs isolated from normal and diseased retinas. The level of transcription of T beta 3 mRNA in the cd dog retina appeared to be normal. Linkage analysis of a crossbred informative pedigree showed five obligate recombinants out of nine informative offspring. These results suggest that T beta 3 is not a candidate gene for the cone degeneration of the cd mutant. 3amessenger RNA 3aphotoreceptors 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aanimal proteins 3adogs 3aguanosine triphosphate 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic disorders 3agene expression 3aretina 3aeye diseases 3aexons 3aintrons 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aDNA Primers 2aDog Diseasesxgenetics 2aDogsxgenetics 2aExons 2aHumans 2aIntrons 2aLod Score 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPoint Mutation 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRetinal Cone Photoreceptor Cellsxmetabolism 2aRetinal Degenerationxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aRetinal Rod Photoreceptor Cellsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTransducinxchemistryxgenetics. 0agenbank/u52916 0asegregation 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic polymorphism 0anucleotide sequences1 aPiriev, N.I.1 aRay, K.1 aAcland, G.M.1 aAquirre, G.D.1 aFarber, D.B.0 tGene.g1997 July 18, v. 194, no. 1 p.47-56x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02828naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011200144300001600256500001500272520101300287650001801300650002101318650002401339650002701363650003001390650002101420650002501441650002001466650002901486650002401515650001801539650002301557650002101580650003501601650001801636650004001654650002801694650001401722650002301736650003401759650003901793650003401832650002701866650004401893653001201937653002801949653002501977653001602002700002702018700001502045700002302060773006502083852000902148930003302157945001302190946001102203655001202214IND2061377520221116212233.0980120e19970709ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206137752DNAL7 a92560782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTratner, I.10aCloning and characterization of the S. pombe gene efc25+, a new putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor  ap. 203-210.  a2019-12-05  aWe report the cloning and characterization of a new S. pombe gene, efc25+, for 'exchange factor Cdc25-like'. The C-terminal region of the predicted product of this gene displays high sequence homology with a number of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ras. These include Cdc25 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc25 of Saccharomyces kluyveri, Csc25 of Candida albicans, Sdc25 of S. cerevisiae and Ste6 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Disruption of efc25+ resulted in cells with a spherical shape reminiscent of the abnormal morphological phenotype of ras1 deletion mutants. However, unlike ras1 null mutants, strains deleted for efc25+ were proficient for mating and sporulation. This differs from the only other Ras1 exchange factor characterized so far in S. pombe, the Ste6 protein, whose deletion results in defects in mating and sporulation but not in cell shape. We hypothesize that Efc25 is an exchange factor for Ras1 and that it is involved in a signaling pathway different from that involving Ste6. 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Recombinant 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGuanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aProteinsxgenetics 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgenetics 2aSchizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aefc25+ gene1 aFourticq-Esqueoute, A.1 aTillit, J.1 aBaldacci, Giorgia.0 tGene.g1997 July 9, v. 193, no. 2 p.203-210x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04355naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151072001700168100002300185245017500208300001800383500001500401520184700416650001602263650002802279650002502307650001102332650001502343650001102358650001002369650002502379650000802404650001702412650002402429650002002453650002102473650002302494650003302517650001702550650002802567650001902595650001002614650004702624650004402671650003102715650002302746650002602769650003002795650002102825650001802846650001102864650001802875650004402893650004502937650000902982650005302991651001803044651001803062653002003080653002003100653005503120653002803175700001903203700002303222700002103245700001903266700002203285700002003307773013003327852000903457930003303466945002503499946001303524655001203537IND4406794620221116212014.0080613e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440679462DNAL7 a185415492pmid7 aPMC24945282pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFurtado, Jeremy D.10aEffect of protein, unsaturated fat, and carbohydrate intakes on plasma apolipoprotein B and VLDL and LDL containing apolipoprotein C-III: results from the OmniHeart Trial  ap. 1623-1630.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND:Plasma apolipoprotein B (apo B) and VLDL and LDL with apolipoprotein C-III (apo C-III) are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Dietary intake affects lipoprotein concentration and composition related to those apolipoproteins. OBJECTIVE:We studied differences in apo B lipoproteins with and without apo C-III after 3 healthy diets based on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial diet. DESIGN:Healthy participants (n = 162) were fed each of 3 healthy diets for 6 wk in a crossover design. Diets differed by emphasis of either carbohydrate (Carb), unsaturated fat (Unsat), or protein (Prot). Blood was collected at baseline and after diets for analysis. RESULTS:Compared with the Carb diet, the Prot diet reduced plasma apo B and triglycerides in VLDL with apo C-III (16%, P = 0.07; 11%, P = 0.05, respectively) and apo B in LDL with apo C-III (16%, P = 0.04). Compared with the Unsat diet, the Prot diet reduced triglycerides in VLDL with apo C-III (16%, P = 0.02). Compared with baseline (subjects' usual diet was higher in saturated fat), the Prot diet reduced apo B in LDL with apo C-III (11%, P = 0.05), and all 3 diets reduced plasma total apo B (6-10%, P < 0.05) and apo B in the major type of LDL, LDL without apo C-III (8-10%, P < 0.01). All 3 diets reduced the ratio of apo C-III to apo E in VLDL. CONCLUSIONS:Substituting protein for carbohydrate in the context of a healthy dietary pattern reduced atherogenic apo C-III-containing LDL and its precursor, apo C-III-containing VLDL, resulting in the most favorable profile of apo B lipoproteins. In addition, compared with a typical high-saturated fat diet, healthy diets that emphasize carbohydrate, protein, or unsaturated fat reduce plasma total and LDL apo B and produce a lower more metabolically favorable ratio of apo C-III to apo E. 3adietary fat 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3adietary carbohydrate 3aWhites 3afat intake 3aBlacks 3awomen 3aapolipoprotein C-III 3amen 3arisk factors 3acarbohydrate intake 3adietary protein 3aapolipoprotein B 3aexperimental diets 3avery low density lipoprotein 3ahypertension 3alow density lipoprotein 3aprotein intake 2aAdult 2aApolipoprotein C-IIIxbloodxdrug effects. 2aApolipoproteins Bxbloodxdrug effects. 2aBlood Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietary Carbohydrates 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturated 2aDietary Proteins 2aEnergy Intake 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteins, LDLxbloodxdrug effects. 2aLipoproteins, VLDLxbloodxdrug effects. 2aMale 2aNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (U.S.) 3aMassachusetts 0aUnited States 0aapolipoproteins 0aOmniHeart Trial 0aDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial diet 0acardiovascular diseases1 aCampos, Hannia1 aAppel, Lawrence J.1 aMiller, Edgar R.1 aLaranjo, Nancy1 aCarey, Vincent J.1 aSacks, Frank M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.1623-1630dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle01833naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011100123300001400234500001500248520077000263650001301033650001801046650002101064650002201085650002501107650002001132650002901152650001001181650001201191650001501203653002801218653002501246653001401271700002001285773006401305852000901369930003301378945001301411946001101424655001201435IND2061303120221116212028.0980115e19970718ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206130312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Q.R.10aStructure and expression of the chicken calmodulin I gene.

The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence is identical to the one of chicken CaMII which consists of 148 as. The CaMI gene contains six exons. Its intron/exon organization is identical to that of the chicken CaMII and the CaMI and CaMIII genes of rat and human. Expression of the CaMI gene was detected in all chicken tissues examined, although at varying levels. The gene is transcribed into four mRNAs of 0.8, 1.4, 1.7 and 4.4 kb as determined by Northern blot analysis. Our results demonstrate that the "multigene-one-protein" principle of CaM synthesis is not only applicable to mammals whose CaM is encoded by three different genes, but also to chickens. 3achickens 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aexons 3aintrons 3acalmodulin 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0acami gene1 aBerchtold, M.W.0 tGene.g1997 July 18, v. 194, no. 1 p.63-68x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04286naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002400180245016300204300001800367500001500385520190700400650003102307650002302338650002302361650001802384650001702402650002102419650002102440650002302461650001202484650002202496650002302518650001902541650002102560650001502581650001002596650000902606650002202615650002002637650001002657650002202667650001102689650001102700650001102711650000902722650005202731650001602783650006902799650005702868650001502925650000902940650001702949651001202966653003402978653001303012700001803025700002403043700001803067700001903085700001903104700002003123700001703143700002003160700003203180700002203212700002403234773013003258852000903388930003303397945002503430946001303455655001203468IND4406795520221116212153.0080613e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440679552DNAL7 a185415582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBosy-Westphal, Anja10aFamilial influences and obesity-associated metabolic risk factors contribute to the variation in resting energy expenditure: the Kiel Obesity Prevention Study  ap. 1695-1701.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: A low metabolic rate may be inherited and predispose to obesity, whereas a higher metabolic rate in obesity may be acquired by obesity-associated cardiometabolic risk. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explain the interindividual variation in resting energy expenditure (REE) by assessing 1) the association between REE and body composition, thyroid hormones, and obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factors, and 2) the familial (genetic and environmental) contribution to REE. DESIGN: REE and metabolic risk factors (ie, blood pressure and plasma insulin, glucose, and C-reactive protein concentrations) were assessed in 149 two- or three-generation families, including at least one overweight or obese member. Heritability of REE, respiratory quotient (RQ), thyroid hormones [thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4)], and body composition (fat-free mass and fat mass) were estimated by using variance components-based quantitative genetic models. RESULTS: REE adjusted for body composition, sex, and age (REEadj) significantly correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma insulin and glucose concentrations, and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) (r = 0.14-0.31, P < 0.05). Thyroid hormones had a modest influence on REE variance only. Heritability was 0.30 ± 0.07 for REEadj and 0.29 ± 0.08 for REE after additional adjustment for thyroid hormones and metabolic risk. Furthermore, heritability was estimated to be 0.22 ± 0.08 for RQ, 0.37 ± 0.08 for TSH, 0.68 ± 0.06 for FT4, and 0.69 ± 0.05 for FT3 (all significantly larger than zero). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factors contribute to interindividual variation in REE, with hypertension and insulin resistance being associated with a higher REE. REE was moderately heritable, independent of body composition, sex, age, thyroid function, and cardiometabolic risk. 3aresting energy expenditure 3aC-reactive protein 3adisease prevention 3ablood glucose 3arisk factors 3abody composition 3athyroid hormones 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3ametabolic studies 3afamilial incidence 3ablood pressure 3afamily relations 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFamily 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Clearance Ratexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aOverweightxepidemiologyxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aPrevalence 2aRest 2aRisk Factors 0aGermany 0aKiel Obesity Prevention Study 0afamilies1 aWolf, Andreas1 aBührens, Frederike1 aHitze, Britta1 aCzech, Norbert1 aMönig, Heiner1 aSelberg, Oliver1 aSettler, Uta1 aPfeuffer, Maria1 aSchrezenmeir, J.q(Jürgen)1 aKrawczak, Michael1 aMüller, Manfred J.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.1695-1701dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle03467naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002600146245008600172300001800258520167200276650001801948650002901966650001401995650001002009650000802019650002302027650001302050650002302063650002402086650001802110650002102128650001002149650003002159650002002189650003402209650002502243650001102268650001602279650001102295650000902306650002902315650002302344650002102367650002402388653002002412653002602432653002402458700002002482700002402502700002402526700002402550700002302574700002202597773013002619852000902749930003302758945002502791946001302816655001202829IND4406795420221116212058.0080613e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440679542DNAL7 a185415572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHenderson, Gregory C.10aGlucoregulation is more precise in women than in men during postexercise recovery  ap. 1686-1694.  aBACKGROUND: The regulation of glycemia is challenged in healthy men and women after exercise bouts of substantial energy expenditure. OBJECTIVE: We determined rates of glucose appearance (Ra), disappearance (Rd), and metabolic clearance (MCR) before, during, and after isoenergetic moderate and hard-intensity exercise. DESIGN: Ten men and 8 women received primed-continuous infusion of [6,6-²H₂]glucose tracer to measure glucose kinetics. Participants were studied under 3 different conditions with diet unchanged between trials: 1) before, during, and 3 h after 90 min of exercise at 45% of peak oxygen consumption (VO₂peak; E45); 2) before, during, and 3 h after 60 min of exercise at 65% VO₂peak (E65), and 3) in a time-matched sedentary control trial. RESULTS: In men and women, Ra, Rd, and MCR increased above the control trial during exercise and were higher in E65 than in E45 (P < 0.05). Average Ra, Rd, and MCR remained elevated above the control over 3 h of postexercise recovery in men after exercise in E45 and E65 (P < 0.05), and blood glucose concentrations were depressed below the control during recovery (P < 0.05). Glucose concentrations were not depressed in women during 3 h of postexercise recovery, and in contrast with that in men, average Ra and Rd did not remain significantly elevated during postexercise recovery in women, although MCR did remain elevated in E65 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: After exercise bouts, women are better able to maintain glucose concentrations at sedentary control levels, thus not requiring the counter-regulation of glucose production that is seen in men and requiring less accentuation of lipid metabolism. 3ablood glucose 3aphysiological regulation 3aprecision 3awomen 3amen 3agender differences 3aexercise 3aenergy expenditure 3alabeling techniques 3aexercise test 3alipid metabolism 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Clearance Rate 2aOxygen Consumption 2aRestxphysiology 2aSex Characteristics 0aglucoregulation 0apostexercise recovery 0aexercise physiology1 aFattor, Jill A.1 aHorning, Michael A.1 aFaghihnia, Nastaran1 aJohnson, Matthew L.1 aLuke-Zeitoun, Mona1 aBrooks, George A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.1686-1694dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle03366naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245014000145300001600285500001500301520095400316650002701270650001801297650002101315650001801336650002401354650001301378650002901391650002501420650002001445650002901465650002801494650001501522650002101537650002801558650001101586650002401597650001201621650001801633650002301651650001601674650003701690650001801727650003301745650004101778650002801819650001301847650002701860650003401887650003001921650002401951650005201975650004502027650003402072650002702106653002202133653001902155653002802174653001902202653002302221653001902244653003402263653002502297700001502322700001402337700001702351700001802368700001502386700001502401773006602416852000902482930003302491945001302524946001102537655001202548IND2056241120221116211747.0970331e19970115ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205624112DNAL7 a90316432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnamnart, S.14aThe P-OLE1 gene of Pichia angusta encodes a delta 9-fatty acid desaturase and complements the ole1 mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 299-306.  a2019-12-05  aThree PCR-amplified DNA fragments hybridizing with the OLE1 gene encoding delta 9-fatty acid desaturase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were obtained using, respectively, genomic DNAs of one strain each of Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Pichia angusta and Yarrowia lipolytica as templates. A gene designated P-OLE1 was cloned from the above fragment of P. angusta and sequenced. An open reading frame of P-OLE1 encodes a 49.6-kDa protein consisting of 451 amino acid residues, which shows high identity (62%) and similarity (89%) to that deduced from the OLE1 nucleotide sequence. Expression of P-OLE1 driven by the S. cerevisiae GAP promoter or its own promoter complemented the ole1 mutation of S. cerevisiae. Transcription of P-OLE1 in the native host was suggested to be partially repressed by oleic acid in the medium, as was that of OLE1 in S. cerevisiae and a similar gene in Y. lipolytica, but that of a similar gene in K. thermotolerans was not. 3agenetic transformation 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3aKluyveromyces 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3amutation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenetic complementation 3aoleic acid 3apromoter regions 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3aPichia 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Fungal 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aKluyveromycesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aOleic Acidxmetabolism 2aPichiaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomycetalesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aSaccharomycetales 0agenbank/d83185 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d83187 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/d83186 0akluyveromyces thermotolerance 0anucleotide sequences1 aTomita, T.1 aFukui, F.1 aFujimori, K.1 aHarashima, S.1 aYamada, Y.1 aOshima, Y.0 tGene.g1997 Jan. 15, v. 184, no. 2 p.299-306x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03052naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245013300144300001600277520097400293650001701267650002201284650001901306650002101325650001601346650001901362650002501381650002501406650002101431650002001452650001801472650001501490650001401505650001401519650001501533650002401548650001801572650002301590650003301613650001301646650003801659650001001697650003901707650002801746650003301774650006201807650003501869650001901904650002201923650003401945650002701979653000902006653002302015653001402038653002802052653001902080700001402099700001502113700001402128700001402142700001402156700001702170773006502187852000902252930003302261945001302294946001102307655001202318IND2057429020221116212034.0970602e19970207ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205742902DNAL7 a90558192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwasaki, T.10aCloning of cDNA encoding the rice 22-kDa protein of Photosystem II (PSII-S) and analysis of light-induced expression of the gene  ap. 223-229.  aCloning of rice cDNA encoding the chlorophyll-binding 22 kDa protein of Photosystem II (PSII-S) and the light-induced expression of the gene are reported. One of the light-responsive cDNA clones, isolated by screening with a light-specific subtracted cDNA probe, was shown to encode PSII-S of rice. Genomic Southern analysis suggested that the PSII-S gene, psbS, is a single-copy gene in rice. A brief exposure to red light induced a severalfold increase in the steady state level of PSII-S transcripts in etiolated seedlings. The red light effect was reversed by far-red light, suggesting involvement of phytochrome in the PSII-S gene regulation. Prolonged exposure (3 h) to blue light, however, revealed a much stronger effect than red light on the accumulation of PSII-S transcripts in the etiolated seedlings. In dark-adapted green plants, prolonged exposure to blue light induced re-accumulation of transcripts encoding PSII-S, whereas red light had little effect. 3aOryza sativa 3acomplementary DNA 3aplant proteins 3abinding proteins 3achlorophyll 3aphotosystem II 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3astructural genes 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3ablue light 3ared light 3aseedlings 3aetiolation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDarkness 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLight 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxgenetics 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aPlant Proteins 2aSeedsxphysiology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0adark 0agenetic regulation 0apsbs gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d843921 aSaito, Y.1 aHarada, E.1 aKasai, M.1 aShoji, K.1 aMiyao, M.1 aYamamoto, N.0 tGene.g1997 Feb. 7, v. 185, no. 2 p.223-229x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02731naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245007500142300001600217520124300233650001101476650001901487650002001506650001801526650002201544650001801566650004301584650001001627650002301637650002301660650002401683650001101707650002301718650002001741650001101761650003201772650002801804650002201832650002701854650002601881650003601907650002701943700001401970700001801984700001502002700001802017700001802035773005802053852000902111930003302120945001302153946001102166655001202177IND2060269520221116212106.0971027s1997    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206026952DNAL7 a91975382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeda, K.10aAnalysis of an expression profile of genes in the human adipose tissue  ap. 227-235.  aIncreasing evidence suggests that in addition to storing excess energy as fat, adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ secreting various factors into the blood stream. Every time a new factor is found in adipose tissue, however, its implication is discussed independently, and a systematic analyses based upon a global view of gene expression of this tissue has not been performed. To describe the function of this tissue in terms of gene expression, and to find new factors, we performed random complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing using a 3'-directed cDNA library that faithfully represents the composition of the messenger RNA (mRNA). Various well-known but unexpected genes, including those for gelsolin, plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPX-3) and carboxypeptidase E (CPE) were shown to be very active. By comparing the expression profile of active genes in the adipose with those of other tissues and with data in dbEST, we identified seven new genes that are specifically expressed in adipose tissue. Among these, one encoded a protein with collagen-like repeats and a putative secretion signal. These data can be used as new tools for analyses of the physiology of this tissue, as well as the etiology and complications of obesity. 3ahumans 3aadipose tissue 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aDNA libraries 2aAdipose Tissuexphysiologyxsecretion. 2aAdult 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aComplement Factor D 2aFemale 2aGelsolinxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aHumans 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificity 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Tagged Sites 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aOkubo, K.1 aShimomura, I.1 aMizuno, K.1 aMatsuzawa, Y.1 aMatsubara, K.0 tGene.g1997, v. 190, no. 2 p.227-235x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03891naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001800146245009900164300001800263520176500281650001602046650002902062650001002091650003002101650002002131650002102151650001202172650003102184650002802215650002402243650001602267650001802283650001502301650002002316650001802336650001902354650004602373650001702419650001902436650002702455650002602482650001702508650002102525650002402546650001802570650002402588650001102612650004102623650001102664650001102675650001902686650000902705650004102714650001702755700002302772700002302795700001902818700001902837700002202856700002402878700001702902700001602919773013002935852000903065930003303074945002503107946001303132655001203145IND4406796620221116212205.0080613e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440679662DNAL7 a185415692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSinghal, Atul10aDietary nucleotides and fecal microbiota in formula-fed infants: a randomized controlled trial  ap. 1785-1792.  aBACKGROUND: Dietary nucleotides are nonprotein nitrogenous compounds that are thought to be important for growth, repair, and differentiation of the gastrointestinal tract. A higher nucleotide intake may also have favorable effects on the fecal microbial composition and incidence of diarrhea in infancy. However, few studies have tested this hypothesis with an experimental study design. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that nucleotide supplementation of infant formula has beneficial effects on fecal bacteriology. DESIGN: Oligonucleotide probes were used to measure bacterial genus-specific 16S ribosomal RNA in stools of a subset of infants (mean age: 20.4 wk) who were randomly assigned to nucleotide-supplemented (31 mg/L; n = 35) or control formula (n = 37) from birth until age 20 wk or were breastfed (reference group; n = 44). The microbial pattern was assessed as the ratio of Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella group (BPP) to Bifidobacterium species. RESULTS: The ratio of BPP to Bifidobacterium spp. rRNA in infants randomly assigned to the nucleotide-supplemented formula was lower than in infants receiving the control formula (mean difference: -118%; 95% CI: -203%, -34%; P = 0.007), but it did not differ in infants who were breastfed. The difference between randomized formula-fed groups was independent of potential confounding factors (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that nucleotide supplementation improves the composition of the gut microbiota in formula-fed infants. Because this effect could contribute to previously described benefits of nucleotide supplementation for gastrointestinal tract and immune function, these findings have important implications for optimizing the diet of formula-fed infants. 3anucleotides 3adietary nutrient sources 3afeces 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ainfant formulas 3ainfant nutrition 3ainfants 3arandomized clinical trials 3agastrointestinal system 3adietary supplements 3aBacteroides 3aPorphyromonas 3aPrevotella 3aBifidobacterium 3amessenger RNA 3abreast feeding 2aBifidobacteriumxisolation & purification 2aBirth Weight 2aBreast Feeding 2aDiarrheaxepidemiology 2aDietary Carbohydrates 2aDietary Fats 2aDietary Proteins 2aDietary Supplements 2aEnergy Intake 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Formula 2aMale 2aNucleotidesxadministration & dosage 2aSocial Class1 aMacfarlane, George1 aMacfarlane, Sandra1 aLanigan, Julie1 aKennedy, Kathy1 aElias-Jones, Alun1 aStephenson, Terence1 aDudek, Peter1 aLucas, Alan0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.1785-1792dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/30  aOther US 7aarticle03165naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130100002000150245016100170300001800331500002800349520175900377650002302136650001902159650002002178650001102198650001202209650001802221650002302239650001402262650005302276650002202329650001802351650003202369650001902401651001802420700002102438700002702459700002402486700002502510700001602535773013402551852000902685946001302694655001202707IND4406798220221116212333.0080613s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440679822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

   1 aBeydoun, May A.10aEthnic differences in dairy and related nutrient consumption among US adults and their association with obesity, central obesity, and the metabolic syndrome  ap. 1914-1925.  aPublisher supplied data  aBACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest dairy consumption and associated nutrients may be protective against some of the components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between consumption of a variety of dairy products and their related nutrients with obesity, central obesity, and MetS, and attempted to explain some of the ethnic differences in metabolic outcomes through dairy consumption using national data. DESIGN: Nationally representative indicators of obesity, central obesity, and MetS among US adults were constructed from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 data, including direct anthropometric assessments, blood pressure, and laboratory tests. Sample sizes ranged from 4519 for MetS to 14 618 for obesity. Associations between diet (assessed using 24-h recalls) and metabolic and other outcomes were tested using multivariate linear and logistic models and structural equation models. RESULTS: We found a significant inverse association between intake of whole milk, yogurt, calcium, and magnesium and metabolic disorders. Odds ratios for one more daily serving of yogurt and 100 mg Mg for MetS were 0.40 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.89) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.96), respectively. The opposite was found for intakes of cheese, low-fat milk, and phosphorus. Using structural equation models, ethnic differences in some MetS outcomes, such as body mass index and systolic blood pressure, were partly explained by variations in dairy-related nutrients. CONCLUSIONS: Various dairy products may have differential associations with metabolic disorders, including obesity. Ethnic differences in dairy consumption may explain in part the ethnic disparities in metabolic disorders in the US population. 3aethnic differences 3adairy products 3anutrient intake 3aadults 3aobesity 3aabdominal fat 3ametabolic syndrome 3anutrients 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aprotective effect 3adata analysis 3aanthropometric measurements 3ablood pressure 3aUnited States1 aGary, Tiffany L.1 aCaballero, Benjamin H.1 aLawrence, Robert S.1 aCheskin, Lawrence J.1 aWang, Youfa0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition AJN.g2008 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.1914-1925dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle04008naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002100180245016100201300001800362520177300380650000802153650001302161650002802174650001702202650001102219650001002230650001002240650002002250650002402270650002302294650001902317650002302336650002302359650001502382650001002397650001702407650001702424650001902441650001602460650002002476650004202496650001002538650001102548650002202559650001102581650002502592650001702617650002602634650003002660650001702690651001202707651002702719653004502746700002202791700002502813700002102838700001902859700003302878700001902911700002102930700002002951700002202971700002302993773013003016852000903146930003303155945002503188946001303213655001203226IND4406797720221116212239.0080613e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440679772DNAL7 a185415802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKivimäki, Mika.10aAssociation of age at menarche with cardiovascular risk factors, vascular structure, and function in adulthood: the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study  ap. 1876-1882.  aBACKGROUND: It is unclear whether age at menarche is an independent determinant of future cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether menarcheal age is an independent predictor of body mass index (BMI) and a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence and adulthood. DESIGN: We examined the associations of menarcheal age with BMI (in kg/m²) and other cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence and adulthood in a population-based sample of 794 female adolescents aged 9-18 y at baseline. Their age at first menstruation was requested at baseline and again 3 and 6 y later. Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed at baseline and at age 30-39 y. RESULTS: A 1-y decrease in menarcheal age was associated with 0.81 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.08) higher adult BMI as well as greater waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, elevated systolic blood pressure, higher insulin resistance, and greater risk of metabolic syndrome (P < 0.05 for all). In multivariable analysis in which these adult risk factors were mutually adjusted for, only the inverse association between age at menarche and adult BMI remained. However, this inverse association was lost after adjustment for premenarcheal BMI (β: -0.16; 95% CI -0.55, 0.23; P = 0.42). Higher premenarcheal BMI predicted earlier menarche, and the strong association between premenarcheal BMI and adult BMI was robust to adjustment for age at menarche. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that early menarche is only a risk marker. Greater childhood BMI seems to contribute to earlier age at menarche and, because of tracking, greater adult BMI and associated cardiovascular risk. An independent effect of early menarche on adult adiposity cannot be excluded, but it is likely to be small at best. 3aage 3amenarche 3acardiovascular diseases 3arisk factors 3aadults 3awomen 3agirls 3abody mass index 3awaist circumference 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3ablood pressure 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolic syndrome 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge of Onset 2aBirth Weight 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Height 2aBody Mass Index 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiology 2aChild 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMenarchexphysiology 2aMenstruation 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aOverweightxcomplications 2aRisk Factors 3aFinland 0aFinlandxepidemiology. 0aCardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study1 aLawlor, Debbie A.1 aDavey Smith, George.1 aElovainio, Marko1 aJokela, Markus1 aKeltikangas-Järvinen, Liisa1 aVahtera, Jussi1 aTaittonen, Leena1 aJuonala, Markus1 aViikari, Jorma SA1 aRaitakari, Olli T.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.1876-1882dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/30  aOther US 7aarticle04019naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002100163245011900184300001800303520191100321650002702232650002302259650000802282650002002290650001902310650001802329650002102347650001702368650002802385650001302413650001302426650001602439650002302455650004002478650001002518650000902528650002802537650001402565650001902579650001602598650001102614650001902625650002202644650001302666650003702679650001102716650003302727650001202760650001402772650002502786650000902811650004602820650001602866650003602882650001202918650002402930651001002954653003902964700001703003700002003020700002303040773013003063852000903193930003303202945002503235946001303260655001203273IND4406798520221116212036.0080613e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440679852DNAL7 a185415882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Cellular antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) play a central role in the control of reactive oxygen species. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether GPX1 polymorphism (Pro198Leu) is associated with MetS as well as with each component of MetS. DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional analysis of randomly selected, community-dwelling Japanese persons aged 40-70 y (1128 M, 1105 F). RESULTS: The genotype frequencies for the GPX1 Pro198Leu polymorphism in this cohort were 0.846, 0.151, and 0.003 for CC, CT, and TT, respectively. The CT/TT genotypes had significantly higher waist-hip ratios, triacylglycerol concentrations, homeostasis model assessment for β-cell function, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in men (P = 0.045, 0.012, 0.011, 0.004, and 0.003, respectively) than did the CC genotype; the CC/TT genotypes also had higher insulin in both sexes (P = 0.019 for men, P = 0.010 for women) and higher body fat mass (P = 0.027) and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (P = 0.008) in women. The CT/TT genotypes showed significant association with higher prevalence of MetS as defined by 2 commonly used criteria in men [odds ratio (OR): 2.02; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.15 by the International Diabetes Federation criteria; OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.18 by the modified National Cholesterol Education Program criteria) but not in women. The CT/TT genotypes showed a higher prevalence of central obesity (OR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.31, 2.85) and hypertriglyceridemia (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.15) in men but not in women; there were no differences in other components of MetS between the CC and CT/TT genotypes in either sex. CONCLUSION: GPX1 Pro198Leu variants are associated with the prevalence of MetS in Japanese men but not in women. 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ametabolic syndrome 3amen 3aJapanese people 3acohort studies 3afree radicals 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3areactive oxygen species 3agenotype 3abody fat 3ahomeostasis 3adisease prevalence 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histology 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aBody Size 2aCohort Studies 2aDNA Primers 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexgenetics 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistancexgenetics 2aLeucine 2aLongevity 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProline 2aSex Characteristics 0aJapan 0aglutathione peroxidase 1 Pro198Leu1 aAndo, Fujiko1 aIguchi, Akihisa1 aShimokata, Hiroshi0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.1939-1944dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle02793naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245010100131300001600232500001500248520136900263650002801632650001801660650002201678650000901700650002401709650001201733650002501745650002001770650001501790650002201805650002301827650001701850650001601867653002401883653001601907653001901923653002501942653001301967653002501980653002002005653002802025653002602053700001702079700001702096700001602113773006802129852000902197930003302206945001302239946001102252655001202263IND2055134920221116212054.0970129e19961017ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205513492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanaccione, D.G.10aTransposon-like sequences at the TOX2 locus of the plant-pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum  ap. 103-109.  a2019-12-05  aThe ascomycete fungus Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 is pathogenic on certain genotypes of maize due to the production of HC-toxin, a host-specific cyclic peptide.

This 22-kb region of DNA is flanked by a repetitive element. We have sequenced the element and found an interrupted reading frame that would encode a product similar to transposases from the fungal transposons Fot1 of Fusarium oxysporum and Pot2 of Magnaporthe grisea. The individual element cloned from C. carbonum is likely to function neither in cis nor trans, as it had a nonsense mutation in frame and several substitutions in its terminal inverted repeats. However, similar elements in the C. carbonum genome may be active, as the putative transposase-encoding region hybridized to mRNA of the size predicted by the reading frame. The element was found in varying copy number in the genomes of all Cochliobolus spp. examined, giving a distinct fingerprint in each species and race tested. The sequence similarity of the C. carbonum repetitive element to other fungal transposons, along with its presence in multiple copies per genome, strongly suggest that the C. carbonum repetitive element is a member of the Fot1 family of fungal transposons. 3ainterspecific variation 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3aloci 3arestriction mapping 3aenzymes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amycotoxins 3aBipolaris zeicola 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aCochliobolus 3atransposons 0aspecies differences 0atransposase 0agenbank/u40479 0arepetitive sequences 0ahc-toxin 0anucleotide sequences 0afcc1 transposon 0amolecular sequence data 0aCochliobolus carbonum1 aPitkin, J.W.1 aWalton, J.D.1 aAnnis, S.L.0 tGene.g1996 Oct. 17, v. 176, no. 1/2 p.103-109x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01648naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010100126300001600227520063100243650001700874650002200891650002100913650001800934650002500952650002500977653002801002653001901030653001901049653001901068653001901087700001501106700001901121773006801140852000901208930003301217945001301250946001101263655001201274IND2055370120221116212135.0970212e19961121ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205537012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAliyeva, E.10aSequences of two expressed sequence tags (EST) from rice encoding different cap-binding proteins  ap. 221-223.  aWheat has been shown to have two forms of the cap-binding protein that participate in the initiation of translation.

This peptide represents the aa sequence of the solvent-exposed G-H loop of protein VP1 which is involved in cell recognition and infection. The efficiency of the viral motif in promoting cell attachment and spreading is comparable to that shown by fibronectin or vitronectin. Cell binding is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against a viral, RGD-involving B-cell epitope and also by sera against vitronectin (alpha v beta3/beta5) and fibronectin (alpha5 beta1) receptors. In addition, a synthetic RGD peptide, which is a ligand for both integrins, prevents the cell binding mediated by the FMDV domain. These data demonstrate that the FMDV RGD motif is a potent ligand for cell-receptor integrins and sufficient to promote cell attachment to susceptible cells mainly through the vitronectin receptor. 3aAphthovirus 3acoat proteins 3areceptors 3aglycoproteins 3acell lines 3akidneys 3ahamsters 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3afibronectins 3arecombinant antigens 0ahela cells 0abinding 0abhk cells1 aFeliu, J.X.1 aHarbottle, R.P.1 aBenito, A.1 aCoutelle, C.0 tGene.g1996 Nov. 21, v. 180, no. 1/2 p.101-106x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03527naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245018700125300001600312500001500328520201900343650002902362650001802391650002402409650002102433650002202454650002302476650002502499650002102524650002002545650002502565650002102590650002502611650002802636653001902664653001902683653001602702653002802718653001702746653002302763653001902786653001602805700002102821700001702842700001602859773006802875852000902943930003302952945001302985946001102998655001203009IND2055369920221116212129.0970212e19961121ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205536992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaitra, S.10aThree second chromosome-linked clustered Cyp6 genes show differential constitutive and barbital-induced expression in DDT-resistant and susceptible strains of Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 165-171.  a2019-12-05  aThe level of expression of the Cyp6a2 gene is much higher in the DDT-resistant 91-R strain than in the susceptible 91-C strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Waters et al. (1992b) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 4855-4859). To understand the role of Cyp6a2 and related genes in insecticide resistance, we have isolated and characterized two new Cyp6 genes from the 91-R strain. The polypeptides encoded by these two genes, Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9, show 77 and 75% amino acid sequence similarity, and 60 and 55% identity with Cyp6a2 of D. melanogaster, respectively. In the genome, Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9 genes are closely clustered within 4 kb and map at region 51C of the second chromosome. In between them another Cyp gene is present which is more related to Cyp6a9 than to Cyp6a8. The Cyp6a8 gene which is transcriptionally highly active in 91-R, moderately active in ry506 and silent in the 91-C strain hybridizes with 2.0- and 1.8-kb RNAs. Two different-sized RNAs, 2.1 and 1.8 kb, also hybridize with the Cyp6a9 and/or Cyp6a9-related genes. While the level of 2.1-kb RNA is similar in all three strains, the level of 1.8-kb RNA is highest in the 91-R strain and barely detectable in 91-C strain. Transgenic experiments showed that a 8.3-kb BamHI fragment contains the cis-regulatory elements for the expression of both Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9-related genes. Barbital induces all these genes in all three strains and increases the levels of the two Cyp6a8 transcripts and the 1.8-kb RNA produced by the Cyp6a9 and/or Cyp6a9-related genes. Expression of the Cyp6a8 gene is down-regulated in the hybrids of 91-R and 91-C strains despite the fact that the hybrids carry one copy of the highly active allele of the Cvp6a8 gene of the 91-R strain. Based on these results we propose that the Cyp6a8 gene in 91-C strain may be turned off by an active repressor which might be inhibited by barbital treatment. In the 91-R strain, the putative repressor may be defective, allowing high level of constitutive expression of the Cyp6a8 gene. 3aunspecific monooxygenase 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3atransgenic animals 3aamino acid sequences 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3amultigene family 3apolytene chromosomes 3aDrosophila melanogaster 0agenbank/l46860 0agenbank/l46858 0acyp6a9 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0aneuroleptics 0achromosome mapping 0agenbank/l46859 0acyp6a8 gene1 aDombrowski, S.M.1 aWaters, L.C.1 aGanguly, R.0 tGene.g1996 Nov. 21, v. 180, no. 1/2 p.165-171x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02781naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011700128300001600245500001500261520156800276650002201844650001601866650002401882650002101906650002401927650000901951650002501960650001701985650002302002650001902025650001402044650002102058653001902079653002102098653001402119653002502133653002802158700001602186773006702202852000902269930003302278945001302311946001102324655001202335IND2055440720221116212013.0970218e19961205ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205544072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar, G.R.10aCloning and sequence analysis of the Rhizobium etli ccmA and ccmB genes involved in c-type cytochrome biogenesis  ap. 129-135.  a2019-12-05  aIn this paper we describe the sequence analysis of two Rhizobium etli genes (ccmA and ccmB) which are believed to participate in the transport of the haem moiety to the periplasm in other bacterial species. The characterized DNA region was isolated by complementation of a R. etli Tn5mob induced mutant (CFN4201) which was affected in the production of c-type cytochromes. Sequence analysis of this region identified three open reading frames, two were identified as the ccmA and ccmB genes. The predicted protein sequence of ccmA showed significant homology with ATP binding proteins of the ABC-type transporter systems, while ccmB encodes for a hydrophobic protein probably associated with the ccmA gene product. The Tn5mob insertion in CFN4201 strain was located in the carboxy terminus of CcmB. Restriction mapping of the EcoRI fragment containing the Tn5mob insertion showed that it involved a deletion of approximately 1.5 kb. Mutagenesis of the wild-type region with a miniMu transposon and complementation analysis showed that the mutation in ccmB, and not the deletion, was responsible for the phenotype of CFN4201 strain and that ccmA and ccmB are independent transcription units. We found that a region located downstream of ccmB is reiterated twice, one near the chromosomal ccmA-ccmB locus while the second in plasmid e. Finally, CFN4201 membranes had detectable levels of c1 apoprotein which did not contain bound haem. This data could suggest that haem binding to the apoprotein occurs after the translocation of the apo form of c1 to the membrane. 3aprotein synthesis 3aapoproteins 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aheme 3aamino acid sequences 3acytochrome c 3abacterial proteins 3acell membranes 3aRhizobium 3aABC transporters 0agenbank/u52866 0abinding proteins 0accma gene 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aSoberon, M.0 tGene.g1996 Dec. 5, v. 182, no. 1/2 p.129-135x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03629naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245010100141300001600242500001500258520131100273650001301584650002101597650001101618650001601629650002901645650002501674650001201699650002401711650002801735650002101763650002701784650002401811650001201835650004001847650001801887650002701905650002901932650002301961650002301984650001502007650003902022650001502061650001102076650001902087650002502106650002902131650002802160650003102188650001402219650001302233650003102246650004202277650002402319650006202343650003802405650003402443650003002477653001602507653001102523653001902534653002802553653002502581653001402606700001402620700002002634700001902654700001802673773006602691852000902757930003302766945001302799946001102812655001202823IND2055447020221116211846.0970218e19970131ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205544702DNAL7 a90343252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoos, J.10aENP1, an essential gene encoding a nuclear protein that is highly conserved from yeast to humans  ap. 137-146.  a2019-12-05  aA novel gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ENP1, was found to be essential for growth. The ENP1 gene encodes a protein of 483 amino acids (aa). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the deduced aa sequence of this gene exhibited approx. 60% sequence similarity to the deduced aa sequence of proteins of unknown function in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. No well defined functional motifs were evident upon analysis of the aa sequence. The protein was found to contain 20% acidic aa residues, with most of them being localized to a very negatively charged domain between aa residues 100 and 150. A construct encoding a fusion protein consisting of the Enp1 protein fused to the c-myc epitope that was either under the control of the ENP1 promoter or the GAL1,10 promoter was prepared. The construct was used to express the protein tagged with the c-myc epitope. Despite the presence of a naturally occurring promoter region with homology to the unfolded protein response element, the level of Enp1mycp remained unchanged after growth of the cells in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation of proteins. Immunohistochemical studies to define the cellular localization of the Enp1myc protein revealed that it was localized to the nucleus.

DNA blot analyses indicated that hsc1+ is localized in Sp chromosome II, and suggested that the Sp genome contains a relatively smaller number of HSP70 genes compared with the Sc genome. 3aheat shock proteins 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aheat stress 3amultigene family 0ahsc1+ gene 0agenetic regulation 0aheat shock cognate proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d84218 0anucleotide sequences1 aSugiura, R.1 aShuntoh, H.1 aKuno, T.0 tGene.g1996 Nov. 28, v. 181, no. 1/2 p.45-49x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02099naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009400145300001600239500001500255520053200270650002100802650002500823650002400848650003400872650001200906650002100918650002100939650002400960650001800984650003601002650001601038650002101054650001801075650003101093650002801124650002101152650003101173653001201204653002201216653001501238653002801253653001901281653002501300653004801325700002001373700002001393773006601413852000901479930003301488945001301521946001101534655001201545IND2056240220221116212144.0970331e19970115ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205624022DNAL7 a90316262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaure, P.T.10aMolecular analysis of the isocitrate lyase gene (acu-7) of the mushroom Coprinus cinereus  ap. 185-187.  a2019-12-05  aThe nucleotide sequence of the structural gene for isocitrate lyase (acu-7) is presented and features of its coding sequence and predicted protein are described.

While several of these genes are highly expressed in stomach (sLys), few other copies are weakly expressed in other tissues, notably in polymorphnuclear granulocytes and macrophages (mLys). Searching an understanding for these grossly different levels of expression, we isolated the bovine variant of the gene being expressed in granulocytes and characterized it by sequencing, together with its promoter. Spanning about 9 kb of genomic DNA, the gene is found to be segmented into four exons, in common with all other Lys, as known from vertebrates. Sequence homologies between all bovine sLys-variants exceeds 70% over much of the entire coding sequence and promoter region. This indicates (i) that bovine lysozymes expressed either in stomach or granulocyte originate from a common ancestral gene and (ii) also excludes the possibility that the observed weak expression of the mLys gene is due to major structural rearrangements within the promoter segment. However, primer extension analysis based on RNA isolated from kidney locates the transcription startpoint (tsp of that gene) 44 nt further upstream than observed in both, bovine stomach lysozyme RNA or any of the homologous genes in mice and man. The observed weak expression of this bovine mLys gene appears to be a consequence of both the presence of an extra ATG codon in the extended 5'-UTR, and a severe down mutation of the ancestral TATA-box which is only partially compensated for by the presence of another mutation further upstream resulting in a weak substitute promoter sequence. 3alysozyme 3ainterspecific variation 3aretrotransposons 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3ahumans 3acattle 3atranscription (genetics) 3amice 3agene expression 3agranulocytes 3akidneys 3aexons 3apromoter regions 3aintrons 0aspecies differences 0amolecular sequence data 0aslys gene 0atranscription start point 0agenbank/u25810 0anucleotide sequences 0amlys gene1 aHobom, G.1 aSenft, B.1 aSeyfert, H.M.0 tGene.g1996 Oct. 31, v. 178, no. 1/2 p.131-137x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01519naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245007900133300001600212520045600228650002200684650002200706650001200728650002500740650002500765650001000790650001100800650001800811653002800829653001900857653001900876653001900895700001500914700001800929700001500947700001300962773006800975852000901043930003301052945001301085946001101098655001201109IND2055023720221116211804.0970123e19961031ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205502372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiefer-Meyer, M.C.10aCloning and sequence analysis of laccase-encoding cDNA clones from tobacco  ap. 205-207.  aThree laccase-encoding cDNAs were cloned from a tobacco stem cDNA library.

Chimeric genes fusing the promoter and the 5' untranslated region of the At eEF-1 beta gene to the gus reporter gene were constructed and used to study the expression of this gene in transgenic tobacco plants. Interestingly, it was found that the first intron of this gene is required for high levels of expression. Experiments using chimeric promoters showed that an enhancer-like element is present in the first intron of At eEF-1 beta. Gel-shift assays were used to demonstrate that this intron is specifically bound by putative transcription factors present in nuclear protein extracts. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3arecombinant DNA 3aTATA box 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3atransgenic plants 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3ahistochemistry 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aintrons 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aEnhancer Elements, Genetic 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPeptide Elongation Factor 1 2aPeptide Elongation Factorsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 0aenhancer sequences 0agenbank/x74733 0apromoter regions 0abinding proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0atranslation 0aef-1 beta gene 0atranslation factors 0agenbank/x74734 0anucleotide sequences1 aJimenez, B.1 aHerrera-Estrella, L.0 tGene.g1996, v. 170, no. 2 p.201-206x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02009naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245014400174300001600318500002400334520096800358650002401326650000801350650001501358650001301373650000901386650002201395650001301417650002201430650002501452773014001477852000901617856005701626655001201683IND4456035020221116211848.0110408e196506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445603502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1965.tb00848.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMADGE, DAVID S.14aTHE Responses of cotton stainers (dysdercus fasciatus sign.) to relative humidity and temperature, and the location of their hygroreceptors  ap. 135-152.  aIncludes references  aCotton stainers (Dysdercus fasciatus Sign.) are hygrosensitive to both dry and moist air, but not to intermediate relative humidities. The hygroreceptors are located on the 4-segmented antennae. Bilateral amputation of the terminal antennal segment results in a dry reaction; bilateral amputation of the terminal and sub-terminal segments result in a moist reaction. The sensilla basiconica (“peg organs”) on the terminal segment are probably responsible for the moist reaction, and the sensilla trichodea (“sensory hairs”) on the two terminal segments are probably responsible for the normal dry reaction. Other sensory areas on the antennae are probably not hygrosensitive. In temperature gradients of 15° C to 38° C (mainly in moist air) cotton stainers first aggregate at the cold end, and then aggregate in two peaks, one at the cold end and another at 23° C--34° C. The thermoreceptors are not located on the antennae, but elsewhere on the body. 3aDysdercus fasciatus 3aair 3aamputation 3aantennae 3acold 3arelative humidity 3asensilla 3asensory receptors 3atemperature profiles0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1965 June, v. 8, no. 2 p.135-152dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1965.tb00848.x 7aarticle02102naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007300127300001600200500001500216520093900231650002801170650001801198650002401216650002101240650002401261650002201285650002501307650002001332650001401352653001901366653003001385653001401415653002801429653002501457653002301482700001301505700001601518773006801534852000901602930003301611945001301644946001101657655001201668IND2055130220221116211942.0970129e19961024ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205513022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsiang, C.Y.10aIdentification of a pseudorabies virus UL12 (deoxyribonuclease) gene  ap. 109-113.  a2019-12-05  aWe characterized the gene encoding the pseudorabies virus (PrV) homologue of the herpes simplex virus 1 UL12 open reading frame that encodes the alkaline nuclease. The deduced PrV UL12 product was 492 amino acid residues and exhibited three conserved regions among herpesviruses. Northern blot analysis indicated that three transcripts (3.2, 1.6 and 1 kb) were encoded in this region and the UL12 corresponds to the 1.6-kb transcript. Primer extension and UL12-specific cDNA cloning were performed to verify the precise location of the UL12 transcript. These data indicated that the transcription start site of UL12 was located at 47-62 nucleotides upstream of the UL12 translation start site and the polyadenylation cleavage site was located at 15 or 16 nucleotides downstream the typical polyadenylation signal. Furthermore, the 53-kDa UL12 product, which indeed has deoxyribonuclease activity, was evidenced by in vitro expression. 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3anucleases 0agenbank/u25056 0atranscription start point 0aul12 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aSuid herpesvirus 11 aHo, T.Y.1 aChang, T.J.0 tGene.g1996 Oct. 24, v. 177, no. 1/2 p.109-113x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03728naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245012900146300001800275500001500293520206100308650001502369650002002384650002402404650002302428650002702451650002102478650001902499650001502518650001902533650002402552650001202576650003102588650003202619650001302651650002102664650001102685650002402696650001902720650002002739650001402759650002202773650001402795650002402809650002702833650002302860653002002883653002002903653001802923700001702941700001502958773008502973852000903058930003303067945001303100946001303113655001203126IND2330908020221116211931.0030220e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233090802DNAL7 a124874732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDechow, C.D.10aHeritability and correlations among body condition score loss, body condition score, production and reproductive performance  ap. 3062-3070.  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives of this study were to estimate the heritability of body condition score loss (BCSL) in early lactation and estimate genetic and phenotypic correlations among BCSL, body condition score (BCS), production, and reproductive performance. Body condition scores at calving and postpartum, mature equivalents for milk, fat and protein yield, days to first service, and services per conception were obtained from Dairy Records Management Systems in Raleigh, NC. Body condition score loss was defined as BCS at calving minus postpartum BCS. Heritabilities and correlations were estimated with a series of bivariate animal models with average-information REML. Herd-year-season effects and age at calving were included in all models. The length of the prior calving interval was included for all second lactation traits, and all nonproduction traits were analyzed with and without mature equivalent milk as a covariable. Initial correlations between BCS and BCSL were obtained using BCSL and BCS observations from the same cows. Additional genetic correlation estimates were generated through relationships between a group of cows with BCSL observations and a separate group of cows with BCS observations. Heritability estimates for BCSL ranged from 0.01 to 0.07. Genetic correlation estimates between BCSL and BCS at calving ranged from -0.15 to -0.26 in first lactation and from -0.11 to -0.48 in second lactation. Genetic correlation estimates between BCSL and postpartum BCS ranged from -0.70 to -0.99 in first lactation and from -0.56 to -0.91 in second lactation. Phenotypic correlation estimates between BCSL and BCS at calving were near 0.54, whereas phenotypic correlation estimates between BCSL and postpartum BCS were near -0.65. Genetic correlations between BCSL and yield traits ranged from 0.17 to 0.50. Genetic correlations between BCSL and days to first service ranged from 0.29 to 0.68. Selection for yield appears to increase BCSL by lowering postpartum BCS. More loss in BCS was associated with an increase in days to first service. 3adairy cows 3aearly lactation 3agenetic correlation 3aselection criteria 3aphenotypic correlation 3alactation number 3aenergy balance 3amilk yield 3abody condition 3apostpartum interval 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxgenetics 2aBody Constitutionxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aLactationxgenetics 2aModels, Animal 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhenotype 2aPostpartum Period 2aPregnancy 2aRegression Analysis 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic 0arepeat breeders 0alactation stage 0aweight losses1 aRogers, G.W.1 aClay, J.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.3062-3070x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04251naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245012400146300001800270500001500288520210400303650001602407650002202423650001902445650001802464650001502482650002302497650001802520650000902538650001702547650001802564650002802582650001202610650002002622650001802642650001602660650002402676650001702700650001902717650000902736650001602745650004702761650001202808650002402820650003602844650002302880650004602903650001402949650001102963650001902974650001102993650001403004650003203018650002803050650002003078650002303098650002103121650002403142653001803166653001503184653001103199653001303210653001503223653001703238653001103255700001903266700001903285773008503304852000903389930003303398945001303431946001303444655001203457IND2330906520221116212023.0030220e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233090652DNAL7 a124874692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalawu, M.B.10aForage intake, meal patterns, and milk production of lactating dairy cows fed grass silage or pea-wheat bi-crop silages  ap. 3035-3044.  a2019-12-05  aThis study investigated the feed intake, milk production, and plasma nutrient status in dairy cows fed inter-cropped pea-wheat (bi-crop) silages comprised of contrasting ratios of pea to wheat. Spring peas (cv. Magnus) and wheat (cv. Axona) sown at either high (75:25) or low (25:75) pea inclusion rates were harvested after 13 (Cut 1) or 15 (Cut 2) wk. Eighteen Holstein-Friesian cows between wk 9 and 10 of lactation were used in a cyclical changeover design with three 28-d periods. Cows were fed the bi-crop silages and 6 kg of concentrates or second-cut grass silage supplemented with 6 (GS6) or 9 (GS9) kg/d of concentrates. Forage intakes were higher when bi-crops were fed (10.3 to 11.4 kg dry matter [DM]/d) than when grass silage was fed (8.6 kg DM/d). Total DM intake was similar among cows fed the bi-crop silages and GS9 diets, but intakes for GS6 were at least 1.7 kg DM/d lower. Increasing the pea inclusion rate increased the crude protein (CP) content of the ration, but it did not enhance forage quality or animal performance. The rate of intake of the different forages was similar, so that the higher intakes of bi-crop silages were associated with more time spent at the feedbunk and an increased number of meals. Diet digestibility ranged from 531 to 650 g/kg, and the highest value was given by the Cut 1 bi-crop silage diet. Milk yield tended to be similar for cows fed the Cut 2 bi-crop and GS9 diets, and these values were at least 1.7 kg higher than those for cows fed on other treatments. Generally, the bi-crop diets resulted in higher milk fat contents and lower polyunsaturated fatty acid contents. Milk protein content was highest for cows fed the GS9 diet. Blood metabolite content was unaffected by treatment except for blood urea nitrogen content, which was higher in cows fed the bi-crop silages, reflecting reduced N-use efficiency with these diets. The study showed that pea-wheat bi-crop silages can be used to replace moderate-quality grass silage in dairy cow rations, but their role as alternatives to high-quality forages requires additional investigation. 3afatty acids 3awhole crop silage 3amilk fat yield 3adigestibility 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aserum albumin 3apeas 3aconcentrates 3acrude protein 3amilk protein percentage 3alactose 3afeed conversion 3ablood glucose 3afeed intake 3amilk fat percentage 3agrass silage 3aprotein intake 3aurea 3acrude fiber 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDigestion 2aEating 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aPeasxchemistry 2aPoaceaexchemistry 2aSilagexanalysis 2aTriticumxchemistry 0ablood protein 0adry matter 0aintake 0amilk fat 0amilk yield 0awheat silage 0aratios1 aAdesogan, A.T.1 aDewhurst, R.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.3035-3044x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02644naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245010900144300001800253500001500271520120400286650001801490650001001508650001001518650001301528650002201541650001101563650002101574650001201595650002301607650004101630650007201671650001101743650001401754650004001768650000901808650002201817653001701839653002501856653002801881653001201909653002601921700001901947700001801966773009901984852000902083939003302092946001302125655001202138IND8906091920221116212416.0891116e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890609192DNAL7 a27827152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiond, J.L.10aPharmacokinetics and metabolic inertness of doxycycline in calves with mature or immature rumen function  ap. 1329-1333.  a2019-12-05  aThe pharmacokinetic determinants of doxycycline were calculated after a single IV administration of the drug (20 mg/kg of body weight) in 5 Angus calves with mature rumen function and 4 Holstein calves with immature rumen function. Doxycycline disposition was best described by means of an open 2-compartment model. Median elimination half-life was 14.17 hours (Angus) and 9.84 hours (Holstein). Mean (+/- SEM total body clearance was 1.07 (+/- 0.06) and 2.20 (+/- 0.21) ml/min/kg in Angus and Holstein calves, respectively. Mean extent of doxycycline binding to serum proteins was 92.3% (+/- 0.8%). The large steady-state volume of distribution (1.31 +/- 0.11 L/kg in Angus and 1.81 +/- 0.24 L/kg in Holstein calves), despite the small free fraction in serum, suggested a relatively unrestricted access of drug into the intracellular compartment and/or appreciable tissue binding. Results of mass spectrometric analysis of serum and urine from calves administered doxycycline IV revealed absence of biotransformation, because only parent drug could be detected. Thus, doxycycline may be a valuable antibiotic for use in food animals pending further studies on tissue residues, safety, and efficacy. 3atetracyclines 3arumen 3aAngus 3aHolstein 3ametabolic studies 3acalves 3apharmacokinetics 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDoxycyclinexadministration & dosagexmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aFemale 2aHalf-Life 2aInjections, Intravenousxveterinary 2aMale 2aRumenxphysiology 0adrug effects 0aantimicrobial agents 0aphysiological functions 0aanalogs 0aanti-infective agents1 aTyczkowska, K.1 aRiviere, J.E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1989 Aug., v. 50, no. 8 p.1329-1333x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02989naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009100144300001800235500001500253520145300268650000901721650003001730650002701760650002201787650001101809650001401820650001201834650003201846650001101878650003401889650002801923650004801951650006801999650003102067650005102098650006902149650006002218653002502278653001602303700001702319700001702336773009902353852000902452939003302461946001302494655001202507IND8906091320221116212132.0891116e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890609132DNAL7 a25512002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, G.H.10aInfection of the middle nasal meatus of calves with Pasteurella haemolytica serotype 1  ap. 1297-1301.  a2019-12-05  aEight healthy nonstressed calves were inoculated with Pasteurella haemolytica serotype 1, by instilling a broth culture into the middle nasal meatus of the left nostril. The inoculated left nostrils shed P haemolytica from the ventral nasal meatus at a steady rate for a mean of 7 days, whereas the uninoculated right nostrils of the same calves shed P haemolytica sporadically and in lower concentrations. The duration, frequency, and concentration of P haemolytica shed from the inoculated nostrils was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than from the nostrils of other healthy calves that had been exposed by instilling the culture into the ventral nasal meatus of both nostrils in a previous study. The concentration of antibodies (IgG, IgA, and IgM) to P haemolytica increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in serum and nasal secretions after exposure. Four weeks after initial P haemolytica exposure, calves were exposed to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus and became clinically ill. Four calves were induced to shed P haemolytica from both nostrils by the virus infection; thus, they were harboring the bacterium and were susceptible to active recolonization. Four calves were not induced to shed P haemolytica. The apparent reason was not that they were resistant to active colonization, but that they were no longer harboring the bacterium, because they became active shedders after they were reinfected with P haemolytica. 3anose 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aMannheimia haemolytica 3agenetic variation 3acalves 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxanalysis 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aHerpesvirus 1, Bovinexgrowth & development 2aInfectious Bovine Rhinotracheitisxcomplicationsxmicrobiology. 2aNasal Cavityxmicrobiology 2aPasteurellaxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aPasteurella Infectionsxcomplicationsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0ainoculation1 aNelson, S.L.1 aBriggs, R.E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1989 Aug., v. 50, no. 8 p.1297-1301x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02731naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245017200143300001800315520138500333650000901718650001301727650002001740650002501760650001301785650001201798650004201810650002101852650004101873650006001914650003301974650003102007650001302038650005802051653001302109700001602122700001702138773009902155852000902254939003302263946001302296655001202309IND8906087620221116212310.0891113e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890608762DNAL7 a27827052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, J.A.10aRelationship of plasma gastrin immunoreactivity and gastroesophageal sphincter pressure in clinically normal dogs and in dogs with previous gastric dilatation-volvulus  ap. 1228-1232.  aFasting and postprandial gastroesophageal sphincter pressure (GESP) and plasma gastrin immunoreactivity were measured in 6 dogs from 9 through 60 months after treatment for and recovery from gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV). The GESP was not significantly increased in these dogs, compared with that in clinically normal dogs in either the fasting or postprandial state. Corresponding plasma gastrin immunoreactivity was not significantly increased in dogs of the GDV-recovered group, compared with that in clinically normal dogs (fasting or postprandial). An exaggerated increase in GESP in response to food-induced gastrin release was not observed in dogs of the GDV-recovered group. Exogenously administered pentagastrin (3-micrograms/kg bolus, IV) increased fasting GESP in clinically normal dogs over a 4-minute test period (P = 0.01). Gastric distention in response to oral administration of isosmolar saline solution (500 ml) did not significantly increase GESP or plasma gastrin immunoreactivity in clinically normal dogs. In anesthetized clinically normal dogs, gastric distention in response to use of balloons filled to exert intragastric pressure of 30 mm of Hg also did not cause significant increase in plasma gastrin immunoreactivity. Increased GESP, secondary to hypergastrinemia or gastric distention, is an unlikely cause of eructation failure in dogs with GDV. 3adogs 3agastrins 3aimmune response 3aesophageal sphincter 3apressure 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxbloodxphysiopathology. 2aDogsxphysiology 2aEsophagogastric Junctionxphysiology 2aGastric Dilatationxbloodxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aGastrinsxbloodximmunology. 2aPentagastrinxpharmacology 2aPressure 2aStomach Volvulusxbloodxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 0ablockage1 aTwedt, D.C.1 aCurtis, C.R.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1989 Aug., v. 50, no. 8 p.1228-1232x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02503naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245011500175300001600290500002400306520122300330650002401553650001101577650002401588650001501612650001801627650001201645650002301657650001401680650001801694650001001712650001301722650001301735650002101748650002001769650002001789650001301809650001601822650001101838700002001849773012401869852000901993856005502002655001202057IND4396219820221116212059.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439621982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00609.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopham, Holly J.R.10aEffect of inorganic and organic forms of selenium supplementation on development of larval Heliothis virescens  ap. 171-178.  aIncludes references  aSelenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for vertebrates though little is known about the effects on insects. Herbivorous insect larvae acquire Se from plant tissues in the inorganic form of sodium selenate and sodium selenite, and in the organic form of selenoamino acids, selenomethionine, and selenocystine. In this study, we document the effects of dietary supplementation with sodium selenite, sodium selenate, selenocystine, selenomethionine, and selenized yeast on the developmental rate of Heliothis virescens (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Larvae tolerated high levels of Se (500 μg g⁻¹ Se) as sodium selenate and to a lesser extent as selenocystine. Lower levels of sodium selenite (>1 μg g⁻¹ Se) caused increased mortality, reduced rates of pupation, more pupal/adult intermediates, and reduced adult emergence. Selenomethionine proved toxic to larvae at levels above 25 μg g⁻¹ Se, significantly delaying pupation and raising mortality. Provision of Se as selenized yeast, which contains primarily selenomethionine, was also extremely detrimental to larval development and survival. The results indicate that the impact of dietary Se supplement for insects may differ from vertebrates. 3aHeliothis virescens 3aadults 3adietary supplements 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3alarval development 3amortality 3aplant tissues 3apupae 3apupation 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3asodium selenate 3asodium selenite 3atoxicity 3avertebrates 3ayeasts1 aShelby, Kent S.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2007 Nov., v. 125, no. 2 p.171-178dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00609.x 7aarticle02152naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002600128245011000154300001800264520086100282650000901143650001801152650001601170650001701186650001601203650001901219650001201238650002201250650002001272650002201292650001801314650002401332650000901356650004001365650002601405650004001431650004601471700001701517700001701534773010001551852000901651939003301660946001301693655001201706IND8906163920221116212305.0891116e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890616392DNAL7 a28023292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrites-Murphy, M.B.10aEffect of incorporation of serum from dogs with renal impairment on canine erythroid bone marrow cultures  ap. 1537-1543.  aSerum from dogs with surgically induced renal impairment was incorporated into the medium for erythroid bone marrow cultures. A significant correlation was found between serum activities of erythropoietin and numbers of erythroid colony-forming units grown in culture. Serum creatinine concentrations had no correlation, and serum parathyroid hormone activities had a negative correlation with numbers of erythroid colony-forming units that was below the level of significance. Purified 1-84 parathyroid hormone added to bone marrow cultures was found to be stimulatory to erythroid colony-forming unit growth in higher concentrations, but decreased the number of burst-forming units. Unmeasured substances in the canine serum appeared to have a greater effect on the canine erythroid bone marrow cultures than did creatinine or parathyroid hormone values. 3adogs 3arenal failure 3abone marrow 3acell culture 3ablood serum 3aerythropoietin 2aAnimals 2aBone Marrow Cells 2aCells, Cultured 2aCreatininexblood 2aCulture Media 2aDog Diseasesxblood 2aDogs 2aErythroid Precursor Cellsxcytology 2aErythropoietinxblood 2aKidney Diseasesxbloodxveterinary. 2aParathyroid Hormonexbloodxpharmacology.1 aPierce, K.R.1 aFisher, J.W.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1989 Sept., v. 50, no. 9 p.1537-1543x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02440naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245008900150300001800239520099900257650001601256650001101272650001301283650002201296650002101318650003201339650002501371650001601396650001201412650003701424650002301461650001101484650003501495650004201530650000901572650002701581650006001608650003001668700001901698700001901717700001901736700001801755700001801773773010001791852000901891939003301900946001301933655001201946IND8906133820221116212309.0891114e198910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890613382DNAL7 a28023102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwecker, W.S.

Six groups of 4 calves each were subjected to the following regimes: group 1--nonparasitized controls; group 2--nonparasitized, but challenge exposed at day 64 with Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine (BA) and at day 78 with IV administration of a soluble third-stage larval (L3) antigen preparation of O. ostertagi (OAG); group 3--nonparasitized, but challenge exposed at day 78 with 75 X 10(3) L3 of O ostertagi; group 4--continuously parasitized by weekly dosing with 30 X 10(3) L3 of O ostertagi; group 5--continuously parasitized by weekly dosing with 30 X 10(3) L3 of O ostertagi, then challenge exposed on day 64 with BA and on day 78 with IV inoculation of OAG; and group 6--continuously parasitized by weekly dosing with 30 X 10(3) L3 of O ostertagi, then challenge exposed on day 78 with 75 X 10(3) L3 of O ostertagi. Over the initial 10 weeks of the study, nonparasitized calves, (groups 1, 2, and 3) had higher body weight, blood lymphocyte (BL) response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and significantly (P less than 0.05) higher feed consumption and lymphocyte numbers, whereas parasitized calves (groups 4, 5, and 6) had higher BL responses to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and significantly (P less than 0.05) higher neutrophil and eosinophil numbers, plasma pepsinogen (PP) values, and BL response to OAG. During the challenge-exposure period (weeks 10 through 13), group-5 calves had significantly (P less than 0.05) higher eosinophil numbers and PP values for week 11 (BA challenge exposure) and for week 13 (OAG challenge exposure) than did group-2 calves, but differences were not observed in BL responses to PHA, PWM, and OAG. Oral L3 challenge exposure at week 13 induced significantly (P less than 0.05) lower lymphocyte numbers, higher eosinophil numbers (P less than 0.05), and higher PP values, but lower BL response to PHA, PWM, and OAG in group-6, compared with group-3 calves. In continuously parasitized calves, comparison of IV OAG challenge exposure with oral L3 challenge exposure indicated that group-6 (L3) calves has significantly lower (P less than 0.05) lymphocyte numbers and higher PP values than did group-5 (OAG) calves. Results of ELISA revealed significantly (P less than 0.05) higher antibody titer to OAG in parasitized calves, compared with nonparasitized calves. Abomasal mucosal pathologic changes were most severe in the continuously parasitized calves. Calves of groups 4, 5, and 6 had thicker mucosae (edema), significantly (P less than 0.05) higher eosinophil numbers, and higher globule leukocyte and mast cell numbers in the fundic and pyloric regions than did calves of groups 1, 2, and 3. Calves of groups 4, 5, and 6 also had significantly (P less than 0.05) larger abomasal lymph node masses than did nonparasitized calves. In group-1 calves, nodes had the lowest mass. Differences were not observed among groups for lymphocyte responses to proliferative and suppressive assays performed on the abomasal lymph node lymphocytes. 3acalves 3aOstertagia ostertagi 3aantigens 3avaccines 3aimmune response 2aAbomasumxpathology 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Helminthxanalysis 2aAntigens, Helminthximmunology 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aBody Weight 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesximmunology 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aEating 2aFecesxparasitology 2aImmunizationxveterinary 2aLeukocyte Countxveterinary 2aLymph Nodesxpathology 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMale 2aOstertagiaximmunology 2aOstertagiasisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aPepsinogensxblood 2aTrichostrongyloidiasisxveterinary1 aGibbs, H.C.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1989 Oct., v. 50, no. 10 p.1764-1770x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03759naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009900146300001800245500001500263520230000278650001002578650001602588650001902604650001602623650001002639650001502649650001902664650002102683650001202704650003002716650003702746650006902783650002202852650002802874650001102902650002302913650002902936650003102965653002502996653002603021700001603047700001703063700001803080773010003098852000903198939003303207946001303240655001203253IND8906133320221116212354.0891113e198910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890613332DNAL7 a28023052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuzwiak, J.S.10aEffect of probenecid administration on cephapirin pharmacokinetics and concentrations in mares  ap. 1742-1747.  a2019-12-05  aCephapirin (20 mg/kg of body weight, IV) was administered before and after 3 doses of probenecid (25, 50, or 75 mg/kg, intragastrically, at 12-hour intervals) to 2 mares. Clearance and apparent volume of distribution, based on area under the curve, were negatively correlated with probenecid dose. Clearance of cephapirin was decreased by approximately 50% by administration of 50 mg of probenecid/kg. Serum, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, CSF, urinary and endometrial concentrations of cephapirin were determined after 5 doses of cephapirin (20 mg/kg, IM, at 12-hour intervals) without and with concurrently administered probenecid (50 mg/kg, intragastrically) to 6 mares, including the 2 mares given cephapirin, IV. Highest mean serum cephapirin concentrations were 16.1 +/- 2.16 micrograms/ml at 0.5 hour after the 5th cephapirin dose [postinjection (initial) hour (PIH) 48.5] in mares not given probenecid and 23.7 +/- 1.30 micrograms/ml at 1.5 hours after the 5th cephapirin dose (PIH 49.5) in mares given probenecid. Mean peak peritoneal fluid and synovial fluid cephapirin concentrations were 6.2 +/- 0.57 micrograms/ml and 6.6 +/- 0.58 micrograms/ml, respectively, without probenecid administration and 12.3 +/- 0.46 micrograms/ml and 10 +/- 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, with concurrent probenecid administration. Mean trough cephapirin concentrations for peritoneal and synovial fluids in mares given probenecid were 2 to 3 times higher than trough concentrations in mares not given probenecid. Overall mean cephapirin concentrations were significantly higher for serum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and endometrium when probenecid was administered concurrently with cephapirin (P less than 0.01). Cephapirin was not detected in CSF samples. Overall mean urinary cephapirin concentrations (2.47 mg/ml without concurrent probenecid administration and 3.06 mg/ml with concurrent probenecid) were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05). Mean trough serum probenecid concentration was 61.2 +/- 5.28 micrograms/ml. Highest serum probenecid concentration was 148.8 +/- 5.97 micrograms/ml, 2 hours after the 5th cephapirin dose (PIH 50).

It has been proposed that this represents a necessary energetic trade-off between reproductive and somatic functions. We examined the metabolic aspects of this trade-off. We measured egg production, dry wt, somatic lipid and carbohydrate storage, and metabolic rate in response to changing amounts of live dietary yeast. These variables were measured in live replicate populations selected for postponed aging and five replicate short lived control populations. We find that all ten populations show an overall increase in egg production and decrease in the amount of stored metabolites in the presence of increasing amounts of yeast. All populations increase metabolic rate in response to increasing amounts of live dietary yeast. The energetics of this phenomenon suggest that increased egg production results from increased acquisition of nutrients available in yeast with only a small redirection of resources from storage to egg production. 3aanimal nutrition 3ametabolism 3alongevity 3abody weight 3afecundity 3aexperimental diets 3acarbohydrates 3ayeasts 3alipids 3anutrient reserves 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aartificial selection 0areproduction1 aBradley, T.J.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.779-788x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02666naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006900124300001600193520179900209650001302008650002502021650001202046650001302058650002302071650001402094653001302108653001802121700001802139700001902157773008602176852000902262930003302271945001302304946001102317655001202328IND2081517420221116212016.0980511e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208151742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, L.10aOn the respiratory quotient (RQ) of termites (Insecta: Isoptera)  ap. 749-758.  aThe respiratory quotient (RQ) at 28 degrees C was determined by Warburg manometry in 23 species of termites from the Mbalmayo Forest Reserve (Cameroon) and three sub-tropical species cultured under laboratory conditions in the U.K. or freshly collected in Australia. The data are tabulated with other recently reported RQs (determined by manometry or GC) and with measured CH4 emission rates to provide a survey of 29 species covering both lower and higher termites in all major trophic (functional) categories. In all species, except the wood-feeding Coptotermes acinaciformis and the soil-feeding Cubitermes fungifaber, the observed mean values (with manometry corrected for known fluxes of H2 and CH4) were at or well above 1.00. Soil-feeding forms (except C. fungifaber) generally showed a high apparent RQ (not corrected for H2), with nine species (out of 13) above 1.20 and six species above 1.30. Well-replicated laboratory experiments with Reticulitermes lucifugus showed that there was a tendency for RQ to fall with time over a 4-h incubation, although remaining greater than 1.00. The observed RQs are consistent with carbohydrate being the principal substrate supporting respiration in all trophic and taxonomic categories, with little or no contribution from the degradation of lignin or other polyaromatic materials. However, in many species (especially soil-feeders), the observed RQ is greater than that expected from known fluxes of O2, CO2 and CH4 on the assumption that carbohydrate is the respiratory substrate. This presupposes that there is a large hydrogen sink (additional to CH4 production), possibly the emission of H2 gas, and/or the existence of unresolved digestive mechanisms or electron routings. Uncertainties in the use of manometry with termites are discussed. 3aIsoptera 3arespiratory quotient 3amethane 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen consumption 3aemissions 0acrowding 0ahydrogen sink1 aBignell, D.E.1 aEggleton, N.L.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.749-758x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01994naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013400127300001600261500001500277520080900292650001401101650002401115650001601139650001201155650001801167650002401185650002101209650001701230650001801247650001101265650001501276650001501291650001501306650001401321653001401335653001701349653001401366700001601380773008601396852000901482930003301491945001301524946001101537655001201548IND2062941020221116212135.0980406e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206294102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheopold, U.10aHelix pomatia lectin and annexin V, two molecular probes for insect microparticles: possible involvement in hemolymph coagulation  ap. 667-674.  a2019-12-05  aInsect hemolymph coagulation involves a complex reaction with contributions from hemocytes and soluble factors. Here we present evidence for the presence of microparticles in the coagulation reaction. These particles are formed by hemocytes in a calcium-dependent process. Both the particles and the remaining cells are labelled by annexin V indicating the presence of phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane. Microparticles are enriched in hemomucin, a surface protein of Drosophila hemocytes that is specifically recognised by a snail (Helix pomatia) lectin. Hemomucin is shown to bind to lipophorin, a multifunctional hemolymph molecule previously implied in coagulation. Our findings suggest similarities at a biochemical and cellular level between vertebrate blood and insect hemolymph coagulation. 3aparticles 3aphosphatidylserines 3acoagulation 3alectins 3aHelix pomatia 3aGalleria mellonella 3abinding proteins 3agranulocytes 3abinding sites 3amucins 3acell lines 3alipophorin 3aDrosophila 3ahemocytes 0ahemomucin 0alipoproteins 0ahemolymph1 aSchmidt, O.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 July, v. 43, no. 7 p.667-674x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02595naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245500001500261520135100276650002301627650001501650650001401665650002701679650002001706650000801726650001401734650001301748650001601761650001101777650002601788653002101814653001701835653001901852653002101871653001801892700001601910700001301926700001501939700002001954773008501974852000902059930003302068945001302101946001102114655001202125IND2061231320221116211834.0980113e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206123132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTawfik, A.I.10aHaemolymph ecdysteroids and the prothoracic glands in the solitary and gregarious adults of Schistocerca gregaria  ap. 485-493.  a2019-12-05  aThe haemolymph titre of ecdysteroids rises in the adults of both sexes to a brief peak in the first week after emergence. A major rise begins on days 8-10, coincidentally with intensive vitellogenesis in the females and aggregation pheromone production in the males. The titre reaches about 400 ng of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) equiv./ml in the solitary, but less than 150 ng/ml in the gregarious adults of both sexes. In the females, the titre drops after oviposition (prior to day 20) and remains low until the next egg batch matures; then it increases in either phase to 150-180 ng/ml. A similar titre reduction in the males occurs just after day 20: in the solitary males the titre declines slowly to about 110 ng/ml on day 40, whereas in the gregarious males ecdysteroids virtually disappear by day 25. The blood of females contains similar levels of 20E and ecdysone, whereas in the males 20E makes up 73% (solitary) or 94% (gregarious) of total ecdysteroids. Minor components include a compound behaving as makisterone A and highly polar metabolites. The prothoracic glands are well preserved in both solitary and gregarious adults for at least 1 week after fledging and in some females they seem to persist for the lifetime, but in contrast to the glands of larvae, do not produce significant amounts of ecdysteroids when cultured in vitro. 3aprothoracic glands 3adimorphism 3asecretion 3aaggregation pheromones 3asteroidogenesis 3aage 3ahemolymph 3aecdysone 3aecdysterone 3aadults 3aSchistocerca gregaria 0agregarious phase 0aecdysteroids 0asolitary phase 0aphase dimorphism 0amakisterone a1 aVedrova, A.1 aLi, W.W.1 aSehnal, F.1 aObeng-Ofori, D.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 May, v. 43, no. 5 p.485-493x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03112naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012600129300001400255500001500269520178800284650002502072650001202097650002502109650001902134650001702153650002202170650001302192650002402205650001402229650001302243650002002256653001502276653002602291653002702317653002302344653001402367653002502381700001602406700001802422700002102440700001902461773008402480852000902564930003302573945001302606946001102619655001202630IND2164351620221116211926.0980929e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216435162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbbinghaus, D.10aDetection of major and minor sex pheromone components by the male codling moth Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)  ap. 49-58.  a2019-12-05  aElectroantennograms (EAGs) recorded from the antennae of male Cydia pomonella L. in response to stimulation with doses of the main sex pheromone component E8,E10-dodecadienol (Codlemone) ranging from 5 ng to 500 micrograms did not differ in their amplitudes from responses obtained to a synthetic 7-component pheromone blend containing the same absolute quantities of Codlemone. Based on differences in spike amplitudes obtained in Single Cell recordings (SCR), Sensilla trichodea on the antenna of males were found to contain at least three receptor neurone types. Two olfactory receptor neurones were tuned to Codlemone, while the third failed to be stimulated by Codlemone or by the minor components of the pheromone blend. As spike activity of the neurones in the S. trichodea stimulated by the 7-component blend did not differ from that of stimulation by Codlemone alone it appears that none of the receptor neurones is sensitive to any of the minor components tested. Scanning-electron-microscopical (SEM) examination of Sensilla auricillica on the antennae of Cydia males revealed two morphologically distinct types: rabbit eared shoehorn and regular shoehorn. SCR from these sensilla showed that only olfactory receptor neurones located in the rabbit-eared shoehorn type were tuned to the minor components. Differences in spike amplitudes (large, intermediate, small) allowed three types of neurones to be distinguished. Only the spike frequency of the intermediate receptor neurone was increased by application of the minor components E8-dodecenol, E9-dodecenol, dodecanol, tetradecanol, hexadecanol and E8,E10-dodecadienal. None were stimulated by Codlemone. These results are discussed in relation to the behavioural role of the minor pheromone components of C. pomonella. 3achemical composition 3aneurons 3aelectroantennography 3asex pheromones 3awind tunnels 3aelectrophysiology 3asensilla 3aolfactory receptors 3areceptors 3aantennae 3aCydia pomonella 0aanemotaxis 0aolfactory stimulation 0aanatomy and morphology 0asensilla trichodea 0acodlemone 0asensilla auricillica1 aLosel, P.M.1 aLindemann, M.1 aScherkenbeck, J.1 aZebitz, C.P.W.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1998 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.49-58x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02234naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245018100124300001600305520118500321650001601506650002201522650001601544650001401560650002701574650001901601650002101620650001001641650001701651650002201668653001301690700001601703773008701719852000901806930003301815945001301848946001101861655001201872IND2123408420221116212623.0980616e199709  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212340842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiimi, S.10aDevelopment changes in juvenile hormone and juvenile hormone acid titers in the hemolymph and in vitro juvenile hormone synthesis by corpora allata of the silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 875-884.  aA simple method was developed to quantify hemolymph juvenile hormone (JH) and JH acid in hemolymph extracts from Bombyx mori with an established radioimmunoassay (RIA) for JH I. When various organic solvent extracts of hemolymph were assayed by RIA, levels of non-specific binding of the labeled ligand in the assay were determined to be greater than 50% of the maximum amount of the label bound by the antiserum. When hemolymph was diluted with methanol:water:8.4 N ammonium hydroxide (10:9:1) and extracted with isooctane, non-specific binding was only 50% higher than control levels obtained with the assay buffer alone. The organic phase contained only JH and aqueous phase, JH acid. Consequently, this extraction method was used to prepare samples for RIA and enabled the separate measurement of JH and JH acid in hemolymph. With this method, changes in the hemolymph titers of JH and JH acid were determined from the third instar through early pupal stage of Bombyx mori. Changes in the in vitro secretory activity of corpora allata and brain-corpora cardiaca-corpora allata complexes from fifth instar larvae were also determined by using JH I RIA of the incubation medium. 3aBombyx mori 3ajuvenile hormones 3ametabolites 3ahemolymph 3abiological development 3acorpora allata 3acorpora cardiaca 3abrain 3abiosynthesis 3aradioimmunoassays 0ain vitro1 aSakurai, S.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.875-884x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03630naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008300125300001600208500001500224520241200239650002802651650001502679650001502694650002402709650001802733650001402751651004502765653002402810653001502834653003202849653002702881653002802908653001502936653002702951653002502978653002603003700001403029773008703043852000903130930003303139945001303172946001103185655001203196IND2123395120221116212440.0980616e199710  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212339512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTodd, C.M.10aResponses to desiccation in four coleopterans from sub-Antarctic South Georgia  ap. 905-913.  a2019-12-05  aRates of water loss were determined for four Coleoptera species: the herbivores Hydromedion sparsutum and Perimylops antarcticus (Family Perimylopidae) and the carnivores Trechisibus antarcticus and Oopterus soledadinus (Family Carabidae) collected during summer from a range of terrestrial habitats at South Georgia. A recording microbalance enabled measurement of individual weight loss with time in < 5% r.h. at 10, 20, 30 and 35 degrees C. Adults of T. antarcticus had significantly higher rates of water loss than any other species over all temperatures. Individuals of both herbivores exhibited the slowest water loss rates under the experimental conditions. Within species, rates at 10 or 20 degrees C were slower than at the higher temperatures. Adult P. antarcticus had significantly greater amounts of body water than adult H. sparsutum for each of the four temperatures. Within species and life-stages of both herbivores, body water contents after drying at 10 degrees C were significantly lower than individuals dried at 30-35 degrees C, but no such differences were observed for the carnivores. At each temperature, rates of water loss were negatively correlated with initial live weight in all four species, but this was not the case within species or between adults and larvae. Maximum survival times during desiccation declined as temperature increased, but did not differ between species at 10 degrees C. Over 30-35 degrees C, survival times of both herbivores were significantly longer than either of the carnivores. Smaller insects (e.g. the carabids) had faster rates of water loss than the larger perimylopids under the same environmental conditions. The latter had greater resistance to desiccation than the former. It is suggested that the larger body water content of P. antarcticus enables it to resist desiccation more than the other three species, which correlates with its ecological distribution. Differences in water contents after drying individuals at low and high temperatures may be caused either by the water binding properties of cells and tissues or by reduction in energy stores in order to maintain metabolism at lower environmental temperatures causing a body weight loss. Whilst both herbivores show some physiological adaptations to drying conditions, it is suggested that the two carnivorous beetles may have adapted behaviourally to the South Georgia environment. 3ainterspecific variation 3aColeoptera 3abody water 3aambient temperature 3awater content 3amortality 3aSouth Georgia and South Sandwich Islands 0aspecies differences 0aresistance 0adehydration (physiological) 0aperimylops antarcticus 0atrechisibus antarcticus 0awater loss 0adesiccation resistance 0aoopterus soledadinus 0ahydromedion sparsutum1 aBlock, W.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 Oct., v. 43, no. 10 p.905-913x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02628naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008800126300001600214520127400230650002001504650001701524650002001541650002301561650001601584650002001600650002701620650002601647650002101673650002201694650002201716650001401738650002201752653001101774653001501785653002801800653002001828700001701848700002201865700001201887700001601899700001301915700002201928700001901950773008701969852000902056930003302065945001302098946001102111655001202122IND2123407920221116212706.0980616e199709  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212340792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeath, R.L.10aProteinase inhibitors from Nicotiana alata enhance plant resistance to insect pests  ap. 833-842.  aThe ornamental tobacco (Nicotiana alata) produces one 6-kDa chymotrypsin inhibitor and four 6-kDa trypsin inhibitors from a single 40.3-kDa precursor protein. Three different approaches have been used to assess the potential of these proteinase inhibitors (PIs) in insect control. The first was an in-vitro approach in which all five inhibitors, the single chymotrypsin inhibitor or three of the four trypsin inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit gut protease activity in insects from four orders. The second approach was to incorporate the N. alata PIs in the artificial diet of the native budworm (Helicoverpa punctigera) and the black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus). H. punctigera larvae and T. commodus nymphs had a significant (P < 0.01) reduction in growth after ingestion of the PI and were more lethargic than insects on the control diet. Several of the H. punctigera larvae also failed to complete moulting at the third or fourth instar. The third approach was to express the N. alata PIs in transgenic tobacco under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter. When H. punctigera larvae were fed tobacco leaves expressing the N. alata PIs at 0.2% soluble protein, significant (P < 0.01) differences in mortality and/or growth rate were observed. 3aNicotiana alata 3ainsect pests 3apest resistance 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aproteinases 3aenzyme activity 3aHelicoverpa punctigera 3aTeleogryllus commodus 3aartificial diets 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atransgenic plants 3amortality 3asublethal effects 0agrowth 0ainhibition 0achymotrypsin inhibitors 0agut proteinases1 aMcDonald, G.1 aChristeller, J.T.1 aLee, M.1 aBateman, K.1 aWest, J.1 aVan Heeswijck, R.1 aAnderson, M.A.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.833-842x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02752naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245015100124300001600275500001500291520160200306650002201908650002101930650002301951650001301974650002401987650002002011650001602031650002002047650001302067650002502080653001702105653001602122653001202138700001902150700002002169773008702189852000902276930003302285945001302318946001102331655001202342IND2123394920221116212445.0980616e199710  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212339492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, K.Y.10aFurther evidence that diapause in the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, is regulated by ecdysteroids: a comparison of diapause and nondiapause strains  ap. 897-903.  a2019-12-05  aA nondiapause strain of the gypsy moth offers an additional tool for evaluating the regulation of diapause in this species. Patterns of protein expression in the gut and gut enzyme activity distinguished the two strains. Synthesis of a 55 kDa gut protein, previously linked to diapause, began 14 days after oviposition in both the diapause (D) and nondiapause (ND) strains. Though synthesis of this protein persisted in the D strain, its synthesis decreased after day 18 in the ND strain. In the D strain, activity of the proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, aminopeptidase) and esterase remained low, while activity of all of these enzymes increased dramatically in the ND strain 1820 days after oviposition. By contrast, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was high in both strains 15-17 days after oviposition, activity remained high in the D strain but in the ND strain activity then decreased. Patterns of ALP zymograms were similar in the two strains on day 15, but later a band of high mobility appeared only in the D strain. When 20-hydroxyecdysone was added to hanging drop cultures containing ND pharate larvae 15 days after oviposition, the larvae assumed the characteristics of diapause larvae: the 55 kDa gut protein was synthesized, the ALP zymogram revealed the characteristic diapause pattern, and they failed to ingest culture medium. The fact that 20-hydroxyecdysone could elicit these responses in ND individuals further supports previous results indicating that ecdysteroids promote the induction and maintenance of the pharate larval diapause in this species. 3aprotein synthesis 3aLymantria dispar 3astrain differences 3adiapause 3ahormonal regulation 3adigestive tract 3aecdysterone 3aenzyme activity 3aisozymes 3aalkaline phosphatase 0aecdysteroids 0agut enzymes 0aenzymes1 aValaitis, A.P.1 aDenlinger, D.L.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 Oct., v. 43, no. 10 p.897-903x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01756naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009100125300001600216520087900232650002801111650002401139650001401163650001401177650001901191650001401210653001001224653002601234700001801260773008601278852000901364930003301373945001301406946001101419655001201430IND2090628020221116212434.0980522e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209062802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProwse, N.14aThe effects of reproduction on longevity and fertility in male Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 501-512.  aWe examined the effect of reproduction on subsequent survival and fecundity of male Drosophila melanogaster by reversing the reproductive status of individuals part-way through life. Reproduction had a much more marked effect on fertility than survival: males with a history of reproduction showed complete sterility at a time when upwards of 80% of their cohort were still alive. Analyses of survival rates alone gave a misleading measure of the impact of ageing. Sterility appeared to be attributable mainly to a reduction in sperm count. Early reproduction caused permanent, irreversible damage to both survival and fecundity, with risk playing an apparently minor role. Individual differences in frailty appeared to be of little consequence for the interpretation of these reversal experiments, although its possible occurrence made definite detection of risk difficult. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3asexual reproduction 3alongevity 3amortality 3amale fertility 3afecundity 0aaging 0acosts of reproduction1 aPartridge, L.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 June, v. 43, no. 6 p.501-512x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03212naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012500124300001600249500001500265520193700280650002402217650001602241650001502257650001702272650002002289650001802309650001502327650003202342650002402374650001502398650001602413650001102429653002202440653001302462653002502475653002902500653001102529653001802540700001502558700001702573773008602590852000902676930003302685945001302718946001102731655001202742IND2090629220221116212614.0980522e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209062922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrbic, M.10aCaste formation in the polyembryonic wasp Copidosoma floridanum (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae): in vivo and in vitro analysis  ap. 553-565.  a2019-12-05  aThe polyembryonic wasp Copidosoma floridanum produces two morphologically distinct types of larvae in its host Trichoplusia ni. Reproductive larvae consume the host, pupate, and form adult wasps, whereas precocious larvae manipulate the sex ratios of the reproductive caste and defend the brood against interspecific competitors. Previous study indicated that morphogenesis of the reproductive caste was associated with a 9-day competency period, and that ecdysteroids of host origin were required for completion of embryogenesis. Here we investigated whether factors associated with the host environment mediate morphogenesis of precocious larvae and caste determination. Embryogenesis of precocious larvae was found to be synchronized with specific stages of the host first-fourth instars. However, development of precocious larvae did not depend on environmental factors specifically associated with these host stages. Elevation of the host juvenoid titer using the analogue methoprene induced T. ni to undergo a supernumerary sixth instar, but did not alter the proportion of wasp embryos that developed into precocious and reproductive larvae. In contrast, embryos competent to initiate morphogenesis developed into precocious larvae when transplanted into novel host stages such as pupae. Development of precocious larvae was arrested by ablation of the host's source of ecdysteroids, but could be rescued dose-dependently by injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone. In vitro rearing studies confirmed that completion of embryogenesis of the precocious caste required an exogenous pulse of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Combined with previous studies, our results indicate that embryos forming precocious and reproductive larvae acquire the competence to undergo morphogenesis at different times. However, we find no evidence to suggest that caste determination is mediated by environmental factors associated with a specific stage of the host. 3acaste determination 3aparasitoids 3adimorphism 3apolyembryony 3aTrichoplusia ni 3amorphogenesis 3aCopidosoma 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahormonal regulation 3amethoprene 3aecdysterone 3alarvae 0acaste polyphenism 0ain vitro 0adevelopmental stages 0amorphogenetic competence 0atiming 0aembryogenesis1 aRivers, D.1 aStrand, M.R.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 June, v. 43, no. 6 p.553-565x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03250naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009800125300001600223500001500239520221000254650001602464650001802480650001802498650002402516650001902540650001302559650001502572650001102587650002202598653002002620653001802640653001102658653001502669700001802684773008402702852000902786930003302795945001302828946001102841655001202852IND2180727520221116212313.0981030e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218072752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKremen, C.10aControl of pupal commitment in the imaginal disks of Precis coenia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)  ap. 287-296.  a2019-12-05  aWhen final (5th) instar larvae of Precis coenia were treated with the juvenile hormone analog (JHA) methoprene, they underwent a supernumerary larval molt, except for certain regions of their imaginal disks, which deposited a normal pupal cuticle. Evidently those regions had already become irreversibly committed to pupal development at the time JHA was applied. By applying JHA at successively later times in the instar, the progression of pupal commitment could be studied. Pupal commitment in the proboscis, antenna, eye, leg and wing imaginal disks occurred in disk-specific patterns. In each imaginal disk there were distinct initiation sites where pupal commitment began during the first few hours of the final larval instar, and from which commitment spread across the remainder of the disk over a 2- to 3-day period. The initiation sites were not always located in homologous regions of the various disks. As a rule, pupal commitment also spread from imaginal disk tissue to surrounding epidermal tissue. The regions of pupal commitment in all disks except those of the wings, coincided with the regions of growth of the disk. Only portions of the disk that had undergone cell division and growth underwent pupal commitment. Shortening the growth period did not prevent pupal commitment in the wing imaginal disk, indicating that, in this disk at least, a normal number of cell divisions was not crucial in reprogramming of disk cells for pupal cuticle synthesis. The apparent growth spurt of imaginal disks that occurs during the last part of the final larval instar is merely the final stage of normal and constant exponential growth. Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids appeared to play little role in the regulation of normal imaginal disk growth. Instead, growth of the disks may be under intrinsic control. Interestingly, even though endogenous fluctuation in JH titers do not affect imaginal disk growth, exogenous JHA proved able to inhibit both pupal commitment, cell movement, and growth of the disks during the last larval instar. This function of JH could be important under certain adverse conditions, such as when metamorphosis is delayed in favor of a supernumerary larval molt. 3aNymphalidae 3amorphogenesis 3acell division 3ahormonal regulation 3aanimal cuticle 3apupation 3amethoprene 3alarvae 3ajuvenile hormones 0atransplantation 0ametamorphosis 0agrowth 0ainhibition1 aNijhout, H.F.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1998 , v. 44, no. 3/4 p.287-296x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03547naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011500126300001600241500001500257520228800272650001502560650001602575650001702591650002202608650001802630650001802648650003202666650001002698650002402708650001202732650002302744653001402767653001802781653003002799653002802829653003202857700001702889700001502906700001802921773008402939852000903023930003303032945001303065946001103078655001203089IND2180727920221116212604.0981030e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218072792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, T.J.10aEffects of parasitization by Cotesia congregata on the brain-prothoracic gland axis of its host, Manduca sexta  ap. 323-332.  a2019-12-05  aThe ability of prothoracic glands (PTGs) from parasitized and unparasitized Manduca sexta 5th-instars to respond to ecdysiotropic extracts prepared from day-5 5th instar brains was compared. An in vitro bioassay revealed that PTGs from parasitized animals were much less responsive to brain PTTH than glands from unparasitized larvae. However, when incubated in Grace's medium in the absence of brain extract, glands from day-3 and -4 hosts remained active for a much longer period of time than did those dissected from their unparasitized counterparts. Rather than exhibiting reduced (basal) levels of synthesis after the 3rd hour of incubation, glands from these parasitized larvae continued to synthesize/release ecdysteroid into the medium at relatively high rates. The timing of this enhanced secretory activity is coincident with the ecdysteroid peak that occurs just prior to and during wasp emergence. Following parasite emergence, gland activity decreased, and by the third day after emergence, was reduced to low levels. Results suggest that the requirement for PTTH to stimulate ecdysteroid production has been bypassed, i.e. that the parasite has uncoupled the normal mechanisms that permit brain regulation of PTG activity. The ability of brains from parasitized M. sexta to stimulate PTGs from unparasitized day-2 5th instars was also examined. Dose-response analyses performed for the first 7 days of the 5th instar showed that on a per brain basis ecdysiotropic activity in brains from parasitized and unparasitized animals was similar. However, when differences in brain size were considered, ecdysiotropic activity appeared to be more concentrated in brains from day-7 parasitized larvae than in brains from similarly aged unparasitized larvae. Analysis of the size distribution of the ecdysiotropic activity in brains from parasitized larvae revealed a unique form that was larger than the 29 kDa standard. This suggests that parasitization may inhibit neuropeptide processing, particularly during the final stages preceding emergence of the wasps from the host. Thus, both an inhibition of prothoracicotropic hormone processing and the inability to respond to this neurohormone may contribute to the developmental arrest characteristic of parasitized 5th instars. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aecdysteroids 3ahormone secretion 3aManduca sexta 3aneuropeptides 3ahost-parasite relationships 3abrain 3ahormonal regulation 3aCotesia 3aprothoracic glands 0aparasites 0aecdysiotropin 0aparasites of insect pests 0aneuropeptide processing 0aprothoracicotropic hormones1 aGelman, D.B.1 aReed, D.A.1 aBeckage, N.E.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1998 , v. 44, no. 3/4 p.323-332x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02580naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015000126300001400276520151900290650002201809650002001831650002101851650001401872650001301886650001101899650001001910650002701920650001801947653001901965653001701984653001502001700001502016700001302031773008402044852000902128930003302137945001302170946001102183655001202194IND2164353120221116212415.0980929e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216435312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshiga, T.10aDevelopmental changes of storage proteins and biliverdin-binding proteins in the haemolymph and fat body of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura  ap. 67-76.  aThe concentrations of three storage proteins (SL-1,SL-2 and SL-3, hexamers of 70-80 kDa subunits) and two biliverdin-binding proteins (BP-A and BP-B, dimers of 165 kDa in the haemolymph and fat body during larval and pupal development of Spodoptera litura were determined by immunodiffusion tests using polyclonal antisera. SL-1 and SL-2 (methionine-rich) first appeared in the haemolymph of one-day-old sixth (final) instar larvae, prominently increased in the haemolymph during the later feeding period and were almost totally sequestered by the fat body after gut purge. SL-3 (arylphorin) was first detected in the haemolymph during the molting period to the final larval ecdysis, increased in concentration throughout the entire feeding period of the final larval instar and was partly sequestered by the fat body several hours later than the other storage proteins. BP-A showed nearly the same pattern in the haemolymph as SL-3: BP-B increased during feeding period and decreased during molting period and attained a maximum level during the penultimate larval instar, however its concentration decreased considerably and remained low in the final larval instar. BP-A was partly and BP-B was almost totally sequestered by the fat body 8 h after sequestration of SL-1 and SL-2, rendering the fat body blue in colour. These facts suggest an additional function of biliverdin-binding proteins as amino acid storage proteins and the results show a differential uptake mechanism for these proteins by the fat body. 3aSpodoptera litura 3aanimal proteins 3abinding proteins 3ahemolymph 3afat body 3alarvae 3apupae 3abiological development 3ametamorphosis 0aprotein uptake 0afluctuations 0abiliverdin1 aMaruta, K.1 aTojo, S.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1998 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.67-76x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02538naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010300126300001600229500001500245520137800260650002001638650002001658650002401678650003101702650002501733650002001758650001701778650001401795650002901809653001401838653001401852653001501866653001401881700001401895700001601909700001401925700001301939773008601952852000902038930003302047945001302080946001102093655001202104IND2060681620221116212106.0971126e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206068162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiesner, A.10aIsolated apolipophorin III from Galleria mellonella stimulates the immune reactions of this insect  ap. 383-391.  a2019-12-05  aApolipophorin III (apoLp-III) was isolated from the haemolymph of last instar larvae of Galleria mellonella. The ultraviolet (u.v.) spectrum and the N-terminal amino acid sequence reveal high similarities with the apoLp-III from Manduca sexta. The protein is heat-stable. The molecular mass of apoLp-III was determined to be 18 077 Da using mass spectrometry. The heat treatment (90 degrees C, 30 min) resulted in a pI shift from 6.6 for the non-heated to 6.1 for the heat-treated apoLp-III without change in the molecular mass, indicating that a conformational change might have been caused by the heat treatment, rather than covalent alterations. Intrahaemocoelic injection of pure apoLp-III into last instar G. mellonella larvae is followed by a dose-dependent increase of antibacterial activity in cell-free haemolymph of treated larvae 24 h after injection. Furthermore, pure apoLp-III enhances the phagocytic activity of isolated haemocytes in vitro. The newly discovered role of apoLp-III in inducing immune-related functions in insects is discussed in regard to the known features of this molecule in lipid metabolism. Arylphorin, another heat-stable protein in G. mellonella haemolymph, was likewise isolated in this study. The protein was identified by N-terminal protein sequencing, the sequence obtained exactly matches the known sequence data for this protein. 3aapolipoproteins 3aanimal proteins 3aGalleria mellonella 3aphysicochemical properties 3aamino acid sequences 3aimmune response 3aphagocytosis 3ahemocytes 3aantibacterial properties 0ahemolymph 0ainduction 0aarylphorin 0aisolation1 aLosen, S.1 aKopacek, P.1 aWeise, C.1 aGotz, P.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.383-391x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02673naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013200126300001600258500001500274520141800289650002001707650001601727650001501743650001601758650001801774650002001792650003201812650001201844650001101856650001801867650002701885650001601912653001501928653001401943653003001957653002001987653002702007653001102034700001802045773008602063852000902149930003302158945001302191946001102204655001202215IND2060681820221116212259.0971126e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206068182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlleyne, M.10aParasitism-induced effects on host growth and metabolic efficiency in tobacco hornworm larvae parasitized by Cotesia congregata  ap. 407-424.  a2019-12-05  aParasitism by the braconid wasp Cotesia congregata affects the growth of Manduca sexta larvae in a parasitoid 'dose-dependent' fashion. Following parasitization of fourth-instar larvae, more heavily parasitized larvae grew larger compared to those containing fewer parasitoids due to an increase in host dry weight. The differences in host mass appeared to arise after oviposition. A 'dose-dependent' enhancement of host dry weight would appear nutritionally beneficial for the parasitoids developing in more 'crowded' hosts. The efficiencies of conversion of ingested and digested food to body mass and the approximate digestibility of the diet ingested by the host caterpillar did not vary significantly with clutch size although parasitoids took slightly longer to develop in the more heavily parasitized hosts. Larval parasitoids developing in the presence of many competitors weighed up to 50% less than those developing in hosts with fewer endoparasitoids, although the weight of adult female parasitoids did not vary significantly with wasp clutch size. The maximum number of emerging wasps was 200 parasitoids, possibly representing the host's 'carrying capacity' for larvae parasitized in the fourth-instar. The ratio of emerging to non-emerging parasitoids decreased as parasitoid clutch size increased, with few or none emerging from very heavily parasitized hosts containing more than 400 parasitoids. 3asuperparasitism 3aparasitoids 3ametabolism 3afood intake 3aManduca sexta 3afood conversion 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aCotesia 3alarvae 3adigestibility 3abiological development 3aclutch size 0aparasitism 0aparasites 0aparasites of insect pests 0aparasitoid load 0ahost growth inhibition 0agrowth1 aBeckage, N.E.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.407-424x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02316naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013400126300001600260520121600276650002501492650001101517650001201528650001301540650001901553650002201572650001701594650001601611653001101627653002301638653001201661653001201673700001701685700001801702700001701720700001801737773008501755852000901840930003301849945001301882946001101895655001201906IND2061229320221116212414.0980113e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206122932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGadenne, C.10aOccurrence of non-stationary larval moults during diapause in the corn-stalk borer, Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 425-431.  aLast-instar larvae of the corn stalk borer, Sesamia nonagrioides (Lep.: Noctuidae), enter a facultative diapause under short photoperiods. In this noctuid, diapause development is characterized by the ability of larvae to perform several larval moults (up to seven) before pupation. Surprisingly, these supernumerary moults were not stationary and larval growth did occur as shown by growth in head-capsule width and weight of diapausing larvae. These heavy diapause larvae produced heavier pupae than non-diapausing strains. The number of supernumerary moults varied for insects, although they were reared under the same conditions. Pupal weight of diapause larvae was independent of the number of supernumerary moults performed. Using a radiochemical assay, we show that corpora allata from Sesamia nonagrioides larvae produced juvenile hormone (JH) -III, JH-II and their respective diols and acids. Although corpora allata of day-4 diapause-destined larvae exhibited the same biosynthetic pattern, no labelled products could be detected in the incubation medium containing corpora allata from non-diapausing larvae of the same age. Biosynthetic activity of the corpora alata was detected throughout diapause. 3aSesamia nonagrioides 3alarvae 3amolting 3adiapause 3acorpora allata 3ajuvenile hormones 3abiosynthesis 3ametabolites 0agrowth 0asupernumerary molt 0ajh acid 0ajh diol1 aDufour, M.C.1 aRossignol, F.1 aBecard, J.M.1 aCouillaud, F.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 May, v. 43, no. 5 p.425-431x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01758naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010800126300001600234500001500250520080000265650001401065650002201079650001301101650000901114650001401123650002301137653002201160653001701182653002001199653001301219700001301232773008501245852000901330930003301339945001301372946001101385655001201396IND2061229720221116212103.0980113e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206122972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevetak, D.10aSubstrate vibration sensitivity of the leg scolopidial organs in the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea  ap. 433-437.  a2019-12-05  aThe threshold sensitivity of the leg-vibration receptors of the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea, was investigated electro-physiologically. The legs were stimulated by sinusoidal vibrations. Summed responses from the leg nerve fibres of different legs do not differ much. In each leg there are two scolopidial organs which respond to vibration. The most sensitive--the subgenual organ--shows maximum sensitivity in the frequency range 1.5-2 kHz and a displacement threshold near 0.2 nm, corresponding to an acceleration of about 0.03 ms-2. The other is the femoral chordotonal organ with maximum sensitivity at about 1 kHz and the threshold between 0.1 and 1 ms-2. After ablation of both scolopidial organs, only responses of non-scolopidial organs persist, very probably campaniform sensilla. 3avibration 3aelectrophysiology 3asensilla 3alegs 3areceptors 3aChrysoperla carnea 0achordotonal organ 0asense organs 0asubgenual organ 0aablation1 aAmon, T.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 May, v. 43, no. 5 p.433-437x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01705naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005000127300001600177500001500193520093200208650002501140650001101165650001401176650001401190653001001204700001601214773010501230852000901335930003301344945001301377946001301390655001201403IND2038646320221116213245.0940411e199311  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203864632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, W.E.10aVariable-dimension livestock restraining cage  ap. 549-552.  a2019-12-05  aHandling livestock can be a hazardous and frustrating operation especially when access to the animal is required for procedures such as pregnancy testing of cattle or other reproductive examinations. A handling facility that gently restrains the animal in an adjustable dimension cage can contribute to a smooth operation and increased safety for the operator as well as the animal. A system was designed to mechanically adjust the width of the cage and the position of the front restraint so the cage precisely fits the animal and positions the animal against the leg bar at the rear of the cage. The width and position can be changed over the entire span of each motion control device and can be adjusted for each animal after the animal is in place. The system has been tested at the Fort Keogh Livestock and Range Research Laboratory. Cattle are handled easily with a minimum of stress and the controls are easy to operate. 3arestraint of animals 3adesign 3alivestock 3acage size 0acages1 aShort, R.E.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1993 Nov., v. 9, no. 6 p.549-552wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01409naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245005500124300001600179520052900195650002100724650002300745650001100768650001800779653002400797653001000821653003500831700001400866700001600880700001500896773009200911852000901003930003301012945001301045946001301058655001201071IND2044806520221116212955.0950224e199411  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204480652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLague, C.10aWide-span boom for band-spreading of liquid manure  ap. 759-763.  aWe designed, constructed. and tested a 28.2 m (92.5 ft) wide boom for precise application of liquid manure onto growing crops.

Traction performance variables and maximum pulling capacity were measured on forested and haul road surfaces. Little difference in maximum pulling capacity was found among the four widest tire combinations tested: 68X50-32s, dual 68 X 43-25s, dual 30.5L-32s, all bias-ply construction, and 68 X 68-25 radial-ply tires. Single 28L-26s and 68 X 43-25s operated at two different inflation pressures had the lowest maximum pulling capacity, but the results for the 68 X 43-25s appeared to be biased because of wet site conditions. A net traction-slip model was presented and its parameters estimated using regression. Results indicated that the model accounted for a large proportion of the variability in the net traction/slip data but tended to overpredict net traction at low and high slip and underpredict at intermediate slip. Tire width did not appear to influence the model parameters consistently. The test surface, however, did affect bias-ply tire performance, with the field surface tending to lower the rate at which net traction ratio approached its maximum value, indicating lower tractive efficiency. This was not true for the radial-ply tires, which appeared to be as efficient on either surface. 3askidders 3atires 0aperformance testing 0atraction1 aStokes, B.J.1 aWilhoit, J.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1993 Nov., v. 9, no. 6 p.571-576x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03788naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010800147300001800255500001500273520171200288650001602000650001302016650002902029650002102058650000902079650001702088650001902105650002702124650002002151650001802171650004102189650001202230650005302242650003002295650004102325650001702366650002902383650003702412650006102449650004302510650004302553650000902596650002402605650004802629650003002677650002902707650001802736650004002754650002202794650002702816653001202843653003402855700001402889700001702903700002402920700001702944773008502961852000903046930003303055945001303088946001303101655001203114IND2330898020221116213048.0030220e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233089802DNAL7 a124874402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeBlanc, J.G.10aImmunomodulating effects of peptidic fractions issued from milk fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus  ap. 2733-2742.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of peptides released during the fermentation of milk on the humoral immune system and on fibrosarcoma growth was studied. Lactobacillus helveticus was able to release peptidic compounds during milk fermentation due to its high proteolytic activity, as was shown by the degree of proteolysis and size-exclusion HPLC elution profiles. Three fractions of these compounds were separated and fed to mice during different periods (2, 5, and 7 d). The humoral immune response was assessed by following the number of IgA-secreting cells, and the antitumor activity was monitored by studying the regression of subcutaneously implanted fibrosarcomas. Feeding during 2 and 7 d with the medium-sized fraction (Fraction II) significantly increased the IgA-producing cells in the intestines, whereas feeding with the large compound fraction (Fraction I) during 5 d and the small compound fraction (Fraction III) during all three feeding periods provided similar increases. A double dose of Fraction II showed the highest IgA-producing cell count. The increase by Fraction III was shown to be caused by the presence of L-Tryptophan. Fraction II significantly decreased the size of fibrosarcoma when previously fed during 7 d, and feeding with Fraction I during 5 d decreased significantly its size after 35 d of growth. Although the mechanisms by which lactic acid bacteria enhance the immune system are not clear, this study clearly shows that bioactive compounds released in fermented milks contribute to the immunoenhancing and antitumor properties of these products. The release of bioactive peptides by lactic acid bacteria can have important implications on the modulation of the cellular immune response. 3aproteolysis 3apeptides 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aimmunoglobulin A 3amice 3afibrosarcoma 3afermented milk 3acultured milk starters 3asmall intestine 3aB-lymphocytes 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aB-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFermentation 2aFibrosarcomaximmunology 2aImmunity, Cellularxdrug effects 2aImmunoglobulin A, Secretoryxbiosynthesisxdrug effects. 2aLactobacillusximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aLymphoid Tissuexcytologyximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMilkximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMilk Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aParticle Size 2aPeptidesximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aTryptophanximmunology 0asarcoma 0anonspecific immunostimulation1 aMatar, C.1 aValdez, J.C.1 aLeblanc, J.q(Jean)1 aPerdigon, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2733-2742x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03199naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245013100146300001800277520183800295650001502133650001302148650002302161650002102184650002702205650001702232650002002249650002002269650001602289650001202305650003402317650001502351650001102366650000902377650003102386650004202417650002002459650001102479651001002490651001002500700002602510700001602536773008502552852000902637930003302646945001302679946001302692655001202705IND2327717320221116213035.0020625e200111  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232771732DNAL7 a117680992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamore, A.B.10aImpact of area and sire by herd interaction on heritability estimates for somatic cell count in Italian Holstein Friesian cows  ap. 2555-2559.  aThe aim of the paper was to estimate variance components for somatic cell scores for Italian Holsteins using data from three different areas of the country. A total of 2,202,804 first-parity test-day records, collected from 1990 to 1997 in three areas of Italy (Mantova, Milano, and Parmigiano cheese area), were available for study. The areas differ in herd size, feeding systems and especially in milk use. A minimum standard of quality is also required by some specific methods of cheese production, as for example from the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese chain. These reasons, taken together, affect the attention given to the quality of milk production in herds, and, therefore, to the sanitation levels. A pedigree file was extracted from the national database of Holstein Friesian breed. For computational reasons, eight samples of the data were extracted per area. Variance components were estimated by sample using two different test-day repeatability models. The first model included fixed effects of herd-test date, days in milk (30-d intervals) and calving month, and random effects of permanent environment, additive genetic and residual error. Estimated heritabilities in the first model ranged from 0.06 to 0.09 and repeatabilities from 0.36 to 0.45. Only small differences were detected among areas. In the second model, a random sire x herd interaction effect was added. Including the sire x herd effect resulted in heritability estimates ranging between 0.05 and 0.08 and repeatabilities from 0.35 to 0.45. The analysis revealed that only a small fraction of the total variance (0.35 to 1.5%) could be explained by sire x herd interaction effect. Based on this research, it appears that parameter estimates for somatic cell count do not differ by region, and inclusion of a sire x herd interaction effect is unnecessary. 3adairy cows 3aHolstein 3asomatic cell count 3agenetic variance 3ageographical variation 3aheritability 3asire evaluation 3alactation stage 3adairy herds 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCell Count 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMastitis, Bovinexgenetics 2aMilkxcytologyxsecretionxstandards. 2aModels, Genetic 2aParity 3aItaly 0aItaly1 aArendonk, J.A.M. van.1 aGroen, A.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.2555-2559x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02803naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245013100148300001800279520124900297650001501546650001301561650001001574650002301584650001701607650002101624650002001645650002301665650001801688650002301706650001401729650001201743650001301755650003401768650001501802650001101817650003801828650000901866650006101875650003101936650001901967650002301986700001802009700001702027700001802044700001702062700001702079773008502096852000902181930003302190945001302223946001302236655001202249IND2327717220221116213151.0020625e200111  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232771722DNAL7 a117680982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChrystal, M.A.10aHeritability of teat-end shape and the relationship of teat-end shape with somatic cell score for an experimental herd of cows  ap. 2549-2554.  aTeat-end shapes were categorized for 1443 Holstein cows with 3582 lactations, in the Iowa State University herd at Ankeny, approximately 40 d postpartum between 1970 and 1995. Frequencies of teat-end shapes were as follows: round, 52.2%; prolapsed, 0.8%; flat, 14.2%; plate, 3.4%; funnel, 8.9%; and mixed, 20.5%. Cows were coded as mixed if all four teat-end shapes were not the same. Heritability estimates were obtained with an animal model with pedigrees traced back to registration numbers roughly conforming to birth year 1955. The heritability estimates for first, second, and third and later lactations were 34, 21, and 13%, respectively. Lactation averages for linear somatic cell scores were adjusted for days in milk, and month and age at calving, and were available for 255 cows with 431 lactations categorized from 1992 to 1995. Frequencies of teat-end shape on the 255 cows were as follows: round, 58%; prolapsed, 3%; flat, 11%; plate, 2%; funnel, 6%; and mixed, 20%. Least-squares means of somatic cell score for categories of teat-end shape were computed from a mixed model that included year, parity, and teat-end shape as fixed effects and cow as a random effect. Teat-end shape did not significantly affect somatic cell score. 3adairy cows 3aHolstein 3ateats 3asomatic cell count 3aheritability 3alactation number 3abovine mastitis 3agenetic resistance 3agenetic trend 3aselection criteria 3aphenotype 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCell Count 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aMale 2aMammary Glands, Animalxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aMastitis, Bovinexgenetics 2aMilkxcytology 2aModels, Biological1 aSeykora, A.J.1 aHansen, L.B.1 aFreeman, A.E.1 aKelley, D.H.1 aHealey, M.H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.2549-2554x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03140naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008300145300001800228500001500246520130900261650001901570650001401589650003101603650001501634650002301649650001701672650001801689650001901707650002801726650001601754650001501770650001601785650000901801650001301810650001601823650002401839650001801863650001601881650001201897650003601909650001501945650005801960650001102018650001902029650001102048650002802059650002002087650003202107650002802139650001802167650001102185653001502196653001502211653002502226653000902251653002102260700002002281773008502301852000902386930003302395945001302428946001302441655001202454IND2330903620221116212857.0030220e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233090362DNAL7 a124874652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, P.W.10aInfluence of particle size on the effectiveness of the fiber in alfalfa silage  ap. 3000-3007.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective was to determine the influence of alfalfa silage particle length on milk yield, milk composition, and chewing activity. Sixteen multiparous lactating Holsteins were used in each of two separate feeding trials over a 2-yr period providing two repetitions. Each trial was based on 4 x 4 Latin squares with 21-d periods. All four diets (2-yr average, dry basis) contained a basal level of 10.7% neutral detergent fiber from corn silage and 2.3% neutral detergent fiber from chopped alfalfa-grass hay. One of the diets served as a low forage, low fiber control and contained only the basal forages. The other three diets contained an additional 8.6% neutral detergent fiber from coarser alfalfa silage, finely re-chopped alfalfa silage or an equal mixture of the two. An increase in the forage content above the basal amount using alfalfa silage increased 4% fat-corrected milk yield, milk fat yield and concentration, eating time, and total chewing time. Dry matter intake was not influenced by diet. Linear increases in rumination and total chewing times were observed as the mean particle size of the alfalfa silage increased from finer to coarser. There was no linear effect of alfalfa silage particle size on milk yield, 4% fat-corrected milk yield, dry matter intake, or milk composition. 3amilk fat yield 3aingestion 3aparticle size distribution 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aconcentrates 3afiber content 3aalfalfa silage 3amilk protein percentage 3amastication 3arumination 3achop length 3acorn 3aduration 3afeed intake 3amilk fat percentage 3aparticle size 3acorn silage 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDetergents 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEating 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aMasticationxphysiology 2aMedicago sativa 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aParticle Size 2aSilage 0adry matter 0amilk yield 0achemical composition 0adiet 0amilk composition1 aArmentano, L.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.3000-3007x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03081naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245011800143300001800261520143500279650000901714650001101723650002201734650002201756650002301778650001501801650002401816650001201840650002301852650001901875650001101894650002801905650001201933650001301945650002701958650004001985650001902025650001102044650003702055650002202092650004302114650002802157650002302185650003302208650001702241651001402258653001702272700001602289700001802305700001502323773008502338852000902423930003302432945001302465946001302478655001202491IND2330901120221116213116.0030220e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233090112DNAL7 a124874552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNudda, A.14aThe yield and composition of milk in Sarda, Awassi, and Merino sheep milked unilaterally at different frequencies  ap. 2879-2884.  aSarda (n = 8), Awassi (n = 8), and Merino (n = 8) ewes were subjected unilaterally to once-daily milking (ODM) or twice daily milking (TDM) to test the hypothesis that the two breeds highly selected for milk production (Sarda and Awassi) would not respond as much to a change in the frequency of milking as the Merino, a wool sheep that has not been selected for dairy production. Milk composition and somatic cell count (SCC) were also assessed to determine if the changes in milking frequency affected milk quality. Milk yield was 24% and 18% lower in ODM udder halves than TDM udder halves in Sarda and Awassi breeds, respectively. The yield loss due to ODM was similar to that observed in Merino ewes (23%) and did not support our hypothesis. Fat content did not differ significantly in any breeds between ODM and TDM udder halves. Protein content was higher in the milk of ODM than TDM udder halves in Sarda and Merino ewes. The SCC was influenced by milking treatment only in the Sarda ewes, with high values observed in the milk of ODM udder halves. The same trend was observed in the Awassi and Merino breeds, but the differences were not significant. The effects on milk yield, composition, and SCC caused by ODM were completely reversed when TDM was resumed. This suggests that in sheep flocks the milk yield losses due to short-time suppression of one daily milking, for example, on festive days, are low and temporary. 3aewes 3aAwassi 3amilking frequency 3abreed differences 3aselection criteria 3amilk yield 3amilk fat percentage 3alactose 3asomatic cell count 3amilk secretion 3aMerino 3aSardinian (sheep breed) 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aDairyingxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLactosexanalysis 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretionxstandards. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSheepxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 3aAustralia 0ahand milking1 aBencini, R.1 aMijatovic, S.1 aPulina, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2879-2884x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040608b00000000c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03525naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245011700151300001800268500001500286520175000301650001502051650001902066650002302085650001602108650001802124650001402142650001502156650001702171650001602188650001402204650001602218650001202234650003602246650002302282650002302305650004502328650001102373650002102384650002802405650002602433650003702459650002902496650004802525650002202573650003602595650004102631653001502672700001602687700001602703700002002719700001902739773008502758852000902843930003302852945001302885946001302898655001202911IND2330900120221116212718.0030220e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233090012DNAL7 a124874502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangsritavong, S.10aHigh feed intake increases liver blood flow and metabolism of progesterone and estradiol-17 beta in dairy cattle  ap. 2831-2842.  a2019-12-05  aIncreased liver blood flow (LBF) resulting from elevated feed intake in lactating dairy cows may increase steroid metabolism. Continuous infusion of bromosulphthalein (BSP; specifically metabolized in liver) was used to measure LBF. Similarly, progesterone (P4) and estradiol-17beta (E2) were administered by continuous infusion. Circulating concentrations at steady state were used to calculate the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of BSP, P4, and E2. Experiment 1: Variation in LBF was determined in thee nonlactating and four lactating cows over 3 d at 3 to 5 h after feeding. Coefficients of variation ranged from 14 to 31% among cows within day and from 4 to 8% within cows across days. Experiment 2: Six nonlactating cows were used in a 3 x 3 Latin-square design with three feed regimens: no feed, 0.5 maintenance diet (M), and 1.5 M. Experiment 3: Eight lactating cows were used in a 4 x 4 Latin-square design with four feed regimens: no feed, 0.5 M, 1.5 M, and 2.2 M. In experiments 2 and 3, LBF and MCR of P4 increased immediately after feed consumption and increases persisted longer at higher intakes. The LBF reached a maximum at 2 h after feeding and MCR of P4 reached maximum at 3 h after feeding with a positive correlation (r = 0.92) between LBF and MCR for P4. Experiment 4: A crossover design was used to determine MCR of E2 in unfed or full-fed lactating dairy cows. The MCR of E2 increased immediately after feeding and stayed elevated throughout the 4.5-h infusion period. Thus, LBF and steroid metabolism were acutely elevated by feed consumption in lactating and nonlactating cows. Higher rates of LBF and steroid metabolism in lactating than in nonlactating cows may indicate chronic effects of higher feed intakes as well. 3adairy cows 3aliver function 3asteroid metabolism 3ablood serum 3afeeding level 3alactation 3ablood flow 3aprogesterone 3afeed intake 3aestradiol 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aEatingxphysiology 2aEstradiolxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivation 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLiverxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aMetabolic Clearance Rate 2aProgesteronexmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRegional Blood Flowxphysiology 2aSulfobromophthaleinxdiagnostic use. 0adry period1 aCombs, D.K.1 aSartori, R.1 aArmentano, L.E.1 aWiltbank, M.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2831-2842x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03368naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245011800143300001800261520146700279650001501746650001701761650003501778650002201813650001301835650002101848650001601869650001701885650001701902650001601919650001601935650001201951650002301963650003301986650003702019650001102056650004102067650004102108650002602149650006502175650004102240650001402281650002402295650002202319650004702341653002502388700001802413700001502431700001402446700001802460700001902478700001902497700001502516700001502531700001902546773008502565852000902650930003302659945001302692946001302705655001202718IND2330899920221116213019.0030220e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233089992DNAL7 a124874492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassa, T.10aEffects of whole cottonseed diet and recombinant bovine somatotropin on ovarian follicles in lactating dairy cows  ap. 2823-2830.  aThe effects of whole cottonseed (WCS) in the diet and the administration of bovine somatotropin (bST) on ovarian follicular dynamics and plasma progesterone (P4) concentrations were examined in cows during a period of synchronized follicular growth. Lactating Holstein cows (n = 28) were randomly assigned to treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. Diets consisted of WCS (15% of dry matter) or no WCS, and bST at a dose of 0 or 208 mg/14 d. Dietary treatments began within 24 h of calving and bST treatments began within 7 d postpartum. Cows received GnRH at 65 +/- 3 d postpartum (d 0), PGF(2alpha) (d 7), a second dose of GnRH (d 9), and were inseminated 16 h later (d 10). Ovarian changes were monitored daily by ultrasonography from d 0 to 9. On d 9, 93% of cows had a preovulatory follicle and 86% ovulated. For Class 2 (6 to 9 mm) follicles, a diet x bST interaction was detected, with bST stimulating Class 2 follicles in cows fed WCS, but not in cows on the control diet. Neither diet nor bST affected numbers of Class 1 (2 to 5 mm) or Class 3 (greater than or equal to 10 mm) follicles or sizes of the subordinate and dominant follicles. During the luteal phase of the cycle, lactating cows fed WCS tended to have elevated concentrations of plasma P4, whereas bST was without effect. Plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased in cows fed WCS. Number and diameter of corpora lutea did not differ among treatments. 3adairy cows 3asomatotropin 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aovarian follicles 3adiameter 3afeed supplements 3adietary fat 3ablood plasma 3aprogesterone 3acholesterol 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCottonseed Oilxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexbloodxpharmacology. 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aLactationxphysiology 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effectsxphysiologyxultrasonography. 2aOvulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexblood 2aRandom Allocation 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbloodxpharmacology. 0asynchronized females1 aAmbrose, J.D.1 aAdams, Al.1 aRisco, C.1 aStaples, C.R.1 aThatcher, M.J.1 aVan Horn, H.H.1 aGarcia, A.1 aHead, H.H.1 aThatcher, W.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2823-2830x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03812naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245012700145300001800272500001500290520188300305650001502188650001202203650002002215650001102235650002202246650002402268650001402292650002102306650001602327650001002343650002002353650001102373650001802384650002802402650001202430650003602442650003602478650001102514650004102525650002602566650000902592650004702601650001102648650001402659650001902673650001202692650004002704650002802744650001702772651001402789653002602803653001902829653001502848700002402863700001802887700001902905700001802924700001902942773008502961852000903046930003303055945001303088946001303101655001203114IND2330899520221116212920.0030220e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233089952DNAL7 a124874472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSartori, R.10aFertilization and early embryonic development in heifers and lactating cows in summer and lactating and dry cows in winter  ap. 2803-2812.  a2019-12-05  aTwo experiments in two seasons evaluated fertilization rate and embryonic development in dairy cattle. Experiment 1 (summer) compared lactating Holstein cows (n = 27; 97.3 +/- 4.1 d postpartum [dpp]; 40.0 +/- 1.5 kg milk/d) to nulliparous heifers (n = 28; 11 to 17 mo old). Experiment 2 (winter) compared lactating cows (n = 27; 46.4 +/- 1.6 dpp; 45.9 +/- 1.4 kg milk/d) to dry cows (n = 26). Inseminations based on estrus included combined semen from four high-fertility bulls. Embryos and oocytes recovered 5 d after ovulation were evaluated for fertilization, embryo quality (1 = excellent to 5 = degenerate), nuclei/embryo, and accessory sperm. In experiment 1, 21 embryos and 17 unfertilized oocytes (UFO) were recovered from lactating cows versus 32 embryos and no UFO from heifers (55% vs. 100% fertilization). Embryos from lactating cows had inferior quality scores (3.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.3), fewer nuclei/embryo (19.3 +/- 3.7 vs. 36.8 +/- 3.0) but more accessory sperm (37.3 +/- 5.8 vs. 22.4 +/- 5.5/embryo) than embryos from heifers. Sperm were attached to 80% of UFO (17.8 +/- 12.1 sperm/UFO). In experiment 2, lactating cows yielded 36 embryos and 5 UFO versus 34 embryos and 4 UFO from dry cows (87.8 vs. 89.5% fertilization). Embryo quality from lactating cows was inferior to dry cows (3.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.3), but embryos had similar numbers of nuclei (27.2 +/- 2.7 vs. 30.6 +/- 2.1) and accessory sperm (42.0 +/- 9.4 vs. 36.5 +/- 6.3). From 53% of the flushings from lactating cows and 28% from dry cows, only nonviable embryos were collected. Thus, embryos of lactating dairy cows were detectably inferior to embryos from nonlactating females as early as 5 d after ovulation, with a surprisingly high percentage of nonviable embryos. In addition, fertilization rate was reduced only in summer, apparently due to an effect of heat stress on the oocyte. 3adairy cows 3aheifers 3aconception rate 3awinter 3arelative humidity 3aambient temperature 3alactation 3abody temperature 3aheat stress 3acells 3aembryo (animal) 3asummer 3aembryogenesis 3aartificial insemination 2aAnimals 2aCattlexembryologyxphysiology. 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Development 2aFemale 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMale 2aOocytesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aSeasons 2aSperm-Ovum Interactionsxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 2aTime Factors 3aWisconsin 0aaccessory spermatozoa 0aembryo quality 0adry period1 aSartor-Bergfelt, R.1 aMertens, S.A.1 aGuenther, J.N.1 aParrish, J.J.1 aWiltbank, M.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2803-2812x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03164naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009100128300001600219500001500235520184500250650002402095650001802119650001802137650001402155650002202169650002102191650001802212650002402230650002502254650002002279650001302299650002402312650001602336650002502352650002002377653002302397653001902420653002802439653001702467653002302484653002302507773008602530852000902616930003302625945001302658946001102671655001202682IND2054194820221116213039.0961125e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205419482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamashita, O.10aDiapause hormone of the silkworm, Bombyx mori: structure, gene expression and function  ap. 669-679.  a2019-12-05  aDiapause hormone (DH) is a neuropeptide hormone which is secreted from the suboesophageal ganglion (SG) and is responsible for induction of embryonic diapause of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. DH is isolated from SGs and determined to be a 24 amino acid peptide amide. The cDNA encodes the polyprotein precursor from which DH, pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) and three other neuropeptides are released to become mature. The C-terminal FXPRL-NH2 sequence of DH is essential but not sufficient, and the two N-terminal regions are needed as a complementary sequence for expression of full activity. The DH-PBAN gene is composed of 6 exons interrupted by 5 introns and is expressed in 12 neurosecretory cells of the SG. The incubation of eggs at 25 degrees C, which induced embryonic diapause in the progeny, caused DH-PBAN mRNA content to increase at 5 different stages in the life cycle. By contrast, a 15 degrees C incubation induced expression of the gene in the late pharate adult stage. The temperature-controlled expression of DH-PBAN gene is closely correlated to the incidence of diapause, indicating that DH-PBAN gene expression is the initial event leading to diapause induction. DH acts to stimulate trehalase activity in developing ovaries to bring about hyperglycogenism in mature eggs, a prerequisite for diapause initiation. The availability of synthetic DH and the trehalase cDNA clone facilitates the study of molecular mechanisms of DH action. Using in vivo and in vitro systems, DH clearly induces expression of the trehalase gene in developing ovaries. New protein synthesis is not needed for this process, but a Ca2+-dependent proteinkinase seems to be involved. Here, I review these topics to explore molecular mechanisms of diapause, a fundamental event that is critical for the success of insect life. 3amechanism of action 3aneurohormones 3amessenger RNA 3atrehalase 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aneuropeptides 3aambient temperature 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3adiapause 3ahormonal regulation 3aBombyx mori 3anucleotide sequences 3aenzyme activity 0aliterature reviews 0atrehalase gene 0amolecular sequence data 0adh-pban gene 0aembryonic diapause 0achemical structure0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1996 July, v. 42, no. 7 p.669-679x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02013naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010900130300001600239520095300255650001301208650002201221650001101243650001301254650001401267650001301281650002001294650002001314650002701334650001601361650002301377651001201400651001201412653002001424700001901444773008601463852000901549930003301558945001301591946001101604655001201615IND2054693020221116203921.0961231e199608  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205469302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcWatters, H.G.14aThe influence of each parent and geographic origin on larval diapause in the blow fly, Calliphora vicina  ap. 721-726.  aThe blow fly, Calliphora vicina R.-D. (Diptera: Calliphoridae), displays a larval diapause in response to short daylengths experienced by the adult female. The range of daylengths inducing diapause varies among geographic populations of fly and differences are genetic in origin, being maintained under laboratory conditions. The critical daylength for a southern, English strain is 14.5 hours of light and for a northern, Finnish strain is 16 hours. Crosses between these strains revealed that diapause incidence was produced entirely by maternal induction and was not influenced by the male. Diapause duration, in contrast, was affected by both parents; larvae with mothers of the northern strain and southern fathers entered diapause at the same rate as the pure bred northern larvae but emerged from it much more quickly. Thus diapause duration is a characteristic of the larvae themselves, influenced by the genetic background of both parents. 3acrossing 3aCalliphora vicina 3alarvae 3adiapause 3aincidence 3aduration 3amaternal effect 3apaternal effect 3ageographical variation 3aphotoperiod 3astrain differences 3aEngland 3aFinland 0agenetic effects1 aSaunders, D.S.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1996 Aug., v. 42, no. 8 p.721-726x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02973naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245016600129300001600295500001500311520165000326650001501976650001601991650001102007650001602018650002602034650001902060650002702079650001602106650001402122650001502136650001102151650002202162650001402184650002002198653001402218653003002232653001002262653001602272700001602288700001802304700001702322773008602339852000902425930003302434945001302467946001102480655001202491IND2054178520221116203633.0961122e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205417852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalgopal, M.M.10aParasitism by Microplitis demolitor induces alterations in the juvenile hormone titers and juvenile hormone esterase activity of its host, Pseudoplusia includens  ap. 337-345.  a2019-12-05  aMicroplitis demolitor is a polydnavirus-carrying parasitoid that attacks the larval stage of Pseudoplusia includens and other noctuids. Parasitism or injection of wasp components like polydnavirus and teratocytes has a juvenilizing effect on P. includens development. Here we measured hemolymph juvenile hormone (JH) titers and juvenile hormone esterase activity in P. includens larvae after parasitism or injection of wasp components. Results were compared to nonparasitized larvae. During the fifth stadium, JH titers of nonparasitized larvae fluctuated between 0.08 and 0.50 ng/ml, whereas titers in parasitized larvae never fell below 2 ng/ml. P. includens larvae injected with calyx fluid plus venom or calyx fluid plus venom and teratocytes exhibited JH titers intermediate between parasitized and nonparasitized larvae. Nonparasitized larvae exhibited two peaks of JH esterase activity. The first occurred between 12 and 48 h in association with cessation of larval feeding, while the second occurred immediately before pupation. In contrast, levels of JH metabolism remained at low levels in parasitized larvae and larvae injected with calyx fluid plus venom or calyx fluid, venom and teratocytes. Only trace amounts of JH were detected in in vitro assays of teratocytes or M. demolitor larvae suggesting neither released JH into the hemolymph of parasitized larvae. Although calyx fluid plus venom and teratocytes did not elevate JH titers to the levels measured in parasitized larvae, their effects on formation of larval-pupal intermediates by P. includens were similar to those generated by exogenous application of methoprene or JH. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3avenoms 3ateratocytes 3aMicroplitis demolitor 3aPolydnaviridae 3aPseudoplusia includens 3abody fluids 3ahemolymph 3amethoprene 3alarvae 3ajuvenile hormones 3aesterases 3aenzyme activity 0aparasites 0aparasites of insect pests 0acells 0acalyx fluid1 aDover, B.A.1 aGoodman, W.G.1 aStrand, M.R.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1996 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.337-345x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02239naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008600129300001600215520153400231650001901765650001101784650001301795653001301808773008601821852000901907930003301916945001301949946001101962655001201973IND2054189220221116203924.0961125e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205418922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorridge, G.A.14aThe relation between pattern and landmark vision of the honeybee (Apis mellifera)  ap. 373-383.  aThis is an exploratory study which takes advantage of a new method to study the difference between discrimination of patterns and the use of landmarks by honeybees. The experiments examine the transfer of black and white cues between two-dimensional patterns that are seen ahead by the bees, and lateral landmarks on the walls of tunnels through which they fly, and vice versa. The Y-choice apparatus, in which freely flying bees choose one of two targets from a fixed distance, was modified by adding, in each arm, a white paper tunnel followed by a transparent baffle, which controls the range at which the bees' choices are made. The results reveal that: (a) Bees can use both the distribution of black areas and the orientation of edges that they see on the side walls as they pass. So far as they were tested, the same visual features are used in landmarks as in targets. (b) The bees can immediately transfer the cues learned on tunnels to corresponding patterns on the targets, i.e. transfer forwards along their flight path, but not in the reverse direction. (c) New landmarks are learned in a few visits, sometimes even in one visit, but orientation cues on tunnels and targets take about 2 h to learn. (d) When trained on targets, they will not at first use the same cues on unfamiliar landmarks, but they rapidly learn to insert a new landmark into their flight path. The conclusion is that learning landmark locations and discriminating 2D patterns subtending < 45 degrees in forward vision have different mechanisms. 3aApis mellifera 3avision 3alearning 0apatterns0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1996 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.373-383x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02214naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015200128300001600280520120900296650001401505650002401519650002101543650001801564650001301582650001901595650002701614650002301641651001201664653002101676700001501697773008601712852000901798930003301807945001301840946001101853655001201864IND2054192920221116203749.0961125e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205419292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulson, S.J.10aSupercooling and survival of the beech leaf mining weevil Rhynchaenus fagi L.

Similar observations were made on naturally overwintering field populations. No weevil survived cooling to, or below the supercooling point. The mean supercooling point of weevils exposed to temperatures at, or below +2 degrees C, or sampled from the field, was consistently below -21 degrees C. When exposed to a constant +2 or -5 degrees C, mortality was low, at 10 and 12% after 168 and 126 days respectively. Mortality increased rapidly in weevils exposed to temperatures below -10 degrees C, with 48% survival after 112 days at -10 degrees C and only 25% after 84 days at -15 degrees C. None of the dead weevils had frozen. Periods spent at +2 degrees C in cycling treatments which included exposure at -10 or -15 degrees C, extended the duration of survival at the lower temperatures compared to constant exposures at these temperatures, but mortality was still more rapid than at a constant +2 degrees C. Survival of naturally overwintering insects was consistently high over three winters. 3amortality 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3aoverwintering 3aduration 3acold tolerance 3aenvironmental exposure 3asupercooling point 3aEngland 0arhynchaenus fagi1 aBale, J.S.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1996 July, v. 42, no. 7 p.617-623x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02055naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008300131300001800214500001500232520102700247650001501274650001501289650001501304650002301319650002101342650002101363650002401384650001701408650002801425650001501453653002001468653001301488700001501501773008501516852000901601930003301610945001301643946001301656655001201669IND2327715720221116203725.0020625e200111  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232771572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, C.J.C.14aThe effect on production and behavior of mixing uniparous and multiparous cows  ap. 2424-2429.  a2019-12-05  aThe production and behavior of a group of eight multiparous and eight uniparous cows after they were mixed were compared with unmixed groups of 16 multiparous and 16 uniparous cows. The cows grazed pasture (mean height 16 cm) in treatment groups in a daily paddock rotation. The milk yield of mixed cows was 3% less in the first week than cows in the unmixed groups, and 1% less in the 6 wk after mixing. The reduction in milk yield was similar for uni- and multiparous cows. Both uni- and multiparous cows in the mixed group grazed for less time and they stood for longer, particularly in the first week postmixing. The multiparous cows in the mixed group increased their pasture biting rate and became more dominant than the uniparous cows, who spent more time grooming other cows and in aggressive interactions compared with the unmixed group of uniparous cows. We concluded that the mixing of multi- and uniparous cows causes disruption to their grazing and social behavior, which results in a reduction in milk yield. 3adairy cows 3arumination 3aaggression 3arotational grazing 3alactation number 3asocial dominance 3amilk fat percentage 3abiting rates 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 0aanimal behavior 0agrooming1 aRind, M.I.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.2424-2429x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02808naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008600145300001800231500001500249520119800264650001501462650002801477650001801505650002601523650002301549650001501572650001401587650002501601650001901626650002001645650001201665650001101677650004701688650001101735650004101746650003501787650002801822650001401850650004201864650003401906650002201940653002401962653001201986700001701998700001502015700001402030700001602044700001702060773008502077852000902162930003302171945001302204946001302217655001202230IND2327715620221116203937.0020625e200111  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232771562DNAL7 a117680822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatts, J.L.10aPhylogenetic studies on Corynebacterium bovis isolated from bovine mammary glands  ap. 2419-2423.  a2019-12-05  aCoryneform bacteria are frequently isolated from bovine mastitis with the lipophilic species, and Corynebacterium bovis is the most frequently isolated organism of this group. However, previous studies on the phylogeny of corynebacteria have incorporated only a single reference strain. We examined the phylogeny of C. bovis using 47 strains isolated from bovine mammary glands. Phylogenetic studies were performed by direct sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA and comparison to sequences of reference strains. All strains identified as C. bovis demonstrated similarity of 98% or higher to the ribosomal RNA gene sequences of the type strain of C. bovis. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that all strains tested clustered with members of the Corynebacterium urealyticum group confirming that C. bovis is a legitmate member of the genus Corynebacterium. Further investigation into the diversity within the species using repetitive element palindrome PCR indicated only minor differences between the strains tested. Corynebacterium bovis ATCC 13722 demonstrated the highest similarity (95%) with Brevibacterium helvolum, indicating that this organism does not belong in the genus Corynebacterium. 3adairy cows 3ainterspecific variation 3aribosomal RNA 3aCorynebacterium bovis 3astrain differences 3aDNA probes 3aphylogeny 3anucleotide sequences 3amammary glands 3abovine mastitis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCorynebacteriumxclassificationxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmicrobiology 2aMastitis, Bovinexmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis 0aspecies differences 0astrains1 aLowery, D.E.1 aTeel, J.F.1 aDitto, C.1 aHorng, J.S.1 aRossbach, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.2419-2423x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02857naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013400125300001600259500001500275520157900290650001501869650002001884650001101904650001501915650002301930650001701953650002201970650001101992650002602003653001602029653002102045653001902066653001902085653002202104653001302126653002902139653002102168653001402189700001902203700001302222773008602235852000902321930003302330945001302363946001102376655001202387IND2054189520221116203642.0961125e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205418952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiesel, G.10aEffects of juvenile hormone and juvenile hormone analogues on the phase behaviour of Schistocerca gregaria and Locusta migratoria  ap. 385-395.  a2019-12-05  aPhase behaviour of Locusta migratoria and Schistocerca gregaria has been studied using animals kept isolated (representing the solitary phase) and reared under crowded conditions (representing the gregarious phase). Social aggregation (grouping), marching activity and aggression/flight behaviour (reactions to confrontation) were monitored separately in adults and/or hoppers of different larval stages. All three qualities of behaviour revealed characteristic and highly significant differences between isolated and crowded locusts. Effects of JH III and three JH analogues on the phase behaviour of crowded locusts have been analysed. Aggregation was significantly reduced by all compounds in a dose-dependent manner suggesting a "solitarization" effect and a rather direct implication of endogenous JH in this behavioural parameter. JH analogues had, surprisingly, a stimulating effect on the marching activity of crowded locusts. This might be caused by pharmacological side-effects of the JH analogues. Crowded locusts showed almost exclusively "weak" reactions to confrontation with decoy animals. After treatment with JH analogues, the test animals exerted more "strong" and less "weak" reactions, thus indicating a tendency towards "solitarization". Generally, L. migratoria was slightly less responsive than S. gregaria to the tested compounds. JH III was less effective than the JH analogues. The varying strength of impact which the compounds had upon the three behavioural qualities could reflect a differential involvement of endogenous JH in these parameters. 3afenoxycarb 3aanimal behavior 3alarvae 3aaggression 3aLocusta migratoria 3apolymorphism 3ajuvenile hormones 3aadults 3aSchistocerca gregaria 0aaggregation 0agregarious phase 0asolitarization 0asolitary phase 0amarching behavior 0acrowding 0ajuvenile hormone analogs 0aphase dimorphism 0aisolation1 aTappermann, S.1 aDorn, A.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1996 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.385-395x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02992naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245008100143300001800224500001500242520154100257650001301798650001701811650004401828650001101872650001401883650001901897650002001916650000901936650000701945650001601952650002801968650001201996650002202008650001102030650001102041650001502052650004502067650001302112650002002125650002402145650001602169653001102185653001802196653001102214700001802225700001302243700001702256773008502273852000902358930003302367945001302400946001302413655001202426IND2327714620221116203911.0020625e200111  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232771462DNAL7 a117680752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, T.14aThe liquid-state 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance study on microfiltrated milk  ap. 2357-2363.  a2019-12-05  aTo gain further insight into diversiform phosphorus in bovine milk, we separated skim milk into casein micelle and serum fractions by microfiltration and subjected them to liquid-state 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. As previously reported, the skim milk spectrum showed a broad and indistinct peak from phosphoserine residue (SerP) of casein. In the casein micelle spectrum, however, the SerP peak was more clearly observed with a phosphate peak that may be from micellar calcium phosphate (MCP). The serum spectrum was the same as skim milk spectrum, except for SerP peak. Furthermore, two types of casein micelle fractions, with 0.90 and 1.04 of [beta-casein + kappa-casein]/[alpha(s1)-casein + alpha(s2)-casein] ratios were generated by different temperature microfiltrations, occurring because beta-casein is released from the micelle at a low temperature. The shape of SerP peaks changed dramatically in both the casein micelle spectra, when the temperature dropped from 35 to 5 degrees C. Deconvolution analysis indicated that each SerP peak comprised the same set of four peaks. Half-width and composition discriminated between the two types of casein micelle fractions. As a consequence, there was significant interaction between casein micelle and milk serum, causing cloudiness of SerP in the liquid-state 31P-NMR spectrum of milk. Casein composition influenced the SerP-MCP interaction in micellar structure. Shape changing of the SerP peak was discussed in connection with beta-casein-release phenomenon. 3amicelles 3akappa-casein 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aserine 3askim milk 3aalphaS1-casein 3amicrofiltration 3awhey 3apH 3atemperature 3amilk protein percentage 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxanalysis 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aFiltration 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aMicelles 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPhosphorus Isotopes 2aTemperature 0acasein 0aphosphoserine 0aratios1 aHiramatsu, K.1 aOhba, T.1 aTsutsumi, A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.2357-2363x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02393naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008700126300001600213520133200229650003301561650002601594650001601620650001101636650001701647650002001664650001201684650001601696653001601712653001401728653001601742653001901758653001801777653002201795700002601817773008601843852000901929930003301938945001301971946001101984655001201995IND2054177620221116203340.0961122e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205417762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBressac, C.10aDrosophila subobscura females preferentially select long sperm for storage and use  ap. 323-328.  aDrosophila subobscura males produce short and long sperm. From a total of approx. 20,000 sperm transferred per copulation, 66% were short and 34% long. Thirty hours after copulation females had stored approx. 900 sperm in the receptacle and spermathecae. The remaining 19,000 sperm were eliminated from the uterus. Females preferentially selected the long sperm from the ejaculate for storage, but the percentages of long sperm were different in the two storage organs. In the receptacle 89% were long sperm and in the spermathecae 80%. While the ratio of short to long sperm in the receptacle was constant, the ratio varied in the spermathecae. After seven days of egg laying only one third of the initial amount of sperm remained in the storage organs. At this time the percentage of short sperm was higher than just after storage, indicating that long sperm were preferentially used for fertilization. We monitored the entire egg laying periods of females which mated once, counting all inseminated eggs; the number of hatched eggs each resulted from a fertilizing sperm. Additionally, we recorded those sperm which did not penetrate the egg but were found outside of the egg on the chorion. The sum of fertilizing sperm plus the sperm on the chorion (916) matched perfectly the mean number of stored sperm per female (915). 3afertilization (reproduction) 3aDrosophila subobscura 3aspermatozoa 3alength 3apolymorphism 3asperm transport 3astorage 3aspermatheca 0autilization 0aselection 0ashort sperm 0asperm transfer 0asperm storage 0asperm utilization1 aHauschteck-Jungen, E.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1996 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.323-328x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02935naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245014700172300001600319500013700335520143100472650002101903650001301924650002501937650001301962650002001975650001601995650001402011650001202025650002002037650001002057650001602067650001302083650001602096650001102112650002002123650001602143650001402159650001102173700002002184700001402204773013702218856005502355856004602410852000902456655001202465IND60662536820200429000000.0190905e20190710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066253682DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1242.622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJedrzejuk, A.10aProteolytic activity, identification and expression profile of a KDEL-CysEP gene in common lilac flowers depending on the flowering conditions  ap. 435-440.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Horticulture in Europe - SHE2016 held October 17-21 2016, Chania, Crete Greece  aIn a temperate zone, common lilac blooms in May, and the whole flowering process lasts ca. 3 weeks. The flowering process starts in July of the previous year, during winter flower buds are in the state of deep dormancy, and their activity starts again in the spring of the next year. Forcing is a method, that may induce flowering in plants, independently of the natural blooming period. The temperatures required to start blooming in lilac during standard forcing method in November are ca. 37°C. This method is rapid, but gives panicles of poor quality. The alternative is forcing at 15°C, but in November plants forced by this method require 49 days to bloom as compared to 23 days for the standard 37°C. Anyway, the main advantage of this method is a very good quality of flowers and long vase life. In this study we investigated the cysteine protease activity and its expression profile at different stages of flowering (flower bud whitening and swelling, open flowers, wilted flowers) for lilac flowers (Syringa vulgaris L.) blooming under three different conditions: natural conditions in May and forcing in a greenhouse in November at 37°C (standard forcing) or at 15°C (alternative forcing). The gene expression did not correlate with the cysteine endoprotease activity. Alternative forcing method at 15°C affected the flowering process delaying senescence, presumably due to the low cysteine protease activity. 3aSyringa vulgaris 3acysteine 3acysteine proteinases 3adormancy 3aenzyme activity 3aflower buds 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3apanicles 3aproteolysis 3aspring 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3avase life 3awinter1 aLukaszewska, A.1 aSerek, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1242 p.435-440dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1242.6240uhttps://handel.nal.usda.gov/10113/6625368  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245015900154300001600313500002400329520167400353650002502027650001702052650002302069650001502092650001002107650001102117650002302128650002302151650001402174650001102188650001802199650003302217650001102250650001102261650001002272651002002282700002602302773011502328852000902443856007602452655001202528IND4424385920221116203025.0090808s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442438592DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.11922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyle, Garreth10aFunctional trait differences between extant exotic, native and extinct native plants in the Hunter River, NSW: a potential tool in riparian rehabilitation  ap. 892-903.  aIncludes references  aRiparian and riverine systems around the world are subject to human mediated degradation. It is increasingly recognized that rehabilitation of these systems is important to retain biodiversity and important ecosystem services. Plant functional traits represent a potentially useful but underutilized tool in the restoration or rehabilitation of ecosystems such as riparian systems. This study uses a functional trait approach to provide insight into the changes in ecosystem function that have occurred with the loss of native plant species and their replacement by exotics. We examined the plant functional traits associated with extinct native, extant native and extant exotic species in the riparian margin of the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. Comparisons of 11 traits were conducted using univariate (analysis of variance and χ ²) and multivariate (principal component analysis and analysis of similarity) methods. Both extant native and extant exotic species had traits associated with a short lived, ruderal strategy: high specific leaf area (SLA), soft leaves, herbaceous growth forms and therophyte life form. In contrast, extinct native species had traits such as low SLA, tough leaves, tree and shrub growth form and phanerophyte life form. This shift in plant trait assemblages associated with the transition from a native to predominately exotic flora has important implications for ecosystem processes in this riverine system. We suggest that such a functional trait approach can be integrated with knowledge of other ecosystem components to provide an understanding of ecosystem function that can be used to guide rehabilitation initiatives. 3aanalysis of variance 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aflora 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aphanerophytes 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3ashrubs 3atrees 3aNew South Wales1 aLeishman, Michelle R.0 tRiver research and applications.g2009 Sept., v. 25, no. 7 p.892-903dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.11923Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02442naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142245010800162300001600270500002400286520136100310650003101671650001201702650001201714650001901726650002201745650001401767650001301781650002001794650001301814650001401827700002001841700002301861773010501884852000901989856008201998655001202080IND4424372720221116202709.0090808s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442437272DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2008001962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Cláudia14aThe role of extracellular polymers on Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm biomass and metabolic activity  ap. 363-370.  aIncludes references  aStaphylococcus epidermidis is now well established as a major nosocomial pathogen, associated with indwelling medical devices. Its major virulence factor is related with the ability to adhere to indwelling medical devices and form biofilms. In this study, the biofilm matrix of four S. epidermidis clinical isolates was extracted and the polysaccharides and proteins content was quantified. The results were correlated with the total biofilm biomass (determined by crystal violet assay) and cellular metabolic activity (evaluated with XTT reduction assay). According to the results, the exopolymers studied play an important role not only on structure and biofilm biomass but also on cellular activity. Thus, the strain forming biofilms with the highest level of polysaccharides (S. epidermidis 1457) also formed thicker biofilms but with the lowest metabolic activity. The protein concentration also varied among strains, with the biofilm matrix of S. epidermidis 9142 presenting a higher concentration of proteins comparing to the remaining strains. This fact indicates the different levels of importance that matrix proteins can hold on biofilm composition among strains albeit overall, it is suggested that extracellular protein production it is not a determinative factor for biofilm total biomass.

CZE separations were carried out in a propionate background electrolyte at a low pH (3.2) containing 18-crown-6-ether (18-crown-6) to reach a complete resolution of the cations. In addition, triethylenetetramine (TETA) coated the inner wall surface of the chip channels.

The synthetic dataset was required for the modelling of livestock movements with a view to assessing biosecurity implications. The WofE method is based on the analysis of spatial relationships between evidential patterns with respect to an event, such as the actual location of a farm. The evidential patterns of cattle farms were derived from maps of land use, land tenure, drainage systems, roads, settlements and long-term averaged rainfall. These evidential patterns were used for delineating and ranking land areas suitable for cattle farming. For each evidential pattern statistics such as a positive weight, a negative weight and a contrast were calculated for estimating the degree of correlation between the evidential patterns and known farm locations. The integrated evidential patterns of known farms were then used for estimating posterior probabilities and splitting land into five different classes according to its suitability for farming. 3aBayesian theory 3abiosecurity 3acattle 3adata collection 3adrainage systems 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aland tenure 3aland use 3amodels 3arain 3aroads 3aAustralia 0aBayesian modelling 0aWeights of evidence 0aConditional independence 0aGIS 0aFarm location 0aSpatial distribution of farms 0aLacunarity1 aDonald, G.

Context-free and context-sensitive grammars are applied to the description of polypeptides and polynucleotides. The length of the minimal grammar program generating the sequence is used as a measure of its complexity, and the number of rules (derivational length) as a measure of the grammar structure. 25 DNA, RNA, and protein sequences are analysed. It is shown that the derivational length has a tendency to increase along phylogenetic pathways. A proposal is made to connect the replication rates in the Eigen-Schuster theory with the concepts developed here. 3aproteins 3alanguages 3agenetic code 3aequations 3aDNA 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3aRNA 0agenetic message 0amathematics and statistics 0alanguage theory 0agenetic grammar 0atheory1 aJimenez-Montano, M.A.0 tMathematical biosciences.g1980 Nov., v. 52, no. 1/2 p.53-71x0025-55647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02302naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245006600145300001600211520129500227650001401522650003201536650002401568650002401592650001201616650004901628650003101677650001601708650002401724650002401748700001701772773008301789852000901872930003301881945001301914946001301927655001201940IND2045710020221116204035.0950421e199504  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204571002DNAL7 a77035942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Mg.14aThe population dynamics of communities of parasitic helminths  ap. 191-214.  aThis paper considers the dynamics of a host (animal) species that would grow exponentially in the absence of parasitism, and a community of parasite species that may regulate this growth. The model consists of a single differential equation for the host and one for each of the parasite species. This level of simplicity is achieved by assuming that each parasite species has a negative binomial distribution within the host population, with either zero covariance between the species (exploitation competition), or a specified covariance structure (interference competition). Conditions on the model parameters that determine the abundance of the different species are formulated, as are conditions that determine when a parasite species can invade a community and when a species is likely to be squeezed out. The results show that highly aggregated parasite species are more likely to coexist, but are less able to regulate their host population. A negative correlation between the distributions of the parasite species enhances both their ability to coexist and their ability to regulate the host population. The results of this analysis apply more generally to other systems where communities of exploiter species coexist on discretely distributed hosts, for example, insects on plants. 3ahelminths 3ahost-parasite relationships 3apopulation dynamics 3amathematical models 2aAnimals 2aHelminthsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aMathematics 2aModels, Statistical 2aPopulation Dynamics1 aDobson, A.P.0 tMathematical biosciences.g1995 Apr., v. 126, no. 2 p.191-214x0025-55647nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01395naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009300143300001300236520031900249650003200568650002700600650002400627650002600651650001200677650001400689650003500703650001600738650002300754650002200777650002300799653002500822700001400847773008000861852000900941930003300950945001300983946001300996655001201009IND2041916620221116204017.0940912e199407  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204191662DNAL7 a80810472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikder, A.10aPersistence of a generalized Gause-type two prey-two predator pair linked by competition  ap. 1-23.  aWe consider a generalized Gause-type model of a two predator-two prey system in which the predators are prey-specific and the prey are in competition with each other.

The different methodologies based on these ideas allow for modeling and analyzing biochemical pathways focusing on the coordinate behavior of the whole system. However, one must become familiar with the difference in nomenclature and methodology to relate the models and results obtained by applying these techniques and to appreciate their potential for answering fundamental questions about biochemical systems. In the following three papers we show how this can be facilitated by comparing the nomenclature, methodology, and results of the two leading techniques in this area, metabolic control analysis and biochemical systems theory, using a model of the fermentation pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a reference system. In the present paper we review the nomenclature, technical concepts, and related experimental measurements while creating a practical dictionary for the reference system that makes the relatedness of the two approaches more apparent. In the second paper, subtitled Steady-State Analysis, we show that both approaches give the same picture for many systemic responses of the reference system. In the third paper of this series, subtitled Model Validation and Dynamic Behavior, we show that the quality of the model can be assessed by studying the sensitivity to changes in the system parameters. We hope to illustrate the usefulness of these tools in providing an interpretation of the experimental measurements in a specific metabolic pathway. 3aterminology 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afermentation 3abiochemical pathways 3amathematical models 3akinetics 2aFermentation 2aKinetics 2aMathematics 2aModels, Biological 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSystems Theory 2aTerminology as Topic 0aregulation1 aSorribas, A.1 aCascante, M.0 tMathematical biosciences.g1995 Nov., v. 130, no. 1 p.25-50x0025-55647nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02083naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245009500175300001800270520106400288592002801352650002201380650002601402650001601428650001801444650001901462650001501481650001901496650001301515700001301528700002401541773009701565856007401662852000901736655001201745IND60340928920221119054035.0150809e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034092892DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.237622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadzadehmoghadam, Soheila10aRecent progress in electrospun nanofibers: Reinforcement effect and mechanical performance  ap. 1171-1212.  aComposite materials are becoming increasingly important as structural materials for aeronautical and space engineering, naval, automotive, and civil engineering, sporting goods, and other consumer products. Fiber‐based reinforcement represents one of the most effective manufacturing strategies for enhancing the mechanical strength and other properties of composite materials. Electrospinning has gained widespread interest in the last two decades because of its ability to fabricate continuous ultrafine nanofibers with unique characteristics. The impact of electrospinning on fiber synthesis and processing, characterization, and applications in drug delivery, nanofiltration, tissue scaffolding, and electronics has been extensively studied in the past. In this article, the authors have focused on a comprehensive review of the mechanical performance and properties of electrospun nanofibers as potential reinforcements as well as their advanced nanocomposites. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

At each trial site, 30 calves were allocated into three groups of 10 calves each: T (treated with toltrazuril), D (treated with diclazuril) and C (left untreated). For 40weeks post-treatment, the calves were weighed and examined clinically and parasitologically. The oocyst counts as well as the number of scour days were significantly lower in the T group than in the D and C groups. Final bodyweights and body condition scores of the T group exceeded those of groups C and D. The results confirmed that toltrazuril was highly efficacious, safe and provided productive benefits in dairy and beef calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChianina 3aEimeria bovis 3aEimeria zuernii 3abeef cattle 3abody condition 3abody weight 3acalves 3adairy heifers 3adiclazuril 3afarms 3agrowth performance 3along term effects 3aoocysts 3atoltrazuril1 aDiaferia, Manuela1 aViola, Orfeo1 aFioretti, Daniela Piergili0 tveterinary journal.g2011 Nov., v. 190, no. 2 p.296-299dElsevier Ltdx1090-02337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012700169506011700296506007600413520169000489592002802179506003702207650002202244650001702266650002002283650001402303650001102317650002302328651001002351653002002361653004302381653002502424653003302449653002002482700001602502773010102518856008602619852000902705655001202714IND60766125020221207111541.0220606e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076612502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Zhenmin10aTheory and valuation of cross-regional ecological compensation for cultivated land: A case study of Shanxi province, China  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is the core to design a cross-regional ecological compensation standard of cultivated land for promoting its marketization. Unfortunately, there are some defects in the existing ecological compensation model of cultivated land. For its sustainability, this study established a theoretical model of cross-regional ecological compensation of cultivated land, focused on estimating its ecological compensation price and then analyzed the temporal and spatial changes of its ecological compensation amount in Shanxi province. We found that the model designed in our paper had a lot of credibility, and it could better identify the ecological payment and acceptance areas of cultivated land. Moreover, the ecological payment areas were generally distributed in the Fenhe valley and surrounding intermountain basins, while the ecological acceptance areas were mainly along with the Lvliang mountains and the surrounding hilly mountainous. It also noted that the cultivated land's compensation price showed an upward trend with time, and presented a five-region distribution of “three highs and two lows”. Furthermore, the average compensation price in the non-demonstration was greater than that in demonstration counties of Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) and the average compensation price in ecological payment areas was also greater than that in ecological acceptance areas. It would promote the ecological compensation marketization of cultivated land with the help of regional differences in ecological compensation prices. These findings are highly valuable for the government coordinating the relationship between agricultural production and cultivated land protection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3aland use change 3amountains 3aprices 3atheoretical models 3aChina 0aCultivated land 0aCross-regional ecological compensation 0aEcological footprint 0aEcological carrying capacity 0aShanxi province1 aYao, Shunbo0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Mar., v. 136 p.108609-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008200162300001300244520121400257592002801471650002101499650002101520650001501541650001101556650001701567650002001584650001501604650001101619650001401630653004101644653001001685653001401695653003501709700001801744700001601762700005301778700005601831700001301887700001601900773012201916856008302038852000902121655001202130IND60626413920221122125109.0190326e20190322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062641392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.12.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jian10aEffect of Mo doping and NiFe-LDH cocatalyst on PEC water oxidation efficiency  ap. 9-19.  aThe NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets were decorated on the surface of doped BiVO4 to structure an integrating photoanode for improving solar photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting efficiency, which is a dynamic research topic to solve the energy crisis and remit environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion. The fabricated photoanode exhibits rapid response to visible light, enhances photocurrent density and shows significant cathodic shift compared to BiVO4. Moreover, the measured incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the photoanode is comparable to that reported in the literature. The amount of evolution oxygen was measured and the faradaic efficiency produced oxygen was also obtained by comparing the theoretical calculation value. The enhancement is attributed to the increase of the carrier density, the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole and consuming of the photogenerated holes accumulated at the electrode surface, which has been confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the intensity modulated photocurrent spectra (IMPS). The work may offer a promising method for designing a high efficiency and low-cost photoanode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3apollution 0aPhotoelectrochemical water splitting 0aBiVO4 0aMo-doping 0aNiFe-layered double hydroxides1 aYang, Xiaojun1 aBai, Shouli1 aXiang, Xu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1089-62101 aLuo, Ruixian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7754-07721 aHe, Jing1 aChen, Aifan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Mar. 22, v. 540 p.9-19dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.12.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03658naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018500168300001600353500001900369520218000388592002802568650001402596650001702610650001102627650001802638650002202656650001802678650002202696650001302718653002602731653003002757653001302787653001702800653001002817700002402827700002502851700002802876700002202904700002302926700006002949773009603009856008603105852000903191655001203200IND60719780020221117204023.0210124e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071978002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.11.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYunusa, Umar10aMobile phone reminders for enhancing uptake, completeness and timeliness of routine childhood immunization in low and middle income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 209-221.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImmunization remains one of the most effective public health interventions offering protection for children from vaccine preventable diseases. However, many children living in low- and- middle income countries do not get adequate immunization due to several factors. Mobile phone reminder interventions have shown great potential in enhancing a number of immunization outcomes. However, the evidence supporting its use in these countries is vague. This systematic review was conducted to provide evidence for mobile phone reminder in enhancing immunization uptake, completeness and timeliness. This review was conducted in accordance to the PRISMA recommendations. Three online databases; PubMed, Cochrane Library and African Journals Online, were systematically searched for potentially relevant studies. Screening of records (titles/abstracts from and full-texts) was done using Covidence. Meta-analyses were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (v5.4). The GRADEpro was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence/summary of findings. Eleven RCTs assessing immunization uptake, completeness and/or timeliness by means of SMS, phone calls or a combination of voice message and SMS were included in both quantitative and qualitative synthesis. Overall, the included studies were of moderate quality. Majority of the included studies indicated that mobile phone reminders were beneficial. Meta-analyses indicated that using mobile phone reminder interventions for the review outcomes was of variable effect with high level of heterogeneity. A combination of voice message and SMS has a greater effect followed by phone calls then SMS reminders for immunization completeness. The use of SMS for immunization uptake and timeliness were largely insignificant (p > 0.05). Furthermore, evidence to support the efficacy of mobile phone reminder from the GRADE synthesis was between low and moderate. Mobile phone reminders, particularly a combination of voice message + SMS and perhaps phone calls appears to be more effective in enhancing immunization outcomes. However, more studies are required in view of methodological inadequacies in existing studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood 3aimmunization 3aincome 3ameta-analysis 3amobile telephones 3apublic health 3asystematic review 3avaccines 0aImmunization outcomes 0aMobile phone intervention 0aReminder 0aChild health 0aLMICs1 aGarba, Saleh Ngaski1 aUmar, Addakano Bello1 aIdris, Suleiman Hadejia1 aBello, Umar Lawal1 aAbdulrashid, Idris1 aMohammed, Jibril1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7466-79730 tVaccine.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 39, no. 2 p.209-221dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245005800165300001600223520082700239592002801066650001601094650002601110650001501136650002401151650001001175700002001185700002101205700002201226700002301248700001901271773009101290856008201381852000901463655001201472IND4462428620221120145249.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446242862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeirinckx, Eva10aChiral inversion of R(−) to S(+) ketoprofen in pigs  ap. 290-292.  aThe S(+) enantiomer of ketoprofen is predominant in the plasma of pigs after administration of racemic ketoprofen, although the occurrence and extent of R(−)-to-S(+) inversion is uncertain.

S(+) ketoprofen was formed immediately after administration and concentrations exceeded R(−) concentrations after 1h. Absence of pre-systemic inversion was deduced from the lower S(+) percentages after oral administration.

Here, we present the Spatial Targets and Sustainable Livelihoods (STSL) framework and analyze regional environmental vulnerability and livelihood assets in the Longnan Municipality of China. We constructed reasonable spatial targeting and payment modes according to each actual type. We classified the present 27 poverty-stricken areas in Longnan Municipality into two levels of environmental vulnerability, four classes in combination with natural capital, eight categories with the addition of human capital, and ten subcategories considering environmental vulnerability and all five livelihood assets. Finally, considering regional development and sustainable livelihoods for poor people, we suggest spatial layout targets for implementing conservation or restoration ecological projects and 10 differentiated payment modes. This study provides an appropriate proposal for certain regions to implement the environmental policy of win–win PES and fills the research gap regarding specific payment modes for PES.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental policy 3aenvironmental protection 3ahuman capital 3alivelihood 3anatural capital 3apeople 3apoverty 3aChina 0aWin–win PES 0aSTSL framework 0aEnvironmental vulnerability 0aSustainable livelihoods 0aChina1 aYan, Shulin1 aSong, Xiaoyu1 aLi, Zongxing1 aMao, Jinhuang0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Mar., v. 136 p.108612-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1086123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245010500165300001600270506002800286520149500314592002801809506003701837650001501874650001201889650001201901650001501913650002401928650002701952650001501979650002401994650001302018650002102031651001402052653001102066653001302077653002402090700001302114700002002127700002302147773013502170856007902305852000902384655001202393IND60739852820221215143108.0210330e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073985282DNAL7 a10.18343/jipi.25.4.6442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLestari, Ayu Dwi10aResidual Effect of Mungbean First Planting on Growth and Yield of Cowpea Second Planting in Dry Land  ap. 644-652.  aResource is Open Access  aThe objective of this research was to determine the residual effect of fertilizer and former plant spacing of mungbean first planting on growth and yield of cowpea second planting in a dry land. The experiment was conducted at Muneng Research Field, Probolinggo, East Java during dry season in 2015. The cowpea seeds of KT 5 varieties were planted in plots measuring 4 m x 4,5 m with plant spacing of 40 cm x 15 cm, 2 plants/hole. This research was carried out without adding fertilizer (fertilizer application only given on mungbean planting). This experiment was laid out in a split plot design and replicated three times. Plant spacing of mungbean as the main plot, namely 1) former of 40 cm x 10 cm, 1 plant/hole (J1); 2) former of 40 cm x 15 cm, 2 plants/hole (J2); and 3) former of 40 cm x 20 cm, 2 plants/hole (J3). Residual combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers as the sub plot, namely 1) former without fertilizer (R0); 2) former of 50 kg ZA + 50 kg SP-36 + 100 kg KCl/ha (R1); 3) former of 150 kg Phonska/ha (R2); 4) former of 5000 kg organic fertilizer/ha (R3); and 5) former of 75 kg Phonska + 2500 kg organic fertilizer/ha (R4). The results showed that the cultivation of cowpea with R3 and R4 treatments had effects on shoot and roots dry weights. The highest cowpea yield was obtained with J3 and R4 treatment of 1,62 t/ha and the highest biomass was obtained with J3 treatment of 5,92 t/ha, but statistically not significantly different from the other treatments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarid lands 3abiomass 3acowpeas 3adry season 3aexperimental design 3afertilizer application 3amung beans 3aorganic fertilizers 3aplanting 3aresidual effects 3aIndonesia 0acowpea 0adry land 0aresidual fertilizer1 aSutrisno1 aWijanarko, Andy1 aKuntyastuti, Henny0 tJurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia.g2020 Oct., v. 25, no. 4 p.644-652dBogor Agricultural UniversitywJournal:27739x2443-34627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18343/jipi.25.4.6443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245008200168500001400250520148500264592002801749650000901777650001601786650001001802650001401812650001101826650001501837650000901852650001101861650001501872650001301887650001101900650001001911700003201921700001401953700002201967773011901989856007402108852000902182655001202191IND60704201620221122032340.0200723e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070420162DNAL7 a10.3390/w120102342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTessema, Netsanet Nigatu10aPhysical Model Study on Discharge over a Dam Due to Landslide Generated Waves  aNAL-light  aImpulse waves generated by landslides falling into reservoirs may lead to overtopping of a dam and, in turn, to flooding of the downstream area. In the case of an embankment dam, the overtopping may lead to erosion of the downstream slope, ultimately resulting in breaching and complete failure with consequent further hazardous release of water to the downstream area. This research deals with the overtopping process of a dam due to landslide generated waves in a three-dimensional (3D) physical scale model setup. Experiments have been conducted with varying the slide, reservoir, and dam parameters. The primary focus is on investigating the feasibility of employing the steady state weir equation in order to predict the overtopping discharge over a dam crest due to landslide generated waves. Calibration and validation of the coefficient of discharge values for the different dam section are conducted for the specified model setup. Accordingly, a two-step calculation procedure is presented for predicting the overtopping discharge based on the maximum overtopping depth values. Hence, for the fixed setup, which includes a constant slope angle of the landslide surface, a predictive equation for maximum overtopping depth is proposed, based on slide volume, slide release height, still water depth, upstream dam slope angle, and dam height. The relative slide volume and relative still water depth both seem to have a significant effect on the relative overtopping depth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3acalibration 3adepth 3aequations 3aheight 3alandslides 3alead 3amodels 3aprediction 3aresearch 3avolume 3awater1 aSigtryggsdóttir, Fjóla G.1 aLia, Leif1 aJabir, Asie Kemal0 tWater.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120102343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014900169500001400318520100000332592002801332650002601360650002001386650001701406650001901423650001201442650001101454650001701465650001401482650001301496653000801509653000801517653000801525653000901533653000801542653000801550653001001558653000901568653001201577653001101589653001101600653000801611653000801619653000801627653000801635653000801643653001801651653001701669653002301686653003601709653002101745700001301766700001301779700005301792773010001845856008701945852000902032655001202041IND60696658820221118115426.0200614e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069665882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yuning10aOn-site, rapid and visual determination of Hg2+ and Cu2+ in red wine by ratiometric fluorescence sensor of metal-organic frameworks and CdTe QDs  aNAL-light  aA ratiometric sensor of MOF/ CdTe QDs was constructed by physically mixing CdTe QDs (λₑₘ = 605 nm) with MOF (Fe-MIL-88NH₂,λₑₘ = 425 nm). Under an UV lamp (λₑₓ = 365 nm), orange-red CdTe QDs is gradually quenched with increasing levels of Hg²⁺ or Cu²⁺, while blue MOF is unchanged, accompanying with a visual change from bright pink to blue fluorescence. Hence, a new method for determining Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺ by MOF/CdTe QDs sensor is established, whose detection limits are 0.22 ng mL⁻¹ for Hg²⁺ (2.1% RSD) and 0.26 ng mL⁻¹ for Cu²⁺ (1.1% RSD), respectively. In addition, on-site, rapid and visual determination of Hg²⁺/Cu²⁺ in red wine without any pretreatment is realized by using a MOF/CdTe QDs paper-based sensor. For Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺, the semi-quantitative detection ranges of the paper-based sensor are both 10 ~ 5000 ng mL⁻¹, implying that it has great application value in analyzing Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺ in liquid samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afood chemistry 3aliquids 3amixing 3apretreatment 3ared wines 3asampling 0aAAS 0aAFS 0aB-R 0aDDTC 0aDMF 0aDPA 0aFT-IR 0aHPLC 0aICP-AES 0aICP-MS 0aMn-CDs 0aMOF 0aQDs 0aRSD 0aSEM 0aTGA 0aCu2+ and Hg2+ 0aMOF/CdTe QDs 0aPaper-based sensor 0aRatiometric fluorescence sensor 0aVisual detection1 aLiu, Wei1 aCao, Jie1 aWu, Yiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4579-12080 tFood chemistry.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 328 p.127119-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010200168300001600270500001900286520091000305592002801215650002301243650002101266650001101287650001301298650003001311650002901341650001101370650001501381650001501396650001801411650002001429653001601449653001301465653001901478700002101497700002201518773013601540856008101676852000901757655001201766IND60740924920221119051317.0210609e20210728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074092492DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145200039802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalton, Gemma E.10aMechanisms linking the human gut microbiome to prophylactic and treatment strategies for COVID-19  ap. 219-227.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has altered the face of biology, social interaction and public health worldwide. It has had a destructive effect upon millions of people and is approaching a devastating one million fatalities. Emerging evidence has suggested a link between the infection and gut microbiome status. This is one of the several factors that may contribute towards severity of infection. Given the fact that the gut is heavily linked to immunity, inflammatory status and the ability to challenge pathogens, it is worthwhile to consider dietary intervention of the gut microbiota as means of potentially challenging the viral outcome. In this context, probiotics and prebiotics have been used to mitigate similar respiratory infections. Here, we summarise links between the gut microbiome and COVID-19 infection, as well as propose mechanisms whereby probiotic and prebiotic interventions may act.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adigestive system 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3anutritional intervention 3apeople 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3apublic health 3asocial behavior 0aCoronavirus 0aCOVID-19 0aGut microbiome1 aGibson, Glenn R.1 aHunter, Kirsty A.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2021 July 28, v. 126, no. 2 p.219-227dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145200039803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015800171300001600329520116300345592002801508650002501536650001301561650001901574650002001593650001401613650001701627650001401644650003101658650001301689650002101702650000901723650001101732650002001743650001401763650001101777650001601788650001101804650001401815650001101829653002301840653000901863653001401872653001601886653001001902653001401912700002201926700002201948700002501970700002301995700002102018773009702039856008502136852000902221655001202230IND60684238320221122215458.0210201e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068423832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuiuay, Chokchai10aEffect of gasoline-like fuel obtained from hard-resin of Yang (Dipterocarpus alatus) on single cylinder gasoline engine performance and exhaust emissions  ap. 634-645.  aThis study focused on the performance and exhaust emissions of gasoline engines using gasoline-like fuel (GLF) produced from hard-resin of Yang (HY) by the fast pyrolysis process in semi-continuous reactors at pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C. Bio-oil products obtained from the process were distilled into heavy fuel at 200–350 °C and light fuel at 25–200 °C. HY (100%wt) generated 20.5%wt of light fuel and 30.8%wt of heavy fuel with 35.0%wt of gas and 13.7%wt of waste obtained. Light fuel as well as GLF and gasoline were tested for distillation, density, viscosity, heating value, flash point and silver strip corrosion under ASTM and also for the effect of GLF on performance and exhaust emissions of spark-ignition (SI) engines for a four-stroke single cylinder and fuel mixing system with carburetor. Positive results were shown for performance of brake torque, brake power and brake thermal efficiency. Findings revealed that brake specific fuel consumption was lower compared to gasoline. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) from engine exhaust were lower than gasoline with carbon dioxide (CO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) higher.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipterocarpus alatus 3abiofuels 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acorrosion 3adistillation 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3agasoline 3agasoline engines 3aheat 3amixing 3anitrogen oxides 3apyrolysis 3asilver 3atemperature 3atorque 3aviscosity 3awastes 0aGasoline-like fuel 0aYang 0aSI engine 0aPerformance 0aResin 0aPyrolysis1 aLaloon, Kittipong1 aKatekaew, Somporn1 aSenawong, Kritsadang1 aNoisuwan, Phakamat1 aSudajan, Somposh0 tRenewable energy.g2020 June, v. 153 p.634-645dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245011200133300001600245500001900261520032700280592002800607650003100635650002400666650001000690650001000700650002000710650002100730653002500751653001400776653001200790700001500802773015800817852000900975655001200984IND60716756620221119042706.0201107e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071675662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNidhi, Bhatiwada10aEffect of storage on nutritional and sensory qualities of grain amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) flour  ap. 297-300.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGrain amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) flour stored for six months in airtight glass containers at room temperature was analyzed for nutrient composition initially and after 3ʳᵈ and 6ᵗʰ month of storage.

Temperature and residence time varied from 220 to 280 °C and 20–60 min. The fuel (volatile ignitability (VI), combustibility index (CI), fuel ratio (FR)), and flow (Hausner ratio (HR), cohesion coefficient (C), Carr compressibility index (CCI), angle of repose) properties were investigated for raw and torrefied biomass. Torrefied biomass was also characterized through TGA, FTIR, SEM-EDX and ICP-MS analysis. For moisture sorption test, contact angle was measured. Finally, torrefied biomass was compared with coal using published literature. The HHV, fixed carbon content, FR of raw biomass at 280 °C for 40 min was increased from 19.31 to 24.76 MJ/kg, 11.35 to 60.40 wt %, and 0.13 to 1.63, respectively. While, VI, CI, C, CCI and bulk density of raw biomass at similar condition of torrefaction decreased from 15.76 to 15.37 (MJ/kg), 147.40 to 17.37 (MJ/kg), 0.40 to 0.33, 22.85 to 15.86 and 230.82 to 172.84 (kg/m³), respectively. ICP-MS analysis revealed that torrefied biomass was enriched in sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc. At similar torrefaction condition, the moisture absorbed by raw and torrefied biomass was 35.44% and 6.61%, respectively. Contact angle (79.1°/77.5°) for torrefied biomass suggested its hydrophobic nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aVachellia nilotica 3aangle of repose 3abulk density 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acoal 3acohesion 3acompressibility 3acontact angle 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3aquartz 3arenewable energy sources 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3asorption 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atorrefaction 3awoody biomass 0aTorrefaction 0aICP-MS 0aContact angle 0aAngle of repose 0aFuel and flow properties 0aAcacia nilotica1 aChakraborty, Jyoti Prasad1 aMondal, Monoj Kumar0 tRenewable energy.g2020 June, v. 153 p.711-724dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094024002200139024001900161040001800180100002000198245009300218300001400311520128700325592002801612650001501640650002001655650001901675650001601694650002701710650001601737650001201753650002901765650001601794650002801810650002301838650001301861650002101874650002801895650001701923700002701940700001901967700003201986773009802018856009102116990002302207852000902230655001202239IND60098789920221119183920.0141105e20130909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009878992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.0142doi7 aPMC41455892pmcid7 a238717552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAranda, Juan F.10aMicroRNA modulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in cardiometabolic diseases  ap. 31-39.  aThe regulation of the metabolism of cholesterol has been one of the most studied biological processes since its first isolation from gallstones in 1784. High levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduced levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are widely recognized as major risk factors of cardiovascular disease. An imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species can oxidize LDL particles, increasing the levels of the highly proatherogenic oxidized LDL. Furthermore, under pathological scenarios, numerous molecules can function as pro-oxidants, such as iron or (high levels of) glucose. In addition to the classical mechanisms regulating lipid homeostasis, recent studies have demonstrated the important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) as regulators of lipoprotein metabolism, oxidative derivatives of lipoprotein, and redox balance. Here, we summarize recent findings in the field, highlighting the contributions of some miRNAs to lipid- and oxidative-associated pathologies. We also discuss how therapeutic intervention of miRNAs may be a promising strategy to decrease LDL, increase HDL, and ameliorate lipid- and oxidative-related disorders, including atherosclerosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobiosis 3aatherosclerosis 3acholelithiasis 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3afatty liver 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahomeostasis 3alow density lipoprotein 3ametabolic syndrome 3amicroRNA 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3arisk factors1 aMadrigal-Matute, Julio1 aRotllan, Noemi1 aFernández-Hernando, Carlos0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Sept. 9, v. 64 p.31-39dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245010300175506002800278520159100306592002801897506003701925650001401962650000801976650001701984650001702001650002902018650001002047650001202057650001002069650001902079650001702098650001002115650003002125651001102155651001402166700002502180700002602205700001902231773009602250856008302346852000902429655001202438IND60739853920221207073358.0200608s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073985392DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202020040032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzalea, Dyah Argarini10aMolecular Bird Sexing on Fischeri Lovebird (Agapornis fischeri) by Using Polymerase Chain Reaction  aResource is Open Access  aFischeri Lovebird (Agapornis fischeri) found originally in Africa which has spread to many countries. In Indonesia, Fischeri Lovebird is popular as a pet animal. This lovebird is a monomorphic bird, so it is difficult to differentiate morphologically between male and female birds. In general, a male lovebird has ZZ homozygotes, whereas females' lovebird has ZW heterozygous of their sex chromosome. These sex chromosomes set used as study targets for molecular bird sexing of many species of birds because this method is effective and simple to perform. This method targeted to amplify the Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding (CHD) gene, which found into the sex chromosome of male and female birds. The objective of this study was to rapid molecular bird sexing of Fischeri Lovebird by using PCR methods. Research samples were collected from feather calamus of A. fischeri. The total sample was 11 feathers from A. fischeri. which were collected three to six feathers for each lovebird. Then the research was followed by DNA extraction from calamus feathers, DNA amplification by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products and visualization of PCR predicts by UV-Transilluminator in darkroom. It concluded that PCR amplification using NP, MP and P2 primers produced double DNA bands in size of 400 bp on Z chromosome and bp on W chromosome for female Fischeri Lovebird, whereas for male Fischeri Lovebird only produced a single DNA band in size of 400 bp on Z chromosome. From eleven samples of Fischeri Lovebird showed a total of five females and six male Fischeri Lovebirds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgapornis 3aDNA 3aW chromosome 3aZ chromosome 3aagar gel electrophoresis 3abirds 3afemales 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3amales 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aAfrica 3aIndonesia1 aHerjuno, Ari Nugroho1 aMedania, Purwaningrum1 aAris, Haryanto0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 20 p.04003-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202020040033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015600172520101900328592002801347650001601375650002401391650001601415650001401431650001701445650002801462650004701490650002301537650001601560650000901576650001101585650001301596650001601609653001501625653001901640653000901659653001201668653001501680653003901695700002201734700006101756700002001817700002301837700002601860700002201886700002201908700002001930700002601950700002201976773010001998856008702098852000902185655001202194IND60696659320221118115354.0200614e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069665932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNebbia, Stefano10aDifferential impact of Holder and High Temperature Short Time pasteurization on the dynamic in vitro digestion of human milk in a preterm newborn model  aThe high-temperature short-time (HTST, 72 °C, 15 s) pasteurization of human milk (HM) has been proposed as an alternative to the Holder method (HoP, 62.5 °C, 30 min), to increase the preservation of bioactive compounds. We have investigated the impact of HTST and HoP pasteurization on the gastrointestinal kinetics of human milk, using a dynamic in vitro system in a preterm newborn model. An increased protein aggregation on the surface of fat globules following pasteurization, albeit to a lesser extent in HTST than in HoP, was observed. Despite relevant differences in the undigested milk samples, both pasteurization methods led to similar proteolytic patterns, while raw HM presented a higher native lactoferrin content throughout digestion. The slightly decreased amino acid release following HoP, with respect to HTST and raw HM, indicated that peptidomic analysis, which is currently underway, might provide interesting insights on the differential digestive kinetics of differently pasteurized HM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abioactive compounds 3abreast milk 3adigestion 3afat globules 3agastrointestinal system 3ahigh-temperature short-time pasteurization 3ain vitro digestion 3alactoferrin 3amilk 3amodels 3aneonates 3aproteolysis 0aDonor milk 0aPasteurization 0aHTST 0aPreterm 0aDigestomic 0aMilk fat globule membrane proteins1 aGiribaldi, Marzia1 aCavallarin, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-16831 aBertino, Enrico1 aCoscia, Alessandra1 aBriard-Bion, Valérie1 aOssemond, Jordane1 aHenry, Gwénaële1 aMénard, Olivia1 aDupont, D.q(Didier),1 aDeglaire, Amélie0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 328 p.127126-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015200172300001600324520114100340592002801481650004401509650002601553650001801579650001401597650001501611650003201626650001401658650001501672650001501687650002001702650001801722650001301740650001601753650002401769650001401793650001801807653001101825653001201836653001701848653002101865653001401886700002501900700002701925700002401952773011101976856008502087852000902172655001202181IND60684238620221122155223.0210201e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068423862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatchimpet, Jaran10aOptimization of process variables for the production of biodiesel by transesterification of used cooking oil using lipase from Nile tilapia viscera  ap. 861-869.  aBiodiesel synthesis through transesterification of used cooking oil or frying oils using the viscera lipase from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as a low-cost feedstock and catalyst, respectively, was optimized. The influences of operating factors, including methanol/oil molar ratio, enzyme loading, reaction time, type of alcohol, water content and reaction temperature on the yield of biodiesel were investigated. The optimized conditions to achieve maximum biodiesel yield were obtained using an enzyme loading of 30 kUnit, a methanol to oil molar ratio of 4:1, a water content of 3%, a reaction temperature of 45 °C and a 28 h reaction time. Under these optimal operating conditions, the highest biodiesel yield observed was 96.5%. The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was applied to ensure the conversion of used cooking oil into biodiesel. The biodiesel characteristics met the specifications set as prescribed by EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751. The results from this investigation show the viability of economical biodiesel production using byproducts as both source and catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aanimal organs 3abiodiesel 3abyproducts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalysts 3afeedstocks 3afrying oil 3afuel production 3akitchen waste 3amethanol 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3aviability 3awater content 0aLipase 0aViscera 0aNile tilapia 0aUsed cooking oil 0aBiodiesel1 aSimpson, Benjamin K.1 aSangkharak, Kanokphorn1 aKlomklao, Sappasith0 tRenewable energy.g2020 June, v. 153 p.861-869dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245015600208520154100364592002801905650001501933650001701948650001601965650001801981650001901999650002402018650002102042650001302063650001602076650002002092650001202112650002102124653000802145653002802153653001202181653001302193653002502206700001802231700001702249700001602266700005102282773010602333856008702439852000902526655001202535IND60745220620221118023235.0211123e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074522062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1272012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yuxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5650-977610aComplexation of tannic acid with polyoxypropylene diamine in water and application for the preparation of hierarchically structured functional surfaces  aWe rationalize that a water-soluble low molecular weight polyoxypropylene diamine (i.e., Jeffamine® D400 polyetheramine), capable of various types of noncovalent molecular interactions through its amine and propylene oxide groups, presents a simple yet versatile opportunity to form complexes with natural polyphenol of tannic acid (TA) and be exploited to engineer functional materials and surfaces. By investigating TA-D400 complexation behaviors in water, we demonstrate that mixing weakly acidic TA and neutral D400 solutions of stock concentrations above 1.0 mg/mL allowed easy formation of colloidally stable TA-D400 complexes. Such complexes were characterized as cationic nanoparticles of typical hydrodynamic diameters less than 300 nm. Mixing ratios were found to be less of an influencer on complexation. The TA-D400 intermolecular complexation was shown to be driven primarily by hydrophobic interaction in conjunction with ionic association. A simple immersion process can induce the formation of substrate-independent, hierarchically structured, and highly hydrophilic surfaces because of adsorption of TA-D400 complexes. Such functional surfaces not only can potentially modulate cell-material interactions shown by our brief in vitro fibroblast cell culture study, but also are feasible for in situ facile reduction of HAuCl₄ to achieve integration of gold nanoparticles for function enrichment. This TA-D400 system adds a new option to the toolbox of polyphenol-mediated green technologies for surface engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acell culture 3afibroblasts 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amolecular weight 3ananogold 3apolyphenols 3apropylene oxide 3atannins 3awater solubility 0aPPO 0aNoncovalent interaction 0aComplex 0aCationic 0aSurface modification1 aSun, Xiaoning1 aHan, Jianmei1 aCheng, Fang1 aHe, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6638-96910 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 627 p.127201-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1272013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009500160300001800255520136800273592002801641650001201669650002601681650001401707650001401721650001701735650001501752650001301767650002201780650002301802650001401825650001601839650002301855650002501878650001401903650000901917651001901926700002301945700002201968700002801990700001902018773012502037856007502162852000902237655001202246IND60535826220221119161054.0160805e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053582622DNAL7 a10.1021/es506361p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Guangming10aEvolution of Sediment Plumes in the Chesapeake Bay and Implications of Climate Variability  ap. 6494-6503.  aFluvial sediment transport impacts fisheries, marine ecosystems, and human health. In the upper Chesapeake Bay, river-induced sediment plumes are generally known as either a monotonic spatial shape or a turbidity maximum. Little is known about plume evolution in response to variation in streamflow and extreme discharge of sediment. Here we propose a typology of sediment plumes in the upper Chesapeake Bay using a 17 year time series of satellite-derived suspended sediment concentration. On the basis of estimated fluvial and wind contributions, we define an intermittent/wind-dominated type and a continuous type, the latter of which is further divided into four subtypes based on spatial features of plumes, which we refer to as Injection, Transport, Temporary Turbidity-Maximum, and Persistent Turbidity-Maximum. The four continuous types exhibit a consistent sequence of evolution within 1 week to 1 month following flood events. We also identify a “shift” in typology with increased frequency of Turbidity-Maximum types before and after Hurricane Ivan (2004), which implies that extreme events have longer-lasting effects upon estuarine suspended sediment than previously considered. These results can serve as a diagnostic tool to better predict distribution and impacts of estuarine suspended sediment in response to changes in climate and land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adiagnostic techniques 3aestuaries 3afisheries 3ahuman health 3ahurricanes 3aland use 3amarine ecosystems 3asediment transport 3asediments 3astream flow 3asuspended sediment 3atime series analysis 3aturbidity 3awind 3aChesapeake Bay1 aDiGiacomo, Paul M.1 aKaushal, Sujay S.1 aYuen-Murphy, Marilyn A.1 aDuan, Shuiwang0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 June 02, v. 49, no. 11 p.6494-6503dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes506361p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245013200169300001800301520217000319592002802489650002102517650002102538650001802559650001602577650002002593650001802613650002902631650001102660650001502671650002102686650002802707650001402735650001502749650000902764650002402773650001802797650001402815650001402829700002602843700001902869700001902888700002502907700002202932773011902954856005503073852000903128655001203137IND4510562920221116205751.0150730e20010415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451056292DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02115.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuger, Anick10aLow and high density lipoprotein metabolism in primary cultures of hepatic cells from normal and apolipoprotein E knockout mice  ap. 2322-2330.  aApolipoprotein E (apoE) plays a major role in lipoprotein metabolism by mediating the binding of apoEâcontaining lipoproteins to receptors. The role of hepatic apoE in the catabolism of apoEâfree lipoproteins such as low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoproteinâ3 (HDL3) is however, unclear. We analyzed the importance of hepatic apoE by comparing human LDL and HDL3 metabolism in primary cultures of hepatic cells from control C57BL/6J and apoE knockout (KO) mice. Binding analysis showed that the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of LDL, but not of HDL3, is increased by twofold in the absence of apoE synthesis/secretion. Compared to control hepatic cells, LDL and HDL3 holoparticle uptake by apoE KO hepatic cells, as monitored by protein degradation, is reduced by 54 and 77%, respectively. Cleavage of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) by treatment with heparinaseâI reduces LDL association by 21% in control hepatic cells. Thus, HSPG alone or a hepatic apoEâHSPG complex is partially involved in LDL association with mouse hepatic cells. In apoE KO, but not in normal hepatic cells, the same treatment increases LDL uptake/degradation by 2.4âfold suggesting that in normal hepatic cells, hepatic apoE increases LDL degradation by masking apoBâ100 binding sites on proteoglycans. Cholesteryl ester (CE) association and CE selective uptake (CE/protein association ratio) from LDL and HDL3 by mouse hepatic cells were not affected by the absence of apoE expression. We also show that 69 and 72% of LDLâCE hydrolysis in control and apoE KO hepatic cells, respectively, is sensitive to chloroquine revealing the importance of a pathway linked to lysosomes. In contrast, HDL3âCE hydrolysis is only mediated by a nonlysosomal pathway in both control and apoE KO hepatic cells. Overall, our results indicate that hepatic apoE increases the holoparticle uptake pathway of LDL and HDL3 by mouse hepatic cells, that HSPG devoid of apoE favors LDL binding/association but impairs LDL uptake/degradation and that apoE plays no significant role in CE selective uptake from either human LDL or HDL3 lipoproteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapolipoprotein E 3abinding capacity 3abinding sites 3achloroquine 3aheparan sulfate 3aheparin lyase 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aknockout mutants 3alow density lipoprotein 3alysosomes 3ametabolism 3amice 3aprotein degradation 3aproteoglycans 3areceptors 3asecretion1 aTruong, ToâQuyen1 aRhainds, David1 aLapointe, Jany1 aLetarte, FrÃ©deric1 aBrissette, Louise0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 Apr. 15, v. 268, no. 8 p.2322-2330dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02115.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013600169520159200305592002801897650002101925650002201946650001501968650002801983650002602011650001402037650001902051650001302070650002302083650001102106650001302117650002802130650001902158650002302177650002702200650001702227650001902244650001402263650001702277650002402294650002802318650002102346650003702367653001802404653003802422653003302460653002902493700002302522700001602545700001602561700002102577700002802598773010602626856008702732852000902819655001202828IND60745220720221118023331.0211123e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074522072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1272022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe, Debarati10aStudies on cancer cell death through delivery of dopamine as anti-cancer drug by a newly functionalized cobalt ferrite nano-carrier  aRecently, a promising applicability of dopamine (DA) as an anticancer drug has been observed because it has an anti-angiogenesis property regulating tumour growth. We have proposed here a new approach for cancer therapy using cobalt-ferrite (CF) nanoparticles as a DA delivery agent by functionalizing CF with DA and polyethylene glycol (PEG). CF was synthesized by simple wet chemical method and its physical properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to confirm its structural and morphological properties respectively. After that DA was conjugated with CF (CF-DA) and then the CF-DA was polyethylene glycolated (CF-DA-PEG) for better fixing of DA on the CF and to deliver the dopamine very slowly into the cancer cells. FTIR study confirms the adsorption of DA and coating of PEG. We then carried on some experiments on cancer cells treating them with CF, DA, CF-DA, PEG and CF-DA-PEG to investigate and compare their anticancer properties. Detail mechanisms of cancer cell death were investigated by different techniques such as MTT assay, colony formation assay, anti migratory property, cell apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, actin cytoskeleton disruption, western blot analysis, mitochondrial membrane disruption investigation etc. Our results convey an important message that CF-DA-PEG is able to deliver DA inside the A549 cells and also CF-DA-PEG shows an anti-cancer effect inducing apoptosis through activating the cyrochrome-c and caspase dependent apoptotic pathway and CF catalysed ROS generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acancer therapy 3acaspases 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3adopamine 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amicrofilaments 3amigratory behavior 3amitochondrial membrane 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene glycol 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity testing 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aDrug delivery 0aCobalt ferrite magnetic particles 0aDopamine as anti-cancer drug 0aCatalytic ROS generation1 aUpadhyay, Priyanka1 aDas, Arpita1 aGhosh, Ajay1 aAdhikary, Arghya1 aGoswami, Madhuri Mandal0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 627 p.127202-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1272023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010900164300001800273520139700291592002801688650001101716650001901727650002501746650001501771650001301786650001801799650000901817650002001826650001501846700002001861700002501881700002901906700001901935700002401954773012501978856007502103852000902178655001202187IND60535826320221119161510.0160805e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053582632DNAL7 a10.1021/es50605722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrowne, Mark Anthony10aSpatial and Temporal Patterns of Stranded Intertidal Marine Debris: Is There a Picture of Global Change?  ap. 7082-7094.  aFloating and stranded marine debris is widespread. Increasing sea levels and altered rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, waves, and oceanic currents associated with climatic change are likely to transfer more debris from coastal cities into marine and coastal habitats. Marine debris causes economic and ecological impacts, but understanding the scope of these requires quantitative information on spatial patterns and trends in the amounts and types of debris at a global scale. There are very few large-scale programs to measure debris, but many peer-reviewed and published scientific studies of marine debris describe local patterns. Unfortunately, methods of defining debris, sampling, and interpreting patterns in space or time vary considerably among studies, yet if data could be synthesized across studies, a global picture of the problem may be avaliable. We analyzed 104 published scientific papers on marine debris in order to determine how to evaluate this. Although many studies were well designed to answer specific questions, definitions of what constitutes marine debris, the methods used to measure, and the scale of the scope of the studies means that no general picture can emerge from this wealth of data. These problems are detailed to guide future studies and guidelines provided to enable the collection of more comparable data to better manage this growing problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3aguidelines 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3arain 3asolar radiation 3awind speed1 aChapman, M.

To predict how anthropogenic emissions affect global Hg cycling and eventually human Hg exposure, it is crucial to understand Hg deposition and re-emission of legacy Hg from soils. However, assessing Hg deposition and re-emission pathways remains difficult because of an insufficient understanding of the governing processes. We measured Hg stable isotope signatures of radiocarbon-dated boreal forest soils and modeled atmospheric Hg deposition and re-emission pathways and fluxes using a combined source and process tracing approach. Our results suggest that Hg in the soils was dominantly derived from deposition of litter (∼90% on average). The remaining fraction was attributed to precipitation-derived Hg, which showed increasing contributions in older, deeper soil horizons (up to 27%) indicative of an accumulation over decades. We provide evidence for significant Hg re-emission from organic soil horizons most likely caused by nonphotochemical abiotic reduction by natural organic matter, a process previously not observed unambiguously in nature. Our data suggest that Histosols (peat soils), which exhibit at least seasonally water-saturated conditions, have re-emitted up to one-third of previously deposited Hg back to the atmosphere. Re-emission of legacy Hg following reduction by natural organic matter may therefore be an important pathway to be considered in global models, further supporting the need for a process-based assessment of land/atmosphere Hg exchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHistosols 3aboreal forests 3aemissions 3aforest soils 3ahumans 3amercury 3amodels 3aorganic horizons 3aorganic matter 3aorganic soils 3apeat soils 3astable isotopes1 aWiederhold, Jan G.1 aSkyllberg, Ulf1 aKronberg, Rose-Marie1 aHajdas, Irka1 aKretzschmar, Ruben0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 June 16, v. 49, no. 12 p.7188-7196dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b007423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007000155500001400225520142000239592002801659650001101687650001401698650000901712650001201721650000901733650002101742650001101763650001301774650001001787650001101797650001301808650001101821650001001832700001601842700001801858700001701876773011901893856007402012852000902086655001202095IND60704202420221121223048.0200723e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070420242DNAL7 a10.3390/w120102412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jinbo 10aExperimental and Numerical Investigation of River Closure Project  aNAL-light  aThe success or failure of river closure is directly related to the construction period and project benefit. Therefore, it is very necessary to study the river closure by an appropriate method. In this paper, a 1D–2D coupled river closure model is established to optimize the closure flow rate, closure period, and layout of a real closure project. The 1D transition model between open channel flow and pressurized flow is established by a finite volume scheme. For the 2D model, 2D shallow water equations are solved using an unstructured finite volume scheme. The 1D model and 2D model are coupled by considering the mass and momentum conservation. To validate the model, a physical experiment of a real river closure project is set up according to the gravity similarity criterion with a scale of 1:80. Then, the experimental data obtained by the calibrated physical experiment is compared with the numerical results. Good agreements are achieved in terms of surface elevation, velocity, and flow rate. Finally, the real river closure project is further investigated by the model. The layout, closure flow rate and closure period of this project is analyzed and optimized. The original design of the berm is more suitable to discharge the flow. Moreover, the first stage cofferdam should be removed to floor elevation upstream and downstream of the dam. The river closure flow rate should not exceed 2380 m³/s.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesign 3aequations 3aflow 3agravity 3amass 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amomentum 3apaper 3arivers 3avelocity 3avolume 3awater1 aJin, Sheng 1 aAi, Congfang 1 aDing, Weiye 0 tWater.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120102413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011600175520085300291592002801144650001901172650002101191650001701212650002501229650001301254650002701267650001601294650001701310650001801327650004401345650002201389653002401411653002301435653001701458653000801475700005801483700002001541700001601561700002301577700002301600700006501623700001901688700001901707700002201726773010001748856008701848852000901935655001201944IND60696659620221118115405.0200619e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069665962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortaluri, Vincent10aLimited genotypic and geographic variability of 16-O-methylated diterpene content in Coffea arabica green beans  aThe acknowledged marker of Robusta coffee, 16-O-methylcafestol (16-OMC), can be quantified by NMR as a mixture with 16-O-methylkahweol (16-OMK), which accounts for approximately 10% of the mixture.

Environmental effects suggesting a possible protective role of 16-OMD for adaptation, as well as genotypic effects that support a high heritability of this trait were observed. Altogether, our data confirmed the presence of 16-OMD in green Arabica at a level approximately 1.5% that of a typical Robusta, endorsing the validity of 16-OMD as a marker for the presence of Robusta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aCoffea canephora 3aditerpenoids 3aenvironmental impact 3agenotype 3ageographical variation 3agreen beans 3aheritability 3aintrogression 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotective effect 0a16-O-methylcafestol 0a16-O-methylkahweol 0aGreen coffee 0aNMR1 aThomas, Freddy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8900-33681 aGuyader, Sophie1 aJamin, Eric1 aBertrand, Benoît,1 aRemaud, Gérald S.1 aSchievano, Elisabetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4781-99321 aMammi, Stefano1 aGuercia, Elena1 aNavarini, Luciano0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 329 p.127129-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094024002200139024001900161040001800180100001700198245018300215300001300398500001500411520164500426592002802071650001102099650002102110650002202131650002002153650001002173650001602183650000902199650001802208650001202226650001002238650001402248650001502262650002102277653001502298700002202313700002102335700002102356700002102377700001702398700001402415700002802429700001902457700002402476700002002500700002102520700002602541773009402567856009102661990002302752852000902775655001202784IND60098790520221119185620.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009879052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.06.0172doi7 aPMC38551832pmcid7 a237777062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorini, Ada10aAntisense directed against PS-1 gene decreases brain oxidative markers in aged senescence accelerated mice (SAMP8) and reverses learning and memory impairment: A proteomics study  ap. 1-14.  a2019-12-06  aAmyloid β-peptide (Aβ) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the induction of oxidative stress. This peptide is produced by proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the action of β- and γ-secretases. Previous studies demonstrated that reduction of Aβ, using an antisense oligonucleotide (AO) directed against the Aβ region of APP, reduced oxidative stress-mediated damage and prevented or reverted cognitive deficits in senescence-accelerated prone mice (SAMP8), a useful animal model for investigating the events related to Aβ pathology and possibly to the early phase of AD. In the current study, aged SAMP8 were treated by AO directed against PS-1, a component of the γ-secretase complex, and tested for learning and memory in T-maze foot shock avoidance and novel object recognition. Brain tissue was collected to identify the decrease of oxidative stress and to evaluate the proteins that are differently expressed and oxidized after the reduction in free radical levels induced by Aβ. We used both expression proteomics and redox proteomics approaches. In brain of AO-treated mice a decrease of oxidative stress markers was found, and the proteins identified by proteomics as expressed differently or nitrated are involved in processes known to be impaired in AD. Our results suggest that the treatment with AO directed against PS-1 in old SAMP8 mice reverses learning and memory deficits and reduces Aβ-mediated oxidative stress with restoration to the normal condition and identifies possible pharmacological targets to combat this devastating dementing disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3amemory 3aoligonucleotides 3aAlzheimer disease 3apathophysiology 3abrain 3aproteolysis 3amice 3aanimal models 3aamyloid 3agenes 3acognition 3aproteomics 3aoxidative stress 0asenescence1 aSultana, Rukhsana1 aFörster, Sarah,1 aPerluigi, Marzia1 aCenini, Giovanna1 aCini, Chiara1 aCai, Jian1 aKlein, J.

Thromboelastography, hemostasis profile (i.e. prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], fibrinogen concentration), platelet count (PLT), thrombin–antithrombin complexes (TAT), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity were evaluated. Dogs with carcinomas had faster thrombus generation (TEGTG, a mathematic value obtained from the first derivate of the thromboelastographic tracing; 834.8±91.1 vs. 707.8±75.8mm/min; mean±SD), increased fibrinogen concentration (276 vs. 151mg/dL), and PLT (425 vs. 324U×10⁹/L), but had decreased PAI-1 activity (15.7 vs. 26.2IU/mL).The most common hemostatic abnormalities found in carcinoma dogs were hypercoagulability (TEGTG>mean+2 SD of healthy dogs) and thrombocytosis (PLT>424×10⁹U/L) in 46% of cases, and hyperfibrinogenemia (fibrinogen >384mg/dL) in 32% of cases. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was uncommon and the extent of disease was not correlated with hypercoagulability. TEGTG showed good correlation with fibrinogen (r=0.80) and hyperfibrinogenemia seems to be a main factor of the hypercoagulable state in carcinoma dogs. In conclusion, TEGTG is a valid parameter to diagnose hypercoagulability.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood platelet count 3acarcinoma 3adisseminated intravascular coagulation 3adogs 3afibrinogen 3ahemostasis 3aplasminogen activator inhibitors 3aprothrombin 3athromboplastin1 aLara García, Ana1 aZaldívar López, Sara1 aCouto, C.

The biological parameters of this pest were investigated using two-sex, age-stage life table theory on both composite and natural diets (25 ± 1°C, 50 ± 10% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 16:8 [L:D] h). Based on the preliminary studies, the combination of the green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), sunflower seeds (Helianthus annuus L.), and wild rue capsules (Peganum harmala L.) was introduced into a composite diet. There was no significant difference between the longevity of each stage on diet treatments, but the mean fecundity of female fed on composite diet was about 196.48 ± 12.02 (eggs), which indicated a significant decrease than the fecundity of female fed on the natural diet (265.81 ± 11.67 eggs; P=0.05, t-test). Also, main parameters of life table (r, R₀, T, and λ) for composite and natural diets were about 0.0863 ± 0.0031 d–¹, 89.03 ± 13.33 eggs, 51.987 ± 0.536 d, and 1.091 ± 0.0034 d–¹ and 0.1023 ± 0.003 d–¹, 128.75 ± 17.56 eggs, 47.454 ± 0.439 d, and 1.1077 ± 0.0037 d–¹, respectively. There was a significant difference between these four parameters on both diets. Despite a significant decrease in fecundity with using composite diets, this diet can satisfy our needs now and the laboratory rearing of pistachio green stink bug did not stop over the year in the absence of host weeds and insect did not diapause.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrosternum hilare 3aBrachynema 3aHelianthus annuus 3aPeganum harmala 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aRuta graveolens 3acomparative study 3adiapause 3adiet 3aentomology 3afecundity 3afemales 3ainsects 3alife tables 3alongevity 3apistachios 3arelative humidity 3asurvival rate 3at-test 0acomposite diet 0apistachio green stink bug 0abiological characteristic1 aZiaaddini, Mahdi1 aAlizadeh, Ali1 aJalali, Mohammad Amin1 aEbrahimi, Morteza0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2016 Mar. 27, v. 109, no. 3 p.1273-1282dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245013700194300001800331500001900349500002000368520183100388592002802219596007202247596003002319596005002349596004902399650001302448650002102461650001702482651001002499700001402509700002002523700002102543700001502564700001502579773013402594856007202728852000902800655001202809IND60718029920221121172626.0201118e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071802992DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.36172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Bingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7666-916310aUrban expansion or poor productivity: Explaining regional differences in cropland abandonment in China during the early 21st century  ap. 2540-2551.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCropland abandonment has long been recognized as a marginalization process in rural regions but recently also as a precursor to urbanization in peri‐urban regions. This study aimed to evaluate the relative importance of urbanization and poor productivity in cropland abandonment. A thorough investigation was conducted on 345 cities/towns at the prefecture level or higher in China using 500‐m annual maps for 2003–2016. Cropland abandonment was spatiotemporally coupled with the urbanization. At a national scale, approximately 0.55% of the total cropland area (approximately 862 km² per year) has been abandoned. Cropland abandonment increased significantly until 2009, declined in the early 2010s, and then leveled off in recent years. In particular, the new first‐tier cities suffered the greatest abandonment per capita. However, cropland abandonment was increasingly shifted to lower‐tier cities, particularly the high‐quality cropland abandonment in the medium‐tier cities. Low‐quality cropland in rural regions of the medium‐ and lower‐tier cities experienced incessant abandonment. Results showed that the extent of cropland abandonment increased with city sizes described either by population/GDP or by built‐up area. High‐quality cropland abandonment was more closely related to the built‐up area than to population and GDP for total abandonment. Urbanization‐induced abandonment in peri‐urban areas was dominant for most cities, with exceptions only for a few small cities. Contrary to expectation, cropland abandonment for most cities/towns in rural regions was not more driven by poor productivity, compared to peri‐urban regions. Our study highlights that urbanization mainly accounted for the regional differences in cropland abandonment in China during the past two decades.  aPublisher supplied data  a41771468 and 41471362cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGD1805cFuzhou University  a201806655006cChina Scholarship Council (CSC)  a2017I0008cScience Bureau of Fujian Province 3acropland 3aland degradation 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aYang, Xin1 aTang, Zhenghong1 aChen, Chongcheng1 aLi, Haiwen1 aBerry, Joe0 tLand degradation & development.g2020 Nov., v. 31, no. 17 p.2540-2551dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.36173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008900158300002000247520101500267592002801282650001401310650001801324650001401342650001301356650001101369650001901380650002501399650001201424650001801436650002101454700001601475700001901491700001701510700001901527700001601546700001401562700002101576700001501597700001601612700002101628700001501649700001801664700003001682773014401712856007401856852000901930655001201939IND60673185020221122235054.0191018e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067318502DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta08684f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Wen-Long10aFree-standing N,Co-codoped TiO₂ nanoparticles for LiO₂-based Li–O₂ batteries  ap. 23046-23054.  aLi–O₂ batteries based on lithium superoxide (LiO₂) would address the issues of significant polarization, low energy density and inferior cycle performance. However, LiO₂ as an intermediate product in the discharge process is very active and could be readily disproportionated into Li₂O₂. Thus, it is challenging to find an appropriate cathode catalyst, which can stabilize the active discharge product LiO₂. In this work, heteroatom N and Co codoped titanium dioxide nanoparticles grown on carbon fibers (N,Co-TiO₂/CFs) are fabricated and employed as a non-noble metal cathode catalyst for Li–O₂ batteries. LiO₂ formed in the Li–O₂ batteries can be repeatedly charged and discharged with a very low charge potential of approximately 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li⁺).

It focuses on the social networks created during the Lower Magdalenian of the Cantabrian region (Spain), and visible through similarities of portable art representations. It uses Species Distribution Modeling and Maximum Classification Likelihood on faunal presence data to reconstruct prehistoric biomes, and contextualize the networks reconstructed through the art analysis. It demonstrates the potential of mapping the recreated networks onto the reconstructed biomes and of identifying the linked sites' foraging and minimal band territories to distinguish between local mobility movement and inter-group social alliances. The results show that, during the Lower Magdalenian, the majority of movements seen through artistic similarities probably represent the seasonal mobility of one or two hunter-gatherer groups, and that only a few inter-site links represent social networks used to exchange mates and gather information.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aecosystems 3afauna 3aforaging 3amodels 3asocial behavior 3asocial networks 3aSpain 0aCantabrian region 0aLower Magdalenian 0aSocial networks 0aPortable art objects 0aSpecies Distribution Modeling 0aGIS0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 412 p.112-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006700171300001400238520079500252592002801047650002501075650002301100650002001123650001701143650002601160650002301186650001201209650001601221651001801237653002301255653001601278653001501294653002101309653002101330653002201351700001701373773010901390856008401499852000901583655001201592IND60123540720221119064746.0150325e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012354072DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2015.9957512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParikh, Anish A.10aNutrition Label Formatting: Customer Perceptions and Behaviors  ap. 48-57.  aIn response to increasing U.S. obesity rates, legislators have begun mandating that chain restaurants make nutrition information available. While other studies have addressed various aspects of nutrition information labeling in restaurants, there has been little research into the efficacy of the various forms of delivery of restaurant nutrition information. The results of this study indicate that menu nutrition formatting has little impact on customer behavior. This study also found that when nutrition information was influential in the decision making process, consumers chose food items averaging 30% less calories.

GSLs also serve as receptors for different bacterial toxins. For example, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, GSLs function as receptors of the insecticidal Cry toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and mutations in bre genes involved in GSLs synthesis resulted in resistance to Cry5 toxin in this organism. However, the information of GSLs function in insects is still limited. In this study, three genes for glycosyltransferases, bre2, bre3, and bre4, from Helicoverpa armigera were identified and cloned. The previously reported bre5 gene from H. armigera was also analyzed. Protein sequence alignments revealed that proteins codified by H. armigera Bre shared high identity with homologous proteins from other organisms. Expression profile analysis revealed that the expressions of bre genes varied in the different tissues and also in the different developmental stages of H. armigera. Finally, the heterologous expression of bre genes in Trichoplusia ni Hi5 cell line showed that the corresponding translated proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of Hi5 cells. These results provide the bases for further functional studies of bre genes and analyzing potential roles of GSLs in mode of action of Cry1A toxin in H. armigera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aTrichoplusia ni 3aamino acid sequences 3acell differentiation 3acell lines 3acytoplasm 3aentomology 3agenes 3aglycosphingolipids 3aglycosyltransferases 3aheterologous gene expression 3ainvertebrates 3amechanism of action 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3avertebrates 0aglycosyltransferase 0amolecular cloning 0asubcellular localization1 aXiao, Yutao1 aDhiloo, Khalid Hussain1 aSoberón, Mario,1 aBravo, Alejandra1 aWu, Kongming0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2016 May 17, v. 109, no. 3 p.1415-1423dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245011100156300001600267520125400283592002801537650002501565650002201590650001901612650001901631650002101650650001601671650001701687650001301704650001001717650001701727650001101744650003101755650001801786650001601804650001201820650002201832650002201854650000801876650003901884650002001923650003001943650001901973650001601992650002702008650001602035653001802051653002502069653002002094653002902114700003502143700001902178700002802197700002002225700002102245773012902266856007102395852000902466655001202475IND60631247420221122055105.0190219s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063124742DNAL7 a10.1071/RD181242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKałuża, Anna14aThe content of immunomodulatory glycoepitopes in seminal plasma glycoproteins of fertile and infertile men  ap. 579-589.  aAccording to a concept of fetoembryonic defence, protein–carbohydrate interaction may be involved in the regulation of maternal immunity that prevents rejection of allograft spermatozoa, embryo and fetus. In the present study we focussed on the evaluation of the expression of glycoepitopes that may be of crucial importance in this process: LewisY (LeY) and LewisX (LeX) as well as terminal sialylation. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulphate was used to separate seminal plasma samples of fertile (n=10) and infertile (n=103) men; these were then probed with lectins specific to fucose (Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin and Ulex europaeus agglutinin) and sialic acid (Sambucus nigra agglutinin and Maackia amurensis agglutinin). Differential expression of α2,3-bound sialic acid was found in six out of seven analysed bands, whereas differences in the other analysed glycoepitopes were found in fewer numbers of bands. Mass spectrometry analysis focussed on the identification of proteins carrying glycans with immunomodulatory epitopes, including fibronectin, lactoferrin, clusterin, zinc-α2-glycoprotein, prostate acid phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen; these should be submitted to further detailed analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLotus tetragonolobus 3aMaackia amurensis 3aSambucus nigra 3aUlex europaeus 3aacid phosphatase 3aagglutinins 3aallografting 3aepitopes 3afetus 3afibronectins 3afucose 3agene expression regulation 3aglycoproteins 3alactoferrin 3alectins 3amass spectrometry 3amaternal immunity 3amen 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolysaccharides 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aseminal plasma 3asialic acid 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aspermatozoa 0aglycosylation 0ahuman seminal plasma 0alectin blotting 0amale decreased fertility1 aFerens-Sieczkowska, Mirosława1 aOlejnik, Beata1 aKołodziejczyk, Justyna1 aZimmer, Mariusz1 aKratz, Ewa Maria0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2019, v. 31, no. 3 p.579-589dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD181243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169300001600273520086500289592002801154650001201182650001101194650002101205650001601226650001801242650001501260650000901275650001401284650003301298650001201331650001401343650001401357651001701371653001801388653001801406653003201424700002401456773010001480856008401580852000901664655001201673IND60121771420221120184215.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012177142DNAL7 a10.1080/03670244.2013.8113862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMsaki, Mark M.10aMeasuring Household Food Security Using Food Intake Indicators in Rural Kwazulu Natal, South Africa  ap. 193-213.  aEstimation of micronutrients intake in food consumption surveys has generally been ignored. Focusing on similar households, a household food consumption survey (n = 200) was carried out in November 2004 (period of less) and March 2005 (period of plenty) in rural KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. Diet diversity, energy, protein and micronutrient intakes were proxies of household food security. Principal Component Analysis was used to estimate household food adequacy and strength of the variables (nutrients) in determining household intake variation amongst the community. On average, variation in household intake was contributed by energy (62.8%), iron (20.2%), protein (11.8%), vitamin E (3.8%), vitamin A (1.0%), and dietary diversity (0.3%). Linking food intake to household variables can generate plausible variables for measuring household food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3aenergy 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3airon 3anutrients 3aprincipal component analysis 3asurveys 3avitamin A 3avitamin E 3aSouth Africa 0afood adequacy 0afood security 0ahousehold food intake index1 aHendriks, Sheryl L.0 tEcology of food and nutrition.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 53, no. 2 p.193-213dRoutledgex1543-52377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03670244.2013.8113863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245011500213300001800328520164200346592002801988650001702016650003602033650001502069650001102084650002202095650001602117650001602133650001302149650001802162700001402180700002302194700005802217700002202275700002802297773012902325856008402454852000902538655001202547IND60598648120180809000000.0180702e20180419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059864812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b005292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivas-Ubach, Albert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1293-712710aMoving beyond the van Krevelen Diagram: A New Stoichiometric Approach for Compound Classification in Organisms  ap. 6152-6160.  avan Krevelen diagrams (O/C vs H/C ratios of elemental formulas) have been widely used in studies to obtain an estimation of the main compound categories present in environmental samples. However, the limits defining a specific compound category based solely on O/C and H/C ratios of elemental formulas have never been accurately listed or proposed to classify metabolites in biological samples. Furthermore, while O/C vs H/C ratios of elemental formulas can provide an overview of the compound categories, such classification is inefficient because of the large overlap among different compound categories along both axes. We propose a more accurate compound classification for biological samples analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry based on an assessment of the C/H/O/N/P stoichiometric ratios of over 130 000 elemental formulas of compounds classified in 6 main categories: lipids, peptides, amino sugars, carbohydrates, nucleotides, and phytochemical compounds (oxy-aromatic compounds). Our multidimensional stoichiometric compound classification (MSCC) constraints showed a highly accurate categorization of elemental formulas to the main compound categories in biological samples with over 98% of accuracy representing a substantial improvement over any classification based on the classic van Krevelen diagram. This method represents a signficant step forward in environmental research, especially ecological stoichiometry and eco-metabolomics studies, by providing a novel and robust tool to improve our understanding of the ecosystem structure and function through the chemical characterization of biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino sugars 3achemical constituents of plants 3aecosystems 3alipids 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3anucleotides 3apeptides 3astoichiometry1 aLiu, Yina1 aBianchi, Thomas S.1 aTolić, Nikola1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3950-91301 aJansson, Christer1 aPaša-Tolić, Ljiljana,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 19, v. 90, no. 10 p.6152-6160dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b005293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003400135040001800169100002200187245006600209300001300275506007600288520072200364592002801086506003701114650000801151650002201159650003701181650001101218650001301229650001401242650002501256650001501281650003101296650002401327650001101351650001701362650001101379650001101390650003101401650003601432700002001468700002201488700001701510773010601527856008001633852000901713655001201722IND50068563020221207141109.0150427e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006856302DNAL7 a235371092pmid7 aPMC40537752pmcid7 a10.1186/gb-2013-14-3-r302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilippe, Nicolas10aCRAC: an integrated approach to the analysis of RNA-seq reads  ap. 3121.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA large number of RNA-sequencing studies set out to predict mutations, splice junctions or fusion RNAs. We propose a method, CRAC, that integrates genomic locations and local coverage to enable such predictions to be made directly from RNA-seq read analysis. A k-mer profiling approach detects candidate mutations, indels and splice or chimeric junctions in each single read.

A potted experiment was conducted with two levels of growth regulators [i.e. with or without treatment with Seed king (Kinetine), Root king (Indole-butyric acid) and More king (Chitosan)], two maize cultivars (Calabar White and Obatanpa-98 and three nitrogen rates (0, 90 and 180 kg/ha in the form of urea). The measured parameters were growth attributes, nitrogen uptake, dry matter yield, harvest-index, shoot to root ratio, yield attributes and agronomic and physiological nitrogen use efficiency. Calabar White had taller plants (154.53 cm) more leaves (12.00) and larger leaf area (466.98 cm ²) than obatanpa-98 at 6 weeks after sowing. The dry matter yield of both leaf and stem increased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) with increasing N rates but the growth regulators significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased only the leaf dry matter. The interaction between growth regulators and nitrogen significantly affected the leaf dry matter but not the stem dry matter. There was a considerable (P ≤ 0.05) increase in harvest-index (HI) at the 90 kg/ha N rate with growth regulators and Obatanpa-98 had better HI (30.81%) than Calabar White (27.41%). Obatanpa 98 also had much (P ≤ 0.05) higher grain yield (87.42 g/plant) than Calabar White (65.40 g/plant) but for both cultivars, the grain yield increased progressively with increasing N rate. The uptake of N differed significantly (P ≤ 0.05) among the different partitions of maize (leaves, stems and grains) at various growth stages. Calabar White had the highest N uptake in the leaves and stem whether at silking or at harvest. Obatanpa-98 partitioned more N to the grains than Calabar White. Agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (ANUE) was highest (21.31 gg ⁻¹) at the 90 kg/ha N rate with Obatanpa-98 having a superior (20.26 gg ⁻¹) ANUE to Calabar White (15.94 gg ⁻¹). The physiological nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) was also highest (8.14 g/kg) at the 90 kg/ha N rate with Obatanpa-98 being more efficient (8.08 gkg) than Calabar White (6.26 g/kg). Thus, both cultivars treated with 90 kgN/ha with or without growth regulators would best optimize nitrogen fertilizer use. However, the growth regulators increased the yield of Calabar White significantly only when no N was applied. In contrast, they increased the yield of the hybrid Obatanpa-98 at all N rates especially at the 180 kgN/ha rate. Thus, under the low input cropping common with Calabar White, treatment with the growth regulators would boost yield. A combined treatment of 180 kg N/ha with the growth regulators would ensure the best yield of Obatanpa-98.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3acorn 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3adry matter accumulation 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3ahybrids 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplant growth substances 3aroot shoot ratio 3aseed treatment 3asowing 3astems 3aurea 0aGrowth regulators 0anitrogen fertilizer 0acorn growth 0aN use efficiency1 aPing, An1 aJohn, N.

Meanwhile, the anthropogenic impact on the P accumulation during the last century was distinguished from the natural one. The grain size, redox conditions, and major elements had close relationship with inorganic P, while there was a significant correlation between organic P and OM. Different relationships between Ca-bound P and Ca in the sediment indicated the anthropogenic Ca source besides the natural one. The marked anthropogenic impact on the lake was detected since 1950 AD, while it significantly intensified since 1970 AD. This change corresponded well to the history of the reclamation, constructions of dams, and reservoirs, the utilization of phosphate fertilizers, and the utilization of lime to kill off schistosomes. The P flux was applied to distinguish the anthropogenic versus natural P accumulation. Before 1950 AD, the natural P inputs by soil erosion, runoff, and so on, were the main source of P in the sediment, while thereafter the increasing human activity in the catchment resulted in more extra P or so-called anthropogenic P accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3airon 3alakes 3amanganese 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aWu, Yanhong1 aZhang, Yinjun1 aYang, Xiangdong0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 May, v. 71, no. 10 p.4553-4564dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2848-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012200170300001600292520151000308592002801818650002701846650001401873650002301887650002201910650001501932650001401947650001301961650001501974650002501989650001102014650001802025650001102043650002302054650001502077651001302092700002402105700002202129700002102151700002302172700002302195773010302218856008202321990002302403852000902426655001202435IND60097669220221119214754.0141104e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009766922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolk, Jennifer A.10aIntra- and inter-annual trends in phosphorus loads and comparison with nitrogen loads to Rehoboth Bay, Delaware (USA)  ap. 139-150.  aMonthly phosphorus loads from uplands, atmospheric deposition, and wastewater to Rehoboth Bay (Delaware) were determined from October 1998 to April 2002 to evaluate the relative importance of these three sources of P to the Bay. Loads from a representative subwatershed were determined and used in an areal extrapolation to estimate the upland load from the entire watershed. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and dissolved organic P (DOP) are the predominant forms of P in baseflow and P loads from the watershed are highest during the summer months. Particulate phosphorus (PP) becomes more significant in stormflow and during periods with more frequent or larger storms. Atmospheric deposition of P is only a minor source of P to Rehoboth Bay. During the period of 1998–2002, wastewater was the dominant external source of P to Rehoboth Bay, often exceeding all other P sources combined. Since 2002, however, due to technical improvements to the sole wastewater plant discharging directly to the Bay, the wastewater contribution of P has been significantly reduced and upland waters are now the principal source of P on an annualized basis. Based on comparison of N and P loads, primary productivity and biomass carrying capacity in Rehoboth Bay should be limited by P availability. However, due to the contrasting spatial and temporal patterns of N and P loading and perhaps internal cycling within the ecosystem, spatial and temporal variations in N and P-limitation within Rehoboth Bay are likely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3abase flow 3abiomass production 3acarrying capacity 3aecosystems 3ahighlands 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aprimary productivity 3astorms 3asubwatersheds 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awastewater 3aDelaware1 aScudlark, Joseph R.1 aSavidge, Karen B.1 aAndres, A.

However, investigations about the Al effects over salivary glands are still scarce. In this way, the present study aimed to investigate whether the Al chloride (AlCl₃) is able of triggering oxidative stress in parotid and submandibular glands of mice and also, if any morphological impairment is observed. For this, twenty mice were divided into two groups: Exposed group (EG), which received 18.5 mg/kg of AlCl₃ by intragastric gavage for 60 days and control group (CG), which received distilled water by intragastric gavage during the same period of time. After that, levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and malonaldehyde (MDA) were analyzed and we performed morphological analyses by evaluating the area of parenchyma, stroma, acini, and ducts in both glands. Statistical analyses were performed by Student’s t test and two-way ANOVA, adopting p < 0.05. No abnormal body weight was observed and data indicates that although both major salivary glands are susceptible to Al-induced oxidative stress, by increasing MDA and reducing GSH, only submandibular glands decreased the parenchyma and increased stroma area. Moreover, the submandibular glands showed smaller total area of acini and higher total area of ducts, in comparison with the control group. Notably, AlCl₃ induces oxidative stress in both glands, however, submandibular glands showed to be more susceptible to Al effects than parotid glands. Our study gives evidences about Al toxicity in parotid and submandibular glands and claims for new investigations to understand more mechanisms of Al-induced toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abody weight 3acentral nervous system 3achronic exposure 3aglutathione 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3atrace elements1 ade Oliveira Nunes, Paula Beatriz1 ade Oliveira Ferreira, Railson1 aEiró, Luciana Guimarães1 aBittencourt, Leonardo Oliveira1 ados Santos Chemelo, Victoria1 ados Santos, Sávio Monteiro1 ade Souza-Rodrigues, Renata Duarte1 aMonteiro, Marta Chagas1 aLima, Rafael Rodrigues1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1486-40130 tBiological trace element research.g2020 Dec., v. 198, no. 2 p.575-582dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02091-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011200166300001800278520105400296592002801350650001501378650001001393650001401403650001901417650002401436650001701460650001301477650002901490650001401519650003701533653002001570653002601590653001301616653001601629653001601645700005701661773014801718856008001866852000901946655001201955IND60639200420221122190628.0190501e20190416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063920042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b020852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHibi, Yoshihide10aOxidation of Procyanidins with Various Degrees of Condensation: Influence on the Color-Deepening Phenomenon  ap. 4940-4946.  aColor deepening in red rice is a known phenomenon that occurs during postharvest storage. As procyanidins potentially causes this color deepening, we previously subjected synthetic procyanidin B3, a model procyanidin, to chemical oxidation and determined the structures of the products. To further elucidate the effects of various degrees of polymerization on color deepening, in this study we oxidized synthetic procyanidin C2. The intensity of the UV–vis absorption between 300 and 500 nm in the spectrum of the reaction mixture increased with increasing oxidation time. This absorption following the oxidation of procyanidin C2 was more intense than that of procyanidin B3. HPLC-ESI-MS of the oxidized reaction mixture revealed several new peaks that suggested the formation of products with new intramolecular rather than intermolecular bonds. The major product was structurally identified by comparison with the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS data for a synthetic procyanidin C2 oxide, independently prepared by condensing procyanidin B3 oxide and taxifolin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acolor 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3apostharvest storage 3aprocyanidins 3ared rice 3atandem mass spectrometry 3ataxifolin 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0acolor deepening 0apolymerization degree 0acatechin 0aprocyanidin 0aHPLC-ESI-MS1 aYanase, Emiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6652-42590 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Apr. 16, v. 67, no. 17 p.4940-4946dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b020853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012800159300002000287520137100307592002801678650001101706650001701717650002101734650001401755650001101769650000901780650002201789650001801811650001201829650001301841650002201854650002001876650001301896700002101909700001901930700001801949700001701967700001201984700001601996700001602012700001802028773014402046856007402190852000902264655001202273IND60673185520221122190956.0191018e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067318552DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta08899g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Shenghui10aBioinspired large-scale production of multidimensional high-rate anodes for both liquid & solid-state lithium ion batteries  ap. 22958-22966.  aHigh-power electrode materials hold the key to the development of advanced fast charging/discharging lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein we develop a new bioinspired template method for large-scale production of multidimensional titanium niobium oxide (TNO) with an adjustable structure and morphology. Representative hierarchical porous TNO nanostructures (1D tubes, 2D flakes and 3D spheres) are controllably constructed and modulated. Relying on the self-assembly of crosslinked TNO, this approach enables us to obtain uniform multidimensional TNO with high porosity and a large surface-to-volume ratio, and thereby shorten the transport paths of ions/electrons and accelerate the redox reaction kinetics. Moreover, the dimension effect on Li ion storage is thoroughly studied. The unique architecture allows the designed TNO to be used at high-rates more than 20C (charging time of ∼3 min) in both liquid & solid-state LIBs. Through comparison of dimension effects, the 2D-TNO electrode shows the best performance with 171 mA h g⁻¹ at 40C in liquid electrolyte. Excitingly, it also exhibits outstanding high-rate capability (159 mA h g⁻¹, 20C) and stable cycling life in solid-state LIBs. Our results verify that the bioinspired technique is an effective way for large-scale synthesis of high-performance high-rate electrodes for electrochemical energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acrosslinking 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aions 3alithium batteries 3ananomaterials 3aniobium 3aporosity 3areaction kinetics 3aredox reactions 3atitanium1 aZhang, Shengzhao1 aDeng, Shengjue1 aPan, Guoxiang1 aWang, Yadong1 aLiu, Qi1 aWang, Xiuli1 aXia, Xinhui1 aTu, Jiangping0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 7, no. 40 p.22958-22966dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta08899g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245014500202300001800347520113200365592002801497650001701525650001501542650002301557650001401580650001501594650002001609650001901629650001601648650001301664650001201677650002301689650001401712650001901726650001801745650001401763650001401777650002001791700001701811700001701828700001301845700001801858700001601876773012401892856007402016852000902090655001202099IND60639927420221121043922.0190503e20170306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063992742DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc02926d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaiThese authors contributed equally to this work., Jinyu10aYolk–shell Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@PMO: amphiphilic magnetic nanocomposites as an adsorbent and a catalyst with high efficiency and recyclability  ap. 1336-1344.  aThis study describes the preparation of a multifunctional adsorptive catalyst by the incorporation of ligand groups within the channels of magnetic amphiphilic nanocomposites and attached with Pd nanoparticles. It was clearly demonstrated that Pd²⁺ was adsorbed by ligand-functionalized materials in water, and then Pd²⁺ was coordinated with ligand groups. Finally, the Pd nanoparticles were produced via an in situ reduction of Pd²⁺ by ligand groups through a simple hydrothermal process. Moreover, amphiphilic nanomaterials are viewed as excellent collectors of hydrophobic contaminants in water. The immobilized catalytic active sites with ligand-functionalized nanocomposites were allowed for maximal exposure to the reactants with minimal leaching of the Pd nanoparticles. The unique amphiphilic nanocomposites enabled selective oxidation of alcohols to proceed efficiently in water under aerobic conditions. Moreover, this nanocomposite catalyst could be completely recovered using an external magnet due to the superparamagnetic behavior of Fe₃O₄ and can be recycled with sustained selectivity and activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorbents 3aaerobic conditions 3acatalysts 3acollectors 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3airon oxides 3aleaching 3aligands 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3awater pollution1 aZou, Houbing1 aWang, Runwei1 aWang, Yu1 aShi, Zhiqiang1 aQiu, Shilun0 tGreen chemistry.g2017 Mar. 6, v. 19, no. 5 p.1336-1344dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6gc02926d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013200168300001600300520081400316592002801130650001401158650002301172650002501195650002601220650001801246650001001264650001401274650001501288650001901303653002901322653003301351653002501384700002001409773010501429856008401534852000901618655001201627IND60123541320221119064936.0150325e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012354132DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2013.7269532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrigui, Imene10aEffect of Experiential vs. Cognitive Involvement on Consumer Preferences: Application to Region of Origin Labeled Food Products  ap. 376-386.  aRegion of origin labeled food products consumption is influenced both by cognitive motives related to the individuals' health and safety concerns and by affective motives in relation within the pleasure, the emotional states and the social values. The objective of our study is to examine the effect of involvement and its nature (cognitive vs. experiential) on consumer preferences toward region of origin labeled food products. Discriminant analysis shows that both the cognitive and experiential dimensions of involvement discriminate between the two groups: those who prefer regional food products and those who prefer either national or foreign products. By targeting each profile by an adequate communication strategy, food labels could meet consumer expectations. Thus, their acceptance becomes higher.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer preferences 3adiscriminant analysis 3afood labeling 3afoods 3amarketing 3aprovenance 3asocial benefit 0aexperiential involvement 0aregion of origin food labels 0aconsumer preferences1 aGiraud, Georges0 tJournal of food products marketing.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 19, no. 5 p.376-386dRoutledgex1540-41027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454446.2013.7269533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001400137245012300151300001600274520149100290592002801781650000801809650002201817650002001839650001301859650001601872650002001888650001901908650001001927650001501937650002301952653000901975653002201984653001302006653002802019700001702047700001602064700001702080700001602097773012902113856007102242852000902313655001202322IND60631247820221122055141.0190219s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063124782DNAL7 a10.1071/RD181452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Minli10aEffects of ten–eleven translocation 1 (Tet1) on DNA methylation and gene expression in chicken primordial germ cells  ap. 509-520.  aTen–eleven translocation 1 (Tet1) is involved in DNA demethylation in primordial germ cells (PGCs); however, the precise regulatory mechanism remains unclear. In the present study the dynamics of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in developing PGCs and the role of Tet1 in PGC demethylation were analysed. Results show that 5mC levels dropped significantly after embryonic Day 4 (E4) and 5hmC levels increased reaching a peak at E5–E5.5. Interestingly, TET1 protein was highly expressed during E5 to E5.5, which showed a consistent trend with 5hmC. The expression of pluripotency-associated genes (Nanog, PouV and SRY-box 2 (Sox2)) and germ cell-specific genes (caveolin 1 (Cav1), piwi-like RNA-mediated gene silencing 1 (Piwi1) and deleted in azoospermia-like (Dazl)) was upregulated after E5, whereas the expression of genes from the DNA methyltransferase family was decreased. Moreover, the Dazl gene was highly methylated in early PGCs and then gradually hypomethylated. Knockdown of Tet1 showed impaired survival and proliferation of PGCs, as well as increased 5mC levels and reduced 5hmC levels. Further analysis showed that knockdown of Tet1 led to elevated DNA methylation levels of Dazl and downregulated gene expression including Dazl. Thus, this study reveals the dynamic epigenetic reprogramming of chicken PGCs invivo and the molecular mechanism of Tet1 in regulating genomic DNA demethylation and hypomethylation of Dazl during PGC development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA demethylation 3aDNA methylation 3achickens 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agene silencing 3agenes 3agerm cells 3amethyltransferases 0aDazl 0aDNA demethylation 0adynamics 0a5-hydroxymethylcytosine1 aLi, Dongfeng1 aCao, Wanyan1 aChen, Xiaolu1 aDu, Wenxing0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2019, v. 31, no. 3 p.509-520dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD181453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245016900207300001800376520153800394592002801932650001101960650004101971650001502012650001102027650002102038650002602059650001502085650002202100700002002122700005902142773012802201856008402329852000902413655001202422IND60598648520221119183121.0180702e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059864852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b005372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9059-025910aDetermination of Pesticides by Gas Chromatography Combined with Mass Spectrometry Using Femtosecond Lasers Emitting at 267, 400, and 800 nm as the Ionization Source  ap. 4886-4893.  aA standard sample mixture containing 51 pesticides was separated by gas chromatography (GC), and the constituents were identified by mass spectrometry (MS) using femtosecond lasers emitting at 267, 400, and 800 nm as the ionization source. A two-dimensional display of the GC/MS was successfully used for the determination of these compounds. A molecular ion was observed for 38 of the compounds at 267 nm and for 30 of the compounds at 800 nm, in contrast to 27 among 50 compounds when electron ionization was used. These results suggest that the ultraviolet laser is superior to the near-infrared laser for molecular weight determinations and for a more reliable analysis of these compounds. In order to study the conditions for optimal ionization, the experimental data were examined using the spectral properties (i.e., the excitation and ionization energies and absorption spectra for the neutral and ionized species) obtained by quantum chemical calculations. A few molecules remained unexplained by the currently reported rules, requiring additional rules for developing a full understanding of the femtosecond ionization process. The pesticides in the homogenized matrix obtained from kabosu (citrus sphaerocarpa) were measured using lasers emitting at 267 and 800 nm. The pesticides were clearly separated and measured on the two-dimensional display, especially for the data measured at 267 nm, suggesting that this technique would have potential for use in the practical trace analysis of the pesticides in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aionization 3alasers 3amolecular weight 3amultiresidue analysis 3apesticides 3aspectral analysis1 aImasaka, Tomoko1 aImasaka, Totaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4152-32570 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 06, v. 90, no. 7 p.4886-4893dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b005373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011800166300001800284520094600302592002801248650001701276650002301293650002301316650001401339650001401353650001301367650000901380650002601389650002301415650002201438650000901460650000901469650001501478650000901493653003001502653002101532653000901553653003001562653002301592700003101615700002101646773010901667856008501776852000901861655001201870IND60548848720221119235519.0160905e20160918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054884872DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2016.11617862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogiya, M.10aPhysiological basis of iron chlorosis tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) in relation to the root exudation capacity  ap. 1536-1546.  aMicronutrient deficiency in cultivable soil, particularly that of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), is a major productivity constraint in the world. Low Fe availability due to the low solubility of the oxidized ferric forms is a challenge. An experiment was, thus, executed to assess the performance of eight genetically diverse rice genotypes on Fe-sufficient (100 µM) and Fe-deficient (1 µM) nutrient solution, and their ability to recover from Fe deficiency was measured. Fe efficiency under Fe deficiency in terms of biomass production showed a significant positive correlation with the root release of phytosiderophore (PS) (R ² = 0.62*). This study shows that the Fe deficiency tolerance of Pusa 33 was related to both a high release of PS by the root and an efficient translocation of Fe from the root to the shoot as the Fe–PS complex, which could be useful for improving the Fe nutrition of rice particularly under aerobic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aaerobic conditions 3abiomass production 3achlorosis 3aexudation 3agenotype 3airon 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient solutions 3aphytosiderophores 3arice 3asoil 3asolubility 3azinc 0aIron deficiency chlorosis 0aphytosiderophore 0arice 0airon deficiency tolerance 0airon translocation1 aPāṇḍeya, Raghunātha,1 aSingh, Bhupinder0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2016 Sept. 18, v. 39, no. 11 p.1536-1546dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2016.11617863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013600161300001800297520199100315592002802306650002202334650001502356650002402371650001702395650001002412650001702422650002302439650001402462650002102476650001002497650002102507650001602528650001002544650002902554650002302583650002502606650002302631650002002654650001402674650002202688650001302710650002202723650001102745650002002756650001402776650002402790700001902814700001302833773011002846856008102956852000903037655001203046IND60519509920221120183619.0160501e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051950992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-015-0738-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Shan10aMolecular cloning, characterization, and comparison of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from Gracilaria chouae and Saccharina japonica  ap. 2051-2059.  aUridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) is an essential enzyme in algae, catalyzing the phosphorylation that forms UDP-glucose, the key precursor for biosynthesis of carbohydrates such as trehalose, cellulose, and starch. However, the current knowledge about algal UGP is quite little. Here, we conducted transcriptomic and genomic sequence analyses for algal UGPs. Only one UGP sequence was predicted in each red and brown algal species, and a particular UGP/phosphoglucomutase (PGM) fusion gene was found in some brown algae. Sequence comparisons indicated that these predicted UGPs exhibited significant identity to their fungal and plant orthologs, and the fusion UGP/PGM also had active sites conserved in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that eukaryotic algal and plant UGPs may originate from non-cyanobacterial prokaryotes via horizontal gene transfer, and the non-fusion UGP is the ancestral form. During the evolution of brown algae, UGP had undergone gene duplication and merged with a PGM segment, leading to UGP/PGM. This duplication may not exist in the common ancestor of brown algae and diatoms, but possibly occurred after species differentiation. To study the biochemical properties of algal UGPase, Gracilaria chouae UGP (GcUGP), Saccharina japonica UGP (SjUGP), and S. japonica UGP/PGM (SjUGP/PGM) were recombinantly expressed. GcUGP and SjUGP proteins catalyzed the phosphorylation reaction, with GcUGP having a higher catalytic efficiency (k cₐₜ /K ₘ) than SjUGP, and the optimal reaction conditions differed partly between these two species, possibly due to their divergent developmental processes and adaptabilities to marine environment. However, little UGPase or PGM activities were detected in fusion protein, which indicates the gene duplication may lead to gene neofunctionalization. The results offer a theoretical basis for further study of the role of UGPase in algae and algal functional product synthesis pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aGracilaria 3aSaccharina japonica 3aactive sites 3aalgae 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3agene duplication 3agene fusion 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amarine environment 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphoglucomutase 3aphosphorylation 3aphylogeny 3aprokaryotic cells 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3astarch 3atranscriptomics 3atrehalose 3auridine diphosphate1 aFeng, Yan-Jing1 aLiu, Tao0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2016 June, v. 28, no. 3 p.2051-2059dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-015-0738-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006700155300002000222520137000242592002801612650001101640650001401651650001101665650001101676650001901687650001201706700001301718700002001731700001701751700001401768700001901782700001701801773014401818856007401962852000902036655001202045IND60673185820221122190929.0191018e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067318582DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta09232c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhuo10aNano-Cu-embedded carbon for dendrite-free lithium metal anodes  ap. 22930-22938.  aLithium metal has been considered as a promising anode material for a long time because of its inherent high capacity and low potential. However, dendrite formation upon cycling hinders its application. Herein, a nano-Cu-embedded porous carbon (Cu@carbon) is synthesized by a simple heat treatment of a Cu–organic framework, and is then applied as a host for Li plating/stripping. It is found that the nano-Cu particles are uniformly embedded in the bulk and surface of the carbon, integrating high conductivity and high surface area. DFT calculations and experimental data indicate that the CuCₓ formed at the interface can serve as lithiophilic sites for Li nucleation and growth. As a result, the host material exhibits a dendrite-free Li plating/stripping. The half cell (Li‖Cu@carbon) shows a high coulombic efficiency of 99.3% over 200 cycles even with a high cycling capacity of 4 mA h cm⁻², and the Li@Cu@carbon based symmetric cell can be cycled stably for over 2000 h at 1.0 mA cm⁻². Furthermore, the corresponding Li-metal capacitor (activated carbon‖Li@Cu@carbon) and battery (LiFePO₄‖Li@Cu@carbon) exhibit high cycling stability, with 80.1% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles (capacitor) and 94.7% capacity retention after 1000 cycles (battery). These achievements make our anode among the most stable Li anodes reported so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acopper 3aheat treatment 3alithium1 aYu, Zhuo1 aWang, Bingliang1 aGuo, Zhaowei1 aWang, Nan1 aWang, Yonggang1 aXia, Yongyao0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 7, no. 40 p.22930-22938dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta09232c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01498naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008100169300001800250520044800268592002800716650005200744650001100796650001300807650001200820700001900832700001500851700001700866700002300883700001300906700001600919700002200935773009900957856008301056852000901139655001201148IND60710707020221122081020.0210506e20200917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071070702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColubri, Andrés10aPreventing Outbreaks through Interactive, Experiential Real-Life Simulations  ap. 1366-1371.  aOperation Outbreak (OO) is a Bluetooth-based simulation platform that teaches students how pathogens spread and the impact of interventions, thereby facilitating the safe reopening of schools.

The large dipole moment of C–F dipoles in P(VDF-HFP) is responsible for its high dielectric constant as well as its potentially ferroelectric behavior that must be minimized to avoid hysteretic current–voltage characteristics. A range of material grades and processing conditions are explored and are shown to have a significant effect on the degree of hysteresis observed in device-transfer characteristics. The percentage of HFP monomer in the P(VDF-HFP) dielectric has an effect on gate-dependent mobility induced by disorder at the semiconductor–dielectric interface. Most importantly, we present the considerations that must be made to achieve optimal performance in multiple device architectures of organic field-effect transistors when using P(VDF-HFP) as a dielectric layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric properties 3ahysteresis 3atransistors 0aorganic field-effect transistors (OFETs) 0apolymer gate dielectrics 0apoly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) 0aferroelectrics 0aelectrical stability1 aEftaiha, Ala’a F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4285-25461 aHuang, Jianfei1 aYang, Hao1 aSeifrid, Martin1 aWang, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4689-65381 aBazan, Guillermo C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2537-03101 aNguyen, Thuc-Quyen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8364-75170 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 09, v. 11, no. 17 p.15821-15828dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b208273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012600157300002000283520106800303592002801371650001701399650002601416650002101442650001101463650002101474650001601495650001101511650001301522650001401535650001201549650001701561650001901578700001901597700001601616773012301632856007501755852000901830655001201839IND60558994220221123011508.0161122e20131114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055899422DNAL7 a10.1021/jp40195372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chien
Y.10aDeciphering the Catalysis-Associated Conformational Changes of Human Adenylate Kinase 1 with Single-Molecule Spectroscopy  ap. 13947-13955.  aHuman adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 (AK1) is the key enzyme in maintaining the cellular energy homeostasis. The catalysis-associated conformational changes of AK1 involve large-amplitude rearrangements. To decipher the conformational changes of AK1 at the single-molecule level, we tagged AK1 with two identical fluorophores, one near the substrate-binding site and the other at the boundary of the core domain. We found that magnesium ion binding to AK1 increases the structural heterogeneity of AK1, whereas ADP binding reduces the structural heterogeneity. We exploited the hidden Markov model to extract the underlying catalysis-associated conformational dynamics and determined thermodynamic parameters of the multiple catalytic pathways. The third-order correlation difference calculated from photon fluctuation traces reveals the irreversible nature of the conformational motions, suggesting that single-molecule AK1 is in a nonequilibrium steady state. This discovery offers a fresh viewpoint to look into the molecular mechanisms of cellular biochemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenylate kinase 3aenergy 3afluorescent dyes 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aisozymes 3amagnesium 3aphotons 3aspectroscopy 3athermodynamics1 aHuang, Jung Y.1 aLo, Leu-Wei0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Nov. 14, v. 117, no. 45 p.13947-13955dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp40195373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014100173300001600314520152200330592002801852650002101880650002301901650001601924650002201940650001201962650001201974650001101986650001301997650002102010650002402031651001802055653002002073653001802093653002802111653002402139653002802163700002202191700001702213700002102230773011202251856008702363852000902450655001202459IND60567659720221121032338.0180830e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056765972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehboodi, Sahand10aInterconnection-wide hour-ahead scheduling in the presence of intermittent renewables and demand response: A surplus maximizing approach  ap. 336-351.  aThis paper describes a new approach for solving the multi-area electricity resource allocation problem when considering both intermittent renewables and demand response. The method determines the hourly inter-area export/import set that maximizes the interconnection (global) surplus satisfying transmission, generation and load constraints. The optimal inter-area transfer set effectively makes the electricity price uniform over the interconnection apart from constrained areas, which overall increases the consumer surplus more than it decreases the producer surplus. The method is computationally efficient and suitable for use in simulations that depend on optimal scheduling models. The method is demonstrated on a system that represents North America Western Interconnection for the planning year of 2024. Simulation results indicate that effective use of interties reduces the system operation cost substantially. Excluding demand response, both the unconstrained and the constrained scheduling solutions decrease the global production cost (and equivalently increase the global economic surplus) by $12.30B and $10.67B per year, respectively, when compared to the standalone case in which each control area relies only on its local supply resources. This cost saving is equal to 25% and 22% of the annual production cost. Including 5% demand response, the constrained solution decreases the annual production cost by $10.70B, while increases the annual surplus by $9.32B in comparison to the standalone case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer surplus 3acost effectiveness 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aexports 3aimports 3amodels 3aplanning 3aproducer surplus 3aresource allocation 3aNorth America 0aDemand response 0aEnergy market 0aRenewable intermittency 0aResource allocation 0aWestern interconnection1 aChassin, David P.1 aDjilali, Ned1 aCrawford, Curran0 tApplied energy.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 189 p.336-351dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012100163300001800284520101800302592002801320650001101348650001701359650002101376650001901397650001601416650001501432650001901447650001401466650002001480650001901500650001701519650002101536700001801557700005301575700001301628700005201641773012901693856008401822852000901906655001201915IND60598648820221119183056.0180702e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059864882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b005472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Fang10aDual-Responsive Metabolic Precursor and Light-Up AIEgen for Cancer Cell Bio-orthogonal Labeling and Precise Ablation  ap. 6718-6724.  aMetabolic glycoengineering of unnatural glycans with bio-orthogonal chemical groups and a subsequent click reaction with fluorescent probes have been widely used in monitoring various bioprocesses. Herein, we developed a dual-responsive metabolic precursor that could specifically generate unnatural glycans with azide groups on the membrane of targeted cancer cells with high selectivity. Moreover, a water-soluble fluorescent light-up probe with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) was synthesized, which turned its fluorescence on upon a click reaction with azide groups on the cancer cell surface, enabling special cancer cell imaging with low background signal. Furthermore, the probe can generate ¹O₂ upon light irradiation, fulfilling its dual role as an imaging and therapeutic agent for cancer cells. Therefore, the concepts of the cancer-cell-specific metabolic precursor cRGD–S-Ac₃ManNAz and the AIE light-up probe are promising in bio-orthogonal labeling and cancer-specific imaging and therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazides 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolysaccharides 3asinglet oxygen 3atherapeutics 3awater solubility1 aYuan, Youyong1 aWu, Wenbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6794-217X1 aMao, Duo1 aLiu, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0956-27770 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 30, v. 90, no. 11 p.6718-6724dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b005473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010600171300001400277520111500291592002801406650000901434650001801443650000901461650001501470650001801485650002401503651001301527653002201540653001501562653001301577653002201590700001901612773012301631856008401754852000901838655001201847IND60121772420221121114840.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012177242DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2014.8562502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Kevin N.10aTrends in Intake and Outcome Data for Animal Shelters in a Large U.S. Metropolitan Area, 1989 to 2010  ap. 59-72.  aTrends in nonhuman animal shelter intake and outcomes for dogs and cats in Metro Denver, CO, between 1989 and 2010 were assessed by linear regression analyses of data from 4 of the largest facilities covering 3 counties. The data were analyzed for trends on 3 scales: actual numbers per year, number per 1,000 residents per year, and as a percentage of total intake. Approximately 21,000 dogs and 16,000 cats were taken into the shelters in 2010, representing a 24% decrease for each since 1989. For dogs on a per-1,000-residents basis, intake decreased by 44%, euthanasia by 77%, and adoption by 13%; the live release rate (LRR) increased by 39%. For cats on the same scale, there was a 53% decrease in intake until 1998 followed by an 11% increase through 2010, and an 82% decrease in euthanasia until 2000 followed by a 24% increase through 2010. Adoption of cats per 1,000 residents remained unchanged, but the overall LRR for cats doubled during the study period. Substantially increasing trends in the transfer of dogs and cats from shelters to rescue organizations reflect efforts to optimize adoptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3adata analysis 3adogs 3aeuthanasia 3alinear models 3aregression analysis 3aColorado 0aanimal sheltering 0aeuthanasia 0aadoption 0alive release rate1 aGies, David L.0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 17, no. 1 p.59-72dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2014.8562503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001900158245011300177300001400290500001900304520197700323592002802300650001302328650001602341650002302357650000902380650001402389650001802403650002702421650002102448650001202469650001702481650002602498650002002524650001702544650002302561650001402584650002002598653001302618653002102631653001402652653002302666700001702689700001902706700002002725700001402745700001902759700001902778700001502797700001702812773009602829856009302925852000903018655001203027IND60710707220221122081112.0201104e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071070722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guo-Min10aArginine infusion rescues ovarian follicular development in feed-restricted Hu sheep during the luteal phase  ap. 75-83.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of arginine (Arg) on follicular development of acute feed-restricted ewes during the luteal phase. From day 6 of the estrous cycle, 24 multiparous Hu sheep were randomly assigned into three groups: control group (a maintenance diet; n = 6), feed restriction group (0.5 maintenance diet, saline infusion; n = 9) and Arg treatment group (0.5 maintenance diet, infusion with 155 μmol of Arg-HCl/kg body weight; n = 9). The intravenous administrations were performed three times per day from day 6 to day 15 of the estrous cycle. At the end of treatment, the hypothalamus and pituitary were collected, as well as the follicular fluid (FF) and granulose cells (GCs) in the ≥2.5 mm follicles. The transcription level of NPVF was significantly increased, and the expression level of GNRH was significantly decreased in the hypothalamus with feed restriction. In addition, feed restriction significantly decreased the number of ≥2.5 mm follicles in the ovaries. In the ≥2.5 mm follicles, feed restriction significantly increased estradiol (E₂) level in FF and the expression levels of steroidogenesis related genes (STAR, 3BHSD and CYP19A1) in GCs, while significantly decreased the expressions of FSHR and cell proliferation related genes (YAP1, CCND1 and PCNA) in GCs. Moreover, the activities of glucose metabolism enzymes (PFKP and G6PDH) were significantly decreased in GCs of the ≥2.5 mm follicles with feed restriction. Interestingly, as a precursor of nitric oxide, Arg supplementation can rescue the effects of feed restriction on follicular development by enhancing glucose metabolism and cell proliferation of GCs, and alleviating the abnormal E₂ secretion in the ≥2.5 mm follicles, accompanied with recovering the expressions of NPVF and GNRH in the hypothalamus. These findings will be helpful for understanding the role of nutrition and Arg in sheep follicular development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3abody weight 3acell proliferation 3adiet 3aestradiol 3aestrous cycle 3afollicular development 3afollicular fluid 3aglucose 3ahypothalamus 3aintravenous injection 3amenstrual cycle 3anitric oxide 3arestricted feeding 3asecretion 3asteroidogenesis 0aHu sheep 0aFeed restriction 0aFollicles 0aGlucose metabolism1 aGuo, Yi-Xuan1 aCheng, Chun-Yu1 aEl-Samahy, M.A.1 aTong, Ran1 aGao, Xiao-Xiao1 aDeng, Kai-Ping1 aWang, Feng1 aLei, Zhi-hai0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Dec., v. 158 p.75-83dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245013800206300001600344500001900360520156400379592002801943596016201971650001602133650002802149650001302177650001002190650001602200650001202216650001802228650001602246650001202262650002302274650001802297650001002315650002102325650000902346650001302355650001202368700005902380700001902439773012302458856008202581852000902663655001202672IND60714650920221120063644.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071465092DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02100-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKról, Ewelina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9942-132814aThe Influence of Taurine Supplementation on Serum and Tissular Fe, Zn and Cu Levels in Normal and Diet-Induced Insulin-Resistant Rats  ap. 592-601.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTaurine (Tau) is a β-sulphonated amino acid postulated to improve glucose homeostasis in insulin resistance and diabetes. Changes in carbohydrate metabolism are accompanied by oxidative stress, which may disturb the mineral balance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of Tau supplementation on the levels of trace elements in rats fed either a standard (AIN-93M, 4% fat) diet or a modified high-fat diet (30% fat). For 8 weeks, male Wistar rats were fed these diets supplemented with 3% Tau. Taurine supplementation normalized increased serum insulin concentration and insulin resistance index; however, it did not improve serum CRP concentration in high-fat diet fed rats. The high-fat diet supplemented with Tau decreased the renal and splenic Zn levels, but the tissular Fe content did not change. The effect of Tau supplementation on the mineral balance to some extent depended on the fat content in the rats’ diet. The high-fat diet supplemented with Tau decreased the rats’ splenic Zn levels but increased their femur levels. In the group fed the standard diet, Tau reduced the rats’ femur Zn level, whereas their splenic Zn level was comparable. Tau supplementation decreased the renal Cu level and serum ceruloplasmin concentration in the rats fed the standard diet, but this effect was not observed in the rats fed the high-fat diet. In conclusion, supplementary taurine failed to ameliorate disturbances in mineral homeostasis caused by high-fat diet feeding and led to tissular redistribution of Zn and Cu in the rat.  aPublisher supplied data  agrants for the development of young scientists of the Poznań University of Life Sciences No. 507.786.30 and 507.786.43.cUniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu 3ablood serum 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3adiabetes 3afemur 3aferroxidase 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid content 3amales 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aresearch 3ataurine1 aOkulicz, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5155-03581 aKupsz, Justyna0 tBiological trace element research.g2020 Dec., v. 198, no. 2 p.592-601dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02100-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008900171300001800260520075000278592002801028650001701056650002601073650003001099650001301129650002301142650002101165650001901186653002501205653002101230653002101251653002401272653001901296700001801315773011201333856008401445852000901529655001201538IND60604061720221118062334.0180716e20151209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060406172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.10.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazdar, Katarina12aA computational study of regioselectivity in β-lactam iminothiazolidinone formation  ap. 6908-6911.  aDensity functional theory calculations were performed to explain the different regioselectivity for the formation of β-lactam iminothiazolidinones. Computational results were in agreement with experimental observations that phenyl and cyclohexyl derivatives led to the thermodynamically more stable regioisomers formed by cyclization at the nitrogen atom directly attached to the β-lactam ring which was in contrast to the n-hexyl derivative where the regioisomer with the β-lactam ring attached to the imino bond is more stable instead. It was demonstrated that the different regioselectivity was the consequence of larger steric effects when bulky substituents and the leaving ethoxy group were in close contact during the cyclization step.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactams 3acyclization reactions 3adensity functional theory 3anitrogen 3apositional isomers 3aregioselectivity 3athermodynamics 0aIminothiazolidinones 0aRegioselectivity 0aDFT calculations 0aFree energy barrier 0aSteric effects1 aVazdar, Mario0 tTetrahedron letters.g2015 Dec. 09, v. 56, no. 49 p.6908-6911dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.10.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03885naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245016800161300002000329520196400349592002802313650001602341650001602357650002702373650002402400650001502424650001502439650000902454650001902463650001902482650001602501650003102517650001502548650001102563650001302574650001902587650001302606650002102619650002202640650001602662653001502678653002302693653001602716653001602732653002802748653002702776700001902803700001902822700001502841700007202856700005602928700005802984773014203042856007803184961001203262852000903274655001203283IND60639201020221122154355.0190501e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063920102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b216792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinyuan10aZwitterionic Gadolinium(III)-Complexed Dendrimer-Entrapped Gold Nanoparticles for Enhanced Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Lung Cancer Metastasis  ap. 15212-15221.  aDesign of dual mode or multimode contrast agents or nanoplatforms with antifouling properties is crucial for improved cancer diagnosis since the antifouling materials are able to escape the clearance of the reticuloendothelial system with improved pharmacokinetics. Herein, we present the creation of zwitterionic gadolinium(III) (Gd(III))-complexed dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DEN) for enhanced dual mode computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of lung cancer metastasis. In the present work, poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers of generation 5 were partially decorated with carboxybetanie acrylamide (CBAA), 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), and 1,3-propane sultone (1,3-PS), respectively at different degrees, then used to entrap Au NPs within their interiors, and finally acetylated to cover their remaining amine termini. Through protein resistance, macrophage cellular uptake, and pharmacokinetics assays, we show that zwitterionic Au DEN modified with 1,3-PS exhibit the best antifouling property with the longest half-decay time (37.07 h) when compared to the CBAA- and MPC-modified Au DEN. Furthermore, with the optimized zwitterion type, we then prepared zwitterionic Gd(III)-loaded Au DEN modified with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide for targeted dual mode CT/MR imaging of a lung cancer metastasis model. We disclose that the designed multifunctional Au DEN having an Au core size of 2.7 nm and a surface potential of 7.6 ± 0.9 mV display a good X-ray attenuation property, relatively high r₁ relaxivity (13.17 mM s–¹), acceptable cytocompatibility, and targeting specificity to αᵥβ₃ integrin-expressing cancer cells and enable effective dual mode CT/MR imaging of a lung cancer metastasis model in vivo. The developed multifunctional zwitterion-functionalized Au DEN may be potentially adopted as an effective nanoprobe for enhanced dual-modal CT/MR imaging of other cancer types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aacrylamides 3aantifouling activities 3acomputed tomography 3adendrimers 3agadolinium 3agold 3aimage analysis 3alung neoplasms 3amacrophages 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ametastasis 3amodels 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3apeptides 3apharmacokinetics 3aphosphorylcholine 3azwitterions 0adendrimers 0agold nanoparticles 0aRGD peptide 0azwitterions 0adual mode CT/MR imaging 0alung cancer metastasis1 aXiong, Zhijuan1 aZhang, Jiulong1 aPeng, Chen1 aKlajnert-Maculewicz, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3459-89471 aShen, Mingwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1065-08541 aShi, Xiangyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6785-66450 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 09, v. 11, no. 17 p.15212-15221dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b216793Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011800163300002000281520099700301592002801298650001101326650001201337650001301349650001301362650001201375650001101387650002301398700001701421700002001438700002301458773012301481856007501604852000901679655001201688IND60558994520221119060926.0161122e20131114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055899452DNAL7 a10.1021/jp405154d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKevorkyants, Ruslan10aCalculating Hyperfine Couplings in Large Ionic Crystals Containing Hundreds of QM Atoms: Subsystem DFT Is the Key  ap. 13967-13974.  aWe present an application of the linear scaling frozen density embedding (FDE) formulation of subsystem DFT to the calculation of isotropic hyperfine coupling constants (hfcc’s) of atoms belonging to a guanine radical cation embedded in a guanine hydrochloride monohydrate crystal. The model systems range from an isolated guanine to a 15 000 atom QM/MM cluster where the QM region is comprised of 36 protonated guanine cations, 36 chlorine anions, and 42 water molecules. Our calculations show that the embedding effects of the surrounding crystal cannot be reproduced by small model systems nor by a pure QM/MM procedure. Instead, a large QM region is needed to fully capture the complicated nature of the embedding effects in this system. The unprecedented system size for a relativistic all-electron isotropic hfcc calculation can be approached in this work because the local nature of the electronic structure of the organic crystals considered is fully captured by the FDE approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3achlorine 3acrystals 3aguanine 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry1 aWang, Xiqiao1 aClose, David

Using data from a prospective multicenter study, serum calcium concentration, as well as thorough demographic and medical characteristics, were determined in 194 cases with newly diagnosed, clinicopathologically confirmed PC and 317 controls, without any malignant disease, admitted to the same network of hospitals. Serum total and ionized calcium levels were categorized into tertiles. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) after adjustment for major potential confounders, including age, BMI, smoking, alcohol, education, occupation, marital status, family history of PC, and sex hormones level. The mean serum calcium level (±SD) in case and control groups was 9.22 (±0.46) mg/dl and 9.48 (±0.51) mg/dl, respectively (P < 0.001). After adjustment for mentioned confounders, a significant trend of decreasing risk was found for serum total calcium concentration (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.12–0.59, comparing the highest with the lowest tertile) and ionized calcium (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.10–0.58). An increase of 1 mg/dl in serum calcium level was associated with a significant decrease in PC risk (OR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.34–0.76). Our findings reveal the inverse association between serum total and ionized concentrations and PC risk, which supports the hypothesis that calcium may protect against PC. Furthermore, no evidence was found regarding age, BMI, and sex steroid hormones to modify the association between serum calcium and PC risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acalcium 3aconfidence interval 3aeducation 3ahospitals 3aionization 3amarital status 3anutrition 3aodds ratio 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asex hormones 3asteroid hormones1 aHosseini, Mostafa1 aAllameh, Farzad1 aBabakoohi, Shahab1 aMehrsai, Abdolrasoul1 aPourmand, Gholamreza0 tNutrition and cancer.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 65, no. 7 p.961-968dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl11654x0163-55817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2013.8069363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002500158245015300183300001600336500001900352520136900371592002801740650001101768650001501779650001101794650001801805650001501823650001101838650001201849650001401861650001701875650001901892650001401911650001601925650001401941650001301955650001401968650001101982650001101993653001802004653001002022653001702032700002702049700002902076700002602105773009802131856009302229852000902322655001202331IND60710707420221122081111.0201104e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071070742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeguelini, Mateus R.10aMorphophysiological variations of the female reproductive organs of the vespertilionid bat Myotis nigricans during its different reproductive phases  ap. 121-137.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMyotis nigricans is an important species of insectivorous bat from the Vespertilionidae family, which is endemic of the Neotropics. Despite its wide distribution, no detailed study of the reproduction is found for this species. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate and characterize morphological and morphometric variations of the female reproductive organs of M. nigricans during its different reproductive phases. Twenty adult females were collected, divided into four (4) sample groups, according to the reproductive status (nonreproductive, initial and advanced pregnancy and lactating), and submitted to anatomical, histological and morphometric analyses. The results demonstrated that the female reproductive organs of M. nigricans were composed of the ovaries, the uterus, the uterine tubes and the vagina, in addition to the mammary glands. The ovaries present a great number of interstitial glands and a small but persistent corpus luteum. Ovulation is simple, unilateral and non-preferential, possibly alternated in successive ovulations and may be sequential with the occurrence of postpartum estrus. The uterus is bicornuate, implantation is fundic and the placenta is chorioallantoic, discoidal and hemochorial. The vaginal epithelium is weakly keratinized and shows great disorganization during the periods of pregnancy and lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyotis 3aNeotropics 3aadults 3acorpus luteum 3aepithelium 3aestrus 3afemales 3ahistology 3ainsectivores 3akeratinization 3alactation 3amorphometry 3aovulation 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3auterus 3avagina 0aMammary gland 0aOvary 0aUterine tube1 aSantiago, Cornélio S.1 aMorielle-Versute, Eliana1 aTaboga, Sebastião R.0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Dec., v. 158 p.121-137dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003000137245014700167300001600314520181000330592002802140650001502168650002502183650001702208650001502225650001102240650002102251650002702272650002302299650001702322650001202339650001602351650001302367650001802380650001102398653003702409653001502446653002102461700002202482700002802504700003202532700003202564700003102596700002202627773012902649856007102778852000902849655001202858IND60631248320221122035138.0190219s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063124832DNAL7 a10.1071/RD182162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadrid Gaviria, Stephania10aResveratrol supplementation promotes recovery of lower oxidative metabolism after vitrification and warming of invitro-produced bovine embryos  ap. 521-528.  aAlthough vitrification is the current method of choice for oocyte and embryo cryopreservation, it may have detrimental effects on reduction–oxidation status and mitochondrial activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementing invitro culture (IVC) media and/or vitrification solutions with the antioxidant resveratrol on active mitochondria, mitochondrial superoxide production and lipid peroxidation. Abattoir-derived oocytes were matured and fertilised invitro using standard procedures. Following IVF (21h later), zygotes were cultured in IVC medium supplemented with 0 or 0.5µM resveratrol. On Day 7, blastocysts were vitrified using the Cryotech Vitrification Kit (Cryo Tech Laboratory) with or without 0.5µM resveratrol. After warming, active mitochondria, mitochondrial superoxide production and lipid peroxidation were evaluated using Mito Tracker Green FM, MitoSOX Red and BODIPY581/591 C11 staining respectively. The vitrification–warming process significantly increased active mitochondria and mitochondrial superoxide production in bovine embryos (P<0.05, ANOVA). The addition of 0.5µM resveratrol to the IVC medium or vitrification solutions significantly attenuated the increase in active mitochondria (P<0.05), but not in mitochondrial superoxide production, whereas embryos cultured and vitrified with resveratrol showed the highest values for both parameters (P<0.05). Regarding lipid peroxidation, no significant differences were detected between treatments. In conclusion, resveratrol supplementation of IVC medium or vitrification solutions contributes to recovery of an embryo’s ‘quieter’ state (i.e. lower oxidative metabolism) after vitrification. However, supplementation of both solutions with resveratrol seemed to have a pro-oxidant effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobiosis 3aanalysis of variance 3aantioxidants 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3acryopreservation 3ain vitro fertilization 3alipid peroxidation 3amitochondria 3aoocytes 3aresveratrol 3astaining 3avitrification 3azygote 0aassisted reproductive technology 0ablastocyst 0aoxidative stress1 aMorado, Sergio A.1 aLópez Herrera, Albeiro1 aRestrepo Betancur, Giovanni1 aUrrego Álvarez, Rodrigo A.1 aEcheverri Zuluaga, Julián1 aCética, Pablo D.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2019, v. 31, no. 3 p.521-528dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD182163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014200168300001400310520065500324592002800979650001001007650003001017650002001047650001701067651001101084653002001095653001701115653001101132653002101143653001701164700001901181700002401200773012701224856008301351852000901434655001201443IND60519510520221123033328.0160501e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051951052DNAL7 a10.2994/SAJH-D-15-00022.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalagoli, Leo R.14aThe Advertisement Call of Proceratophrys pombali (Amphibia: Anura: Odontophrynidae) with Comments on Its Distribution and Natural History  ap. 18-24.  aWe describe the advertisement call of Proceratophrys pombali and provide data on its distribution and natural history in Núcleo Curucutu, Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar, Itanhaém, São Paulo, Brazil, and Mongaguá, São Paulo, Brazil.

Such surfaces have proved to be highly repellent to various liquids immiscible with the lubricant. Depending on the underlying surface chemistry, different lubricants can be used, including perfluorinated or alkylated oils. Here, we construct patterned slippery surfaces that consist of virtual channels permanently impregnated with an organic oil and surrounded by areas permanently impregnated with a perfluorinated oil. We demonstrate that water droplets preferentially occupy the organic-oil-lubricated virtual channels. Based on a simple model, we evaluate the forces acting on droplets crossing over to the regions impregnated with perfluorinated oil and show that the cloaking of the droplets plays an important role. We study the actuation of droplets in virtual oil-in-oil channels based on gravity and magnetic fields. Finally, we construct a variety of organic-oil-lubricated channel architectures permitting droplet sorting according to size. We believe that this novel approach for the formation of virtual all-liquid surface-tension-confined channels based on lubricant-infused surfaces, channel networks, or patterns will advance the field of droplet-based microfluidics. The approach presented can be potentially useful for applications in biotechnology, diagnostics, or analytical chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiotechnology 3acomposite materials 3acrossing over 3adiagnostic techniques 3adroplets 3agravity 3alubricants 3amagnetic fields 3amicrofluidic technology 3amodels 3aoils 0adroplet microfluidics 0apatterned slippery surfaces 0aopen microfluidics 0aliquid−liquid interfaces 0adigital microfluidics 0apassive droplet sorting1 aHardt, Steffen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7476-10701 aLevkin, Pavel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5975-948X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 11, no. 17 p.16130-16138dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b218793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015600169300001500325520224800340592002802588650001502616650001102631650001902642650001802661650001002679650002902689650001502718650001902733650001302752650002302765650001902788650004002807650001802847650001302865650001602878650001602894650000902910700002602919700002002945700001802965700001402983700002002997700002103017773010303038856008203141990002303223852000903246655001203255IND60097670320221116142607.0141104e20120120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009767032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErga, Svein Rune10aDynamics of phytoplankton distribution and photosynthetic capacity in a western Norwegian fjord during coastal upwelling: Effects on optical properties  ap. 91-103.  aThe present study describes the coupling between optical properties and the dynamics of phytoplankton distribution and photosynthetic capacity in the Lysefjord during an exceptional coastal upwelling. At the mouth of the fjord, transparent Coastal water was “piled up” against the sill, while more turbid Fjord water from the outer fjord system was flowing over the sill, creating the intermediate layer which extended further into the fjord. This was reflected by high spectral attenuation coefficients in the upper 10 m of the fjord. Outside the sill, clear water with low spectral attenuation coefficients were found below sill depth down to at least 30 m, while the attenuation coefficients inside the sill were significantly higher between 10 and 20 m. About 4–7 km outwards from the head of the fjord clearer deep basin water was entering the upper layer due to the upwelling which could be traced up to 7 m, bounded by the 7.5 °C and the 31 salinity isolines. In the outer part of the fjord waters with a high chl a content and photosynthetic capacity were observed below the outflowing surface layer containing “old water” from the inner part of the fjord, which was characterized by low nutrient and chl a concentrations. Maximum quantum efficiencies (0.5) were encountered within this subsurface layer. Quantum efficiencies exceeded 0.3 when nitrate and silicate concentrations increased above 2 mmol m⁻³. About 50% of the PAR light attenuation (0–30 m) was caused by chl a, and the 1% light depth varied between 27 and 35 m along the transect. Due to the influence of freshwater outlets, non-pigmented particles were more abundant in the inner part of the fjord than in the outer part. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) contributed strongly to absorption within the upper 10 m at wavelengths below 470 nm while scattering was the major attenuation contributor for wavelengths above 600 nm. With respect to possible climate change effects on the growth of phytoplankton in Norwegian fjords, our results indicate that the alteration of coastal wind patterns due to its impact on coastal – fjord water exchanges, is probably more important than increased temperature and/or increased precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abasins 3aclimate change 3acoastal water 3acolor 3adissolved organic matter 3afreshwater 3aisogenic lines 3anitrates 3aoptical properties 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3atemperature 3awavelengths 3awind1 aSsebiyonga, Nicolausi1 aFrette, Øyvind1 aHamre, Børge1 aAure, Jan1 aStrand, Øivind1 aStrohmeier, Tore0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 97 p.91-103dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.11.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012400166300001400290520071700304592002801021650001601049650002501065650002601090650001001116650001101126650002801137650002201165650002401187650001001211651001801221653003001239653001601269653003901285653002601324700002001350773010301370856008401473852000901557655001201566IND60123542220221119064715.0150325e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012354222DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2013.8074082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamal, Sara10aExamining the Relationship Between Advertising Expenditures and Sales of Quick-Service Restaurants in the United States  ap. 55-74.  aThe United States fast-food industry represents an important business sector with respect to national and international economics.

Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) are highly biocompatible and their properties can be easily tuned. In this work, the role of different N-functionalities in the drug delivery performance of N-GQDs was investigated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicated that the magnitude of binding energy between the gemcitabine (GC) drug and the central N-GQDs, i.e., graphitic, pyridinic and amido, was greater than that of pristine GQDs and edge N-GQDs. The quantum molecular descriptors revealed that adsorption of GC drug on the nanocarriers enhanced the chemical reactivity. The adsorption of the GC drug on the nanocarriers was spontaneously proceeded. However, the Gibbs free energy values for adsorption of the GC drug on the center N-GQDs were greater than those of pristine GQDs and edge N-GQDs. Also, the nature of the intermolecular interactions between the GC drug and nanocarriers was further investigated through quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and noncovalent interaction index (NCI). The simulation results demonstrated that the GC drug was loaded on the surface of all nanocarriers, while favorable drug release could occur only from the center N-GQDs in acidic environments of cancer tissues. Finally, the mechanism for the penetration of the drug-loaded nanocarriers across the cell membrane was studied and discussed via steered molecular dynamics (SMD). The results indicated that the force required to pull the drug-loaded nanocarriers was the smallest when the nanocarriers were penetrated perpendicularly rather than parallelly or obliquely into the membrane plane. Overall, the results suggested that the center N-GQDs had better performance in drug delivery than pristine GQDs and edge N-GQDs. Our findings offer insightful information on efficient utilization of N-GQDs as drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3acell membranes 3achemical interactions 3achemical reactions 3adensity functional theory 3adrugs 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasms 3anitrogen 3aquantum dots 3aquantum mechanics1 aShariatinia, Zahra0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Oct. 16, v. 7, no. 40 p.6156-6171dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb00971j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010800168300001600276520155100292592002801843650000901871650002301880650001601903650001101919650001801930650000901948650001301957650001601970650001701986650001702003650002502020650000902045650001502054653002102069653002202090653001802112653002002130653002002150653002602170700002202196700006002218700002402278700002002302773009802322856008702420852000902507655001202516IND60567660120221119102022.0180830e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056766012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoel, Lance10aCost minimization of generation, storage, and new loads, comparing costs with and without externalities  ap. 110-121.  aThe goal of this research is to understand the economics of anticipated large-scale changes in the electric system. 86 million different combinations of renewable generation (wind and solar), natural gas, and three storage types (hydrogen storage, electric vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, and building heat) are modeled within the PJM Interconnection. The corresponding electric systems are then operated and constrained to meet the load every hour over four years. The total cost of each energy system is calculated, both with and without externalities, to find the least cost energy systems.Using today’s costs of conventional and renewable electricity and without adding any externalities, the cost-minimum system includes no renewable generation, but does include EVs. When externalities are included, however, the most cost-effective to system covers 50% of the electric load with renewable energy and runs reliably without need for either new conventional generation or purpose-built storage.The three novel energy policy implications of this research are: (1) using today’s cost of renewable electricity and estimates of externalities, it is cost effective to implement 240GW of renewable electricity to meet 50% of the total electric load; (2) there is limited need to construct new natural gas power plants, especially from a system-wide perspective; and (3) existing coal plants may still be useful to the energy system, and instead of being retired, should be repurposed to occasionally provide generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acost effectiveness 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3anatural gas 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3avehicles (equipment) 3awind 3awind power 0aRenewable energy 0aElectric vehicles 0aExternalities 0aVehicle-to-grid 0aEnergy modeling 0aRenewable integration1 aBrodie, Joseph F.1 aKempton, Willett1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-89541 aArcher, Cristina L.1 aBudischak, Cory0 tApplied energy.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 189 p.110-121dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015700166300001600323520083600339592002801175650002201203650001401225650002301239650002201262650003401284650001101318650001201329650002101341650003301362650004401395650001501439650001901454700001701473773012001490856008201610852000901692655001201701IND60618851820221119035622.0181030e197911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061885182DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517579049011022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, R.A.F.10aStructure-Property Relationships in Polytetramethylene Terephthalate/Polytetramethylene Isophthalate Copolyesters Part I : Glass-Transition Temperatures  ap. 623-631.  aThe glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of a series of polytetramethylene terephthalate/polytetramethylene isophthalate, copolyesters have been measured by a variety of methods including differential thermal analysis, dilatometry, and broad- line nuclear magnetic resonance. The values measured for Tg are discussed in relation to differences in copolymer com position, sample crystallinity and the method used in the measurement of Tg. An increase in the isophthalate content of the copolyester has been found to decrease T g, whereas annealing and increasing the test frequency have both been shown to raise Tg. Values calculated for the apparent activation energy of the glass-transition (ΔETg) for the series of copoly esters are also reported.

The optimal values for the variables were: sodium alginate = 2.15%, CaCl ₂ = 0.24 M, speed = 1606 rpm and spore viability, mortality and diameter of 68% ± 1.73, 85% ± 1.5 and 9μ ± 1.3, respectively; while the predicted values by the software were 70% for spore viability, 87% for mortality and 8.3 μ for diameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki 3aEphestia kuehniella 3acalcium chloride 3acomputer software 3aemulsions 3agelation 3alarvae 3alight microscopy 3amicroencapsulation 3amixing 3amortality 3aresponse surface methodology 3asodium alginate 3aspores 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviability 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0amicroencapsulation 0astability 0aultraviolet1 aMarzban, Rasoul1 aArdjmand, Mehdi1 aSafekordi, Aliakbar1 aAskary, Hassan0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 50, no. 5-6 p.275-285dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2017.13021473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245009800177300001400275500002000289520207300309592002802382650001802410650001002428650001202438650001402450650002802464650001502492650001902507650002002526650001002546650002402556700001802580773014002598852000902738856008902747655001202836IND4406704620221120143058.0190709e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440670462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00661.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalizia, C. Giovanni10aOlfactory coding in the insect brain: molecular receptive ranges, spatial and temporal coding  ap. 81-92.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOdor information is coded in the insect brain in a sequence of steps, ranging from the receptor cells, via the neural network in the antennal lobe, to higher order brain centers, among which the mushroom bodies and the lateral horn are the most prominent. Across all of these processing steps, coding logic is combinatorial, in the sense that information is represented as patterns of activity across a population of neurons, rather than in individual neurons. Because different neurons are located in different places, such a coding logic is often termed spatial, and can be visualized with optical imaging techniques. We employ in vivo calcium imaging in order to record odor‐evoked activity patterns in olfactory receptor neurons, different populations of local neurons in the antennal lobes, projection neurons linking antennal lobes to the mushroom bodies, and the intrinsic cells of the mushroom bodies themselves, the Kenyon cells. These studies confirm the combinatorial nature of coding at all of these stages. However, the transmission of odor‐evoked activity patterns from projection neuron dendrites via their axon terminals onto Kenyon cells is accompanied by a progressive sparsening of the population code. Activity patterns also show characteristic temporal properties. While a part of the temporal response properties reflect the physical sequence of odor filaments, another part is generated by local neuron networks. In honeybees, γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA)‐ergic and histaminergic neurons both contribute inhibitory networks to the antennal lobe. Interestingly, temporal properties differ markedly in different brain areas. In particular, in the antennal lobe odor‐evoked activity develops over slow time courses, while responses in Kenyon cells are phasic and transient. The termination of an odor stimulus is reflected by a decrease in activity within most glomeruli of the antennal lobe and an off‐response in some glomeruli, while in the mushroom bodies about half of the odor‐activated Kenyon cells also exhibit off‐responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantennal lobe 3aaxons 3acalcium 3adendrites 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahoney bees 3aimage analysis 3amushroom bodies 3aodors 3aolfactory receptors1 aSzyszka, Paul0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2008 July, v. 128, no. 1 p.81-92dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00661.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03327naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010200171300001300273520176900286592002802055650000802083650002002091650001402111650001102125650001202136650002302148650001602171650001802187650001702205650001502222650001002237650002402247650000902271650002002280650001102300650002402311650002302335650001202358650001402370651001002384653002502394653002402419653002102443653002102464653002402485653002502509700005302534773010402587856008502691852000902776655001202785IND60636380320221119082540.0190408e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063638032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Louis S.H.10aThermal-cooling performance of subtropical green roof with deep substrate and woodland vegetation  ap. 8-18.  aAs building-integrated vegetation, green roofs can improve thermal performance of buildings and their ambience. Research efforts tended to focus on thermal behavior of extensive green roofs outside the tropics, with inadequate attention on intensive type and tropical region. Using detailed microclimatic monitoring, this study investigated the thermal behavior of a native-woodland intensive green roof in subtropical Hong Kong. Three summer weather days denoting sunny, cloudy and rainy were chosen from long-term monitoring data for comparison with a nearby bare control roof. Shading and evapotranspiration by the woodland canopy respectively reduced roof surface temperature and air temperature by latent-heat absorption. The most notable maximum surface and air cooling, respectively at 19.80 °C and 6.21 °C, was achieved in daytime sunny condition, with cooling effect extending into nighttime. Surface cooling was mainly governed by daily pattern of solar irradiance, whereas air cooling was more pronounced nearer ground surface except in nighttime period on rainy days. Slight near-surface air warming occurred in rainy nighttime. The woodland vegetation filtered 90% of the incoming short-wave radiation during most of the daytime, serving as an insolation filter which contributed to surface cooling. The substrate experienced net heat loss in cloudy and rainy weather, exporting its antecedent stored heat. At 0.5 m substrate depth, the temperature stayed at a stable level, suggesting restricted heat exchange in subsoil. With appropriate design and regular maintenance, an intensive green roof with dense woodland canopy and 1-m substrate could provide effective above-ground and soil cooling and buffer against outdoor-to-indoor heat ingress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3abuildings 3acanopy 3acooling 3aevapotranspiration 3agreen roofs 3aheat transfer 3amicroclimate 3amonitoring 3ashade 3ashortwave radiation 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3athermal properties 3atropics 3awoodlands 3aChina 0aIntensive green roof 0aSubtropical climate 0aRooftop woodland 0aThermal behavior 0aCooling performance 0aSubstrate insulation1 aJim, C.Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4052-83630 tEcological engineering.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 119 p.8-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011800169300001800287500001900305520100800324536012001332592002801452596001801480650002201498650001201520650001001532650002501542650001701567651001201584651001601596653002001612653002101632653002401653653001301677653002001690700002001710700002401730700001901754773013601773856008501909852000901994655001202003IND60740922820221121231010.0210609e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074092282DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2020.18300432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Pue, David12aA farmers’ perspective on farm relocation: lessons learnt from relocated farmers in Belgium and The Netherlands  ap. 1474-1495.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFarm relocation is applied in numerous spatial planning processes, including the conversion of agricultural land for nature development or urbanization. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study on farm relocation. With the aim of identifying main problems and success factors related to farm relocations, we performed in-depth interviews with relocated farmers in the Netherlands and in the region of Flanders, Belgium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study looking at the farmers’ perspective on relocation that includes farmers from different planning projects and countries. Using grounded theory, we were able to identify factors that determine the perceived success or failure of farm relocation, subdivided into five categories: (1) farmer and firm; (2) financial aspects; (3) process; (4) old location; and (5) new location. Insights gathered in this study might guide spatial planners towards effective use of farm relocation in different planning contexts.  aThis work was supported by the Special Research Grant of Ghent University (BOF), Grant Agreement no.

In order to better define the applicability domain and improve the predictive capacity of the fish embryo test, we performed a systematic analysis of existing fish embryo and acute fish toxicity data. A correlation analysis of a total of 153 compounds identified 28 compounds with a weaker or no toxicity in the fish embryo test. Eleven of these compounds exhibited a neurotoxic mode of action. We selected a subset of eight compounds with weaker or no embryo toxicity (cyanazine, picloram, aldicarb, azinphos-methyl, dieldrin, diquat dibromide, endosulfan, and esfenvalerate) to study toxicokinetics and a neurotoxic mode of action as potential reasons for the deviating fish embryo toxicity. Published fish embryo LC₅₀ values were confirmed by experimental analysis of zebrafish embryo LC₅₀ according to OECD guideline 236. Except for diquat dibromide, internal concentration analysis did not indicate a potential relation of the low sensitivity of fish embryos to a limited uptake of the compounds. Analysis of locomotor activity of diquat dibromide and the neurotoxic compounds in 98 hpf embryos (exposed for 96 h) indicated a specific effect on behavior (embryonic movement) for the neurotoxic compounds. The EC₅₀s of behavior for neurotoxic compounds were close to the acute fish toxicity LC₅₀. Our data provided the first evidence that the applicability domain of the fish embryo test (LC₅₀s determination) may exclude neurotoxic compounds. However, neurotoxic compounds could be identified by changes in embryonic locomotion. Although a quantitative prediction of acute fish toxicity LC₅₀ using behavioral assays in fish embryos may not yet be possible, the identification of neurotoxicity could trigger the conduction of a conventional fish acute toxicity test or application of assessment factors while considering the very good fish embryo–acute fish toxicity correlation for other compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacute toxicity 3aaldicarb 3aazinphos-methyl 3acyanazine 3adieldrin 3adiquat 3aendosulfan 3aesfenvalerate 3afish 3aguidelines 3alethal concentration 50 3alocomotion 3amechanism of action 3aneurotoxicity 3apharmacokinetics 3apicloram 3aprediction1 aKönig, Maria1 aOrtmann, Julia1 aMassei, Riccardo1 aPaschke, Albrecht1 aKühne, Ralph,1 aScholz, Stefan0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 June 02, v. 49, no. 11 p.7002-7011dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b019103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245012800210300001800338520167800356592002802034650001702062650001502079650002602094650001902120650002102139650002502160650000902185650001302194650001302207650001202220650001302232650001402245650001602259700001802275700001602293700005702309700005702366700001702423773011902440856008702559852000902646655001202655IND60598816720221120134342.0180702e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059881672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b039502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Songping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2989-826710aInvestigation into the Cleavage of Chemical Bonds Induced by CO2 and Its Mechanism during the Pressurized Pyrolysis of Coal  ap. 3243-3253.  aA Huo linhe coal sample and its N₂-devolatilized char have been pyrolyzed in a pressurized fixed-bed reactor under N₂ and 50% CO₂/50% N₂ atmospheres, respectively. With a view to avoiding any disturbance from the devolatilization process, N₂-devolatilized char was used to study the effect of CO₂ on the cleavage of chemical bonds. The results show that CO₂ intensifies the consumption of H in the char before its release in the form of H₂. More H in the char is transferred into gaseous aliphatic hydrocarbons and condensable volatiles, leading to a decrease in the yield of H₂ under 50% CO₂ atmosphere compared with that under N₂ at elevated pressure in the range 550–900 °C. A CO₂ atmosphere is the dominant factor in the release of H from char below 700 °C, such that more H in char induced by CO₂ is transferred into volatiles at 550 °C than that at 800 °C, above which temperature controls the release of H from char. Thus, CO₂ induces the decomposition of more H-containing organic groups to form CH₄, C₂H₆, C₂H₄, and H-rich low-molecular-weight tar at elevated pressure and 550 °C. Dissociative adsorption of CO₂ on coal/char can generate adsorbed active C(O) and active Cf at elevated pressure. The electronegativity of the O in active C(O) induces cleavage of adjacent bonds, and the formation of active Cf may induce new structural defects or active sites (Cf) capable of inducing bond cleavage, resulting in the cleavage of chemical bonds in the char at lower temperatures than under N₂ atmosphere at elevated pressure, such as those of aromatic rings, aliphatic chains of aromatic hydrocarbons, and ether bonds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acoal 3aethylene 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3anitrogen 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aZhai, Lingrui1 aQin, Yuhong1 aWang, Zhiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9009-97851 aZhao, Jiantao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8353-25841 aFang, Yitian0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 32, no. 3 p.3243-3253dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b039503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003200139245013200171500001400303520172800317592002802045650001502073650001002088650001902098650001802117650001402135650001202149650001102161650002202172650001302194650001602207650001402223650001902237650002502256650001002281650001702291650002502308650002102333700002802354700002602382700002502408700002502433773011902458856007402577852000902651655001202660IND60704199720221118224701.0200723e20200113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070419972DNAL7 a10.3390/w120102172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodoy Androcioli, Leonardo 10aEffect of Water Deficit on Morphoagronomic and Physiological Traits of Common Bean Genotypes with Contrasting Drought Tolerance  aNAL-light  aWater deficit is considered one of the most limiting factors of the common bean. Understanding the adaptation mechanisms of the crop to this stress is fundamental for the development of drought-tolerant cultivars. In this sense, the objective of this study was to analyze the influence of water deficit on physiological and morphoagronomic traits of common bean genotypes with contrasting drought tolerance, aiming to identify mechanisms associated with tolerance to water deficit. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, arranged in a randomized complete block 4 × 2 factorial design, consisting of four common bean genotypes under two water regimes (with and without water stress), with six replications. The morphoagronomic and physiological traits of four cultivars, two drought-tolerant (IAPAR 81 and BAT 477) and two drought-sensitive (IAC Tybatã and BRS Pontal), were measured for 0, 4, 8, and 12 days, under water deficit, initiated in the phenological stage R5. Water-deficit induced physiological changes in the plants, altering the evaluated morphoagronomic traits. The drought tolerance of cultivar BAT 477 is not only a direct result of the low influence of water deficit on its yield components, but also a consequence of the participation of multiple adaptive physiological mechanisms, such as higher intrinsic water use efficiency, net photosynthesis rate, transpiration, carboxylation efficiency, stomatal conductance, and intracellular concentration of CO₂ under water deficit conditions. On the other hand, cultivar IAPAR 81 can be considered drought-tolerant for short water-deficit periods only, since after the eighth day of water deficit, the physiological activities decline drastically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3abeans 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3acultivars 3adecline 3adesign 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3aphenology 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3awater 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3ayield components1 aMariani Zeffa, Douglas 1 aSoares Alves, Daniel 1 aPires Tomaz, Juarez 1 aModa-Cirino, Vânia 0 tWater.g2020 Jan. 13, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120102173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245014700174300001600321506002800337520083900365592002801204506003701232650002901269650001701298650001601315650001001331650001101341653000901352653001701361653002901378653002801407700003101435773012801466856008901594852000901683655001201692IND60739850220221207072214.0180531e198706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073985022DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.1987.21.2.12782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchetii, Rosa10aEffets de l'interaction souche de levure/composition du moût sur la production, au cours de la fermentation, de quelques metabolites volatils  ap. 113-125.  aResource is Open Access  aLes auteurs ont regroupé 128 vins, issus de 8 moûts fermentés par 16 souches de Saccharomyces cerevisiae, en fonction de la souche et du moût, selon six métabolites de la fermentation.

Determination of high yielding and high quality organically managed cultural practices for newer day-neutral cultivars in the region was performed. Six day-neutral cultivars were planted at two locations (St. Paul, and Morris, MN) in 2013 and 2014 and organically managed as annual crops under straw mulch, plastic mulch, and plastic mulch with low tunnel cultural practices. Yield and average berry weight for each cultivar/cultural practice combination was collected and analyzed weekly and cumulatively at each location and year. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total soluble solid (TSS) content of fruit was measured as indicators of nutritional and sensory quality over time. Day-neutral production added an average of fourteen weeks to the June-bearing strawberry season regardless of cultural practice, while all practices yielded more fruit than the 6160 kg ha –¹ average for June-bearing production in the region. Significant cultivar differences within each practice were observed as well. TPC and TSS both displayed significant cultivar and time of harvest effects. Overall our data support the conclusion that day-neutral strawberries can perform well using organic cultural practices in the Upper Midwest, providing growers the opportunity to extend the season and bolster yield, while providing consumers access to nutritious, locally available fruit for a longer period of time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3aannuals 3acultivars 3afruiting 3agrowers 3aharvest date 3aplanting 3aplastic film mulches 3asensory properties 3astraw mulches 3astrawberries 3atotal soluble solids 3aMinnesota 0aFragaria x ananassa 0aplasticulture 0alow tunnel 0atotal phenolic content 0atotal soluble solids1 aHoover, Emily1 aHayes, Laura1 aPoppe, Steve0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 33, no. 2 p.73-88dTaylor & Francisx2165-06167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2016.11881523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245012400178300002000302520091300322592002801235650003401263650002001297650001001317650002801327650003201355650001301387650001701400653002001417653001501437653003101452653002401483653002801507653003201535700003401567700002501601700003201626700003401658700003101692773014401723856008501867852000901952655001201961IND60544268420221119214936.0190415e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054426842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2014.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamto, Eutrophe Le Doux13aAn aromatic amide C-glycoside and a cyclitol derivative from stem barks of Piper guineense Schum and Thonn (Piperaceae)  ap. lxxvi-lxxxi.  aTwo new compounds, an aromatic amide C-glycoside, 4-C-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3,5-dihydroxy-2-methoxybenzamide (1) and a cyclitol derivative, 4-O-caffeoyl-2-C-methoxycarbonyl-1-C-methyl-2,3,6-trihydroxycyclohexanecarboxylic acid (2), were isolated from the methanol soluble extract of the stem barks of Piper guineense Schum and Thonn, together with four known quinic acids derivatives including 3-O-caffeoyl-1-methylquinic acid (3), 3-O-feruloylquinic acid (4), ethyl-4-O-feruloylquinate (5), and 5-caffeoylquinic acid (6).

Discussing this particular problem is essential for minimizing the losses in the energy gain which is heavily dependent on the amount of radiation reaching photovoltaic cells. The radiation itself may be considerably limited due to the pollution or shading of the working area of PV panels. Because of that, it is necessary to undertake actions to prevent the unfavorable effects of shading. Due to its importance in research on PV panels, the authors of the following publication decided to introduce most crucial factors responsible for shading; including its characteristics, influence on overall functionality of PV panels or possible prevention methods. The analyzed issues were supplemented with the results of the original researches and simulations conducted for the need of this very article. Thus, appropriate steps should be undertaken as early as the design process of PV begins. Such measures may contribute to not only the increase of energy gain, but potential improvement in terms of profitability of the entire investment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apollution 3aprofitability 3arenewable energy sources 3ashade 3asolar collectors 0aReasons for shading 0aEfficiency of photovoltaic installation 0aPanel orientation 0aSkyline shading1 aGłuchy, D.1 aKurz, D.0 tRenewable energy.g2020 June, v. 153 p.480-498dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013200154300001800286520138200304592002801686650001501714650001501729650001701744650002501761650002501786650001501811650001101826650002001837650002001857700002001877700002001897700001701917773012501934856007502059852000902134655001202143IND60535824220221119161602.0160805e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053582422DNAL7 a10.1021/es504325d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Wang10aDiminished Swelling of Cross-Linked Aromatic Oligoamide Surfaces Revealing a New Fouling Mechanism of Reverse-Osmosis Membranes  ap. 6815-6822.  aSwelling of the active layer of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes has an important effect on permeate water flux. The effects of organic- and biofouling on the swelling of the RO membrane active layer and the consequent changes of permeate flux are examined here. A cross-linked aromatic oligoamide film that mimics the surface chemistry of an RO polyamide membrane was synthesized stepwise on gold-coated surfaces. Foulant adsorption to the oligoamide film and its swelling were measured with a quartz crystal microbalance, and the effects of fouling on the membrane’s performance were evaluated. The foulants were extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) extracted from fouled RO membranes and organic compounds of ultrafiltration permeate (UFP) from a membrane bioreactor used to treat municipal wastewater. The adsorbed foulants affected the swelling of the cross-linked oligoamide film differently. EPS had little effect on the swelling of the oligoamide film, whereas UFP significantly impaired swelling. Permeate flux declined more rapidly under UFP fouling than it did under EPS. Foulant adsorption was shown to diminish swelling of the aromatic oligoamide surfaces. Among the already known RO membrane fouling mechanisms, a novel RO fouling mechanism is proposed, in which foulant–membrane interactions hinder membrane swelling and thus increase hydraulic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiofouling 3acrosslinking 3amembrane bioreactors 3amunicipal wastewater 3apolyamides 3aquartz 3areverse osmosis 3aultrafiltration1 aKumar, Rajender1 aHerzberg, Moshe1 aKasher, Roni0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 June 02, v. 49, no. 11 p.6815-6822dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes504325d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012300161300001800284520129600302592002801598650004401626650001501670650001701685650001701702650001101719650002201730650001901752650001301771650001901784650001501803700002401818700001301842700002101855700002001876700001601896773009601912856007402008852000902082655001202091IND60340927220221119054616.0150809e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034092722DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.237332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrenner, Philipp10aDegradation mechanisms of polyfluorene‐based organic semiconductor lasers under ambient and oxygen‐free conditions  ap. 1029-1034.  aIn this communication we investigate the degradation mechanisms of different highly fluorescent polyfluorenes for applications as active organic semiconductor material in laser devices. Using various analytical methods, like Ultraviolet‐Visible (UV‐Vis) absorption spectroscopy, Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) and time‐of‐flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS), we investigate photo‐induced degradation mechanisms. It is shown that the photo‐oxidation rate decreases with an increasing number of benzothiadiazole units within the conjugated polymer. Photooxidation is much more distinct for poly[9,9‐dioctylfluorenyl‐2,7‐diyl] (PFO) than for poly[(9,9‐dioctylfluorenyl‐2,7‐diyl)‐alt‐co‐(1,4‐benzo‐{2,1′,3}‐thiadiazole)] (F8BT). The influence of the photooxidation on the lifetime of the organic laser devices is not as profound as previously assumed, since the laser shuts down before any evidence of photo‐oxidation in F8BT manifests. We observe that the solubility of the material is different at various degradation levels and we consider chain scission of excited bonds and cross‐linking as dominant degradation factors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the low power coefficient, poor self-starting characteristics, and lack of structural analysis have limited their usage. This study, as such, investigates the effect of a ducted augmented system on a Straight Blade Darrieus Hydrokinetic Turbine (SBDHT) to analyze performance, fluid loads, and stress-induced. A one-way Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis followed the transfer of fluid forces to the structural module. Real-time hydraulic load and stress were computed and compared for ducted and non-ducted turbines. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis was performed to solve Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, while turbulences were modeled using k−ω Shear Stress Transport (SST) model. CFD simulation revealed that, for the range of free stream velocity values, the duct augmentation system showed an increase in power production by 112% as compared to non-ducted turbines. The results also reveal that the ducted turbine will experience two-times the hydraulic loads in contrast to non-ducted turbines. Further, induced stress estimation revealed that 178.5 MPa and 94.68 MPa stresses were induced on the ducted and non-ducted turbine, respectively. The stress analysis result showed that maximum stresses occur within the turbine arms and at the joint between shaft and arms. It is, therefore, concluded that the ducted turbine approximately generates double power; however, it also experiences nearly twice stresses compared to the non-ducted turbine, which shall although increase the material cost of the turbine. This study, therefore, recommends that the duct augmentation system should be preferred choice while carefully designing such a system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3akinetic energy 3amodels 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3ariver flow 3ashear stress 3astreams 3aturbines 3awater currents 0aHydrokinetic turbine 0aHydrodynamic performance 0aHydraulic loads 0aInduced stresses 0aFactor of safety1 aShah, Madad Ali1 aHussain, Tanweer1 aHarijan, Khanji1 aMirjat, Nayyar Hussain1 aMemon, Abdul Hameed0 tRenewable energy.g2020 June, v. 153 p.143-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245005300211300001800264520138300282592002801665650001201693650001901705650001101724650001001735650002901745650002001774650001101794650002101805650001501826650001801841650001601859650001701875650001801892773011901910856008702029852000902116655001202125IND60598816920221120134340.0180702e20180308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059881692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b039562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaseli, Yousef1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4563-155710aProcess Modeling of a Biomass Torrefaction Plant  ap. 5611-5622.  aA process model is developed to simulate the performance of a biomass torrefaction unit, which consists of a dryer, a torrefaction reactor, a combustor, and two heat exchangers. The model is capable of predicting the composition of volatiles and torrefied biomass, mass and energy yields, thermal efficiency, process heat requirement, and CO₂ emissions. Useful correlations are presented for the heating value, molecular weight, and specific heat of the volatiles. A comparison of the model prediction with the experimental data reported in the literature shows a very good agreement. The performance of a torrefaction unit with production capacity of 150 MWₜₕ is predicted with an acceptable accuracy using the presented process model. The effect of moisture content, torrefaction temperature, residence time, and adiabatic flame temperature on key process parameters are examined. The thermal efficiency of willow torrefaction unit is found to be 88% at a moisture content of 50% (dry basis), which increases to 94% as the moisture content drops to 20%. The results show that the carbon dioxide produced in the process is notably affected by the torrefaction temperature and the moisture content. A higher moisture content or torrefaction temperature may lead to a higher CO₂ emission. Furthermore, the conditions at autothermal operation are identified and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat exchangers 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aprediction 3aspecific heat 3atemperature 3atorrefaction 3awater content0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Mar. 08, v. 32, no. 4 p.5611-5622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b039563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03750naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010100174300001600275520203300291592002802324650001402352650001502366650002702381650001702408650001302425650001902438650002202457650001502479650001802494650003102512650001302543650002502556650001602581650002302597650001502620653001602635653002702651653000802678653002202686653001902708653001502727700002702742700002502769700003302794700002002827700002002847700002202867773022802889856008203117852000903199655001203208IND60766123220221119131352.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076612322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaa.2021.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarayannopoulou, Maria10aEffect of anaesthesia on cell-mediated immunity in dogs undergoing mastectomy for mammary cancer  ap. 265-274.  aTo investigate if anaesthesia for canine cancer mastectomy further influences host cell-mediated immunity (CMI) promoting cancer progression. A randomized, controlled, blinded clinical study. A total of 20 bitches with malignant mammary tumours of clinical stage II or III undergoing the same type of mastectomy (regional mastectomy). Dogs were randomly allocated to one of two anaesthetic groups (10 per group). The anaesthetic protocol of group A used minimally immunosuppressive drugs (tramadol, robenacoxib, propofol), whereas that of group B (control) used more immunosuppressive drugs (morphine, fentanyl, thiopental, isoflurane). For each animal, measurements of white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils and lymphocytes, and flow cytometric assessment of T cells (CD3⁺), helper T cells (CD4⁺), cytotoxic T cells (CD8⁺) and CD5ˡᵒʷ⁺ T cells were performed prior to anaesthesia (day 0) and on days 3 and 10 postsurgery. Data were analysed using a General Linear Model for repeated measures and presented as mean ± standard deviation, p ≤ 0.05. In all animals, on day 3, WBCs and neutrophils were significantly increased (p < 0.0005), while flow cytometry revealed significantly decreased relative percentages of T cells (CD3⁺) (p = 0.003) and their subpopulations CD4⁺ (p = 0.006), CD8⁺ (p = 0.029) and CD5ˡᵒʷ⁺ (p = 0.031). Specifically, on day 3, the cytotoxic T cells (CD8⁺) were significantly decreased (p = 0.05) only in group B, whereas the CD4⁺ (p = 0.006) and CD5ˡᵒʷ⁺ (p = 0.008) T cells in group A. The only significant difference between groups was found preoperatively in the CD4⁺/CD8⁺ ratio, which was higher in group A (p = 0.006). In dogs with mammary cancer undergoing regional mastectomy, a significant decrease in components of CMI was observed on day 3 postsurgery in both anaesthetic groups. Some indication, however, for better preserved cellular immunity by less immunosuppressive anaesthetic/analgesic drugs was detected, rendering their use advisable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3acell-mediated immunity 3acytotoxicity 3afentanyl 3aflow cytometry 3aimmunosuppression 3aisoflurane 3alinear models 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3amorphine 3aneoplasm progression 3aneutrophils 3astandard deviation 3athiopental 0aanaesthesia 0acell-mediated immunity 0adog 0aimmunosuppression 0amammary cancer 0amastectomy1 aAnagnostou, Tilemachos1 aMargariti, Apostolia1 aKritsepi-Konstantinou, Maria1 aPsalla, Dimitra1 aSavvas, Ioannis1 aKazakos, Georgios0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2022 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.265-274dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaa.2021.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245011800210520182600328592002802154650002202182650001502204650001102219650001202230650002002242650001302262650000902275650001502284650001102299650002602310650001402336650001202350650001202362650001702374653001902391653001402410653001402424653001302438700003102451700003102482700003302513773011702546856008602663852000902749655001202758IND60745218420221118022951.0220207e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074521842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1138302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCacefo, Viviane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6000-135010aExogenous proline alters the leaf ionomic profiles of transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants under water deficit  aWater deficit can reduce the absorption, accumulation, partition, and use of nutrients in plants. To mitigate the effects of this stress, plants produce osmolytes, such as proline, which may assist in preventing nutrient deficiencies under water deficiency. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of exogenous proline application on the ionomic profile of wild-type and genetically modified tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) overproducing proline under water deficit conditions. For this, the exogenous proline application in transgenic tobacco plants with constitutive expression of a mutated heterologous delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase enzyme (VaP5CSF129A) with reduced feedback inhibition and wild-type was studied. Water supply was suspended three days after foliar applications of 10 mM proline and the mineral elements content were determined in leaves nine days after the suspension of irrigation. Hierarchical clustering showed a clear differentiation between groups of plants with or without exogenous proline application, demonstrating that this treatment affected the ionomic profile of tobacco plants more than the water regime. The absorption and translocation mechanisms that were probably affected by the higher amount of proline allowed the separation the mineral elements into five groups by multivariate analysis. Notably, potassium was the nutrient present in the greatest content in tobacco leaves. In general, micronutrients were detected in larger amounts in transgenic plants, with the exception of iron possibly due to the competition with copper. Thus, the data suggest that proline might act, directly, or indirectly as a mitigator of nutritional deficiencies caused by water deficiency in tobacco, if applied prior to the onset of the water deficit conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aabsorption 3acopper 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3aionomics 3airon 3airrigation 3aleaves 3amultivariate analysis 3apotassium 3aproline 3atobacco 3awater supply 0aAbiotic stress 0aNicotiana 0aNutrients 0aOsmolyte1 aRibas, Alessandra Ferreira1 aGuidorizi, Kezia Aparecida1 aVieira, Luiz Gonzaga Esteves0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 170 p.113830-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1138303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015300174300001500327520139000342592002801732650002001760650001101780650001401791650001701805650001301822650001301835650001201848650003601860650001101896650002301907650001901930650001201949650001001961653001501971653002801986653001802014653002302032653002602055700002502081700001702106773011402123856008502237852000902322655001202331IND60566193520221121192112.0170404e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056619352DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2016.12359922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemeskéri, Eszter10aRelationships between the biochemical and spectral traits of leaves and the productivity of apple trees in organic and integrated production systems  ap. 97-114.  aThree apple varieties were investigated in organic and integrated production systems with the objective to examine the relationships between carbohydrates, endogenous formaldehyde (HCHO) and SPAD value during fruit development. The leaves on the eastern, western and southern sides of the apple trees were investigated four times, at 57, 73, 99 and 120 days after flowering. Concentrations of glucose and fructose in the leaves were lower while the sucrose concentration was higher in organic production than in the integrated system. In the integrated production system the high SPAD value and its more intensive increase during fruit development indicated increased photosynthetic activity in the trees in comparison with organic production. In the organic production system, the increase in SPAD values was correlated with increasing ‘fixed’ HCHO concentrations and decreasing fructose concentrations in the leaves. In integrated production the increase in the SPAD value also resulted in a rise in the concentration of HCHO, while the concentrations of carbohydrates (glucose + fructose) in the leaves decreased gradually. The results indicated that the SPAD value and the endogenous formaldehyde concentration in the leaves measured during the early stage of fruit development can be used to characterize the productivity and suitability of the tree for organic production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3aflowering 3aformaldehyde 3afructose 3afruiting 3aglucose 3aintegrated agricultural systems 3aleaves 3aorganic production 3aphotosynthesis 3asucrose 3atrees 0aSPAD value 0aendogenous formaldehyde 0acarbohydrates 0aorganic production 0aintegrated production1 aKovács-Nagy, Eszter1 aSárdi, Éva0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 33, no. 2 p.97-114dTaylor & Francisx2165-06167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2016.12359923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04440naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245009100152500001400243520318700257592002803444650002303472650002103495650002203516650000903538650000903547650001803556650000903574650002303583650001103606650001003617650001403627650001203641650001003653650001003663650001803673650002303691700001803714700001303732700001703745700001803762773011903780856007403899852000903973655001203982IND60704200020221122060459.0200723e20191219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070420002DNAL7 a10.3390/w120100222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Bin10aPerformance Evaluation of a Tidal Current Turbine with Bidirectional Symmetrical Foils  aNAL-light  aAs one might expect, tidal currents in terms of ebb and flood tides are approximately bidirectional. A Horizontal Axial Tidal Turbine (HATT) with unidirectional foils has to be able to face the current directions in order to maximize current energy harvesting. There are two regular solutions to keep a HATT always facing the direction of the flow, which are transferred from wind turbine applications. One is to yaw the turbine around the supporting structure with a yaw mechanism. The other is to reverse the blade pitch angle through 180° with a pitch-adjusting mechanism. The above solutions are not cost-effective in marine applications due to the harsh marine environment and high cost of installation and maintenance. In order to avoid the above disadvantages, a turbine with bidirectional foils is presented in this paper. A bare turbine with bidirectional foils is characterized in that it has nearly the same energy conversion capability in both tidal current directions without using the yaw or pitch mechanism. Considering the working conditions of the bidirectional turbine in which the turbine is installed on a mono-pile, the effect of the mono-pile on the turbine’s performance is evaluated in this paper, especially when the turbine is downstream of the mono-pile. The paper was focused on the evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance of the bidirectional turbine. The hydrodynamic performance of the bare bidirectional turbine without any supporting structure was evaluated based on a steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and model tests. Performance comparison has been made between the turbine with bidirectional foils and the turbine with NACA foils. The effect of the mono-pile on the performance of the bidirectional turbine was studied by using the steady-state and the transient CFD model. The steady-state CFD model was used to evaluate the effect of the mono-pile clearance, which is the distance between the mono-pile and the turbine on the performance of the turbine. The transient CFD model was used to determine the time-dependent characteristics of the turbine, such as time-dependent power and drag coefficients. The results show that the bare bidirectional turbine has nearly the same energy conversion capability in both tidal current directions. The performance of the bidirectional turbine is inferior to the turbine with NACA foils. At the designed tip speed ratio, the power coefficient of the turbine with NACA foils is 0.4498, which increases by 1.6% compared to the 0.4338 of the bidirectional turbine. The turbine’s performance decreases due to the introduction of the mono-pile, and the closer the turbine is to the mono-pile, the greater effect on the turbine’s performance the mono-pile has. At the designed clearance of 1.5 DS, the presence of a mono-pile decreases the peak Cp value by 1.82% and 3.17% to a value of 0.4156 and 0.4004 for the turbine located in the mono-pile upstream and downstream, respectively. The mono-pile can result in the fluctuation of the turbine’s performance. This fluctuation will detrimentally harm the life of the turbine as it will lead to increased wear and fatigue issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adrag coefficient 3aenergy conversion 3aface 3aflow 3ahydrodynamics 3alead 3amarine environment 3amodels 3apaper 3asolutions 3atesting 3atides 3awater 3awind turbines 3aworking conditions1 aWang, Dazheng1 aZhou, Xu1 aShi, Weichao1 aJing, Fengmei0 tWater.g2019 Dec. 19, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120100223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011400177300001600291520136000307592002801667650002301695650001901718650002601737650001201763650001101775650001601786650001101802650002601813650001101839650001601850650002201866650001701888650001701905650001501922650002401937650001601961650001001977650001301987650001702000653001902017653002302036653001502059653002602074653001802100653001702118653002602135700002702161700002102188773011502209856008502324852000902409655001202418IND60566193620221121154242.0170404e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056619362DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2016.12617402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlor-Peregrín, Elena10aCombined use of plant extracts and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to reduce root-knot nematode damage in tomato  ap. 115-124.  aThe effects of mycorrhization by Funneliformis mosseae alone and combined with soil applications of plant extracts from garlic, neem, quassia, and thyme on the damage caused by Meloidogyne incognita in tomato were studied in pot experiments under greenhouse conditions. The nematode reduced shoot fresh weight of tomato by 15% compared with that of nematode-free plants. Nutrient and water stress in M. incognita -infested tomato were detected by measuring the leaf chlorophyll content and canopy temperature, as early as 21 days after nematode inoculation. Mycorrhization by F. mosseae offset the damage caused by the nematode with a general positive effect on plant growth, representing a 17% increase over non-mycorrhized plants. Nematode densities were reduced by garlic, neem, and thyme extracts. Several interactions between treatments proved positive or negative for tomato plant growth, mycorrhization, and nematode reproduction. The most favourable treatment for nematode suppression was a combination of mycorrhization by F. mosseae and application of garlic extract, which increased plant growth by 52%, reduced root galling by 50% and lowered the final nematode population by 51%, when compared to nematode-infested non-treated plants. Neem and thyme extracts showed a negative interaction with F. mosseae , reducing mycorrhization frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aGlomus mosseae 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aQuassia 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3agarlic 3agreenhouse production 3aleaves 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplant growth 3areproduction 3aroot galls 3aroot-knot nematodes 3atemperature 3athyme 3atomatoes 3awater stress 0aAllium sativum 0aAzadirachta indica 0aBiocontrol 0aFunneliformis mosseae 0aQuassia amara 0aThymus zygis 0aMeloidogyne incognita1 aVerdejo-Lucas, Soledad1 aTalavera, Miguel0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 33, no. 2 p.115-124dTaylor & Francisx2165-06167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2016.12617403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009300158300001800251520157100269592002801840650001701868650000901885650004401894650002101938650001301959650001501972650001601987700002002003700002102023700001702044700002202061700003002083700002402113773009702137856007402234852000902308655001202317IND60340927520221119054737.0150809e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034092752DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.237432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabicht, Axel10aCritical fluctuations and static inhomogeneities in polymer gel volume phase transitions  ap. 1112-1122.  aThermoresponsive polymer gels exhibit pronounced swelling and deswelling upon changes in temperature, accompanied by dynamic concentration fluctuations that have been interpreted as critical opalescence. These fluctuations span lengthscales similar to that of static structures in the gels, such as the gel polymer‐network meshsize (1–10 nm) and static polymer‐network crosslinking inhomogeneities (10–1000 nm). To systematically investigate this overlay, we use droplet‐based microfluidics and fabricate submillimeter‐sized gel particles with varying static heterogeneity, as revealed on a molecular scale by proton NMR. When these microgels are probed by small‐angle neutron scattering, the detection of dynamic fluctuations during the volume phase transitions is strongly perturbed by the co‐existing static inhomogeneity. Depending of the type of data analysis employed, the temperature‐dependent evolution of the correlation length associated to the dynamic fluctuations does or does not agree with predictions by the critical scaling theory. Only the most homogeneous sample of this study, prepared by controlled polymer crosslinking in droplet microfluidics, shows a diverging correlation length in agreement to the critical scaling theory independent of the specific approach of data analysis. These findings suggest that care must be taken about polymer‐network heterogeneity when gel volume phase transitions are evaluated as critical phenomena. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

An improvement of the electrical conductivity by three orders of magnitude is achieved for dimethyl sulfoxide, sorbitol, ethylene glycol, and N,N‐dimethylformamide, and the secondary dopant concentration dependence of the conductivity exhibits almost identical behavior for all investigated secondary dopants. Detailed analysis of the surface morphology and Raman spectra reveals no presence of the secondary dopant in fabricated films, and thus the dopants are truly causing the secondary doping effect. Although the ratio of benzenoid and quinoid vibrations in Raman spectra is unaffected by doping, the phase transition in PEDOT:PSS films owing to doping is confirmed. Further analysis of temperature‐dependent conductivity reveals 1D variable range hopping (VRH) charge transport for undoped PEDOT:PSS, whereas highly conductive doped PEDOT:PSS films exhibit 3D VRH charge transport. We demonstrate that the charge‐hopping dimensionality change should be a fundamental reason for the conductivity enhancement. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

In this study, we investigated fine root C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations and age sequence ratios (10-, 25-, and 40-year stands) of Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. (evergreen) and Robinia pseudoacacia Linn. (deciduous) forests on the Loess Plateau, China. Fine root C, N, and N:P of R. pseudoacacia were 22, 23, and 32% greater in 40-year stands than in 10-year stands, respectively, but did not differ significantly in P. tabulaeformis stands of different ages. Fine root P and C:P of both tree species significantly differed with respect to stand age. Fine root C:P and N:P of R. pseudoacacia were lower in 10- and 25-year stands than in 40-year stands. The age-related patterns of C, N, and C:N in fine roots were similar to those in green leaves. Fine root N:P of R. pseudoacacia was positively related to soil N:P. Our results suggest that stand age (temporal factor) plays a key role in fine root C:N:P stoichiometry in temperate forests. Differences in fine root C:N:P stoichiometry between P. tabulaeformis and R. pseudoacacia suggest that the nutrient-use strategy in evergreen tree forests is more conservative than in deciduous tree forests as age increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3afine roots 3aforest plantations 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3astand age 3astoichiometry 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3aChina 0aEcological stoichiometry 0aFine roots 0aPinus tabulaeformis 0aRobinia pseudoacacia 0aStand age1 aDeng, Qiang1 aYuan, Zhiyou1 aMu, Xingmin1 aKallenbach, Robert L.0 tEcological engineering.g2018 Sept., v. 120 p.14-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011800178300001400296520141200310592002801722650001601750650001701766650001701783650001701800650001401817650001801831650001701849650002201866650001701888650001701905650001701922650001201939650001601951650001501967650001401982650001401996650001402010650001102024650001102035653001002046653001802056653002002074653001402094653001402108700001802122773014002140856008602280852000902366655001202375IND60765786720221118124854.0220202e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076578672DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2021.19529042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaravelioğlu, Burçin10aPotential effects of onion (Allium cepa L.) and its phytomolecules on non-communicable chronic diseases: a review  ap. 24-33.  aThe global increase in the morbidity and mortality of non-communicable chronic diseases threaten human health significantly. Therefore, in the treatment of non-communicable chronic diseases, it is needed to develop disease-specific and personalised nutrition strategies following the principles of adequate and balanced nutrition. Potential effects of vegetables and their phytomolecules on diseases have been of interest. There are different types and amounts of phytomolecules in onion, which is commonly known as the queen of vegetables. Phytomolecules, such as different types of phenolic and sulphur compounds, in onion can prevent non-communicable chronic diseases due to their various potential effects, such as anti-oxidant, anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, anti-cardiovascular, and anti-cancer, and this has been among the research topics in the literature. These potential effects can occur through energy metabolism, adipogenesis, lipogenesis, diabetes-related enzymes, insulin signalling, glycogenesis, vasodilator, endothelial, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis pathways. In this review article, it is aimed to explain the potential effects of onion and its phytomolecules on non-communicable chronic diseases. Clinical determination of the effects of onion and its components will significantly assist to further researches about the medical nutrition therapy strategies of chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aadipogenesis 3aangiogenesis 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abiotechnology 3adiet therapy 3aenergy metabolism 3aglycogenesis 3ahorticulture 3ahuman health 3ainsulin 3alipogenesis 3ametastasis 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anutrition 3aonions 3asulfur 0aOnion 0aphytomolecule 0achronic disease 0avegetable 0aquercetin1 aHoca, Mustafa0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 97, no. 1 p.24-33dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2021.19529043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006400170520078200234592002801016650001701044650001701061650002801078650002101106653002101127653004401148653002001192700001501212773013201227856008501359852000901444655001201453IND60728480820221121054212.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072848082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2021.1059312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostello, Ishan10aAnalysing errors in single-molecule localisation microscopy  aIn single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) a super-resolution image of the distribution of fluorophores in the sample is built up from the localised positions of many individual molecules.

However, the factors which limit resolution in a reconstructed image, and the artefacts which can be present, are completely different to those present in standard fluorescent microscopy techniques. Artefacts may be difficult for users to identify, particularly as they can cause images to appear falsely sharp, an effect called artificial sharpening.

However, better understanding of their distinctive source partitions and transfer process remains insufficient in steel-making area. The paper focuses on the pollution levels, health risks, and provenance identification of Tl, As, Pb, Cu, Ni, Co, Sb, Cd, Zn, Be, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Sn, and V in common vegetables from different farmlands near a steel-making plant. The results showed that the Tl, As, Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu and Mn were of high-level contamination in soils and generally above the maximum permissible level (MPL). Calculation using hazard quotients (HQ) exhibited that consumption of the studied vegetables may entail significant health risks to residents, especially for children, resulting from the elevated contents of Tl, As and associated toxic elements. Calculation by binary mixing model using Pb isotopic compositions suggested that steel-making activities contributed to 35–80% of the contamination of Pb and As in vegetables. It is necessary to adopt appropriate remediation measures to mitigate the farmland contamination and ensure the food safety of the agricultural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aenvironment 3afood safety 3apollution 3aprovenance 3aremediation 3atoxicity 0aThallium 0aAgricultural soil 0aFood safety 0aRisk assessment 0aPotentially toxic elements1 aWang, Lulu1 aWang, Yuxuan1 aTsang, Daniel C.W.1 aYang, Xiao1 aBeiyuan, Jingzi1 aYin, Meiling1 aXiao, Tangfu1 aJiang, Yanjun1 aLin, Wenli1 aZhou, Yuchen1 aLiu, Juan1 aWang, Liang1 aZhao, Min0 tEnvironment international.g2021 Jan., v. 146 p.106207-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1062073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245007000161300001800231520175300249592002802002650004102030650002602071650002202097650001802119650001902137650001202156650001402168650001902182650001502201650001002216650001502226651001102241773009802252856007102350852000902421655001202430IND60518653820221120090457.0160418e197910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051865382DNAL7 a10.2307/19368712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Robert K.10aGenecology of Douglas‐Fir in a Watershed in the Oregon Cascades  ap. 1036-1050.  aTo gain insight into genetic microstructure of subregional populations of coastal Douglas—fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco var. menziesii), genetic variability in a population found on a 6100—ha, central Oregon watershed is described. Genotypic values of 193 parent trees located throughout the watershed were estimated from progeny grown in a common garden. Then, genetic variation was partitioned into components attributable to parent—tree location and to differences among trees within locations. Within—location variation appeared to be homogeneous in the watershed; between—location variation was related to topography, but the patterns of trait variation differed depending on the trait measured. Growth traits exhibited strong gradients with elevation, but the relationship varied depending on position within the watershed. Based on estimates of proportions of nonadapted seedlings in hypothetical transfers of seed from one part of the watershed to another, genetic differentiation within the watershed was surprisingly large. In one transfer of 3.5 km between north— and south—facing slopes at the same elevation, °80% of seedlings were estimated to be poorly adapted. Although other possibilities exist, the topoclinal variation in traits probably results from selection as does the large within—location variation. Both kinds of variation are due to high selection intensities in the seedling stage, the former to selection by average environmental differences along gradients, the latter to microenvironmental heterogeneity. The combination of high within— and between—habitat variation is suited to a species which episodically colonizes an environment that is extremely heterogeneous in time and space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetic variation 3agrowth traits 3amicrostructure 3aprogeny 3aseedlings 3aspace and time 3atopography 3atrees 3awatersheds 3aOregon0 tEcology.g1979 Oct., v. 60, no. 5 p.1036-1050dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19368713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024004100132040001800173100001900191245007400210300002000284520094100304592002801245596006401273596008301337596008801420650004401508650003701552650001301589650002801602650002101630650001101651650003701662650001701699650002101716650001201737650001301749650001401762650001301776650003301789650001001822700001901832700005601851700001501907700001801922700001501940700002001955700001501975700001401990700005702004700001802061700005202079773011602131856008502247852000902332655001202341IND60621596120221120155043.0181120e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062159612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b031512doi7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b031512chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Shouceng10aSurface Properties of Organic Kerogen in Continental and Marine Shale  ap. 13882-13887.  aThe adhesion energy of kerogen in continental and marine shale was innovatively discovered using the colloid probe technique with atomic-force microscopy (AFM). AFM results indicated that the adhesion force of kerogen was higher than the inorganic material in both the continental and marine shale samples. The chemical elements in the two kinds of samples were measured by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical compositions of kerogen involved C═C bonding, C═O bonding, pyridine nitrogen, and pyrrole nitrogen, whereas the primary constituent involving inorganic matter was Si–O bonding. These results were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The high percentages of C═C and C═O bonding in kerogen are attributed to the large dipole on the kerogen surface which allowed kerogen to contain liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.  aPublisher supplied data  cBeijing Nova Programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005090  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical bonding 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrocarbons 3ainorganic matter 3aliquids 3anitrogen 3apyridines 3apyrroles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashale1 aDong, Xiaoxiao1 aWang, Tianyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2742-20111 aZhang, Rui1 aZhang, Panpan1 aSheng, Mao1 aCheng, Shizhong1 aZhao, Hong1 aFei, Ling1 aStreet, Jason1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7317-216X1 aChen, Yusheng1 aXu, Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2195-25130 tLangmuir.g2018 Oct. 18, v. 34, no. 46 p.13882-13887dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b031513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01687naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007400171300001400245520075000259592002801009650001301037650001001050650001601060653002001076653002301096653000901119653001101128700001901139773012301158856008301281852000901364655001201373IND60610537120221119163206.0180828e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061053712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavydenko, Mariya10aTime grows on trees: The effect of nature settings on time perception  ap. 20-26.  aWe examined whether nature exposure may be related to time perception. When estimating the length of time spent in nature vs. an urban environment, does the subjective estimate of experience duration change depending on the setting? We present evidence that an experience in nature can feel longer than the same experience in a man-made environment, independent of actual duration. Participants overestimated the duration of a walk if this walk took them through a nature setting but perceived an equally long walk through an urban setting accurately. The nature walk also resulted in a marked improvement in mood and reduction in stress compared to the urban walk. In sum, our studies suggest that nature exposure can slow down time perception.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemotions 3atrees 3aurban areas 0aTime perception 0aDuration estimates 0aMood 0aStress1 aPeetz, Johanna0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2017 Dec., v. 54 p.20-26dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05042naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017300169520333900342592002803681650001803709650001103727650001303738650001403751650001303765650001603778650002403794650002503818650001203843650000903855650002203864653000703886653000803893653000903901653000703910653000703917653000803924653000803932653002203940653002903962653001603991653002204007653002404029700002104053700001804074700002204092700002304114700002504137700002104162700002804183700001904211700002304230773010504253856008504358852000904443655001204452IND60717876420221116221911.0210624e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071787642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1062382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMygind, Lærke10aLandscapes of becoming social: A systematic review of evidence for associations and pathways between interactions with nature and socioemotional development in children  aExisting research indicates that spending time in nature is associated with diverse aspects of children’s health and wellbeing. Although fundamental to later life chances and health, no systematic reviews, to our knowledge, have focused specifically on the effects of interaction with nature on socioemotional functioning in childhood.Amongst children, what is the consistency of associations between the availability of or spending time in nature on socioemotional function and development? Furthermore, which child behaviours and states independently associate with socioemotional function and availability of or spending time in nature, and what is the consistency of associations between these behaviours and states and contact with nature?Embase, Environment Complete, MEDLINE, and APA PsycINFO. Eligible studies were backward and forward snowball-searched.Studies investigating effects of, or associations between, availability of or interaction with nature on socioemotional or proximal outcomes in children under the age of 12 years were included in this review.The internal validity of studies investigating socioemotional outcomes were based on assessments of elements of study design, conduct, and reporting to identify potential issues related to confounding or other biases. The number of analyses indicating positive, negative, and non-significant associations between availability or interaction with green space and the outcomes were summed.A total of 223 eligible full-texts, of which 43 pertained to socioemotional outcomes and 180 to proximal outcomes, met eligibility criteria. Positive associations between availability of and spending time in green space were found with children’s intra- and interpersonal socioemotional function and development. Proportions of positive findings ranged from 13.9% to 55% across experimental and observational research, exposures, populations, and contexts. Modifying and mediating factors were identified.We found consistent evidence for improved aspects of cognition and, for children over six years, reduced risk of obesity and overweight in association with green space; consistent links between movement behaviours in the experimental, but not observational research; tentative trends suggesting associations with play, motor skills, language, screen time, and communication skills; little evidence for positive associations between green space and mood, physical wellbeing, and stress; some evidence for associations with healthy birth outcomes, and little evidence for direct associations between availability of green space and asthma and allergy prevalence, however, mediation via, for example, air pollution was likely.We identified few studies without either probable or severe risk of bias in at least one item. Improved study quality may therefore result in different results. Restricting analyses to include only studies considered at low risk of bias indicated similar or slightly lower proportions of positive findings. Risk of bias in proximal outcomes was not assessed.The empirical evidence for benefits of availability of and interaction green space for child socioemotional function and development must currently be considered limited. A number of proximal indicators were identified.Systematic review registration number.

First, a simple extraction procedure with acetonitrile and 6% trichloroacetic acid was carried out. Second, the supernatant was evaporated and the pellet was reconstituted in 1ml of water/acetonitrile (80/20) and 0.1% formic acid. Extracts were filtered and analyzed by UHPLC–MS/MS on a Kinetex C18 column using gradient elution. The method developed was validated according to the criteria of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Recovery percentages varied between 94% and 106%, repeatability percentages were within the range of 1.7–9.2% and the intralaboratory reproducibility varied between 2.8% and 9.3% for all compounds, except for tylosin A for which more variation was observed resulting in a higher measurement uncertainty. The limit of detection and limit of quantification varied between 1.1 and 20.2 and between 3.5 and 67.3μg/kg, respectively. This method was used to determine the presence and concentration of the seven antibiotic residues in swine manure sampled from ten different manure pits on farms where the selected antibiotics were used. A link was found between the antibiotics used and detected, except for ceftiofur which is injected at low doses and degraded readily in swine manure and was therefore not recovered in any of the samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method available for the simultaneous extraction and quantification of colistin with other antibiotic classes. Additionally, colistin was never extracted from swine manure before. Another innovative aspect of this method is the simultaneous detection and quantification of five different classes of antibiotic residues in swine manure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aantibiotic residues 3aceftiofur 3achromatography 3acolistin 3adetection limit 3adoxycycline 3afarms 3aformic acid 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3aoxytetracycline 3apig manure 3asulfadiazine 3atrichloroacetic acid 3atrimethoprim 3atylosin 3auncertainty 3aveterinary drugs 0aUltra high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) 0aMulti-residue 0aSwine manure 0aValidation 0aVeterinary antibiotics1 aPamel, Els Van1 aPoucke, Christof Van1 aHerman, Lieve1 aHeyndrickx, Marc1 aRasschaert, Geertrui1 aDaeseleire, Els0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 1429 p.248-257dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.12.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01292naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013500162300001600297520034900313592002800662650001800690650002000708651001400728700002900742700002100771700002300792773010500815856007300920852000900993655001201002IND60727760820221116153233.0210212e20190524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072776082DNAL7 a10.15560/15.3.4212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo, Santiago10aNew records of Tachybaptus dominicus (Linnaeus, 1766) (Aves, Podicipedidae) south of its currently known distribution in Argentina  ap. 421-424.  aWe report on 4 records of the Least Grebe, Tachybaptus dominicus (Linnaeus, 1766), to the south of its theoretical distributional limit in C&oacute;rdoba Province, Argentina.

Forty—two percent of 350 study area nests and 57% of 237 beach survey nests produced emerging young; 38% and 24%, respectively, were destroyed by dogs, coatis, and vultures. The mean emergence percentage for the successful study area nests was 83%. About 13% of all eggs deposited did not hatch. A mean incubation period of 62 d and a mean clutch size of 104 eggs were recorded. Emergence success was not influenced by other recorded parameters (nest position on beach, rainfall, turtle's tag year, time of season, incubation period, and clutch size). Incubation period was related to nest position and clutch size. Dogs, coatis, and black and turkey vultures were the chief predators at Tortuguero; dogs did the most damage. Dogs and coatis found nests at all stages of development, but destroyed more nests containing hatchlings than nests containing unhatched eggs. Predation was related to nest position, but not to nest density. Nests were destroyed in equal proportion on the entire 35.4 km of beach. Predator activity was not consistent throughout the season; proportionally more nests were destroyed near the end of the nesting season than during the beginning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCathartes aura 3aChelonia mydas 3aclutch size 3adevelopmental stages 3adogs 3aeggs 3ahatching 3anesting 3anests 3apredation 3apredators 3arain 3asurveys 3aturkeys 3aturtles 3aCosta Rica0 tEcology.g1979 Oct., v. 60, no. 5 p.946-955dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19368633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245013000159300001600289500001500305520156400320592002801884650001101912650001601923650001301939650001301952650000901965650001801974650002601992650001502018650002602033650001702059650002602076650001602102653001102118700002002129700005502149700006302204700005902267773013702326856007902463852000902542655001202551IND60600000220221121074356.0180702e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060000022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b050982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Wei10aEffect of Shewanella oneidensis on the Kinetics of Fe(II)-Catalyzed Transformation of Ferrihydrite to Crystalline Iron Oxides  ap. 114-123.  a2019-12-06  aIron (oxyhydr)oxides are widespread in natural and engineered systems, potent adsorbents of contaminants and a source of energy for iron-reducing bacteria. Microbial reduction of iron (oxyhydr)oxides results in the formation of Fe(II) which can induce the transformation of these iron minerals, typically from less crystalline to more crystalline forms, affecting the biogeochemical cycling of iron and the behavior of any species adsorbed to the iron (oxyhydr)oxides. Factors influencing the transformation rate of the poorly crystalline iron (oxyhydr)oxide, ferrihydrite, to more crystalline forms in the presence of the iron reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 are investigated under controlled laboratory conditions in this work. In particular, the amount of Fe(II) produced increased the transformation rate while increasing concentrations of the electron donor, lactate, decreased the rate. Using kinetic parameters determined from abiotic controls, the results of transformation experiments in the presence of Shewanella oneidensis were modeled with this exercise revealing that less goethite and more lepidocrocite formed than expected. Conversely, studies using the Shewanella exudate only, containing biogenic Fe(II), displayed rates of transformation that were satisfactorily modeled using these abiotic control kinetic parameters. This result suggests that the physical presence of the microbes is pivotal to the reduction in ferrihydrite transformation rate observed in the biotic experiments relative to the analogous abiotic controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3airon oxides 3abacteria 3agoethite 3airon 3alepidocrocite 3aShewanella oneidensis 3aadsorbents 3aenvironmental science 3aferrihydrite 3abiogeochemical cycles 3alactic acid 0aoxides1 aJones, Adele M.1 aLi, Xiaomin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8718-27801 aCollins, Richard N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8895-70311 aWaite, T.

The phosphoinositide 3- kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target for rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway (PI3K/Akt- mTOR) is an important pathway in protein synthesis, cell growth, cell proliferation, and lipid metabolism. The sphingolipid, dihydrosphingosine 1 phosphate (dhS1P) has been shown to bind to high density lipids in plasma. Unlike its analog, spingosine 1 phosphate (S1P), the role of dhS1P in cardiac fibrosis is still being deciphered. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of dhS1P on PI3K/Akt signalling in primary cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes. Our findings demonstrate that inhibiting PI3K reduced collagen synthesis in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts (NCFs), and hypertrophy in neonatal cardiac myocytes (NCMs) induced by dhS1P, in vitro. Reduced activation of the PI3K/Akt- mTOR signalling pathway led to impaired translation of fibrotic proteins such as collagen 1 (Coll1) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and inhibited the transcription and translation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1). PI3K inhibition also affected the gene expression of S1P receptors and enzymes such as the dihydroceramide delta 4 desaturase (DEGS1) and sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) in the de novo sphingolipid pathway. While in myocytes, PI3K inhibition reduced myocyte hypertrophy induced by dhS1P by reducing skeletal muscle α- actin (αSKA) mRNA expression, and protein translation due to increased glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) mRNA expression. Our findings show a relationship between the PI3K/Akt- mTOR signalling cascade and exogenous dhS1P induced collagen synthesis and myocyte hypertrophy in primary neonatal cardiac cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acardiomyocytes 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3acollagen 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3aglycogen synthase kinases 3aheart failure 3ahypertrophy 3ainterstitial collagenase 3alipid metabolism 3amammals 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aphosphates 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotein synthesis 3arapamycin 3askeletal muscle 3asphingolipids 3asphingosine 0aAkt 0aANP 0aαSMA 0aβ1AR 0aβMHC 0aBNP 0aColl1a1 0aCTGF 0adhS1P 0aECM 0aGSK3β 0aMI 0aMMP2 0amTOR 0aNCF 0aNCM 0aPI3K 0aRPS6 0aS1P 0aS1PRs 0aS1PR1 0aSK1 0aαSKA 0aTGFβ 0aTIMP1 0aW 0aFibrosis 0aHypertrophy 0aDihydrosphingosine 1 phosphate 0aSphingolipid 0aPI3K 0aProtein kinase B/Akt 0amTOR 0aRibosomal protein S6 0aCardiac remodelling1 aSavira, Feby1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0383-812X1 aHua, Yue1 aXiong, Xin1 aHuang, Li1 aReid, Christopher1 aFlynn, Bernard L.1 aKaye, David1 aLiew, Danny1 aWang, Bing H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9580-25480 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2021 May, v. 134 p.105952-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2021.1059523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245008800165300001800253520034500271592002800616650001800644650001900662650001100681650002700692650002300719650002100742650002900763650001300792650002100805650002500826700008000851700002200931700001700953700002100970700001500991700002001006773013301026856007401159852000901233655001201242IND60659534820221122024205.0190823e20120521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065953482DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc31341c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLicht, S.q(Stuart),10aSTEP cement: Solar Thermal Electrochemical Production of CaO without CO₂ emission  ap. 6019-6021.  aNew molten salt chemistry allows solar thermal energy to drive calcium oxide production without any carbon dioxide emission.

Moreover, the fact that the effect of the IC on VI can be stronger than other biophysical or seasonal processes is under debate. Using Google Earth Engine and the latest Landsat Surface Reflectance level 1 data, we evaluated the temporal patterns of IC and two VI, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in a mountainous tropical forest during the years 1984–2017. We evaluated IC and VI at different times, their relationship with the topography and the correlations between them. We show that IC is useful for understanding the patterns of variation between VI and IC at the pixel level using Landsat sensors. Our findings confirmed a strong correlation between EVI and IC and less between NDVI and IC. We found a significant increase in IC, EVI, and NDVI throughout time due to an improvement in the position of all Landsat sensors. Our results reinforce the need to consider IC to interpret VI over long periods using Landsat data in order to increase the precision of monitoring VI in irregular topography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3alighting 3amonitoring 3amountains 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3atopography 3atropical forests 3avegetation structure1 aGarcía-Montero, Luis  Gonzaga1 aSibelet, Nicole 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Jan. 08, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120202113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01358naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245004500167520040200212592002800614650002500642650001300667650001600680650001500696653003300711653001500744653002800759700001600787700002200803773012600825856008400951852000901035655001201044IND60728481420221121094848.0210715e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072848142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2021.1014292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Beng Hau10aIdentifying surface-attached nanobubbles  aSurface-attached nanobubbles are spherical cap–shaped gas bubbles that remain stable in size in saturated liquids.

Cadaverine and putrescine were remarkably accumulated in some samples, whereas histamine and spermidine were less abundant, but more frequently present. Histamine concentration was very low in all groups, having the highest value in samples from FAO 51 (median with 25th–75th percentile = 9.3, 4.4–13.4 mg kg⁻¹). Cadaverine was completely absent from tunas deriving from FAOs 51, 37 and 71, while Atlantic Ocean samples demonstrated its noticeable presence (median with 25th–75th percentile = 34.7, 17.6–66.9 mg kg⁻¹). Putrescine generally followed the cadaverine occurrence, but its levels remained very low: FAO 51 and 37 did not reveal any presence, while in FAO 71 slightly elevated concentrations appeared (median with 25th–75th percentile = 6.1, 0–43.3 mg kg⁻¹). There were no significant differences in spermine levels between FAO groups. The results indicate that the established capture, post-capture and storage practices used for Bluefin tunas ensure good quality. A hazardous content could not be detected in the investigated samples and a health risk does not exist. Reported differences in biogenic amine quality and quantity are provoked by environmental conditions and individual variation between FAO areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aThunnus thynnus 3acadaverine 3aenvironmental factors 3ahistamine 3aputrescine 3arisk 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3atuna 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aIndian Ocean 3aMediterranean Sea 3aPacific Ocean1 aPanseri, Sara1 aPavlovic, Radmila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2128-45891 aArioli, Francesco0 tJournal für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 4 p.375-382dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000096x1661-57517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00003-018-1184-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011800171300001800289520047300307592002800780650001700808650002300825650002300848650003600871650001400907650001700921650002200938650002600960650002200986651001101008700002101019700001901040700001501059700002101074700005701095700001701152700001901169700001701188700001901205700001701224700005801241773012201299856008301421852000901504655001201513IND60615197220221120183751.0181009e20180927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061519722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b024112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Byeoung-Kyu10aStreptoglycerides A–D with a Rare 6/5/5 Tricyclic Ring Skeleton from a Marine Actinomycete Streptomyces species  ap. 6037-6040.  aFour novel secondary metabolites possessing a unique 6/5/5 tricyclic ring system, streptoglycerides A–D (1–4), were isolated from a marine actinomycete Streptomyces sp. derived from a mangrove sample collected on Kosrae Island.

This paper reports on the development of an at-line automatic micro-solid phase extraction (μSPE) method for the determination of salivary cotinine followed by its analysis via hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The SPE methodology is based on the bead injection (BI) concept in a mesofluidic lab-on-valve (LOV) flow system to automatically perform all SPE steps. Three commercially available reversed-phase sorbents were tested, namely, Oasis HLB, Lichrolut EN and Focus, and the spherically shaped sorbents (i.e., Oasis HLB and Focus) provided better packing within the SPE column and hence higher column efficiency. An HILIC column was chosen based on its potential for achieving higher sensitivity and better retention of polar compounds such as cotinine. The method uses an isocratic program with acetonitrile:100mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.8 in 95:5v/v ratio as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0mLmin⁻¹. Using this approach, the linear calibration range was from 10 to 1000ng which corresponded to 5–500μgL⁻¹. The corresponding μSPE-BI-LOV system was proven to be reliable in the handing and analysis of viscous biological samples such as saliva, achieving a sampling rate of 6h⁻¹ and a limit of detection and quantification of 1.5 and 3μgL⁻¹, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium acetate 3abiomarkers 3abuffers 3acotinine 3adetection limit 3ahalf life 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3anicotine 3apH 3apolar compounds 3asaliva 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 0aCotinine 0aSaliva 0aHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography 0aBead injection 0aLab-on-valve1 aBarreiros, Luísa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3481-58091 aAlmeida, M.

Effect of experimental conditions on peroxidase binding capacity of PHEMABA cryogel membranes was determined by examining parameters such as pH, temperature and time with binding studies. Maximum peroxidase binding capacity of PHEMABA cryogel membranes was determined as 22.01 mg/g for 2 mg/mL equilibrium peroxidase concentration at pH 8.0. Finally, peroxidase was purified from Brassica oleracea roots with 85.38% yield and 18.38 purification fold. According to obtained results, spongy PHEMABA cryogel membranes show high peroxidase binding capacity and could be suggested as a boronate affinity model system for enzyme purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3acontact angle 3acryogels 3apH 3aperoxidase 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aSpongy membrane 0a2-4-Vinylphenylboronic acid 0aEnzyme purification 0aCryogel1 aZenger, Okan1 aPerçin, Işık1 aDenizli, Adil0 tProcess biochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 103 p.98-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2021.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011300171300001400284520142500298592002801723650001301751650001701764650001801781650001801799650001301817650001901830650001501849650001101864650003701875653001901912653002501931653001301956653002401969653002701993653002002020700003102040700006402071700002802135700003102163700002902194700006602223773010402289856008702393852000902480655001202489IND60613288620221120072053.0200517e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061328862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRey, Valentina10aKinetics and growth mechanism of the photoinduced synthesis of silver nanoparticles stabilized with lysozyme  ap. 10-16.  aA fast and single-step procedure is reported for the preparation of stable solutions of spherical-shaped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) coated with lysozyme (LZ). The preparation of the AgNP@LZ nanocomposites was based on the reduction of Ag⁺ with ketyl radicals photo-generated by the UVA-photolysis of the benzoin I-2959. Both reaction precursors bind to LZ, modifying its superficial charge and conformational structure. The photo-induced kinetics of formation of the AgNPs as a function of the LZ concentration was monitored in-situ by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The multivariate curve resolution-alternating least square (MCR–ALS) method was used for the deconvolution of the kinetic curves for each transient species formed before the growth of the final AgNPs colloids. The Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) model to describe the formation of the AgNPs was used, and the respective first-order rate constants for the growth of the AgNPs as a function of the lysozyme concentration were calculated and the role of the protein capping in the growth kinetics was evaluated. Despite the protein being partially oxidized by the photo-generated radicals, it was strongly adsorbed onto the silver surface forming a tight coating shell around the AgNPs of approximately 30–60 protein molecules. As a result of the partial denaturation and crowded packing, its intrinsic lytic activity was strongly reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3adenaturation 3afree radicals 3agrowth models 3alysozyme 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3asilver 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aPhotoreduction 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aLysozyme 0aNanoparticle growth 0aAggregative-nucleation 0aProtein coating1 aGramajo Feijoo, Marcelo E.1 aGiménez, Rodrigo E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5847-91121 aTuttolomondo, María E.1 aMorán Vieyra, Faustino E.1 aSosa Morales, Marcelo C.1 aBorsarelli, Claudio D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0120-645X0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 172 p.10-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013400165300001600299500001900315520135200334592002801686650001401714650002501728650001501753650002301768650001301791650001901804650001701823650001501840650001301855650001301868650001801881650001401899650001601913650001701929653000701946653000801953653000801961653000801969653000901977653000801986653000701994653001002001653003002011653001502041653000902056653003102065700001602096700001402112773010102126856008502227852000902312655001202321IND60717877020221116222059.0210603e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071787702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2020.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ying10aTransfer of miR-15a-5p by placental exosomes promotes pre-eclampsia progression by regulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via CDK1  ap. 277-286.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPreeclampsia (PE) is a systemic complication that occurs after the 20th week of gestation and is characterized by the onset of hypertension and proteinuria. Dysregulated circulating microRNA (miRNA) has usually been noted in PE. Understanding the release profile and bioactivity of placental exosomes is a promising mode of identifying dysregulated miRNA, which may be useful biomarkers of PE. Herein, we aimed to investigate the role of placental exosomes and their miRNA cargo miR-15a-5p in PE. miR-15a-5p was found upregulated in exosomes isolated from maternal plasma of PE pregnant women as compared to those from normal pregnant women. Placental exosomes derived from PE pregnant women suppressed the proliferation and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells but promoted cell apoptosis, which was dictated by their cargo miR-15a-5p. Further investigation showed that exosomal miR-15a-5p inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by down-regulating CDK1, thus suppressing HTR-8/SVneo cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis. In vivo analysis demonstrated that placental exosomes treated with miR-15a-5p inhibitor attenuated histopathologic changes and apoptosis in the placenta of PE mice. In conclusion, these results provided evidence that transfer of miR-15a-5p by placental exosomes could be a promising therapeutic target to combat PE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3abiomarkers 3acell proliferation 3aexosomes 3ahistopathology 3ahypertension 3aimmunology 3amicroRNA 3aplacenta 3apre-eclampsia 3apregnancy 3aproteinuria 3atherapeutics 0aPE 0aTEM 0aNTA 0aNTA 0aPMSF 0aSDS 0aNC 0a3'UTR 0aPlacenta-derived exosomes 0amiR-15a-5p 0aCDK1 0aPI3K/AKT signaling pathway1 aDu, Xiaomin1 aWang, Jun0 tMolecular immunology.g2020 Dec., v. 128 p.277-286dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008700171300001400258520115300272536051901425592002801944596001601972650003501988650000902023650002102032650002802053650001402081650000902095650001402104650001302118650002402131650000902155650001202164650001302176651002902189700002902218700002202247700001702269700002302286773013302309856008602442852000902528655001202537IND60765787620221118124653.0220202e20220202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076578762DNAL7 a10.1080/1533015X.2021.19430622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, John H.10aFactors affecting staff support of a voluntary nonlead ammunition outreach program  ap. 55-72.  aLead poisoning from ingestion of bullet fragments in gut piles and unretrieved deer carcasses continues to cause mortality in bald eagles. To address this issue, the Midwest region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) initiated an outreach program during 2016–2018 encouraging hunters to voluntarily use nonlead ammunition while deer hunting on National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs). We conducted a survey to assess this program using seven factors that might influence USFWS staff support for the nonlead outreach program: innovativeness, lead exposure to bald eagles, availability of training and outreach materials, satisfaction with program implementation, importance of informational materials, and if they were a deer hunter. Multiple linear regression showed attitudes toward eagles’ lead risk and importance of informational materials had the strongest effect on program support, followed by an individual’s innovativeness. Although previous studies have focused on influencing hunters’ nonlead use, our findings show staff attitudes and perceptions about nonlead strongly affect program support and ultimately program outcomes.  aThis work was supported by the University of Missouri J.

Key factors for success of this rearrangement are the presence of bulky silyl (TIPS or TBDPS) substituents at both O-2 and O-3 and a free hydroxy group at C-4 (derivatives with acid-labile protective groups at O-4 will also engage in this reaction). The rearrangement cleanly proceeds for 2,3-di-O-TIPS derivatives with two hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-6, acid-labile TES groups at O-4 and O-6, or one acyl substituent (Bz, ClAc) at O-6. A possibility to switch the direction of the debenzylidenation reaction in 4,6-O-benzylidene-2,3-di-O-TIPS/TBDPS derivatives by the choice of an acid (TFA, which cleanly gives furanose, versus AcOH, which cleaves benzylidene acetal only) may present an advantage in the divergent synthesis of selectively protected glycosyl donors (either in furanose or pyranose form) useful for the synthesis of biologically important oligosaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3amethylene chloride 3aoligosaccharides1 aMalysheva, Nelly N.1 aLitvinenko, Veronika V.1 aZinin, Alexander I.1 aKolotyrkina, Natalya G.1 aKononov, Leonid O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1858-77380 tOrganic letters.g2018 Sept. 14, v. 20, no. 19 p.6051-6054dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b024243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008200166300001400248520098600262592002801248650002001276650001501296650001501311650001201326651001001338653004001348653002701388653003101415653003201446653001801478700001701496773012301513856008301636852000901719655001201728IND60610538020221119164701.0180828e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061053802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiaowen10aRe-evaluation of the New Ecological Paradigm scale using item response theory  ap. 79-90.  aThis study employed the item response theory (IRT) technique to reevaluate the psychometric properties of the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale using a national-level survey dataset from China. This IRT analysis revealed some previously unreported but important issues with this widely-used environmental attitude measure. It was found that the NEP scale has differential measurement precision across the environmental attitude continuum; a method factor may exist; the negatively worded items have less measurement precision than the positively worded items; some items are redundant with regard to item information and a short version consisting of only positive items perform as well as the current version; and the middle response category provides little value.

Experimental rice paddies (6.3m ×× 3.15m) exposed to natural colonization of mosquitoes were sampled weekly for two rice growing cycles between February 2004 and March 2005. Overall, 21,325 Anopheles larvae were collected, of which 91.9%% were 1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ instars and 8.1%% were 3ʳᵈ and 4ᵗʰ instars. An. arabiensis was the predominant species (84.1%%) with other species, An. pharoensis (13.5%%), An. funestus (2.1%%), An. coustani (0.3%%), and An. maculipalpis (0.1%%) accounting for only a small proportion of the anophelines collected. Culex quinquefasciatus (65.7%%) was the predominant species among the non-anopheline species. Others species collected included: C. annulioris (9.9%%), C. poicilipes (7.3%%), C. tigripes (7.2%%), C. duttoni (0.6%%), Aedes aegypti (5.3%%), Ae. cumminsii (3.5%%), and Ae. vittatus (0.7%%). The densities of the major anopheline species were closely related to rice stage and condition of the rice field. An. arabiensis, the predominant species, was most abundant over a three-week period after transplanting. Low densities of larvae were collected during the late vegetative, reproductive, and ripening phases of rice. An increase in larval density ten days post-transplanting was found to correlate with the application of fertilizer (sulphate of ammonia). Culicine and aedine species densities were significantly higher during the post-harvesting period. Our results suggest that the transplanting stage is favorable for the growth of immature stages of An. arabiensis and provides a narrow window for targeted larval intervention in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRice growth cycle 0aAnopheles larval species 0arice height 0atillers 0awater depth 0alarval control1 aShililu, Josephat1 aMuturi, Ephantus1 aGu, Weidong1 aMbogo, Charles1 aKabiru, Ephantus1 aJacob, Benjamin1 aGithure, John1 aNovak, Robert0 tJournal of vector ecology.g2006 Dec., v. 31, no. 2 p.245-251dSociety for Vector EcologywJournal:19531x1081-17107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3376/1081-1710(2006)31[245:DOISOA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245014000175300001400315520111100329592002801440650001401468650003601482650002001518650001501538653003201553653002901585653002201614653004301636700001701679700001601696773012301712856008301835852000901918655001201927IND60610538120221119164652.0180828e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061053812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuepert, Angela Maria14aThe relationship between Corporate Environmental Responsibility, employees’ biospheric values and pro-environmental behaviour at work  ap. 65-78.  aMany organizations strive for Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER). This can make organizational processes and procedures more pro-environmental, but does it also promote employees’ pro-environmental behaviour? We reason that CER can encourage employees to act pro-environmentally at work by increasing the likelihood that they consider the environmental consequences of their behaviour. In two studies, we test to what extent CER affects pro-environmental behaviour at work, and whether this depends on the extent to which employees value nature and the environment (i.e., endorse biospheric values). Both studies show that stronger biospheric values and perceived CER are related to more self-reported pro-environmental behaviour at work. Interestingly, the relationship between perceived CER and self-reported pro-environmental behaviour was stronger among those with moderate to weak biospheric values. These results suggest that relative weak biospheric values are less likely to inhibit pro-environmental behaviour at work when employees believe that their organization aims to realize CER.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosphere 3acorporate social responsibility 3ahuman resources 3apsychology 0aPro-environmental behaviour 0aOrganizational behaviour 0aBiospheric values 0aCorporate Environmental Responsibility1 aKeizer, Kees1 aSteg, Linda0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2017 Dec., v. 54 p.65-78dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010400163300001600267500001900283520123200302592002801534650002701562650001901589650001501608650002201623650002301645650001301668650000901681650001901690650001501709650001301724650001301737650001001750650001401760650002401774650002801798650004301826650002901869653001501898653001901913700001401932700001401946700001301960700001301973700001501986700001702001773010102018856008502119852000902204655001202213IND60717877220221116221805.0210603e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071787722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2020.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Na10aDetecting Cynoglossus semilaevis infected with Vibrio harveyi using micro RNAs from mucous exosomes  ap. 268-276.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExosomes are important mediators of vesicle transportation and contain microRNAs (miRNAs) that mediate transcriptional gene knockout and silencing in biological processes. Moreover, exosomic miRNAs are promising biomarkers for disease diagnosis and physiological status indication in many species, including fish. The impact of the Vibrio harveyi pathogen on Cynoglossus semilaevis aquaculture is becoming more and more serious as the industry expands. To overcome this challenge, miRNAs in mucous exosomes were screened by small RNA sequencing and verified by quantitative real-time PCR to develop biomarkers. This is the first capture of exosomes from flatfish mucus coupled with miRNA profiling. The results revealed significant differences in expression levels of some miRNAs between infected and healthy fish. Three unique miRNAs were identified for V. harveyi infection diagnosis; expression levels of dre-miR-205-5p and dre-miR-205-5p in infected fish were significantly lower than controls, while dre-miR-100-5p expression was higher. These miRNAs in mucous exosomes could be used to differentiate diseased and healthy fish in an early screening method with practical value for breeding disease-resistant C. semilaevis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynoglossus semilaevis 3aVibrio harveyi 3abiomarkers 3adisease diagnosis 3adisease resistance 3aexosomes 3afish 3agene targeting 3aimmunology 3aindustry 3amicroRNA 3amucus 3apathogens 3aphysiological state 3aphysiological transport 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 0aMicro RNAs 0aMucous exosome1 aZhang, Bo1 aXu, Zihui1 aJia, Lei1 aLi, Ming1 aHe, Xiaoxu1 aBao, Baolong0 tMolecular immunology.g2020 Dec., v. 128 p.268-276dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009600169500001900265520170800284592002801992650001102020650001402031650002302045650001402068650002102082650001302103650002402116650001202140650001102152650001302163650001002176650001602186653002802202653002002230653001702250653003102267700005602298700005902354700005502413700007402468773011202542856008502654852000902739655001202748IND60719449520221118024418.0210212e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071944952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1189092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mingming10aHydrogen production by methane steam reforming using metallic nickel hollow fiber membranes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe metallic nickel hollow fiber membranes (NHFMs) consisting of a dense skin layer integrated on porous nickel substrate were fabricated in a single extrusion step by using a 90 wt% NMP-H₂O solution and water as the respective internal and external coagulants during the spinning process. The resultant asymmetric Ni hollow fibers by sintering were directly applied to hydrogen production from methane steam reforming (MSR), where the porous internal surface functioned as a catalyst bed for MSR reactions, and the external dense skin layer served as the membrane for hydrogen extraction from the reaction products. The effects of the feed composition in terms of steam-to-methane ratio (H₂O/CH₄) and methane concentration; the operational parameters including temperature, space velocity, and the sweep gas flow rate on the performance of the hollow fibers were investigated. The results reveal that the reaction operational temperature should be above 800 °C and the H₂O/CH₄ ratio controlled around 3 so as to achieve both high methane conversion and high H₂ production rate. When operated at 1000 °C and 25,937 h⁻¹ methane space velocity, the maximum H₂ production rate reached 50.84 mmol m⁻² s⁻¹ while the methane conversion reached at 98.58%. In order to produce pure hydrogen, steam may be used as the sweep fluid instead of inert gases such as nitrogen to prevent the dilution of the permeated gaseous hydrogen. The prepared asymmetric NHFMs also demonstrate high chemical stability in the reformate gases and high resistance to carbon deposition at above 800 °C, and thus may be a promising way of cost-effective hydrogen production by MSR at high temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acost effectiveness 3aextrusion 3afeed composition 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3anickel 3anitrogen 3asteam 3atemperature 0aMethane steam reforming 0aNickel membrane 0aHollow fiber 0aCatalytic membrane reactor1 aTan, Xiaoyao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2704-80181 aMotuzas, Julius1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0759-13011 aLi, Jiaquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7924-05731 aLau, R.

Here, we use gene expression patterns in combination with weighted gene coexpression networks and generalized additive models to predict effects on reproduction in the aquatic microcrustacean Daphnia. We developed models to predict effects on reproduction upon exposure to different cyanobacteria, different insecticides and binary mixtures of cyanobacteria and insecticides. Models developed specifically for groups of stressors (e.g., either cyanobacteria or insecticides) performed better than general models developed on all data. Furthermore, models developed using in silico generated mixture gene expression profiles from single stressor data were able to better predict effects on reproduction compared to models derived from the mixture exposures themselves. Our results highlight the potential of gene expression data to quantify effects of complex exposures at higher level organismal effects without prior mechanistic knowledge or complex exposure data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aDaphnia 3aanthropogenic stressors 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aenvironmental science 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainsecticides 3amodels 3areproduction1 aPfrender, M.

Here, we examine the solvent-free unfolding pathway for a group of homologous serum albumins. Utilizing a combination of chemical probes and noncovalent reconstructions, we draw new specific conclusions regarding the unfolding of albumins in the gas phase, as well as more general inferences regarding the sensitivity of collision induced unfolding to changes in protein primary and tertiary structure. Our findings suggest that the general unfolding pathway of low charge state albumin ions is largely unaffected by changes in primary structure; however, the stabilities of intermediates along these pathways vary widely as sequences diverge. Additionally, we find that human albumin follows a domain associated unfolding pathway, and we are able to assign each unfolded form observed in our gas-phase data set to the disruption of specific domains within the protein. The totality of our data informs the first detailed mechanism for multidomain protein unfolding in the gas phase, and highlights key similarities and differences from the known solution-phase pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalbumins 3adata collection 3adrugs 3agases 3ahumans 3aions 3aprotein unfolding1 aMartini, Rachel M.1 aRuotolo, Brandon T.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 139, no. 1 p.534-540dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b116783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245005300159300001800212520122000230592002801450650001501478650001001493650001401503650001601517650001801533650001201551650001301563650001801576650001401594650001801608650002201626650002001648650001601668650001201684773009801696856007101794852000901865655001201874IND60518654820221121012804.0160418e197912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051865482DNAL7 a10.2307/19369682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeanne, Robert L.12aA Latitudinal Gradient in Rates of Ant Predation  ap. 1211-1224.  aPredation by ants on wasp larva baits was assessed at five latitudes from 43°N to 2°S. Rates of predation were significantly greater in the tropics; that is, a food item was exploited by ants in significantly less time in the tropics than in the temperate zone. It was also found that predation rates were higher in low second—growth vegetation than in forests and higher on the ground than on vegetation, and that these differences were more pronounced in the temperature zone than in the tropics. Rates of predation occuring on buildings were lower than in natural situations at every latitude. The number of ant species taken at the baits increased from 22 at the northernmost locality to 74 at the southernmost. In all localities but the northernmost the forest habitat produced a greater diversity of species than the field habitat. There was greater degree of microhabitat specificity among ants in the tropics than in the temperate zone. The proportion of forest canopy specialists also increased toward the tropics. Overall predation rate and ant species richness were found to be positively correlated on a latitudinal scale, but this relationship broke down at the level of habitats and microhabitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3abaits 3abuildings 3acorrelation 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3alatitude 3amicrohabitats 3apredation 3asecond growth 3aspecies diversity 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atropics0 tEcology.g1979 Dec., v. 60, no. 6 p.1211-1224dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19369683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008800157300001800245500002000263520142800283592002801711596005401739596007601793596005901869596005901928596005901987596007602046650002502122650002402147650002502171650001302196650002002209650001602229650001402245650002002259650002002279650003602299650001502335650001602350650002802366650002502394650001902419700001402438700001802452700002302470700001502493700002102508700001902529700001902548700002002567700005402587773014802641856007302789852000902862655001202871IND60644561220221117023615.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064456122DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.96042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Si‐Qi10aAntioxidative system in sweet potato root is activated by low‐temperature storage  ap. 3824-3833.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Sweet potato is susceptible to chilling injury during low‐temperature storage. To explore the correlation between chilling injury and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, the content of ROS and the activities and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes were analyzed in the typical storage‐tolerant cultivar Xushu 32 and storage‐sensitive cultivar Yanshu 25. RESULTS: The activities of antioxidant enzymes including ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) were enhanced rapidly in the early period of storage in response to chilling stress. Thereafter, the content of ROS metabolites increased consistently due to gradual decrease in ROS scavenging enzymes. Storage‐tolerant cultivar Xushu 32 had higher antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expressions as well as higher content of antioxidant metabolites and lower content of ROS metabolites compared with storage‐sensitive cultivar Yanshu 25, suggesting that the capacity of ROS scavenging by antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants is highly associated with the tolerance of sweet potato to chilling stress. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that the antioxidative system is activated in the storage root of sweet potato and the antioxidative capacity is positively associated with better storage performance in the storage‐tolerant cultivar. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐10‐B1cChina Agriculture Research System  aJZ2018HGTB0241cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a31670278cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31470013cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31300133cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a16030701073cMajor Projects of Science and Technology in Anhui Province 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3achilling injury 3acold stress 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asweet potatoes1 aTang, Jun1 aHu, Kang‐Di1 aHuang, Zhong‐Qin1 aYang, Feng1 aZhang, Hui‐Yun1 aHu, Lan‐Ying1 aLi, Yan‐Hong1 aYao, Gai‐Fang1 aZhang, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8406-83730 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2019 June, v. 99, no. 8 p.3824-3833dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.96043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008900168300001200257520110600269592002801375650001101403650001301414650001001427650001801437650002001455653002101475653001901496653002501515653002601540653003301566700002301599773011001622856008401732852000901816655001201825IND60610538420221119164644.0180911e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061053842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharry, Karine10aChildren's response to “ecofriendly” labelling: The role of self-concept clarity  ap. 1-7.  aResearch on adults has examined the effectiveness of social labelling on influencing consumption, especially ecofriendly consumption, and has proposed a self-concept-based mechanism to explain the effectiveness. Surprisingly, however, despite the growth in children's consumption autonomy at an earlier age and their influence on other family members and peers, social labelling effectiveness has scarcely been investigated among children. In addition, discussions of the mechanisms of social labelling have remained at a theorizing level. To address these gaps, this research shows that a nonintrusive ecofriendly social labelling protocol is effective at triggering preadolescents' pro-environmental dispositions and behaviours, thus eliminating the social dilemma that may come into play in this context. It also demonstrates the counterintuitive moderating role of self-concept clarity in this process, with preadolescents who display a clearer self-concept being more likely to act according to the label. These original findings have implications for public policy makers and follow-up research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achildren 3apeers 3apublic policy 3aself-perception 0aSocial labelling 0aPreadolescents 0aSelf-concept clarity 0aPersuasion mechanisms 0aPro-environmental behaviours1 aParguel, Béatrice0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2018 Aug., v. 58 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01159naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003800139245014400177300001600321520023200337592002800569650001500597651001700612651001300629700002300642700002800665773010600693856007300799852000900872655001200881IND60727761820221116153319.0210212e20190614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072776182DNAL7 a10.15560/15.3.4852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParra-Hernández, Ronald Mauricio10aNew record of Tantilla alticola (Boulenger, 1903) (Serpentes, Colubridae) for the Central Cordillera in the department of Tolima, Colombia  ap. 485-488.  aWe report for the first time the presence of Tantilla alticola in the department of Tolima, Colombia.

A Qualitative Study to Understand the Effects of Nutrition and Health Claims on Perceptions and Consumption of Food  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNutrition and Health Claims (NHCs) have been found to influence perceptions of food and consumption behaviour. While previous quantitative research has identified factors that may explain these effects, the current study aimed to address the dearth of in-depth exploration as to the underlying reasons why and how claims may impact upon perceptions and behaviour and the relationships between key factors. Seventy-eight participants took part in 10 focus groups. Discussions were transcribed verbatim and Nvivo 11 was used for thematic analysis. Six themes were developed from the data: 1. Target populations for NHCs; 2. Influence of NHCs on purchasing behaviour; 3. Characteristics/perceptions of products displaying NHCs; 4. Believability of NHCs; 5. Superior yet superficial knowledge; 6. Consumption of products displaying NHCs. Knowledge was a key factor influencing how much individuals believe claims (Believability of NHCs) and their perceptions (Characteristics/perceptions of products displaying NHCs). These perceptions and the characteristics of products displaying claims also impacted believability, as well as purchasing behaviour and consumption. Future research should be cognisant of the role of knowledge and characteristics or perceptions of products in the relationship between NHCs and consumer behaviour, and modelling of these relationships would allow their relative strength to be identified.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconsumer behavior 3afocus groups 3ahealth claims 3amodels 3anutrition 3apurchasing 3aquantitative analysis1 aLavelle, Fiona 1 aMcCloat, Amanda 1 aMooney, Elaine 1 aBucher, Tamara 1 aEgan, Bernadette 1 aDean, Moira 0 tNutrients.g2019 Sept. 02, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110920583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01565naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007800168300001400246520056000260592002800820650001600848650002900864650001500893650002000908653001700928653001800945653003100963653001100994700002901005773011201034856008401146852000901230655001201239IND60610538520221119164740.0180911e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061053852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVesely, Stepan10aHow anonymity and norms influence costly support for environmental causes  ap. 27-30.  aSocial norms are a key driver of pro-environmental action, but their influence may vary by context.

UV damage is a result of increases in MMPs activity and degradation of collagen, resulting in wrinkle formation. Although the antioxidant potential of Urtica species is well known, the protective effects of Urtica thunbergiana against UVB-irradiated photoaging have not been explored. To examine the anti-photoaging effects of Urtica thunbergiana leaf extract (UT), levels of intracellular ROS, MMPs, IL-6, procollagen type 1, and TGF-β1 were investigated in UVB-irradiated NHDFs. We also examined anti-wrinkle effects of UT by measuring physiological and histological skin changes in hairless mice. Our data showed that UVB exposure decreased the level of phosphorylated NFATc1. One active component of UT, chlorogenic acid (CGA), regulated NFATc1 dephosphorylation to a similar extent as tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor. Our results suggest that UT and its active component, CGA, have the potential to prevent UVB-induced premature skin aging by regulating NFATc1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrtica 3aantioxidant activity 3achlorogenic acid 3acollagen 3adephosphorylation 3ahistology 3ain vivo studies 3ainterleukin-6 3aleaf extracts 3amice 3aphotoaging 3aprotective effect 3atacrolimus 3atranscription factors 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3aultraviolet radiation 0aUrtica thunbergiana 0aSkin 0aAnti-aging 0aUVB 0aNFATc1 0aChlorogenic acid1 aNgo, Hien T.T.1 aSeo, Seul A1 aPark, Bom1 aZhang, Mengyang1 aGao, Wei1 aHoo Yi, Tae0 tJournal of functional foods.g2017 Sept., v. 36 p.162-177dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2017.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010900177300001600286500001900302520105100321536020401372592002801576596011101604596005101715650002901766650001501795651001101810653002901821653001801850653002601868653001901894653002301913700003001936700002901966773011501995856008602110852000902196655001202205IND60695664420221120113300.0200521e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069566442DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2019.16907222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrado, Deborah Santos14aThe Dramas of the Marine Extractive Reserve Managers in Brazil: Navigating through Multiple Institutions  ap. 651-668.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, we describe and analyze the co-management institutional framework at 21 Brazilian Marine Extractive Reserves (MERs) and present the dramas of its implementation from the local manager’s perspective. We categorized the governance instruments of MERs into (i) instruments for land/sea tenure and beneficiaries’ recognition, (ii) territorial use planning, (iii) institutional arenas for discussion and deliberation, as well as (iv) public policies. Although the legal arrangements of these protected areas address fundamental dimensions of governance, we present the challenges of its implementation based on the voice of local managers. The managers are the bridge between the central government and communities, dealing with the implementation of the institutional framework in a reality of multi-level and multi-scale drama: from local to national dilemmas, from organizational to structural ones. We explore these dramas and highlight the institutional dilemmas based on the paradoxes between legalism and social emancipation.  aThis study was financed in part by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001 and by São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP 2015/19439-8).  aPublisher supplied data  cby Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001  aFAPESPa/a9-8cSão Paulo Research Foundation 3acollaborative management 3agovernance 3aBrazil 0aCollaborative governance 0aco-management 0amarine protected area 0aprotected area 0atraditional people1 aCastro, Fábio de,d1967-1 aSeixas, Cristiana Simão0 tSociety & natural resources.g2020 May 3, v. 33, no. 5 p.651-668dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.16907223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006100170300001600231520134300247592002801590650001401618650001001632650001101642650001401653650000901667650001501676650002501691650001501716650001701731653002201748653002801770653001501798653002201813653002501835653003101860700002001891700002501911700002201936700002001958773011101978856008602089852000902175655001202184IND60763913320221122151937.0220929e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076391332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandit, Sharda10aTissue-reactive drugs enable materials-free local depots  ap. 142-151.  aLocal, sustained drug delivery of potent therapeutics holds promise for the treatment of a myriad of localized diseases while eliminating systemic side effects. However, introduction of drug delivery depots such as viscous hydrogels or polymer-based implants is highly limited in stiff tissues such as desmoplastic tumors. Here, we present a method to create materials-free intratumoral drug depots through Tissue-Reactive Anchoring Pharmaceuticals (TRAPs). TRAPs diffuse into tissue and attach locally for sustained drug release. In TRAPs, potent drugs are modified with ECM-reactive groups and then locally injected to quickly react with accessible amines within the ECM, creating local drug depots. We demonstrate that locally injected TRAPs create dispersed, stable intratumoral depots deep within mouse and human pancreatic tumor tissues. TRAPs depots based on ECM-reactive paclitaxel (TRAP paclitaxel) had better solubility than free paclitaxel and enabled sustained in vitro and in vivo drug release. TRAP paclitaxel induced higher tumoral apoptosis and sustained better antitumor efficacy than the free drug. By providing continuous drug access to tumor cells, this material-free approach to sustained drug delivery of potent therapeutics has the potential in a wide variety of diseases where current injectable depots fall short.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3amice 3apaclitaxel 3apancreatic neoplasms 3asolubility 3atherapeutics 0aSustained release 0aMaterials-free delivery 0aPaclitaxel 0aPancreatic cancer 0aExtracellular matrix 0aN-hydroxysuccinimide ester1 aPalvai, Sandeep1 aMassaro, Nicholas P.1 aPierce, Joshua G.1 aBrudno, Yevgeny0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Mar., v. 343 p.142-151dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03917naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010900165300001600274500002000290500000900310520203300319592002802352596003002380596012602410650002102536650002402557650001602581650001802597650001302615650001202628650000902640650001802649650001302667650001502680650001402695650001502709650002002724650001902744650001302763650002602776650001302802650002402815650001802839650001802857650001302875650001702888650001302905651001402918700001502932700001902947700001602966700002202982700001603004700002203020773015803042856008203200852000903282655001203291IND60668096720221120092309.0220813e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066809672DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2018.09.03592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Shikha10aSoil Carbon Accumulation and Nutrient Availability in Managed and Unmanaged Ecosystems of East Tennessee  ap. 458-465.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCore Ideas Native woodlot and grassland systems have been converted to a managed turfgrass system with urbanization. Turfgrass systems increased carbon sequestration and nitrogen availability compared with row crop systems. Cool‐season (C₃) turfgrasses improved soil physical and chemical properties more than warm‐season (C₄) grasses. In the last two decades, urban and suburban lands grew by 34% in the United States, with 16 to 20 million ha maintained under turfgrass systems. Side‐by‐side comparison of turfgrass systems with other managed and unmanaged ecosystems have not been comprehensively conducted in the climate transition zone of the United States, despite the environmental significance of land use changes. Our objective was to determine the relative effects of C₃ and C₄ turfgrasses on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and nutrient availability, in comparison with managed row crop and unmanaged woodlot and grassland systems. Soil samples from depths of 0 to 5, 5 to 15, and 15 to 30 cm were collected during March 2017 at the University of Tennessee's East Tennessee Research and Education Center from seven ecosystems: (i) corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation, (ii) continuous soybean, (iii) tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea L.), (iv) Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), (v) bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.), (vi) unmanaged grassland, and (vii) unmanaged woodlot. All turfgrass species were established in 2012 and were managed like low‐input residential lawns. Within the 30‐cm soil profile, turfgrass systems contained 4.2 kg m⁻² SOC at the time of sampling, which was 33% more than croplands and 34% less than unmanaged systems, and the C₄ turfgrass system contained 2.3 kg m⁻² SOC and 0.4 mg kg⁻¹ inorganic N, which were 56 and 57% lower than C₃ systems, respectively. Results from this study highlight that low‐input lawns with suitable grass species can offer higher SOC stock and nutrient availability than conventional cropland systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cChina Scholarship Council  cUnited States Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences Program 3aCynodon dactylon 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aGlycine max 3aPoa pratensis 3aZea mays 3aclimate 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3acropland 3aecosystems 3aeducation 3agrasslands 3aland use change 3alawns and turf 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3arowcrops 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3asoybeans 3aturf grasses 3awoodlots 3aTennessee1 aYan, Sheng1 aSorochan, John1 aStier, John1 aMayes, Melanie A.1 aZhuang, Jie1 aJagadamma, Sindhu0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2019 Mar., v. 83, no. 2 p.458-465dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2018.09.03593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012500165300001600290520105400306592002801360650001901388650002801407650001401435650002501449650001701474650001701491650001001508650001801518650001101536650001701547650003701564650001901601650002101620650001401641650002201655653001701677653001601694653001601710653003401726653001701760653001401777700001701791773011201808856008201920852000902002655001202011IND60557646920221118223405.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudolf, Kamil10aAntiproliferative effects of α-tomatine are associated with different cell death modalities in human colon cancer cells  ap. 491-502.  aAntitumour effects of α-tomatine were studied during 24 hours in a panel of human colon cancer cells. α-Tomatine proved to induce dose-dependent cytotoxicity resulting in morphologically varying cell demise with predominantly occurring necrotic phenotypes and minor presence of cells dying via caspase-independent apoptosis. Analyses into the nature of mechanisms responsible for activation of cell death revealed that following α-tomatine treatment, changes in RIP3 and RIP1 protein expression take place along with cyclophilin D mitochondrial accumulation. Moreover, in treated cells, lysosomal membrane permeabilization as well as mitochondrial perturbation with subsequent mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) contributes to the execution of diverse death phenotypes possibly via enhanced activity JNK but in the absence of significant oxidative stress. Thus α-tomatine exhibits significant antitumour activity in colon cancer cells via targeting their membranous compartments and inducing both necroptosis and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tomatine 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acyclophilins 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3adose response 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3aprotein synthesis 0aColon cancer 0aα-Tomatine 0aNecroptosis 0aCaspase-independent apoptosis 0aMitochondria 0aLysosomes1 aRudolf, Emil0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Dec., v. 27 p.491-502dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245007100209300001600280500001100296506007600307520096800383592002801351506003701379650001001416650001001426650001301436650002201449650001701471650002401488650001701512700002001529700001901549700002001568773010201588856008101690852000901771655001201780IND60524087420221207061405.0160701e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052408742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00294-016-0574-62doi7 aPMC49291572pmcid7 a268862322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCánovas, David,10aNitric oxide in fungi: is there NO light at the end of the tunnel?  ap. 513-518.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNitric oxide (NO) is a remarkable gaseous molecule with multiple and important roles in different organisms, including fungi. However, the study of the biology of NO in fungi has been hindered by the lack of a complete knowledge on the different metabolic routes that allow a proper NO balance, and the regulation of these routes. Fungi have developed NO detoxification mechanisms to combat nitrosative stress, which have been mainly characterized by their connection to pathogenesis or nitrogen metabolism. However, the progress on the studies of NO anabolic routes in fungi has been hampered by efforts to disrupt candidate genes that gave no conclusive data until recently. This review summarizes the different roles of NO in fungal biology and pathogenesis, with an emphasis on the alternatives to explain fungal NO production and the recent findings on the involvement of nitrate reductase in the synthesis of NO and its regulation during fungal development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afungi 3agenes 3amycology 3anitrate reductase 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen metabolism 3apathogenesis1 aMarcos, Jose F.1 aMarcos, Ana T.1 aStrauss, Joseph0 tCurrent genetics.g2016 Aug., v. 62, no. 3 p.513-518dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0172-80837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-016-0574-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013100156520209800287592002802385650002502413650002402438650001802462650001902480650002102499650001102520650002002531650001502551651001002566651001802576700002202594773011902616856007302735852000902808655001202817IND60653505820221120113428.0190714e20190204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065350582DNAL7 a10.3390/w110202692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yanjun 10aEffects of the Three Gorges Project on Runoff and Related Benefits of the Key Regions along Main Branches of the Yangtze River  aThe Three Gorges Project (TGP) is the largest hydroelectric project in the world. It is crucial to understand the relationship between runoff regime changes and TGP&rsquo;s full operation after 2009 in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). This paper defines core, extended and buffer areas of YRB, analyzes the effects of TGP on runoff anomaly (RA), runoff variation (RV) and change of coefficient of variation (CCV) between two periods (2003&ndash;2008 and 2009&ndash;2016), takes percentage of runoff anomaly (PRA) as the evaluation standard, assures alleviation effect on severe dry and wet years of the research area, and finally summarizes related benefits of flood control from TGP. Our results indicate the inter-annual fluctuation of runoff in the core and extended areas expanded, but reduced in the buffer areas, and the frequencies of severe dry and wet years alleviated in the buffer, core and extended areas. Generally, the extended and core areas become less wet, and the buffer areas become less dry. The RV and CCV are both strengthened in the extended and core areas, but are weakened in the buffer areas, and RV is well positively correlated (R2 = 0.80) to CCV. Furthermore, the main benefits of TGP on flood control are remarkable in the reduction of disaster affected population, the decrease of agricultural disaster-damaged area, and the decline of direct economic loss. However, due to torrentially seasonal and non-seasonal precipitation, the sharp rebounds of three standards for Hubei and Anhui occurred in 2010 and 2016, and the percentage of agricultural damage area of five regions in the core and extended areas did not decline synchronously and performed irregularly. Our results suggest that the five key regions along the main branches of the Yangtze River should establish a flood control system and promote the connectivity of infrastructures at different levels to meet the significant functions of TGP. It is a great challenge for TGP operation to balance the benefits and conflicts among flood control, power generation and water resources supply in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation buffers 3afinancial economics 3aflood control 3ainfrastructure 3apower generation 3arunoff 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aZhang, Yongqiang 0 tWater.g2019 Feb. 04, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110202693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245012700207300001600334500001900350520153800369592002801907650001901935650001201954650002301966650002201989650002602011650001802037650000902055650002102064651001702085700006002102773011202162856008302274852000902357655001202366IND60731843220221122075224.0210510e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073184322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-021-01116-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopp, Manuel R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0747-541510aAbiotic conditions shape the relationship between indigenous and exotic species richness in a montane biodiversity hotspot  ap. 421-432.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMontane ecosystems are more prone to invasions by exotic plant species than previously thought. Besides abiotic factors, such as climate and soil properties, plant-plant interactions within communities are likely to affect the performance of potential invaders in their exotic range. The biotic resistance hypothesis predicts that high indigenous species richness hampers plant invasions. The biotic acceptance hypothesis, on the other hand, predicts a positive relationship between indigenous and exotic species richness. We tested these two hypotheses using observational data along an elevational gradient in a southern African biodiversity hotspot. Species composition data of indigenous and exotic plants were recorded in 20 road verge plots along a gradient of 1775–2775 m a.s.l. in the Drakensberg, South Africa. Plots were 2 × 50 m in size and positioned at 50 m elevational intervals. We found a negative correlation between indigenous and exotic richness for locations with poorly developed mineral soils, suggesting biotic resistance through competitive interactions. A strong positive correlation for plots with very shallow soils at high elevations indicated a lack of biotic resistance and the possibility of facilitating interactions in harsher environments. These results suggest that biotic resistance is restricted to the lower and mid elevations while biotic acceptance prevails in presence of severe abiotic stress, potentially increasing the risk of plant invasions into montane biodiversity hotspots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aclimate 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aobservational studies 3aplant ecology 3arisk 3aspecies richness 3aSouth Africa1 aKalwij, Jesse M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8685-96030 tPlant ecology.g2021 Apr., v. 222, no. 4 p.421-432dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55230x1385-02377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-021-01116-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245018100177300001400358520114400372592002801516650001501544650003501559650001601594650001001610650001901620650001201639650002001651650001701671650001401688650001601702653002801718653002601746653004301772653001701815653001001832700002401842700002401866700002601890700002401916773007501940856008502015852000902100655001202109IND60566300220221118025945.0170711e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056630022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Nieto, Beatriz10aMicro-sampling method based on high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry for calcium determination in blood and mitochondrial suspensions  ap. 15-21.  aA micro-sampling and straightforward method based on high resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS AAS) was developed to determine extracellular and intracellular Ca in samples of interest in clinical and biomedical analysis. Solid sampling platforms were used to introduce the micro-samples into the graphite furnace atomizer. The secondary absorption line for Ca, located at 239.856nm, was selected to carry out the measurements. Experimental parameters such as pyrolysis and atomization temperatures and the amount of sample introduced for the measurements were optimized. Calibration was performed using aqueous standards and the approach to measure at the wings of the absorption lines was employed for the expansion of the linear response range. The limit of detection was of 0.02mgL−1 Ca (0.39ng Ca) and the upper limit of linear range was increased up to 8.0mgL−1 Ca (160ng Ca). The proposed method was used to determine Ca in mitochondrial suspensions and whole blood samples with successful results.

The plots consisted of the soil mass inside cylinders 30 or 60 cm in diameter, which were pressed into the soil to a depth of 45–60 cm. These plots were either seeded to sudangrass (sorghum sudanense) or left uncropped. The plant tops, roots, and the soil, by 15-cm layers, were analyzed for total N and excess N¹⁵ content. Recovery of added N¹⁵ from the 32 plots ranged between 96.3 and 101.8%, and averaged 99.0%. There was no significant difference in recovery of the fertilizer N due to the percent of excess N¹⁵ in the fertilizer, size of plot, exposure to natural rainfall, cropping, N source, or the time of application of the fertilizer. Wide variation in recovery of excess N¹⁵ occurred with core sampling and it was found necessary to remove, weigh, mix and subsample the entire soil mass from within the rims. The small amounts of unrecovered N were probably due to procedural errors in the field and laboratory, and leaching and root growth beyond the sampling zone. There was no indication of any N loss in the gaseous form. The fate of applied fertilizer N was followed under field conditions using N¹⁵-enriched nitrogen fertilizer applied to the soil in situ enclosed by large steel cylinders. Total recovery of the fertilizer N from these experiments after 8 weeks ranged from 88 to 96%, but dropped as low as 77% after 10 months. Recovery of the fertilizer N was greater from an ammonium source than from nitrate. Retter recovery of fertilizer was obtained when the plots were cropped to sudangrass rather than left fallow. Doubling the rate of application of the fertilizer N from 336 to 672 kg/ha did not affect percent of total recovery. The 4 to 12% of fertilizer N unrecovered after 8 weeks appears to be due to a loss in the gaseous form, since special precautions were taken to restrict leaching and to eliminate errors in sampling and analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3aammonium 3aammonium sulfate 3aapplication rate 3acore sampling 3afallow 3aleaching 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arain 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asodium nitrate 3asoil 3asteel 3atotal nitrogen1 aBennett, O.

Wheat is a major source of dietary energy and protein for the world's growing population, and its potential to assist in reducing micronutrient-related malnutrition can be enhanced via integration of agronomic fertilization practices and delivery of genetically-manipulated, micronutrient rich wheat varieties. Targeted breeding for these biofortified varieties was initiated by exploiting available genetic diversity for Zn and Fe from wild relatives of cultivated wheat and synthetic hexaploid progenitors. The proof-of-concept results from the performance of competitive biofortified wheat lines showed good adaptation in target environments without compromising essential core agronomic traits. Agronomic biofortification through fertilizer approaches could complement the existing breeding approach; for instance, foliar application of Zn fertilizer can increase grain Zn above the breeding target set by nutritionists. This review synthesizes the progress made in genetic and agronomic biofortification strategies for Zn and Fe enrichment of wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3amalnutrition 3azinc 3abiofortification 3airon 3afoliar application 3adietary energy sources 3ahuman health 3aagronomic traits 3awheat 3azinc fertilizers 3agenetic variation 3awild relatives 3ahexaploidy 0aHPYT 0aCIMMYT 0aCENEB 0aQTL 0aIron 0aZn 0aZinc 0aG × E 0aMalnutrition 0aFe 0abreeding 0aBiofortification1 aOrtiz-Monasterio, I.1 aCakmak, I.1 aHao, Y.1 aSingh, R.P.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2014 May, v. 59, no. 3 p.365-372dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01790naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245006100181300001400242500000900256520071000265592002800975650002301003650001301026650002601039650001101065650001201076650001901088650000701107650001501114650001701129651001101146700002001157773014601177856009601323852000901419655001201428IND60668097020221120071420.0191125e197801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066809702DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1978.03615995004200010019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMéndez, José,10aLiming of Latosols and the Effect on Phosphorus Response  ap. 86-88.  aepub  aStudies were conducted with six Latosols from Panama to evaluate exchangeable Al as the criterion for determining lime rate and the effect of liming on P availability.

Such liming rates were considerably less than those required to adjust the pH to 7. At low rates of applied P, liming to neutralize Al significantly increased growth of millet (Pennisetum typhoides, var.

Coscinodiscus perforatus was erected by Ehrenberg on the basis of sediment material collected from Richmond, Virginia. Subsequently, several authors considered this taxon a synonym of C. radiatus. An examination of the type material of C. perforatus was carried out with scanning electron microscopy and a lecto- and epitype were chosen. The information obtained was substantiated and supplemented by examination of recent plankton material from Buenos Aires (Argentina) coastal waters. On the basis of these analyses the description of C. perforatus was emended and compared with the closely related C. radiatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCoscinodiscus 3aplankton 3asediments 3ataxonomy 3aArgentina 3aVirginia 0aDiatoms 0aMarine phytoplankton 0aCoscinodiscus perforatus 0aCoscinodiscus radiatus 0aLectotype 0aEpitype1 aSunesen, Inés1 aJahn, Regine0 tPhycologia.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 49, no. 6 p.514-524dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/09-03.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04044naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012300173300001600296520221900312536021002531592002802741650000802769650001202777650001202789650002102801650001902822650002302841650000902864650001302873650001502886650003302901650002402934650002202958650001102980650001602991650002303007650001103030651001103041653001103052653001403063653002003077653001603097653001103113653001203124653001403136700002303150700002003173700001703193700001803210700002203228773012103250856008603371852000903457655001203466IND60753654820221120115817.0211016e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075365482DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2021.19085192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSans, E.

The following trial compared broiler chicken welfare in closed-sided (CS) versus open-sided (OS) industrial house types during the winter season in the South of Brazil. 2. Ten flocks in each house type were evaluated as follows: a) bird health: contact dermatitis on the breast and abdominal areas (CDE), bird soiling (BSO), footpad dermatitis (FPD), hock burn (HBU), lameness (LAM), fractures (FRA), bruising (BRU), scratches (SCR), dead on arrival (DOA), and diseases (DIS); b) house environmental measurements: relative humidity (RHU), temperature (TEM), air velocity (AVE), illuminance (ILL), ammonia concentration (NH₃), and carbon dioxide concentration (CO₂), and c) bird behaviour and affective states: bird behaviour (BBE), touch test (TTE), and qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA). 3. Statistical analyses were based on regression models for CDE, BSO, FPD, HBU, LAM and generalised linear models for DOA, FRA, BRU, SCR, and DIS. The Mann–Whitney test was used for RHU, TEM, AVE, ILL, NH₃, CO₂, and the t-test for TTE and LMO, with a specific regression model for BBE data and Principal Component Analysis for QBA. 4. According to odds ratio for worse scores for CS relative to OS, birds were less likely to have severe scores for CDE (P = 0.040 and P = 0.007), BSO (P = 0.031, P = 0.016, and P = 0.038), and HBU (P = 0.017), and had higher median values for AVE (2.3, 0.0–7.8 m s⁻¹ vs. 0.0, 0.0–4.3 m s⁻¹), lower NH₃ concentration (9.0, 0.0–64.0 ppm vs. 12.0, 0.0–60.0 ppm) and TTE scores (98, 96–100 vs. 67, 25–100). Worse results were observed in CS houses for higher stocking density (13.8 ± 0.2 birds/m² vs. 12.0 ± 0.2 birds/m²), RHU (74.5, 50.7–99.9% vs 72.3, 47.4–99.9%), and TEM (23.9, 14.6–29.2°C vs. 21.7, 12.9–30.1°C), lower ILL (16.0, 1.0–60.0 lx vs. 161.0, 8.0–2380.0 lx), less drinking (P = 0.007), more inactive behaviour (P < 0.001) and lower positive emotions, according to QBA (P = 0.028). 5. In the studied region and season, CS houses seemed to offer fewer welfare problems in terms of the health indicators; however, OS houses showed fewer behavioural restrictions and higher positive emotional states.  aThis work was supported by the World Animal Protection.

The heat capacity of Dy₂Se₃ has been measured in the temperature range from T = 4.85 K to T = 301.11 K using adiabatic calorimetry. Two pronounced λ-anomalies with maxima at temperatures TC₁ = 6.20 K and TC₂ = 219.40 K were found in the functional behavior of the heat capacity. In addition, the heat capacity of Dy₂Se₃(cr) showed a continuing excess value consistent with a Schottky anomaly on energy levels lying roughly from 0 to 425 cm⁻¹ above the ground state. On the basis of experimental data on the heat capacity, the values of entropy, enthalpy and reduced Gibbs energy were calculated in the interval from T = 0 to T = 301 K, and the anomalous contribution to these properties was determined. The value of the absolute entropy obtained was used for calculation of Dy₂Se₃(cr) entropy formation at T = 298.15 K.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3adysprosium 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aheat 3aselenides 3atemperature 0aHeat capacity 0aThermodynamic functions 0aDysprosium selenide 0aSchottky anomaly1 aMusikhin, A.E.1 aZelenina, L.N.1 aChusova, T.P.1 aNikolaev, R.E.1 aKorolkov, I.V.0 tThermochimica acta.g2020 Apr., v. 686 p.178551-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2020.1785513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03935naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010100170300001600271500001900287520223500306592002802541596005702569596005702626650002902683650001902712650001502731650002502746650002402771650001502795650001102810650001502821650001402836650001802850650000902868650001302877650002102890650001102911700001502922700001802937700001802955700001902973700002202992700001603014700002203030700002303052700002203075700002003097700006003117773011203177856008303289852000903372655001203381IND60731843520221122111926.0210510e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073184352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-021-01118-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakishima, Daichi10aPotential extinction debt due to habitat loss and fragmentation in subalpine moorland ecosystems  ap. 445-457.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHabitat loss and fragmentation would often induce delayed extinction, referred to as extinction debt. Understanding potential extinction debts would allow us to reduce future extinction risk by restoring habitats or implementing conservation actions. Although growing empirical evidence has predicted extinction debts in various ecosystems exposed to direct human disturbances, potential extinction debts in natural ecosystems with minimal direct human disturbance are little studied. Ongoing climate change may cause habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly in natural ecosystems vulnerable to environmental change, potentially leading to future local extinctions. Recent climate change would lead to extended growing season caused by earlier snowmelt in spring, resulting in expansion of shrubby species and thereby habitat loss and fragmentation of mountainous moorlands. We examined the potential extinction debts of species diversity and functional diversity (FD; trait variation or multivariate trait differences within a community) in subalpine moorland ecosystems subjected to few direct human disturbances. Plant species richness for all species and for moorland specialists were primarily explained by the past kernel density of focal moorlands (a proxy for spatial clustering of moorlands around them) but not the past area of the focal moorlands, suggesting potential extinction debt in subalpine moorland ecosystems. The higher kernel density of the focal moorland in the past indicates that it was originally surrounded by more neighborhood moorlands and/or had been locally highly fragmented. Patterns in current plant species richness have been shaped by the historical spatial configuration of moorlands, which have disappeared over time. In contrast, we found no significant relationships between the FD and historical and current landscape variables depicting each moorland. The prevalence of trait convergence might result in a less sensitive response of FD to habitat loss and fragmentation compared to that of species richness. Our finding has an important implication that climate change induced by human activities may threaten biodiversity in natural ecosystems through habitat loss and fragmentation.  aPublisher supplied data  a18H02221cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20H04380cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aextinction 3afunctional diversity 3ahabitat destruction 3aheathlands 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amountains 3aplant ecology 3arisk 3asnowmelt 3aspecies richness 3aspring1 aSutou, Rui1 aGoto, Akihito1 aKawai, Yutaka1 aIshii, Naohiro1 aTaniguchi, Hayami1 aUchida, Kei1 aShimazaki, Masaya1 aNakashizuka, Tohru1 aSuyama, Yoshihisa1 aHikosaka, Kouki1 aSasaki, Takehiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8727-91520 tPlant ecology.g2021 Apr., v. 222, no. 4 p.445-457dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55230x1385-02377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-021-01118-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010200168300001400270520106700284592002801351650002001379650002301399650000901422650001301431650002101444650001501465650001701480700001601497700001801513773008801531856008601619852000901705655001201714IND60684588720221122232722.0200318e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068458872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKivi, Anatol10aWhat clinicians and patients want: The past, the presence, and the future of the botulinum toxins  ap. 46-51.  aBotulinum toxin (BoNT) is well established in clinical practice for more than 30 years. During this time the area of applications was broaden beyond the ophtalmologic and neurologic indications. Despite of decades of BoNT application with a huge increase of expertise and supporting methods for utilization as well, both patients and physicians claim about boundaries and limits in their daily treatment practice. Most of those limits are related to the toxin itself and its pharmacokinetic properties. The challenge in the field of movement disorders, swetting, and sialorrhea to combine all fast onset, long-lasting effect, safe application free of pain, and the possibility to vary therapy strategies in dosage and application intervals is pervasive and recurrent. In the present article we attempt to name challenges, patient's and physician's wishes. On the base of the toxins that we have and that we are going to get we imagine optimized therapy settings for the core neurological indications spastic movement disorder, dystonia, swetting, and sialorrhea.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotulinum toxin 3amovement disorders 3apain 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3aphysicians 3atherapeutics1 aRi, Songjin1 aWissel, Jörg0 tToxicon.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 177 p.46-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245021500168300001600383520114100399592002801540650001901568650001901587650001301606650003601619650001801655650002701673650001701700650002201717650001201739650001701751650001801768650001901786650001601805650001601821650001401837650001101851650001701862650002201879650001801901650001401919650001301933650002101946650002001967650002001987650001002007650001502017650002002032650002502052650003602077650003202113653001802145653004302163653002802206653001702234653002102251700001702272700001702289700001702306700001802323773011202341856008202453852000902535655001202544IND60557647420221118222928.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Chiung-Tsun10aProtection of Chinese olive fruit extract and its fractions against advanced glycation endproduct-induced oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory factors in cultured vascular endothelial and human monocytic cells  ap. 526-536.  aAccumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of diabetic complications. In this study, we evaluated the protective activities of water/ethanol (1:1, v/v) extract (WEE) and its fractions from Chinese olive (Canarium album L.) fruit on AGEs-induced endothelial dysfunction. The WEE and its fractions could scavenge free radicals, inhibit AGEs formation and reduce the overgeneration of AGEs-induced ROS in endothelial cells. They also increased AGEs-mediated loss of glutathione level and SOD activity. AGEs stimulated monocyte adhesion, ICAM-1 expression and IκBα phosphorylation, which were inhibited by WEE and its fractions. Furthermore, they reduced AGEs-induced inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 level in monocytes. Nine compounds such as gallic acid, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, scopoletin, ferulic acid, ellagic acid, and rutin were identified. These findings indicated that Chinese olive fruit attenuated AGEs-mediated endothelial dysfunction by ameliorating inflammation and oxidant stress responses via inhibiting NF-κB pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanarium album 3aIKappaB kinase 3aadhesion 3aadvanced glycation end products 3acell adhesion 3adiabetic complications 3aellagic acid 3aendothelial cells 3aethanol 3aferulic acid 3afree radicals 3afruit extracts 3agallic acid 3aglutathione 3aglycation 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amonocytes 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3apathophysiology 3aphosphorylation 3arutin 3ascopoletin 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aChinese olive 0aAdvanced glycation end-products (AGEs) 0aEndothelial dysfunction 0aInflammation 0aOxidative stress1 aLiu, Tzu-Hao1 aHsu, Tai-Hao1 aLin, Fang-Yi1 aChen, Hui-Yin0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Dec., v. 27 p.526-536dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245020100171500002200372520134600394592002801740650002601768650001501794650001701809650001601826650001301842650001701855650001601872650001501888650002301903650002001926650001301946650000901959650001201968653000801980653000701988653000801995653000902003653000802012653001102020653002002031653002202051653005302073653002302126700002102149700001902170700002902189700001902218773005302237856008502290852000902375655001202384IND60566300620221118030045.0170711s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056630062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStocker, Pierre12aA fluorescent homogeneous assay for myeloperoxidase measurement in biological samples. A positive correlation between myeloperoxidase-generated HOCl level and oxidative status in STZ-diabetic rats  aPre-press version  aMyeloperoxidase (MPO) is a key enzyme derived from leucocytes which is associated with the initiation and progression of many inflammatory diseases. Increased levels of MPO may contribute to cellular dysfunction and tissues injury by producing highly reactive oxidants such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Myeloperoxidase-generated HOCl is therefore considered as a relevant biomarker of oxidative stress-related damage and its quantitation is of great importance to the study of disease progression.In this context, the current study describes a rapid, sensitive and homogeneous fluorescence-based method for detecting the MPO chlorination activity in biological samples. This assay utilizes 7-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromene-8-carbaldehyde oxime as a selective probe for HOCl detection, and is adapted to 96-well microplates to allow high-throughput quantitation of active MPO.The ability of the method to monitor HOCl release was further investigated in hyperglycemic streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats. The data proved that the present assay has a reliable performance when quantitating the active MPO in the plasma of diabetic animals, a feature of inflammatory disease found concomitant with an elevation of protein carbonyls levels and lipid peroxidation and which was negatively correlated with the ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3abiomarkers 3achlorination 3acorrelation 3adiabetes 3afluorescence 3aglutathione 3aleukocytes 3alipid peroxidation 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoxidants 3arats 3atissues 0aMPO 0aPC 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aSTZ 0a7-HCCO 0aMyeloperoxidase 0ahypochlorous acid 0a7-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromene-8-carbaldehyde oxime 0afluorimetric assay1 aCassien, Mathieu1 aVidal, Nicolas1 aThétiot-Laurent, Sophie1 aPietri, Sylvia0 tTalanta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013800165300001600303520144000319592002801759650002001787650001401807650001401821650001901835650001401854650002401868650001701892650001701909650001901926650001101945650001201956650001301968650001501981650001401996650002802010650001602038653001402054653001702068653001602085653001402101653002402115653002102139700001702160700001702177700001802194773012202212856008102334852000902415655001202424IND60611772720221122210754.0180904e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061177272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2016.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZerin, Tanana10aSurfactant 4-nonylphenyl-polyethylene glycol stimulates reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells  ap. 262-268.  aThe formulation of most pesticides is proprietary and individual components are therefore not generally known. In a preliminary study, we identified six compounds that are often present in pesticides, of which 4-nonylphenyl-polyethylene glycol (NP-40) was found to be the most toxic. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of NP-40 and underlying mechanism in neuronal SK-N-SH cells. Exposure to NP 40 at concentrations higher than 60μmol/L for 24hr decreased cell viability. The cytotoxicity of NP-40 was time- and concentration-dependent. Nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation were apparent starting at 50μmol/L NP-40, and increased at higher concentrations. The expression of apoptotic factors including p53 and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2-associated X protein was upregulated, while that of the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 was downregulated at 80 μmol/L NP-40. Cytochrome c release was observed from 80 to 100μmol/L by confocal microscopy. Caspase-9 and -3/7 activities increased according to concentration, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that apoptosis was induced at 50μmol/L and was increased at 80μmol/L. Our findings indicate that NP-40 stimulates the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway and reactive oxygen species production in a concentration-dependent manner, and suggest that antioxidant administration may be an effective treatment for patients with acute NP-40 poisoning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-cell lymphoma 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-9 3acell viability 3achromatin 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aneurons 3apatients 3apesticides 3apoisoning 3areactive oxygen species 3asurfactants 0aApoptosis 0aCytochrome c 0aCaspase-3/7 0aCaspase-9 0aNonionic surfactant 0aOxidative stress1 aSong, Hoyeon1 aGil, Hyowook1 aHong, Saeyong0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2017 Mar., v. 53 p.262-268dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2016.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245020200183500002200385520172900407592002802136650001702164650001302181650001502194650001602209650001902225650001102244650002102255650001802276650002002294650002202314650001402336650001602350653002302366653001602389653001202405653001402417700003102431700003002462700002502492700003402517773005302551856008502604852000902689655001202698IND60566300720221118030000.0170711s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056630072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Jesus, Jemmyson Romário10aDepleting high-abundant and enriching low-abundant proteins in human serum: an evaluation of sample preparation methods using magnetic nanoparticle, chemical depletion and immunoaffinity techniques  aPre-press version  aThe efficiency of three different depletion methods to remove the most abundant proteins, enriching those human serum proteins with low abundance is checked to make more efficient the search and discovery of biomarkers. These methods utilize magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), chemical reagents (sequential application of dithiothreitol and acetonitrile, DTT/ACN), and commercial apparatus based on immunoaffinity (ProteoMiner, PM). The comparison between methods shows significant removal of abundant protein, remaining in the supernatant at concentrations of 4.6±0.2, 3.6±0.1, and 3.3±0.2µgµL−1 (n=3) for MNPs, DTT/ACN and PM respectively, from a total protein content of 54µgµL−1. Using GeLC-MS/MS analysis, MNPs depletion shows good efficiency in removing high molecular weight proteins (> 80kDa). Due to the synergic effect between the reagents DTT and ACN, DTT/ACN-based depletion offers good performance in the depletion of thiol-rich proteins, such as albumin and transferrin (DTT action), as well as of high molecular weight proteins (ACN action). Furthermore, PM equalization confirms its efficiency in concentrating low-abundant proteins, decreasing the dynamic range of protein levels in human serum. Direct comparison between the treatments reveals 72 proteins identified when using MNP depletion (43 of them exclusively by this method), but only 20 proteins using DTT/ACN (seven exclusively by this method). Additionally, after PM treatment 30 proteins were identified, seven exclusively by this method. Thus, MNPs and DTT/ACN depletion can be simple, quick, cheap, and robust alternatives for immunochemistry-based protein depletion, providing a potential strategy in the search for disease biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aalbumins 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adithiothreitol 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aprotein content 3aprotein depletion 3asynergism 3atransferrin 0aSample preparation 0ahuman serum 0aprotein 0abiomarker1 ada Silva Fernandes, Rafael1 ade Souza Pessôa, Gustavo1 aRaimundo, Ivo Milton1 aArruda, Marco Aurélio Zezzi,0 tTalanta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015200165300001600317520107600333592002801409650002201437650002301459650001201482650001001494650003101504650001301535653002901548653002501577653002301602653002801625653002601653653001201679653000801691653000701699653000801706653001001714653000801724653001101732653000901743653001201752653001101764700001401775700001301789700001601802700001801818700001901836700005901855773011201914856008202026852000902108655001202117IND60557647620221118223013.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xiao-Long10a4-O-galloylalbiflorin discovered from Paeonia lactiflora Pall. is a potential β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitor  ap. 517-525.  aβ-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ), which are important in the development of Alzheimer's disease. It has been demonstrated that albiflorin can alleviate Aβ aggregation. However, the mechanism behind this effect is unknown. In our previous work, albiflorin and its four analogues were isolated from Paeonia lactiflora Pall. This study aims to investigate the relationship of these four compounds with BACE1. Our results show that the albiflorin analogue 4-O-galloylalbiflorin (4-O-GA) had the strongest BACE1 inhibitory effect and was also selective for BACE1. Furthermore, docking study of BACE1 with these analogues yielded similar results, whereby 4-O-GA treatment caused the greatest decreases in both the generation of Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 and in the expression of BACE1 and HIF-1α. Our findings indicate that 4-O-GA exerted significant and selective inhibitory activities against BACE1, potentially providing a useful agent for developing BACE1 inhibitor drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aPaeonia lactiflora 3aamyloid 3adrugs 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3apeptides 0aAlzheimer's disease (AD) 0aβ-secretase (BACE1) 0aβ-amyloid peptide 0aPaeonia lactiflora Pall 0a4-O-galloylalbiflorin 0aDocking 0aAβ 0aAD 0aAPP 0aBACE1 0aBBB 0aDS 3.0 0aFRET 0aHIF-1α 0a4-O-GA1 aLi, Ye-Bo1 aQi, Song1 aZhang, Qiao1 aRen, Tian-Shu1 aMeng, Wei-Hong1 aZhao, Qing-Chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8973-23840 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Dec., v. 27 p.517-525dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245010000168520156000268592002801828650003101856650004101887650003001928650001101958650001201969650001901981650002202000650001602022650001502038651000902053700002302062700002902085700002102114700002302135700002202158773011902180856007302299852000902372655001202381IND60653506320221120113513.0190714e20190205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065350632DNAL7 a10.3390/w110202732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaghsood, Fatemeh  Fadia10aClimate Change Impact on Flood Frequency and Source Area in Northern Iran under CMIP5 Scenarios  aThis study assessed the impact of climate change on flood frequency and flood source area at basin scale considering Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 General Circulation Models (CMIP5 GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (2.6 and 8.5). For this purpose, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model was calibrated and validated for the Talar River Basin in northern Iran. Four empirical approaches including the Sangal, Fill&ndash;Steiner, Fuller, and Slope-based methods were used to estimate the Instantaneous Peak Flow (IPF) on a daily basis. The calibrated SWAT model was run under the two RCP scenarios using a combination of twenty GCMs from CMIP5 for the near future (2020&ndash;2040). To assess the impact of climate change on flood frequency pattern and to quantify the contribution of each subbasin on the total discharge from the Talar River Basin, Flood Frequency Index (FFI) and Subbasin Flood Source Area Index (SFSAI) were used. Results revealed that the projected climate change will likely lead to an average discharge decrease in January, February, and March for both RCPs and an increase in September and October for RCP 8.5. The maximum and minimum temperature will likely increase for all months in the near future. The annual precipitation could increase by more than 20% in the near future. This is likely to lead to an increase of IPF. The results can help managers and policy makers to better define mitigation and adaptation strategies for basins in similar climates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aissues and policy 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aMoradi, Hamidreza 1 aMassah Bavani, Ali  Reza1 aPanahi, Mostafa 1 aBerndtsson, Ronny 1 aHashemi, Hossein 0 tWater.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110202733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007100148245011200219300001600331500001900347520183300366592002802199596009302227650003402320650001102354650002902365650003002394650001302424650001802437650001102455650002402466650001302490650001802503650002402521650002502545650001902570650002102589650001902610650001002629650002502639650001402664700007202678700004602750773011202796856008302908852000902991655001203000IND60731843820221122111847.0210510e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073184382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-021-01124-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Abreu Moreira, Patrícia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6020-449X10aConsequences of tropical dry forest conversion on diaspore fate of Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Fabaceae)  ap. 525-535.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHabitat conversion is one of the major threats for biodiversity conservation and viability of natural populations. Thus, habitat disturbance alters distinct ecological processes, such as plant reproductive success and diaspore fate. In this study, we determined the effects of seasonally tropical dry forests (STDFs) conversion by anthropogenic disturbance by assessing diaspore fate of Enterolobium contortisiliquum. We compared 20 adult trees present in a STDFs preserved area and 20 adult trees present in a human-converted area. In general, diaspore fates from both areas were similar, i.e., there was no difference in the reproductive success of trees in STDFs and human-converted area. Habitat disturbance did not affect the length or width of fruits; only fruit thickness was larger in trees of STDFs habitat. None of the biometric seed measures differed between different habitat conditions. Likewise, the number of undamaged seeds, aborted seeds, pre-dispersal predated seeds, and seed production were independent of habitat conditions. Besides, we did not observe any effect of habitat disturbance on germination percentage. However, seeds from preserved STDFs germinated faster than seeds from the human-converted area. Even though the effects of human-modified habitats on the diaspore fate have already been studied, tree species exhibit different responses to habitat conversion regarding seed predation, seed dispersal, seed germination, and seedling establishment. Overall, our results show that habitat disturbance does not affect the diaspore fate of E. contortisiliquum. This study also highlights the importance of remnants trees in converted landscapes as the population’s connectors which maintain plant–animal mutualistic and antagonistic interactions that mitigate the effects of habitat disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data  a(APQ-04127-10, APQ-00372-11)cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais 3aEnterolobium contortisiliquum 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiometry 3adeforestation 3afruits 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aplant ecology 3aplant establishment 3areproductive success 3aseed dispersal 3aseed germination 3aseed predation 3atrees 3atropical dry forests 3aviability1 ade Siqueira Neves, Frederico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2691-37431 aLobo, Jorgeq(Lobo Segura, Jorge Arturo),0 tPlant ecology.g2021 Apr., v. 222, no. 4 p.525-535dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55230x1385-02377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-021-01124-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009400164300001600258520149200274592002801766650001201794650002301806650002101829650002301850650001101873650001501884650001801899650001901917650001901936650001001955650001501965650001601980650001001996653001902006653003802025653002102063653002202084653005102106700002302157700001502180700001902195700002302214700002002237773012202257856008102379852000902460655001202469IND60611772920221122225538.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061177292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2016.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bianxia10aDetermination of urine-derived odorous compounds in a source separation sanitation system  ap. 240-249.  aSource separation sanitation systems have attracted more and more attention recently. However, separate urine collection and treatment could induce odor issues, especially in large scale application. In order to avoid such issues, it is necessary to monitor the odor related compounds that might be generated during urine storage. This study investigated the odorous compounds that emitted from source-separated human urine under different hydrolysis conditions. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of temperature, stale/fresh urine ratio and urine dilution on odor emissions. It was found that ammonia, dimethyl disulfide, allyl methyl sulfide and 4-heptanone were the main odorous compounds generated from human urine, with headspace concentrations hundreds of times higher than their respective odor thresholds. Furthermore, the high temperature accelerated urine hydrolysis and liquid–gas mass transfer, resulting a remarkable increase of odor emissions from the urine solution. The addition of stale urine enhanced urine hydrolysis and expedited odor emissions. On the contrary, diluted urine emitted less odorous compounds ascribed to reduced concentrations of odorant precursors. In addition, this study quantified the odor emissions and revealed the constraints of urine source separation in real-world applications. To address the odor issue, several control strategies are recommended for odor mitigation or elimination from an engineering perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3adimethyl disulfide 3adimethyl sulfide 3aheadspace analysis 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3amass transfer 3aodor compounds 3aodor emissions 3aodors 3asanitation 3atemperature 3aurine 0aOdor emissions 0aVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) 0aUrine hydrolysis 0aSource separation 0aGas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS)1 aGiannis, Apostolos1 aChen, Ailu1 aZhang, Jiefeng1 aChang, Victor W.C.1 aWang, Jing-Yuan0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2017 Feb., v. 52 p.240-249dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2016.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015600165300001600321520125700337592002801594653002201622653001101644653001401655653001601669653001301685653001601698653001301714700001801727700001801745773016701763856008201930852000902012655001202021IND60517019820221120130734.0190729e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051701982DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154110004152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Eoghan10aEffects of temperature and salinity on the survival and development of larval and juvenile Palaemon serratus (Decapoda: Palaemonidae) from Irish waters  ap. 151-161.  aThe combined effects of temperature and salinity on the survival and development of larval and juvenile Palaemon serratus from the west coast of Ireland were investigated. Survival over time was measured at thirty combinations of temperature and salinity ranging from 10–19°C and 9–34‰ in a fully factorial design. Salinity had a stronger influence than temperature on survival at all larval stages except stage V. For juveniles the main effect changed from temperature between 100 and 200 degree days to salinity between 200 and 600 degree days and temperature between 600 and 800 degree days. Estimates of time taken to 50% mortality showed that juveniles tolerated lower salinities for longer periods and exhibited optimal salinity values which were 3‰ lower than larvae, at temperatures between 10 and 15°C. Larval stage durations were found to be influenced by temperature but not salinity. Comparison with published data suggests that populations of P. serratus have adapted to local conditions of temperature and salinity. The results presented here have practical implications for fisheries assessment and management, as the incorporation of environmental effects into stock–recruitment models can improve their predictive capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPalaemon serratus 0alarvae 0ajuveniles 0atemperature 0asalinity 0adevelopment 0asurvival1 aTully, Oliver1 aBrowne, Ronan0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2012 Feb., v. 92, no. 1 p.151-161dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154110004153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017300167300001600340520094100356592002801297650001701325650001501342650002501357650001601382650001901398650001001417650002301427650001901450650001901469650002401488650001301512650001101525650001301536650001601549650003701565650002701602653002301629653001401652653002201666653004401688653002201732700001801754700005801772773011201830856008201942852000902024655001202033IND60557647720221118223530.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiow, Hwee-Leng10aStructure–activity studies of protease activating, lipase inhibiting, bile acid binding and cholesterol-lowering effects of pre-screened cumin seed bioactive peptides  ap. 600-611.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro physiological properties of pre-screened cumin seed peptides (CSPs) based on in vitro and in silico studies. Results showed that CSPs were capable of increasing the protein digestibility up to 400%. Apart from that, CSP1 and CSP2 showed >50% inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity.

Based on the structure–activity relationship studies, the results have postulated that the interaction of peptides at non-catalytic region induced allosteric effects to enhance the pepsin proteolytic activity; the direct contact of the peptide with lipase active sites rendered inhibitory action; and the binding between peptide and bile acids was relied on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abile acids 3acholesteremic effect 3acholesterol 3acholestyramine 3acumin 3adigestible protein 3adirect contact 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amicelles 3apepsin 3apeptides 3aproteolysis 3astructure-activity relationships 3atriacylglycerol lipase 0aCumin seed peptide 0aBile acid 0aLipase inhibition 0aInhibition of cholesterol micellization 0aProtease activity1 aChoi, Sy-Bing1 aGan, Chee-Yuen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6509-10680 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Dec., v. 27 p.600-611dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166300001600306520121800322592002801540650001801568650001601586650001901602650001201621650001201633650001801645650002501663650000901688650002401697650001301721650002201734650000901756650001901765653002501784653001201809653000901821653002301830653001501853700001701868700001601885700001401901700002101915700001601936700002501952700001801977773011201995856008202107852000902189655001202198IND60557647820221118223012.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiyono, Tamami10aIdentification of pyroglutamyl peptides with anti-colitic activity in Japanese rice wine, sake, by oral administration in a mouse model  ap. 612-621.  aTwo pyroglutamyl peptides with anti-colitic activity were identified in Japanese rice wine, sake, by oral administration of a small dose (0.1–1.0 mg/kg body weight) and in vivo activity-guided fractionation. Compounds in sake were fractionated by preparative isoelectric focusing followed by preparative reversed phase-liquid chromatography. Anti-colitic activity was evaluated using a dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. The final active fraction contained three pyroglutamyl peptides: pyroglutamyl-tyrosine (pyroGlu-Tyr), pyroglutamyl-asparaginyl-isoleucine (pyroGlu-Asn-Ile) and pyroglutamyl-asparaginyl-isoleucyl-asparagyl-asparaginyl-proline (pyroGlu-Asn-Ile-Asp-Asn-Pro). Orally administrating artificially synthesized pyroGlu-Tyr (1.0 mg/kg body weight) and pyroGlu-Asn-Ile (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg body weight) exhibited a significant protective effect against colitis in mice, whereas pyroGlu-Asn-Ile-Asp-Pro showed no significant effect. Additionally, administrating pyroGlu-Asn-Ile normalized colitis-induced colonic dysbiosis, whereas pyroGlu-Tyr did not. These results suggest that identified pyroglutamyl peptides exhibited an anti-colitic activity via different mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abody weight 3achromatography 3acolitis 3adextran 3afractionation 3aisoelectric focusing 3amice 3aoral administration 3apeptides 3aprotective effect 3asake 3asodium sulfate 0aPyroglutamyl peptide 0aColitis 0aSake 0aJapanese rice wine 0aMicrobiota1 aWada, Sayori1 aOhta, Ryoko1 aWada, Eri1 aTakagi, Tomohisa1 aNaito, Yuji1 aYoshikawa, Toshikazu1 aSatō, Kenji,0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Dec., v. 27 p.612-621dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007300159300002000232520111100252592002801363650004401391650002201435650001501457650002001472650001501492650001701507650001601524650000901540650001301549650000901562650002001571650002301591650001501614650001101629650003301640700003001673700002201703700001501725700002301740700001801763700002301781700001601804773012401820856007401944852000902018655001202027IND60640428220221122100601.0190504e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064042822DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra01973k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, Amarish10aNano iron pyrite (FeS₂) exhibits bi-functional electrode character  ap. 16859-16867.  aSustainable charge storage devices require materials that are environmentally benign, readily moldable, easily synthesizable, and profitable for applications in the electronics industry.

A Stochastic Approach Applied to a Case Study on Maize in Northern Italy  aSoil water balance on a local scale is generally achieved by applying the classical nonlinear Richards equation that requires hydraulic properties, namely, water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions, to be known. Its application in agricultural systems on field or larger scales involves three major problems being solved, related to (i) the assessment of spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties, (ii) accounting for this spatial variability in modelling large-scale soil water flow, and (iii) measuring the effects of such variability on real field variables (e.g., soil water storage, biomass, etc.). To deal with the first issue, soil hydraulic characterization is frequently performed by using the so-called pedotransfer functions (PTFs), whose effectiveness in providing the actual information on spatial variability has been questioned. With regard to the second problem, the variability of hydraulic properties at the field scale has often been dealt with using a relatively simple approach of considering soils in the field as an ensemble of parallel and statistically independent tubes, assuming only vertical flow. This approach in dealing with spatial variability has been popular in the framework of a Monte Carlo technique. As for the last issue, remote sensing seems to be the only viable solution to verify the pattern of variability, going by several modelling outputs which have considered the soil spatial variability. Based on these premises, the goals of this work concerning the issues discussed above are the following: (1) analyzing the sensitivity of a Richards-based model to the measured variability of &theta;(h) and k(&theta;) parameters; (2) establishing the predictive capability of PTF in terms of a simple comparison with measured data; and (3) establishing the effectiveness of use of PTF by employing as data quality control an independent and spatially distributed estimation of the Above Ground Biomass (AGB). The study area of approximately 2000 hectares mainly devoted to maize forage cultivation is located in the Po plain (Lodi), in northern Italy. Sample sites throughout the study area were identified for hydropedological analysis (texture, bulk density, organic matter content, and other chemical properties on all the samples, and water retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity on a sub-set). Several pedotransfer functions were tested; the PTF‒Vereckeen proved to be the best one to derive hydraulic properties of the entire soil database. The Monte Carlo approach was used to analyze model sensitivity to two measured input parameters: the slope of water retention curve (n) and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (k<inf>0</inf>). The analysis showed sensitivity of the simulated process to the parameter n being significantly higher than to k<inf>0</inf>, although the former was much less variable. The PTFs showed a smoothing effect of the output variability, even though they were previously validated on a set of measured data. Interesting positive and significant correlations were found between the n parameter, from measured water retention curves, and the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), when using multi-temporal (2004&ndash;2018) high resolution remotely sensed data on maize cultivation. No correlation was detected when the n parameter derived from PTF was used. These results from our case study mainly suggest that: (i) despite the good performance of PTFs calculated via error indexes, their use in the simulation of hydrological processes should be carefully evaluated for real field-scale applications; and (ii) the NDVI index may be used successfully as a proxy to evaluate PTF reliability in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aaboveground biomass 3abulk density 3acase studies 3acorn 3adata quality 3adatabases 3aequations 3aforage 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aorganic matter 3apedotransfer functions 3aphysicochemical properties 3aquality control 3aremote sensing 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3atexture 3awater flow 3aItaly1 aBonfante, Antonello 1 aCoppola, A.q(Antonio),1 aDe Mascellis, Roberto 1 aFalanga Bolognesi, Salvatore 1 aTerribile, F.q(Fabio),1 aManna, Piero 0 tWater.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110202753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245016600171300001600337500001500353520107500368592002801443650002601471650002001497650001501517650002501532650001401557650002401571650003301595650002301628650002101651650002601672650001401698650003101712650003101743650002401774650001301798650002301811650002901834650001001863650001701873650001101890650001601901650001201917650001401929653002201943653002701965653001701992653001102009653001002020653001302030700002502043700002602068700002502094700002302119700002602142700002502168700002302193700002402216700002602240700002202266700002602288773011202314856008202426852000902508655001202517IND60557647920221118223024.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Pollyanna M.14aThe juicy sarcotesta of Punica granatum contains a lectin that affects growth, survival as well as adherence and invasive capacities of human pathogenic bacteria  ap. 695-702.  a2019-12-06  aPomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruits are referred as a “superfood” due to its immense potential for health benefits. This work describes the isolation, characterization and antibacterial effects of P. granatum sarcotesta lectin (PgTeL), a 26-kDa chitin-binding protein with 37% homology with a chitinase from pomegranate seeds. PgTeL was bacteriostatic and bactericide agent on Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Streptococcus mutans (MIC50: 1.25–50 µg/mL; MBC: 18.0–100 µg/mL) and also inhibited the growth of Aeromonas sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella enterica serovar. Enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (MIC50: 3.0–50 µg/mL). The adhesion and invasion abilities of Aeromonas sp., S. aureus, S. marcescens and S. enterica to HeLa cells were reduced when these bacteria were previously treated with PgTeL. In conclusion, the pomegranate juicy sarcotesta is a source of a lectin with biotechnological potential as a new antibiotic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aPunica granatum 3aKlebsiella 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aAeromonas 3aSalmonella enterica 3aStaphylococcus saprophyticus 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aEscherichia coli 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aserotypes 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aSerratia marcescens 3aadhesion 3agrowth retardation 3aantibacterial properties 3atesta 3apomegranates 3afruits 3aantibiotics 3alectins 3achitinase 0aPomegranate juice 0aAntibacterial activity 0aInvasiveness 0aLectin 0aseeds 0aAdhesion1 aNapoleão, Thiago H.1 aSilva, Laysa C.P.B.B.1 aFortes, Deborah T.O.1 aLima, Thâmarah A.1 aZingali, Russolina B.1 aPontual, Emmanuel V.1 aAraújo, Janete M.1 aMedeiros, Paloma L.1 aRodrigues, Claudio G.1 aGomes, Francis S.1 aPaiva, Patrícia M.G.0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Dec., v. 27 p.695-702dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04243naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245025300161300001600414500001900430520260200449592002803051650001603079650001103095650001003106650001403116650001403130650001603144650001403160651001003174651001603184651001303200653001303213653002903226653004303255653003803298653003803336653002903374653001803403653000903421653001503430700002503445700002903470700002403499700003103523773010203554856007203656852000903728655001203737IND60695665620221120113219.0200518e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069566562DNAL7 a10.2216/09-106.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHommersand, Max H.12aA morphological and phylogenetic study of Glaphyrosiphon gen. nov.

A morphological and phylogenetic study of Glaphyrosiphon gen. nov.

Phycologia 49: 554–573. DOI: 10.2216/09-106.1 A new genus, Glaphyrosiphon Hommersand & Leister gen. nov., is proposed to contain the generitype Glaphyrosiphon intestinalis (Harvey) Leister & W.A. Nelson comb. nov., a species known in New Zealand under the name Grateloupia intestinalis (Hooker. f. & Harvey) Setchell ex P.G. Parkinson, and two additional species: Glaphyrosiphon lindaueri W.A. Nelson & P.W. Gabrielson sp. nov. from the northern part of New Zealand and Glaphyrosiphon chilensis M.E. Ramírez, Leister, and P.W. Gabrielson sp. nov. in the southern part of Chile from Valdivia (Región de Los Ríos), to Punta Arenas in the Strait of Magellan (Región de Magallanes). Thalli are borne singly or in clusters from a small discoid holdfast and consist of simple or one- to three-times-branched slippery tubes that are copiously filled with mucilage. The medulla consists of a one- to several-layered network inside the cortex composed of stellate cells that interconnect by short to long extensions linked by pit connections. Primary rhizoidal filaments are absent. Spermatangia are superficial on terminal cortical cells. Carpogonial and auxiliary-cell ampullae are formed separately and link by unsegmented tubular connecting filaments, as in other Halymeniaceae. The auxiliary-cell ampulla consists of a basal cell and four unilaterally branched filaments in which the auxiliary cell is the basal cell of one of the four filaments. The auxiliary cell and inner ampullar filaments unite forming a fusion cell. Ampullar filaments connect terminally to inner cortical cells and laterally with one another by short filaments and pit connections that form an involucral network surrounding the gonimolobes. Tetrasporangia are cruciately divided and borne laterally on filaments produced secondarily from surface cortical cells. Sequence analyses of the rbcL gene place Glaphyrosiphon sister to Polyopes in the Halymeniaceae. The two New Zealand species consist of southern and northern clades separated by 1.2% to 1.7% base-pair distances in rbcL analyses and a Chilean species that forms a single clade separated from the New Zealand clades by 3.9% to 4.4% base-pair distances. Records of Grateloupia intestinalis from Tasmania have not been studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrateloupia 3acortex 3agenes 3amucilages 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aChile 3aNew Zealand 3aTasmania 0aAmpullae 0aGlaphyrosiphon gen. nov. 0aGlaphyrosiphon intestinalis comb. nov. 0aGlaphyrosiphon chilensis sp. nov. 0aGlaphyrosiphon lindaueri sp. nov. 0aGrateloupia intestinalis 0aHalymeniaceae 0arbcL 0aRhodophyta1 aLeister, Geoffrey L.1 aRamírez, María Eliana,1 aGabrielson, Paul W.1 aNelson, W.

ELISA was more sensitive than CF tests when polyvalent antisera were used for detecting the 3 types of virus in epithelial samples, whereas ELISA using monovalent antisera was the least sensitive technique. The ELISA performed with polyvalent antisera was 9 times more sensitive for detecting FMD virus than that with monovalent antisera. However, viral isolation in cell culture was the most sensitive detection system. The combined use of ELISA with polyvalent antisera and cell culture inoculations was the most effective procedure for identifying FMD virus in epithelial samples from the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aserodiagnosis 3acell culture 3acomplement fixation tests 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aAphthovirus 3aantiserum 3agenetic variation 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxanalysis 2aAphthovirusxclassificationximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aCell Line 2aComplement Fixation Tests 2aCross Reactions 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFoot-and-Mouth Diseasexdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aImmune Seraximmunology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0adisease diagnosis1 aMartins, Mauricio A.1 aMaria da Penha, D.

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of dietary soluble non-starch polysaccharide (sNSP) level and composition on grower and finisher phase performance, total tract nutrient digestibility and excreta moisture content in broiler chickens. 2. Cobb 500 broilers (n = 1080) were fed 12 dietary treatments; four diets with differing primary grain sources (barley, corn, sorghum and wheat) and three different sNSP levels (low, medium and high). Diets were formulated to have similar protein and energy levels but differing sNSP levels, induced by manipulating the quantity of the ingredients in the diet. The diets were fed in three phases, starter (d 0–12), grower (d 12–23) and finisher (d 23–31). 3. For birds aged d 23 and 31, total pen body weight and feed intake were determined, and fresh excreta and litter samples were collected per pen. Dry matter (DM) content was measured in the excreta and litter samples. Total tract DM digestibility, apparent metabolisable energy corrected to nitrogen (AMEn), and soluble and insoluble NSP and free oligosaccharide degradability were evaluated. 4. In birds fed the sorghum- and corn-based diets, feeding high sNSP resulted in a lower cFCR at d 0–23 compared to low sNSP (P = 0.004 and P = 0.044, respectively). In birds fed the corn-based diet, feeding low sNSP resulted in the lowest litter DM but highest DM digestibility at d 23 (P = 0.045 and P < 0.001) and d 31 (P = 0.022 and P = 0.008). For all diets, degradability of sNSP was higher and insoluble NSP was lower when feeding low compared to high sNSP (P < 0.001). In birds fed the barley- and sorghum-based diets, AMEn was lower when feeding the low compared to high sNSP level (P < 0.001 and P = 0.016, respectively). 6. Results from this study showed that level of dietary sNSP impacts broiler productive performance and nutrient utilisation.  aThis work was supported by the Agrifutures Australia [PRJ-011487].  aPublisher supplied data  aPRJ-011487 3abarley 3abody weight 3acorn 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3aexcreta 3afeed intake 3ametabolizable energy 3anitrogen 3anutrient utilization 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3awater content 3awheat 0aFibre 0anutrition 0aNSP 0adigestion 0adry matter intake 0ametabolism1 aBhuiyan, M.

YopH, a tyrosine phosphatase, is essential for full virulence of Yersinia. Investigating the YopH-targeted signal transduction pathway(s) in neutrophils during infection of a murine host, we find that several host proteins, including the essential signaling adaptor SLP-76, are dephosphorylated in the presence of YopH in neutrophils isolated from infected tissues. YopH inactivated PRAM-1/SKAP-HOM and the SLP-76/Vav/PLCγ2 signal transduction axes, leading to an inhibition of calcium response in isolated neutrophils. Consistent with a failure to mount a calcium response, IL-10 production was reduced in neutrophils containing YopH from infected tissues. Finally, a yopH mutant survived better in the absence of neutrophils, indicating that neutrophil inactivation by YopH by targeting PRAM-1/SKAP-HOM and SLP-76/Vav/PLCγ2 signaling hubs may be critical for Yersinia survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aYersinia 3acalcium 3ainterleukin-10 3amice 3amutants 3aneutrophils 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3avirulence1 aDurand, Enrique A.1 aMecsas, Joan0 tCell host & microbe.g2013 Sept. 11, v. 14, no. 3 p.306-317dElsevier Inc.x1931-31287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2013.08.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001700168245005900185300001600244520084900260592002801109650001501137650002701152650002101179650001501200650001701215650001701232650001501249650001401264650001201278650001501290650001501305650003201320650002101352650001501373650001701388650002401405650002601429650004401455650001201499650005701511700001301568773010701581856008501688852000901773655001201782IND4473064220221118042412.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447306422DNAL7 a211387852pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Fenglian10aRemoval of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: A review  ap. 407-418.  aHeavy metal pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems today. The treatment of heavy metals is of special concern due to their recalcitrance and persistence in the environment. In recent years, various methods for heavy metal removal from wastewater have been extensively studied. This paper reviews the current methods that have been used to treat heavy metal wastewater and evaluates these techniques. These technologies include chemical precipitation, ion-exchange, adsorption, membrane filtration, coagulation–flocculation, flotation and electrochemical methods. About 185 published studies (1988–2010) are reviewed in this paper. It is evident from the literature survey articles that ion-exchange, adsorption and membrane filtration are the most frequently studied for the treatment of heavy metal wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical precipitation 3aelectrochemistry 3afiltration 3aheavy metals 3aion exchange 3ametal ions 3apollution 3asurveys 3awastewater 2aAdsorption 2aChelating Agentsxchemistry 2aElectrochemistry 2aFiltration 2aFlocculation 2aIon Exchange Resins 2aMembranes, Artificial 2aMetals, Heavyxisolation & purification 2aOsmosis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification1 aWang, Qi0 tJournal of environmental management.g2011 Mar., v. 92, no. 3 p.407-418dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009400166300001600260520098900276592002801265650002501293650002001318650001501338650002401353650002001377650001801397650001601415653003701431653002001468653002601488653003101514653004101545653005401586653005201640653003701692653006801729653004101797700002401838700002201862773011201884856008201996852000902078655001202087IND60557648020221118011636.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhadja, Poonam10aSeaweed sulphated polysaccharide as an inhibitor of calcium oxalate renal stone formation  ap. 685-694.  aSulphated polysaccharides (SPSs) from various seaweeds possess broad spectrum therapeutic and biomedical properties that are known to play a significant inhibitory role in calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stones. CaOx stone formation is a multistep process, which includes crystal nucleation, growth, aggregation, and crystal retention. Renal tubular cell injury is one of the determining factors leading to crystal retention and formation of stone in the nidus. In the present review, a comprehensive account was revealed on the therapeutic mechanisms of action of various seaweed SPSs on CaOx renal stone formation. Seaweed SPSs are inhibitor of crystal nucleation, growth, and aggregation. SPSs prevent renal tubular cell damage because of its antioxidant properties, thereby preventing crystal adherence and internalization. Seaweed SPSs are promising molecules because of their role in renal stone prevention. This study contributed much interest for researchers in a wide spectrum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acalcium oxalate 3amacroalgae 3amechanism of action 3apolysaccharides 3arenal calculi 3aresearchers 0aSeaweed sulphated polysaccharide 0aCalcium oxalate 0aRenal stone formation 0aOxalate (PubChem CID: 971) 0aCalcium oxalate (PubChem CID: 33005) 0aCalcium oxalate monohydrate (PubChem CID: 165350) 0aCalcium oxalate dihydrate (PubChem CID: 122156) 0aFucoidan (PubChem CID: 92023653) 0aGlycosaminoglycans (PubChem CID: 24766) (PubChem CID: 22833565) 0aMalondialdehyde (PubChem CID: 10964)1 aLunagariya, Jignesh1 aOuyang, Jian-Ming0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Dec., v. 27 p.685-694dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012600163300002000289520103800309592002801347650002401375650002101399650002101420650002201441650001301463650001801476650001301494650001401507650001901521650001301540650001501553650002101568700002001589700002801609700002201637700001501659773012401674856007401798852000901872655001201881IND60640428520221122072638.0190504e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064042852DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra01986b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiuzdak, Katarzyna10aHighly stable organic–inorganic junction composed of hydrogenated titania nanotubes infiltrated by a conducting polymer  ap. 33101-33110.  aA poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) conducting polymer doped with poly(2-styrene sulfonate) (pEDOT:PSS) was efficiently electrodeposited on a layer composed of ordered titania nanotubes. TiO₂ nanotubes were formed during an anodization process and, after calcinations, a layer was subjected to hydrogen plasma. Hydrogenation leads to Ti(iii) formation, a decrease in resistance, and a huge increase of donor density when compared with pure titania. According to a detailed structure analysis, the coverage by the polymer matrix is uniform on the entire titania surface as well as along the tubes. The composite material exhibits highly enhanced anodic photocurrent (106 μA cm⁻²) when compared with hydrogenated titania H–TiO₂ (54 μA cm⁻²) or pure polymer film (2 μA cm⁻²). Moreover, H–TiO₂/pEDOT:PSS is characterized with high photostability displayed during prolonged illumination. The proposed hydrogenation approach could be regarded as a facile titania modification for further electrochemical modifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3alighting 3ananotubes 3aphotostability 3apolymers 3asulfonates 3atitanium dioxide1 aSzkoda, Mariusz1 aLisowska-Oleksiak, Anna1 aKarczewski, Jakub1 aRyl, Jacek0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 6, no. 39 p.33101-33110dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra01986b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012900167500002200296520077800318592002801096650000901124650001701133650001801150650000701168650001701175653003101192653001201223653001801235653005201253653001601305700001601321773005301337856008501390852000901475655001201484IND60566301220221118030044.0170711s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056630122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Titao10apH-Triggered Disaggregation-Induced Emission (DIE) Probe for Sensoring Minor-pH Changes in Near Infrared Fluorescence region  aPre-press version  aA new strategy for pH-responsive near infrared (NIR) cyanine dye, based on the concept of triggered disaggregation-induced emission (DIE), has been developed. Schiff base group was introduced to the molecular scaffold of Cy7, and promoted the aggregation of cyanine in pH7.4 buffer due to the strong π-π interaction. While in an acidic (pH 5.8) environment, the Schiff base group was hydrolyzed by acid and the nanoparticles were disaggregated. The vanishing of the intermolecular aggregation-caused quenching thus induced a fluorescence recovery of 96 folds. Moreover, abundant kinds of Schiff base provide more potential cyanine dyes for pH-responsive ultrahigh NIR fluorescence “Off/On” ratio, which could work as the intelligent bio-imaging probes in near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3adyes 3afluorescence 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aschiff bases 0aNear Infrared Fluorescence 0acyanine 0apH-Responsive 0aTriggered Disaggregation-Induced Emission (DIE) 0aaggregation1 aYan, Lifeng0 tTalanta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011100166300001600277520107800293592002801371650002201399650003101421650001401452650001301466650001801479650001801497650001101515650002101526650003601547650003201583650000901615650001601624650001701640650002501657650003101682650002501713650001501738651001401753653002201767653003001789653000701819653003001826653003301856653005301889653005301942653004101995653003702036653003602073653007802109653007702187653003602264700001602300700001902316700002002335700001902355700001902374700001702393700002002410700001802430773011202448856008202560852000902642655001202651IND60557648220221118011512.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Hyung Won14aThe constituent, anti-inflammation, and human neutrophil elastase inhibitory activity of Gnaphalium affine  ap. 674-684.  aGnaphalium affine has long been used as a vegetable and as a traditional medicine to treat various diseases in East Asia. In this work, the human neutrophil elastase inhibitory activity and anti-inflammatory effects of the lead phytochemicals isolated from G. affine and their effects on respiratory disease agents were evaluated in vitro. Through activity-guided fractionation, eight compounds (1–8) with different scaffolds were isolated from the EtOAc fraction of G. affine extract (GAE). The GAE inhibited LPS-induced NO production with different potencies. The highest potency for the inhibition of NO, iNOS, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production was found in isolated compounds (1–8). A series of isolated compounds demonstrated modest to high inhibition of HNE with IC50 values of 2.3–46.1 µM. In particular, luteolin-4′-O-β-d-(6″-E-caffeoyl)-glucoside (7) showed noncompetitive inhibition kinetics against HNE. The results of this study support the traditional use of polyphenol-rich products in the prevention and treatment of respiratory disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGnaphalium affine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acytokines 3aelastase 3aethyl acetate 3afractionation 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alead 3aneutrophils 3anitric oxide 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3arespiratory tract diseases 3atraditional medicine 3avegetables 3aEast Asia 0aGnaphalium affine 0aHuman neutrophil elastase 0aNO 0aPro-inflammatory cytokine 0aFlavonoid-caffeoyl-glucoside 0a1,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 6474640) 0a4,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 6474309) 0aIsoquercitrin (PubChem CID: 5280804) 0aQuercetin (PubChem CID: 5353915) 0aLuteolin (PubChem CID: 5280445) 0aQuercetin-4′-O-α-d-(6″-E-caffeoyl)-glucoside (PubChem CID: 60150859) 0aLuteolin-4′-O-β-d-(6″-E-caffeoyl)-glucoside (PubChem CID: 60150858) 0aApigenin (PubChem CID: 5280443)1 aKim, Ki Ohk1 aYuk, Heung Joo1 aKwon, Ok-Kyoung1 aKim, Jung-Hee,1 aKim, Doo-Young1 aNa, Min Kyun1 aAhn, Kyung-Seop1 aOh, Sei-Ryang0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Dec., v. 27 p.674-684dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245008400163300001600247500001900263520091000282592002801192650001001220650001201230650001001242650001701252650001701269650001301286650001901299653001301318653001701331653002001348700002501368700002601393773010301419856007201522852000901594655001201603IND60695666020221120113241.0200518e20100901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069566602DNAL7 a10.2216/09-111.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVouilloud, Amelia A.10aUltrastructure of mature male gametes of Nitella hyalina (Charales, Charophyta)  ap. 508-511.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVouilloud A.A., Cáceres E.J. and Leonardi P.I. 2010.

DOI: 10.2216/09-111.1 This article describes the ultrastructure of male gametes of Nitella hyalina. Microtubular roots did not surround mitochondria completely. The number of microtubules varied from 12 to19 at the level of mitochondria, from 24 to 31 at the level of the nucleus and from 10 to 21 at different levels of the plastids. The three-membered root is clearly discernible only up to the level of mitochondria. At the rearmost level of the gamete, microtubules were separated in bunches of two to six microtubules each. Mature gametes of N. hyalina were compared with those of other species of Chara and Nitella. This comparative analysis suggests that certain male gamete ultrastructure traits are regularly dissimilar at genus level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChara 3aNitella 3amales 3amicrotubules 3amitochondria 3aplastids 3aultrastructure 0aCharales 0aMale gametes 0aNitella hyalina1 aCáceres, Eduardo J.1 aLeonardi, Patricia I.0 tPhycologia.g2010 Sept. 1, v. 49, no. 5 p.508-511dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/09-111.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010900167300001600276506002800292520141700320592002801737506003701765650002601802650002301828650001401851650002301865650001201888650001601900650001201916650001001928650002201938650001801960650002201978650001602000650001202016650001302028651001002041653001602051653002302067653001402090653002302104653001002127773010302137856007902240852000902319655001202328IND60673220420221207094346.0200612e20191005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067322042DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2019-00532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Christian10aAgriculture and tourism sector linkages: Global relevance and local evidence for the case of South Tyrol  ap. 544-553.  aResource is Open Access  aThe promotion of agritourism, i.e., commercial encounters between farmers and non-local visitors, is seen as a vital development option to stabilise economic decline in rural areas. In addition to agritourism, this article analyses the various transactional linkages between the agriculture and tourism sectors. The theory part discusses earlier literature and also covers modern types of farmer-tourist interactions such as on-farm education and training activities. The empirical analysis provides a complete monetary quantification of the various sector linkages for the case of South Tyrol, a north Italian province with significant agricultural and tourism sectors. By using provincial input-output table data from 2011 and combining them with additional agricultural trade numbers, a complete sectoral interlinkage picture is constructed. The results show that while farmer income from tourism is significant, the money earned by exports of agricultural products to tourist source countries is more than double as much. Tourists’ farm overnight stays contribute to about 10% of total farm incomes. Moreover, the results show that agritourism activity and physical farm output are inversely related to each other. A thorough policy assessment of agritourism must differentiate between its farm income effects and its potential counterproductive consequences for global food security and local food supply.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural products 3aagricultural trade 3aeducation 3aempirical research 3aexports 3afarm income 3afarmers 3afarms 3afood availability 3afood security 3aissues and policy 3arural areas 3atourism 3atourists 3aItaly 0aagritourism 0aagricultural trade 0aeconomics 0ainput-output table 0aItaly0 tOpen Agriculture.g2019 Oct. 05, v. 4, no. 1 p.544-553dDe GruyterwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2019-00533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245015100175300001600326520104200342592002801384650001301412650001901425650001801444650001201462650002101474650001301495650001001508650001501518650001601533650001801549650002101567650001601588650001101604650000901615650002001624650002301644650001501667650001201682650001401694653002901708653002001737653003701757653001401794653001401808653001801822653001401840653000801854653000801862653001001870653000701880653000701887653000901894653000901903653000701912653000701919653000801926653000801934653000801942653000801950653000901958653001101967653001101978653000801989653000801997653000802005653000702013653000702020653000802027653000802035653000802043653000702051653000802058700002802066700003302094700002802127700003302155773011202188856008202300852000902382655001202391IND60557648320221118011452.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantana-Gálvez, Jesús10aApplication of wounding stress to produce a nutraceutical-rich carrot powder ingredient and its incorporation to nixtamalized corn flour tortillas  ap. 655-666.  aWounding stress was applied to carrot to obtain a nutraceutical-rich carrot powder (stressed-carrot powder, SCP) that contained 522, 225, and 23% more chlorogenic acid, total phenolics, and dietary fiber, respectively, compared to regular carrot powder.

Furthermore, SCP substitution induced a change in color of tortillas to yellow, but did not affect cohesiveness and adhesiveness of masa, neither the dimensions, rollability, texture, nor shelf-life of tortillas. Unlike regular tortillas, 10% SCP tortillas had chlorogenic acid, β-carotene, α-carotene, and lutein (270, 39, 36, and 15 µg/g DW, respectively), 155% more total phenolics, and 35% more dietary fiber.

Halophytes may also face sudden micro-environmental variations within their habitats. In this review we examine some of the factors that determine the ability of seeds of halophytes to germinate when conditions are optimal for seedling growth and survival.Seed dormancy (innate, induced or acquired) is an important means of initiating growth under appropriate conditions. Saline environments are often wet and so the seeds of halophytes may remain un-germinated over extended periods even after imbibition if the external environment does not favour germination and seedling survival. Many perennial halophytes, however, do not possess elaborate dormancy systems because they propagate largely through ramets and have no ecological compulsions for seed germination.The seeds of halophytes also have the capacity to recover from a salinity shock and start germination once salinity is reduced, which may happen following rain. In some cases, imbibition in a low-salt solution may help in osmo-priming and improve germination. Seed heteromorphism is yet another strategy adopted by some halophytes, whereby seeds of different size and colour are produced that germinate consecutively at suitable intervals. Light-dependent germination may also help if the seed is under a dense canopy or buried in debris; germination only occurs once these restraints are removed thus increasing the chances of seedling survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acolor 3adrought 3ahabitats 3ahalophytes 3aimbibition 3arain 3asalinity 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atemperature 0aDormancy 0aHalophytes 0aHeteromorphism 0aOsmopriming 0aRecovery 0aSeed germination1 aAnsari, R.q(Raziuddin),1 aFlowers, T.

Six‐log biological indicators of methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus were produced on stainless steel coupons and placed within a large, sealed, environmentally controlled enclosure. Five percent hydrogen peroxide was distributed throughout the enclosure using a Bioquell hydrogen peroxide vapour generator (BQ‐50) for 40 min and left to reside for a further 200 min. Biological indicators were removed at 10‐min intervals throughout the first 120 min of the process. The experiment was repeated for 10 and 35% hydrogen peroxide solutions. Five percent and 10% hydrogen peroxide solutions failed to achieve any reduction of MRSA, but achieved full kill of G. stearothermophilus spores at 70 and 40 min respectively. Thirty‐five percent hydrogen peroxide achieved a 6‐log reduction of MRSA after 30 min and full kill of G. stearothermophilus at 20 min. The concentration of 5% hydrogen peroxide within the enclosure after the 200‐min dwell was measured at 9·0 ppm. This level exceeds the 15‐min Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL) for hydrogen peroxide of 2·0 ppm. Users of automated hydrogen peroxide disinfection systems should review system efficacy and room re‐entry protocols in light of these results. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This research allows hospital infection control teams to consider the impact and risks of using low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for disinfection within their facilities, and to question automated room disinfection system providers on the efficacy claims they make. The evidence that low concentration hydrogen peroxide solutions do not rapidly, autonomously break down, is in contradiction to the claims made by some hydrogen peroxide equipment providers and raises serious health and safety concerns. Facilities using hydrogen peroxide systems that claim autonomous break down of hydrogen peroxide should introduce monitoring procedures to ensure rooms are safe for re‐entry and patient occupation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3aantibiotic resistance 3across infection 3adisease control 3adisinfection 3aequipment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amonitoring 3apatients 3arisk 3aspores 3astainless steel 3avapors1 aBailey, L.1 aBanham, E.1 aWatson, F.1 aAdams, N.M.T.1 aChewins, J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 63, no. 3 p.178-182dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.126073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245007500167300001600242506002800258520143800286592002801724506003701752650002001789650001801809650002001827650002501847650002401872650002201896650000901918650001701927650001801944650000901962650001201971650001101983650002001994650001302014650000902027651001802036653001702054653002202071653001902093653001102112700002002123700002502143773010302168856007902271852000902350655001202359IND60673220520221207094346.0200612e20191005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067322052DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2019-00562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamim Rahman, Kazi10aDemand for Selected Animal Sourced Protein Food Items in United States  ap. 585-590.  aResource is Open Access  aConsumers’ preference for food is ever-changing from carbohydrate to protein since protein plays a vital role in the balanced and healthy growth of human being. Among different sources of protein, animal sourced protein foods are getting popularity over time in United States. How demand for animal sourced protein food items are changing, and to be specific which animal food items are preferred by consumers are necessary to know both for producers and suppliers. This study estimates consumer demand for animal sourced food items in U.S. employing linear approximation of AIDS (LA-AIDS) model. Monthly per capita consumption expenditure data on aggregate and disaggregate animal protein items and price indices at national level from 1995 to 2016 have been collected from the Bureau of Economic Analysis of United States. The data consists of monthly per capita consumption expenditure on beef and veal, pork, other meats, poultry, and fish and seafood, and their price indices. The result shows exogenous growth in the budget share of all meat items. Estimated expenditure and cross price elasticities suggest that all goods are normal in nature and substitute to each other. In addition, weak separability test suggests that meat items are separable from non-meat items. The findings of the study would be helpful understanding consumer preferences and behavior for allocating budget among different sources of animal protein.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal proteins 3acarbohydrates 3aconsumer demand 3aconsumer preferences 3ademand elasticities 3aeconomic analysis 3afish 3ahuman growth 3alinear models 3apork 3apoultry 3aprices 3aprotein sources 3aseafoods 3aveal 3aUnited States 0aSeparability 0aStructural Change 0aAnimal Protein 0aDemand1 aAmin, Md.

Steroid catabolism has been characterized best for the representatives of suborder Corynebacterineae, such as Mycobacteria, Rhodococcus and Gordonia, with high content of mycolic acids in the cell envelope, while it is poorly understood for other steroid-transforming actinobacteria, such as representatives of Nocardioides genus belonging to suborder Propionibacterineae. Nocardioides simplex VKM Ac-2033D is an important biotechnological strain which is known for its ability to introduce ∆¹-double bond in various 1(2)-saturated 3-ketosteroids, and perform convertion of 3β-hydroxy-5-ene steroids to 3-oxo-4-ene steroids, hydrolysis of acetylated steroids, reduction of carbonyl groups at C-17 and C-20 of androstanes and pregnanes, respectively. The strain is also capable of utilizing cholesterol and phytosterol as carbon and energy sources. In this study, a comprehensive bioinformatics genome-wide screening was carried out to predict genes related to steroid metabolism in this organism, their clustering and possible regulation. The predicted operon structure and number of candidate gene copies paralogs have been estimated. Binding sites of steroid catabolism regulators KstR and KstR2 specified for N. simplex VKM Ac-2033D have been calculated de novo. Most of the candidate genes grouped within three main clusters, one of the predicted clusters having no analogs in other actinobacteria studied so far. The results offer a base for further functional studies, expand the understanding of steroid catabolism by actinobacteria, and will contribute to modifying of metabolic pathways in order to generate effective biocatalysts capable of producing valuable bioactive steroids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNocardioides 3aPimelobacter simplex 3aacids 3abacteria 3abinding sites 3abiocatalysts 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3acarbon 3acholesterol 3aenergy 3ahydrolysis 3aoperon 3aphytosterols 3ascreening 3asteroid metabolism1 aSchelkunov, Mikhail I.1 aFokina, Victoria V.1 aPekov, Yury A.1 aIvashina, Tanya1 aDonova, Marina V.0 tCurrent genetics.g2016 Aug., v. 62, no. 3 p.643-656dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0172-80837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-016-0568-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245017000203300001600373506007600389520138800465592002801853506003701881650002301918650002201941650001101963650001701974650001201991650001202003650001602015650002102031650001902052650001902071650001302090650001402103650001302117650001602130700002102146700002402167700002302191700002202214700002302236700002502259700002202284773012902306856007802435852000902513655001202522IND60560878020221207052455.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056087802DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b110222doi7 aPMC54888612pmcid7 a279737882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Chern-Hooi10aIntramolecular Charge Transfer and Ion Pairing in N,N-Diaryl Dihydrophenazine Photoredox Catalysts for Efficient Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization  ap. 348-355.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhotoexcited intramolecular charge transfer (CT) states in N,N-diaryl dihydrophenazine photoredox catalysts are accessed through catalyst design and investigated through combined experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These CT states are reminiscent of the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states of ruthenium and iridium polypyridyl complexes. For cases where the polar CT state is the lowest energy excited state, we observe its population through significant solvatochromic shifts in emission wavelength across the visible spectrum by varying solvent polarity. We propose the importance of accessing CT states for photoredox catalysis of atom transfer radical polymerization lies in their ability to minimize fluorescence while enhancing electron transfer rates between the photoexcited photoredox catalyst and the substrate. Additionally, solvent polarity influences the deactivation pathway, greatly affecting the strength of ion pairing between the oxidized photocatalyst and the bromide anion and thus the ability to realize a controlled radical polymerization. Greater understanding of these photoredox catalysts with respect to CT and ion pairing enables their application toward the polymerization of methyl methacrylate for the synthesis of polymers with precisely tunable molecular weights and dispersities typically lower than 1.10.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3airidium 3aligands 3amethodology 3amolecular weight 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aruthenium 3asolvents 3awavelengths1 aRyan, Matthew D.1 aMcCarthy, Blaine G.1 aTheriot, Jordan C.1 aSartor, Steven M.1 aDamrauer, Niels H.1 aMusgrave, Charles B.1 aMiyake, Garret M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 139, no. 1 p.348-355dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b110223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245006700201500002200268520089900290592002801189653001901217653002001236653000901256653000901265700002301274700001901297700002201316773012701338856008201465852000901547655001201556IND60570465920221120074959.0170710s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057046592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geog.2017.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6492-719310aBasic Earth’s Parameters as estimated from VLBI observations  aPre-press version  aThe global Very Long Baseline Interferometry observation for measuring the Earth rotation’s parameters was launched around 70th.

The MHB2000 nutation model was introduced in 2002, which is constructed based on a revised nutation series derived from 20 years VLBI observations(1980-1999). In this work, we firstly estimated the amplitudes of all nutation terms from the IERS-EOP-C04 VLBI global solutions w.r.t. IAU1980, then we further inferred the Basic Earth’s Parameters(BEPs) by fitting the major nutation terms. Meanwhile, the BEPs were obtained from the same nutation time series using a Bayesian Inversion(BI). The corrections to the precession rate and the estimated BEPs are in an agreement, independent of which methods have been applied.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNutation model 0aNutation series 0aVLBI 0aBEPs1 aRivoldini, Attilio1 aKoot, Laurence1 aDehant, Veronique0 tGeodesy and Geodynamics.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aInstitute of Seismology, China Earthquake Administrationx1674-98477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geog.2017.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01305naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013100156300001600287520033400303592002800637650002500665650001500690650001100705650001500716651001300731700002000744700002600764700001300790773010600803856007300909852000900982655001200991IND60727758520221116152939.0210212e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072775852DNAL7 a10.15560/15.2.2492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoritz, Timo10aFirst record of the Short-tailed Pipefish, Microphis brachyurus lineatus (Kaup, 1856) (Syngnathidae, Nerophinae), for Suriname  ap. 249-252.  aThe occurrence of the pipefish Microphis brachyurus (Bleecker, 1854) in Suriname is reported here for the first time.

However, only 15% of the world’s coal reserves have the required properties for metallurgical coke, which makes the useful coal expensive. Transforming coal into metallurgical coke is an energy-intensive endeavor, and global competition requires worldwide steelmakers to be more efficient in terms of energy consumption, therefore the optimization of the coke production process has become increasingly decisive. The objective of this study was to develop a rigorous model of the coke oven process by separately considering the coke oven, combustion chamber, and regenerative bed. In this study, the coke oven was divided into zones according to the number of available temperature measurements in each combustion chamber. The developed model using Aspen Plus™ was used primarily to obtain a more uniform combustion chamber temperature profile and to investigate the effect of the combustion chamber temperature profile on the fuel consumption. The results were validated from the plant data for temperature, flowrate, and composition. A new set of operating conditions was implemented, and the consumption of coke oven gas was reduced by approximately 12%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3airon 3amodels 3aovens 3araw materials 3asteel 3atemperature profiles 0aMetallurgical coke 0aCoking and combustion chambers 0aModeling 0aSimulation 0aAnd optimization1 aLeite, M.B.M.1 aMarcelino, T.O.A.C.1 aCarneiro, L.O.1 aBrito, K.D.1 aBrito, R.P.0 tEnergy.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 217 p.119419-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1194193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002800171245011600199300001800315520132200333592002801655650001301683650001001696650002601706650002701732650001201759650002601771650002401797650001401821650002001835650003201855650002601887650001301913650001201926650002401938650002801962650001901990650002002009650002302029650002402052651001602076653002002092653002102112653002602133653002202159700002402181700002202205700002202227773010902249856008702358852000902445655001202454IND50068904320221118233139.0190402e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006890432DNAL7 a239935972pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarnjanapratum, Supatra10aChemical compositions and nutritional value of Asian hard clam (Meretrix lusoria) from the coast of Andaman Sea  ap. 4138-4145.  aChemical compositions and nutritive value of the edible portions including foot, mantle and viscera of Asian hard clam (Meretrix lusoria) harvested from the coast of Andaman Sea were determined. Proximate compositions varied with portions tested. Edible portions had moisture (76.23–84.22%) and protein (9.09–12.75%) as the major components. Carbohydrate (0.32–7.89%), fat (1.58–6.58%) and ash (1.23–2.58%) were also found at various levels, dependent upon portions. Myofibrillar proteins were observed as the major fraction in foot (40.54%) and mantle (31.65%), whilst non-protein nitrogen constituents were dominant in the viscera (36.85%). All portions contained a large amount of essential amino acids (167.66–187.63mg/g sample), in which leucine (30.91–36.96mg/g sample) and lysine (35.24–36.03mg/g sample) were predominant. They were rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (46.84–49.18% of total fatty acid) with high level of DHA (13.33–16.47 % of total fatty acids) and EPA (4.75–7.11% of total fatty acids). Cholesterol of 0.07–0.21% wet weight was detected. All portions were also rich in macro- (Na, K, Ca and Mg) and micro- (Fe, Zn, Cu and Cr) minerals.

The cellular level of K⁺ is controlled to a large extent by the K⁺ transporter, which belongs to the KT/HAK/KUP (HAK) family. However, little is known about these genes in tobacco. In this study, we surveyed the tobacco genome and identified 41 putative NtHAK genes (NtHAKS1–NtHAKS21 and NtHAKT1–NtHAKT20). Investigation of the cis-elements in upstream regions of these NtHAK genes suggests that members of this family respond to environmental cues and phytohormones. Expression data mining reveals that NtHAK genes showed clear sub-genome dominance. In all, these results will provide molecular insights into K⁺ transporter research in tobacco.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agrowth and development 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant hormones 3apotassium 3atobacco 3atransporters 0aHAK 0agene family 0aasymmetrical evolution1 aWu, Xingfu1 aGao, Yulong1 aCui, Xiang1 aJiao, Fangchan1 aChen, Xuejun1 aLi, Yongping0 tGenome.g2019, v. 62, no. 4 p.267-278dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl41235x1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2018-01873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011400159300001600273520108400289592002801373653002701401653001801428653001901446653002201465700002101487700001801508773009301526856007501619852000901694655001201703IND60128430220221120174840.0151115e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012843022DNAL7 a10.2326/osj.9.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Nozomu J.14aThe Egg Dilution Effect Hypothesis: A Condition Under which Parasitic Nestling Ejection Behaviour will Evolve  ap. 115-121.  aRecent research into the Large-billed Gerygone, a host species of the Little Bronze-Cuckoo, has revealed that the host physically ejects parasitic cuckoo young from its nest, a behaviour not previously observed in any other host-brood parasite system. Curiously, this host does not reject dissimilar foreign eggs despite egg rejection seeming to be a better strategy for it because if successful, there is no risk of the warbler's own eggs being ejected by cuckoo young. In order to explain this puzzle, we present a new hypothesis, termed the egg dilution effect, which argues that parasitic cuckoo eggs serve to ensure host egg survival through the dilution effect and protect against parasitism by multiple females. It is therefore beneficial for hosts to accept cuckoo eggs even if they are capable of discriminating cuckoo eggs from their own. The conditions of this hypothesis, such as small clutch size and high parasitism rate, fit the nature of the host species and thus help explain why this unique anti-parasitic strategy has evolved only in the Large-billed Gerygone.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAvian brood parasitism 0aBronze-cuckoo 0aEDE hypothesis 0aNestling ejection1 aMikamf, Osamu K.1 aUeda, Keisuke0 tOrnithological Science.g2010 Dec., v. 9, no. 2 p.115-121dUniBio Pressx1347-05587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2326%2Fosj.9.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010500173300001600278520124700294592002801541650002201569650001201591650001801603650001801621650002701639650001201666650001901678650000901697650001501706650000701721650001301728650003301741650001301774650002101787650001801808653001601826653002201842653001601864653001001880653001801890653001701908700002701925700003001952773013301982856008602115852000902201655001202210IND60765785120221118125222.0220202e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076578512DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2021.19229172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonabadi, Ebrahim10aOptimization of culture conditions for enhanced Dunaliella salina productions in mixotrophic culture  ap. 154-162.  aDunaliella salina (D. salina) is a green microalga known for its tendency to produce lipid and β-carotene. Fatty acid profile, lipid and β-carotene productions of the microalga D. salina cultivated under different mixotrophic conditions were assayed. Notably, in spite of a broad spectrum of substrates served, mixotrophic cultivations slightly affected the fatty acid composition, and as a result C16:0 and C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 were identified as main fatty acids. Lipid in dry weight biomass (DWB) hit a high of 24.3% at 5% of NaCL and linolenic acid in lipid reached a peak of 9.15% at 15% of NaCL in medium containing glucose and equal amounts of yeast extract and soy bean powder. One-factor-at-a-time was applied to elucidate the substrates which had noticeable impacts on β-carotene production. Glucose, meat peptone, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO₂ NPs), pH 7.5 and 5% NaCL were identified as key process parameters impacting β-carotene production. Following, the concentration of glucose, meat peptone and TiO₂ NPs were optimized by using response surface method. The highest content of β-carotene, 25.23 mg/g DWB, was obtained in medium composed of (g/L); 22.92 glucose, 5 meat peptone and 0.002 TiO₂ NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDunaliella salina 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3aculture media 3afatty acid composition 3aglucose 3alinolenic acid 3ameat 3amicroalgae 3apH 3apeptones 3aresponse surface methodology 3asoybeans 3atitanium dioxide 3ayeast extract 0aβ-Carotene 0aDunaleilla salina 0afatty acids 0alipid 0ananoparticles 0aoptimization1 aSamadlouie, Hamid Reza1 aShafafi Zenoozian, Masoud0 tPreparative biochemistry & biotechnology.g2022 Feb. 1, v. 52, no. 2 p.154-162dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12249x1532-22977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2021.19229173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245015800166300001600324520049300340592002800833650001400861650000900875650001600884650001300900650001700913650001900930651001400949651001500963651001400978651001300992700002401005773010601029856007301135852000901208655001201217IND60727758920221116152941.0210212e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072775892DNAL7 a10.15560/15.2.2692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspinal, Mario Roberto10aDistributional extension for a dry forest species, Mesoscincus managuae (Dunn, 1933) (Squamata, Scincidae), on the Subhumid Caribbean versant of Honduras  ap. 269-273.  aMesoscincus managuae (Dunn, 1933) (Squamata, Scincidae) is a typical dry-forest species found along the Pacific versant of Central America from Guatemala to northwestern Costa Rica.

Insects has a strong defense system comprising of anatomical barrier, humoral antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production and cellular immune components. Locusta migratoria (L. migratoria) is an agricultural pest insect migrating long distance might encounter distinct pathogens. Owing to this, we aimed in identifying AMPs present in the L. migratoria and elucidate the antimicrobial activity. The migratory locust was immunized with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans mixture, then RNA was isolated and sequenced. The L. migratoria transcriptome was de novo assembled using trinity and screened for AMPs propensity specifically molecular and aggregation properties. The novelty is tested by blasting in known AMP databases. Finally, obtained novel putative AMPs were then tested for antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. The prediction resulted in 3,524 putative AMPs which was further screened down to ten AMPs for final testing. Two peptides showing promising antimicrobial effects were obtained. All the analyzed peptides showed no hemolysis confirms its non-toxicity. Thus, our peptides could be promising drug candidate and can be used as an alternative to antibacterial or antifungal therapy with further validations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aLocusta migratoria 3aRNA 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3acomputer simulation 3adrugs 3aentomology 3ahemolysis 3aimmune system 3ainsect pests 3amigratory behavior 3aprediction 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptome 0aLocusta migratoria 0aAntimicrobial peptide 0aTranscriptome 0aDe novo assembly, Hemolysis1 aChung, Hoyong1 aShin, Yong Pyo1 aKim, In-Woo1 aNatarajan, Sathishkumar1 aVeerappan, Karpagam1 aSeo, Minchul1 aPark, Junhyung1 aHwang, Jae Sam0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2021 June, v. 24, no. 2 p.237-242dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2021.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245010800205300001800313520040900331592002800740650001400768650001500782650002700797650002300824650001700847650001900864650001400883650001300897700002300910700002000933700002000953700002100973700002500994700001701019700002801036773013301064856007401197852000901271655001201280IND60659533120221121232111.0190823e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065953312DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc31275a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWildThese authors contributed equally to this work., Andreas10aSynthesis of a glycopolymeric Ptᴵᴵ carrier and its induction of apoptosis in resistant cancer cells  ap. 6357-6359.  aPost-polymerization modification of a poly(pentafluorostyryl) backbone with β-d-galactose and a terpyridine platinum complex yields a well-defined material that represents the first example of a metal-conjugated glycopolymer.

The most potent compounds caused about 90 % of the plants to flower when the seeds were germinated in their presence and planted in vermiculite. The flowering rate was as high as that caused by the s-triazine and carbamate compounds we measured earlier, but the inhibition of germination and emergence from vermiculite was in general less.

Total ash concentration decreased with increasing N rate in a curvilinear fashion for both wheats and was negatively correlated with grain yield. Increasing the N application rate from 40 to 160 kg of N ha-1 resulted in small, < 10%, decreases in the concentration of P and K but increased the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Fe. Variation in grain mineral concentration as a result of N management was minor relative to variation in grain mineral concentration between local environments. 3awinter wheat 3amineral content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aOntario1 aWarren, C.J.1 aSheard, R.W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Sept., v. 40, no. 9 p.1528-1530x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00021a0113Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01749naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002700139245007800166300001800244520073300262650001700995650002101012650002501033650002301058700002201081700001801103700002301121700001701144773010301161852000901264856007901273930003301352945001301385946001301398655001201411IND2036837420221118042422.0940124e199209  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203683742DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00021a0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez de Simon, B.10aImportance of phenolic compounds for the characterization of fruit juices  ap. 1531-1535.  aSeveral commercial juices of orange, apple, pineapple, peach, apricot, pear, and grape have been analyzed by HPLC and TLC to establish their phenolic composition.

Reverse-phase chromatography showed over 45 peaks in both fungi and revealed a cluster of 10 peaks in A. parasiticus that was not observed in A. flavus. These elution profiles reveal protein heterogeneity that might have application in the field of fungal taxonomy. 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aaflatoxins 3asurface antigens 3aextraction 3aoligopeptides 0amapping1 aNeucere, J.N.1 aCleveland, T.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Sept., v. 40, no. 9 p.1613-1616x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00021a0283Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02244naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245008800158300001800246520118900264650001501453650001601468650003101484650001001515650002401525651001201549653001601561653002001577700002001597700001601617773010201633852000901735856007901744930003301823945001301856946001301869655001201882IND2037099420221118042349.0940203e199208  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203709942DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00020a0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, D.G.10aPersistence of hexazinone and metsulfuron-methyl in a mixed-wood/boreal forest lake  ap. 1444-1449.  aThe persistence of hexazinone and metsulfuron-methyl herbicides was investigated in an experiment using in situ enclosures deployed in a mixed-wood/boreal forest lake. Dissipation studies provided evidence that aqueous residues of hexazinone may persist (DT50 = 131-280 days) under conditions typical of northern lentic systems in the mixed-wood/boreal forest. Although dissipation rates of hexazinone differed depending upon initial concentrations (10(4) and 10(3) microgram L-1), such differences were of little practical significance. In contrast, concentration-dependent dissipation of metsulfuron-methyl was of practical significance with slow rates (DT50 > 84 days) observed for 10(3) microgram L-1 concentrations and more rapid rates (DT50 = 29.1 days) at environmentally realistic initial concentrations approximating 10 microgram L-1. The unexpectedly slow dissipation of hexazinone observed in this study was postulated to result from the influence of low light intensity and short day length on the primary degradation pathway-photolysis. Further study of hexazinone dissipation and impact in relevant northern aquatic systems subject to photolytic inhibition is warranted. 3ahexazinone 3ametsulfuron 3aphysicochemical properties 3alakes 3aaquatic environment 3aOntario 0apersistence 0agreenwater lake1 aMacDonald, L.M.1 aStaznik, B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Aug., v. 40, no. 8 p.1444-1449x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00020a0313Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01858naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002200139245014800161300001800309520080900327650001601136650001601152650001501168650001401183650002401197700001801221700001701239700001501256773010201271852000901373856007901382930003301461945001301494946001301507655001201520IND2037098220221118042559.0940203e199208  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203709822DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00020a0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeerasinghe, C.A.10aAquatic photodegradation of albendazole and its major metabolites. 2.

Rheological studies indicated interaction between aloe vera gel and the algal polysaccharides and xanthan gum as shown by increased apparent viscosities, apparent yield points, and, in some cases, hysteresis but not with guar gum. These properties did not deteriorate during storage. It was therefore proposed that the algal polysaccharides or xanthan gum could serve to stabilize the network structure of fresh aloe vera polysaccharides. 3aAloe vera 3aguar gum 3agels 3arheological properties 3axanthan gum 3astorage 3amixtures 3aleaves 0ared seaweeds 0apolysaccharides 0aexudates1 aCohen, E.1 aArad, S.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Aug., v. 40, no. 8 p.1316-1320x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00020a0043Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01866naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245011500157300001800272520087600290650001301166650001401179650000901193650001501202650001901217650001501236650001301251653001501264773010201279852000901381856007901390930003301469945001301502946001301515655001201528IND2037098320221118042437.0940203e199208  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203709832DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00020a0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeucere, J.N.10aElectrophoretic analysis of cationic proteins extracted from aflatoxin-resistant/susceptible varieties of corn  ap. 1422-1424.  aThe cationic proteins from two varieties of corn, Zea mays L., that are resistant (Yellow Creole) and susceptible (Huffman) to aflatoxin contamination were characterized by electrophoresis.

SDS -PAGE showed approximately 12 bands that ranged between 14 and 43 kDa in both varieties. The profiles were different, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The major proteins in Yellow Creole clustered around 20 kDa on the gel and those in Huffman around 25 kDa. Qualitative variations of proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis were evident, especially within the pH range 6.7-8.0 and around 27 and 92 kDa.

In this work, we showed that NTH2, a paralog of NTH1, encodes a functional trehalase that is implicated in trehalose mobilization. Yeast is also endowed with an acid trehalase encoded by ATH1 and an H⁺/trehalose transporter encoded by AGT1, which can together sustain assimilation of exogenous trehalose. We showed that a tps1 mutant defective in the TPS catalytic subunit cultivated on trehalose, or on a dual source of carbon made of galactose and trehalose, accumulated high levels of intracellular trehalose by its Agt1p-mediated transport. The accumulated disaccharide was mobilized as soon as cells entered the stationary phase by a process requiring a coupling between its export and immediate extracellular hydrolysis by Ath1p. Compared to what is seen for classical growth conditions on glucose, this mobilization was rather unique, since it took place prior to that of glycogen, which was postponed until the late stationary phase. However, when the Ath1p-dependent mobilization of trehalose identified in this study was impaired, glycogen was mobilized earlier and faster, indicating a fine-tuning control in carbon storage management during periods of carbon and energy restriction.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acouplings 3aenergy 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3ahydrolysis 3ametabolism 3aprotein subunits 3atransporters 3atrehalase 3atrehalose 3ayeasts1 aBeltran, Gemma1 aFrançois, Jean.1 aParrou, Jean Luc0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Feb. 1, v. 74, no. 3 p.605-614dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00557-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03522naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245010400171300001600275500002400291520212800315650003502443650001002478650002102488650002102509650000902530650001002539650001502549650001702564650001102581650001302592650001602605650001502621650002302636650002402659650001202683650001902695650001802714650001002732650001502742700001602757773012002773852000902893856009402902856005602996655001203052IND4364356620221118042544.0040909e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436435662DNAL7 a10.1023/B:FRES.0000035175.74199.9a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoland, J.O.10aCopper contamination of soil and vegetation in coffee orchards after long-term use of Cu fungicides  ap. 203-211.  aIncludes references  aThe repeated use of Cu fungicides to control coffee berry disease can result in increased Cu content in soils and vegetation and thus raising the pollution levels and a concern for potential effects on human health. Therefore a field survey of coffee orchards of the Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions of Tanzania, where Cu fungicides are frequently used, was conducted to determine the possible Cu contamination of soils and vegetation. Soil samples were collected from 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm depth at a distance of 0.5 m from the trunk of coffee trees. Plant leaf samples of beans and maize crops intercropped with coffee trees as well as leaves of coffee trees, were also collected at the same time and places. Soil and plant samples were collected both from small farms and commercial estates. Copper in the soil samples was extracted with CaCl2 (CCu), whereas for the total Cu, samples were digested with aqua regia (HNO3 and HCl(1:3) (ACu)). Plant samples were drying ashed and digested with HNO3. Copper concentration in the extracted and digested solutions was determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. A significant Cu enrichment of the soils was observed and the Cu concentration in the 0-5 cm soil depth was about three times higher than in the 15-30 cm depth. A large variability in the soil Cu concentration between fields of the same farm and within the same orchard was observed. The differences in the total Cu concentration (ACu) between small farms and commercial estates were not statistically significant, but the extractable Cu (CCu) was higher and soil pH was lower in the estates of the Kilimanjaro region than at small farms. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased significantly with increasing altitudes, and it was also higher on small farms than on commercial estates. The SOC content showed a close and positive correlation with total Cu. At soil pH below 5.3, the CCu fraction increased steeply. Bean plants from coffee fields showed a high concentration of Cu, suggesting a possible Cu toxicity problem in bean plants. Coffee leaves also showed extremely high Cu concentration. 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abeans 3acalcium chloride 3acommercial farms 3acorn 3acrops 3afungicides 3ahuman health 3aleaves 3aorchards 3asmall farms 3asoil depth 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3atrees 3avegetation1 aSingh, B.R.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2004 July, v. 69, no. 3 p.203-211dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:FRES.0000035175.74199.9a3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-1314/contents 7aarticle02627naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245007300183300001600256500002400272520095200296650002301248650001801271650001001289650002401299650001301323650003001336650006901366650002101435650004501456650003801501650002401539650002701563650003201590650003201622650007801654650002101732650004101753650005801794650003801852650002801890650002501918651001401943651001501957773009201972852000902064856004802073655001202121IND4456884020221118042634.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445688402DNAL7 a211915962pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-010-0978-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurtis, Ian S.10aGenetic engineering of radish: current achievements and future goals  ap. 733-744.  aIncludes references  aRadish is a major root crop grown in the Far East and is especially important to some low-income countries where it is consumed on a daily basis. Developments in gene technology systems have helped to accelerate the production of useful germplasms, but progress has been slow, though achieved, via in planta methods and useful traits have been introduced. In the wake of the new Millennium, future goals in terms of improving transformation efficiency and selection of new traits for generating late-flowering radish are described. Furthermore, the techniques available for incorporating pharmaceutical proteins into radish to deliver edible proteins on-site are discussed. Finally, the concerns of releasing transgenic radish to the field in terms of pollen-mediated gene transfer are also reviewed. Such a report identifies key areas of research that is required to allow the crop satisfy the need of poor impoverished countries in the Far East. 3abiopharmaceuticals 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aradishes 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Flowxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Engineeringxtrends 2aPharmaceutical Preparations 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPollenxgenetics 2aProteinsxgeneticsxtherapeutic use. 2aRaphanusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTissue Culture Techniquesxtrends 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aTransgenesxgenetics 3aEast Asia 0aEast Asia.0 tPlant cell reports.g2011 May, v. 30, no. 5 p.733-744dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-010-0978-6 7aarticle03911naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245014900187300001600336500002400352500001500376520216500391650001802556650002402574650001902598650000902617650001402626650001002640650002902650650000902679650001702688650001802705650002502723650001302748650007802761650002302839650003002862650002902892650002602921650002802947650001402975650003402989650002003023650002203043653001103065700003503076700002603111700003003137700002903167773009203196852000903288856004803297655001203345IND4444646220221118042601.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444464622DNAL7 a204224092pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-010-9670-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenechkin, Ilya V.10aIsolation and Partial Characterization of Bacterial Strains on Low Organic Carbon Medium from Soils Fertilized with Different Organic Amendments  ap. 829-839.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA total of 720 bacterial strains were isolated from soils with four different organic amendment regimes on a low organic carbon (low-C) agar medium (10 µg C ml⁻¹) traditionally used for isolation of oligotrophs. Organic amendments in combination with field history resulted in differences in dissolved organic carbon contents in these soils. There were negative correlations between total and dissolved organic carbon content and the number of isolates on low-C agar medium, whereas these correlations were absent for bacterial strains isolated from the same soil on high-C agar medium (1,000 µg C ml⁻¹). Repeated transfers (up to ten times) of the isolates from low-C agar medium to fresh low- and high-C agar media were done to test for exclusive growth under oligotrophic conditions. The number of isolates exclusively growing under oligotrophic conditions dropped after each subsequent transfer from 241 after the first to 98 after the third transfer step. Identification on the basis of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that most of the 241 isolates (as well as the subset of 98 isolates) belong to widespread genera such as Streptomyces, Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Mesorhizobium, and the taxonomic composition of dominant genera changed from the first transfer step to the third. A selected subset of 17 isolates were further identified and characterized for exclusive growth on low-C agar medium. Two isolates continued to grow only on low-C agar medium up to the tenth transfer step and matched most closely with Rhizobium sullae and an uncultured bacterium on the basis of the almost full-length 16S rRNA gene. It was concluded that the vast majority of strains which are isolated on low-C agar media belong to the trophic group of microorganisms adapted to a “broad range” of carbon concentrations, including well-known and widespread bacterial genera. Oligotrophy is a physiological, not a taxonomic property, and can only be identified by cultural means so far. We showed that true oligotrophs that are unable to grow on high carbon media are rare and belong to genera that also contain broad-range and copiotrophic strains. 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil organic carbon 3aBradyrhizobium 3asoil 3aRhizobium 3agenes 3adissolved organic carbon 3aagar 3aStreptomyces 3aMesorhizobium 3anucleotide sequences 3abacteria 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCulture Mediaxmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFertilizersxanalysis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 0acarbon1 aSpeksnijder, Adrianus G.

Maximum prepartum degree days were estimated to quantify the degree of heat stress. Multiple regressions analyses and logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the effect of prepartum heat stress and body condition change on reproductive parameters, which were obtained from DHIA forms at the end of the lactation. Multiparous and primiparous cows which gained body condition score from calving to 60 d postpartum exhibited 28 and 27 fewer days open (P < 0.05), respectively, than cows not gaining. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of heat stress measurement on days open or services per conception in either multiparous or primiparous cows. During hotter months of calving, multiparous cows showed higher services per conception and primiparous cows showed higher days open and services per conception (P < 0.05). Maximum prepartum degree-days were positively associated (P < 0.05) with calving difficulty score. Multiparous cows with high body condition score at calving were 1.47 times more likely to present a very difficult calving than cows that calved in October (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that reproductive performance was not affected by cumulative prepartum heat stress although it was associated with very difficult calving score. 3aHolstein 3abody condition 3acalving 3aconception 3acows 3adairy herds 3adays open 3aheat stress 3aheat sums 3alactation 3alogit analysis 3areproductive traits 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHeat Stress Disordersxveterinary 2aHot Temperaturexadverse effects 2aPostpartum Period 2aPregnancy 2aRegression Analysis 2aReproductionxphysiology 0aMississippi1 aFuquay, John W.1 aMoore, Reuben B.1 aLiu, Zhanglin1 aClark, Bruce L.1 aVierhout, C.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2010 Feb., v. 42, no. 2 p.265-273dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-009-9415-7 7aarticle02359naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245007900146300001800225500001500243520129400258650002101552650002401573650001701597650001701614650002001631650001401651650002801665650001601693653001501709700001801724700001601742700001701758700002001775773009801795852000901893930003301902945001301935946001301948655001201961IND2042245420221118042301.0940926e199407  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204224542DNAL7 a163493392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassos, F.V.10aKinetics and modeling of lactic acid production by Lactobacillus plantarum  ap. 2627-2636.  a2019-12-05  aAn unstructured model was developed to describe bacterial growth, substrate utilization, and lactic acid production by Lactobacillus plantarum in cucumber juice. Significant lactic acid production occurred during growth, as well as stationary phases. The percentage of acid produced after growth ceased was a function of the medium composition. Up to 51% of the lactic acid was produced after growth ceased when NaCl was not present in the medium, whereas not more than 18% of the total lactic acid was produced after the growth ceased in presence of NaCl, probably because of an increase in the cell death rate. An equation relating the specific death rate and NaCl concentration was developed. With the kinetic model proposed by R. Luedeking and E. L. Piret (J. Biochem. Microbiol. Technol. Eng. 1:393-412, 1958) for lactic acid production rate, the growth-associated and non-growth-associated coefficients were determined as 51.9 (+/- 4.2) mmol/g of cells and 7.2 (+/- O.9) mmol/g of cells h-1 respectively. The model was demonstrated for batch growth of L. plantarum in cucumber juice. Mathematical simulations were used to predict the influence of variations in death rate, proton concentration when growth ceased, and buffer capacity of the juice on the overall fermentation process. 3astarter cultures 3amathematical models 3afermentation 3abiosynthesis 3afermented foods 3acucumbers 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3alactic acid 0avegetables1 aFleming, H.P.1 aOllis, D.F.1 aFelder, R.M.1 aMcFeeters, R.F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 July, v. 60, no. 7 p.2627-2636x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02442naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245009300147300001800240500001500258520129800273650002801571650002801599650001001627650001401637650000901651650002801660650002301688650001201711650001301723650000901736650001601745653001501761653001601776700001901792700001601811700001501827773009801842852000901940930003301949945001301982946001301995655001202008IND2042245620221118042357.0940926e199407  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204224562DNAL7 a163493402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeFlaun, M.F.10aTn5 insertion mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens defective in adhesion to soil and seeds  ap. 2637-2642.  a2019-12-05  aTn5 insertion mutants of a soil isolate, Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, were selected for decreased ability to adhere to quartz sand in a column assay. Three adhesion-deficient mutants that differed in the location of the Tn5 insertion in the chromosome were isolated and compared with the wild-type strain. One mutant, Pf0-5, was described previously as an adhesion-defective, nonmobile, flagellumless mutant (M.F. DeFlaun, A.S. Tanzer, A.L. McAteer, B. Marshall, and S.B. Levy, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 56:112-119, 1990). Another insertion mutant, Pf0-10, was also missing flagella and the 34-kDa outer membrane protein that was absent in Pf0-5 but present in the wild-type strain. The third mutant (Pf0-15) had increased amounts of this 34-kDa outer membrane protein and more flagella than the wild-type strain. These mutants also displayed decreased ability to adhere to sterile and natural (live) soil and to a variety of plant seeds. in kinetics studies, the wild-type strain showed an initial rapid binding to seeds followed by a later slow phase of binding. The mutant strains were defective in the initial stages of attachment but did show the later slow binding. The findings indicate that the same mutations that affect binding to sand and soil also affect adhesion to plant seeds. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aseeds 3aflagellum 3asoil 3aouter membrane proteins 3abacterial proteins 3amutants 3aadhesion 3asand 3atransposons 0adeficiency 0amutagenesis1 aMarshall, B.M.1 aKulle, E.P.1 aLevy, S.B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 July, v. 60, no. 7 p.2637-2642x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02361naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245010400148300001800252520135100270650001901621650001301640650002201653650001201675650002801687650001601715653001601731653003501747700001401782700001601796700002101812773009801833852000901931930003301940945001301973946001301986655001201999IND2042351020221118042444.0940929e199408  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204235102DNAL7 a163493432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaldeman, D.L.10aChanges in bacteria recoverable from subsurface volcanic rock samples during storage at 4 degrees C  ap. 2697-2703.  aThe abundance of viable microorganisms recovered from deep subsurface volcanic rock samples increased after rock perturbation and storage for 1 week at 4 degrees C, while the diversity and evenness of recoverable heterotrophic bacterial communities generally decreased. One sample of each morphologically distinct colony type, recovered both before and after storage of U12n rock samples, was purified and characterized by fatty acid methyl ester (MIDI) and API rapid NFT strips. As determined by MIDI cluster analysis, the composition of the recoverable microbial communities changed with storage of rock samples; some groups of organisms were recovered only before, only after, or at both sample times. In general, the isolates recovered only after storage of rock samples had a greater ability to utilize the carbohydrates included in API test strips and had faster generation times than isolates recovered only on initial plating. The nutritional versatility and faster growth rates of organisms recovered in higher proportions after sample storage provide evidence that some microbial community changes may be due to the proliferation of a few bacterial types. However, because some new genera are recovered only after storage, the possibility also exists that dormant bacterial types are resuscitated during sample perturbation and storage. 3avolcanic rocks 3abacteria 3acommunity ecology 3astorage 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aplate count 0acommunities 0adeep subsurface volcanic rocks1 aAmy, P.S.1 aWhite, D.C.1 aRingelberg, D.B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 Aug., v. 60, no. 8 p.2697-2703x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02384naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245012200166300001800288520050300306650001000809650002600819650002100845650002000866650002100886650002200907650001900929650002800948650001500976650002300991650002801014650002001042650001201062650005901074650004701133650007401180650006101254650004201315650006901357650006701426650002401493650002101517650002201538650001501560650001101575653002001586700001501606700001901621773009801640852000901738930003301747945001301780946001301793655001201806IND2042246520221118042341.0940926e199407  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204224652DNAL7 a80745392pmid7 aPMC2017022pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarewood, P.10aEffect of gamma irradiation on shelf life and bacterial and viral loads in hard-shelled clams (Mercenaria mercenaria)  ap. 2666-2670.  aThe feasibility of using (60)Co gamma irradiation to inactivate total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and F-coliphage in hard-shelled clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, was investigated.

Although the soils were similar, the plant communities were quite different because grazing by domestic animals had been allowed (site A) or prevented (site C). Analysis of allelic variation at 13 enzyme-encoding loci by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis delineated 202 chromosomal types (ETs) among a total of 456 isolates representing two populations of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii (AT and CT) and two populations of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae (AV and CV). Regardless of their site of origin or biovar affiliation, isolates of the same ET were confirmed to be more closely related to each other than to isolates of other ETs by repetitive extragenic palindromic and enterobacterial repetitive intergeneric consensus sequences and the PCR technique. Despite the wide range in densities of the Rhizobium populations (<10(2) to >10(5)/g of soil), their overall genetic diversities were similar (mean genetic diversity, 0.45 to 0.51), indicating that low-density populations of soil-borne bacterial species are not necessarily of little genetic diversity. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed significant multilocus structure (nonrandom associations of alleles) within each of the four populations. From a combination of cluster and linkage disequilibrium analyses, a total of eight distinct groups of ETs were defined in the four populations. Two groups (I and III) contributed significant numbers of ETs and isolates to each population. The two populations of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae (AV and CV) exhibited similar genetic structures despite existing at different densities, in different plant communities, and in the presence (CV) or absence (AV) of their local Vicia hosts. In contrast, total linkage disequilibrium was partitioned differently in two biovar populations occupying the same soil (AV and AT), with disequilibrium in the latter being due entirely to the presence of group V. 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3apopulation genetics 3agenetic variation 3aelectrophoresis 3aloci 3aalleles 3aplant communities 3apastures 3apopulation 3aenzyme polymorphism 3aOregon 0awoodland grasslands 0aallelic variation 0amultilocus enzyme electrophoresis1 aLeung, K.1 aWhittan, T.S.1 aBruijn, F.J. de.1 aBottomley, P.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 Aug., v. 60, no. 8 p.2772-2778x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03320naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017900126300001800305520229100323650003802614650002102652650002002673650002502693650001602718650001702734653001202751700001702763700001902780700001702799773009802816852000902914930003302923945001302956946001302969655001202982IND2042358220221118042328.0940929e199408  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204235822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllrich, M.10aCloning and expression of genes required for coronamic acid (2-ethyl-1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid), and intermediate in the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin coronatine  ap. 2890-2897.  aCoronamic acid (CMA; 2-ethyl-1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid) is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of coronatine (COR), a chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea PG4180. Tn5 mutagenesis and substrate feeding studies were previously used to characterize regions of the COR biosynthetic gene cluster required for synthesis of coronafacic acid and CMA, which are the only two characterized intermediates in the COR biosynthetic pathway. In the present study, additional Tn5 insertions were generated to more precisely define the region required for CMA biosynthesis. A new analytical method for CMA detection which involves derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate and detection by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed. This method was used to analyze and quantify the production of CMA by selected derivatives of P. syringae pv. glycinea which contained mutagenized or cloned regions from the CMA biosynthetic region. pMU2, a clone containing a 6.45-kb insert from the CMA region, genetically complemented mutants which required CMA for COR production. When pMU2 was introduced into P. syringae pv. glycinea 18a/90 (a strain which does not synthesize COR or its intermediates), CMA was not produced, indicating that pMU2 does not contain the complete CMA biosynthetic gene cluster. However, when two plasmid constructs designated pMU234 (12.5 kb) and pKTX30 (3.0 kb) were cointroduced into 18a/90, CMA was detected in culture supernatants by thin-layer chromatography and HPLC. The biological activity of the CMA produced by P. syringae pv. glycinea 18a/90 derivatives was demonstrated by the production of COR in cosynthesis experiments in which 18a/90 transconjugants were cocultivated with CMA-requiring mutants of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180. CMA production was also obtained when pMU234 and pKTX30 were cointroduced into P. syringae pv. syringae B1; however, these two constructs did not enable Escherichia coli K-12 to synthesize CMA. The production of CMA in P. syringae strains which lack the COR biosynthetic gene cluster indicates that CMA production can occur independently of coronafacic acid biosynthesis and raises interesting questions regarding the evolutionary origin of the COR biosynthetic pathway. 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea 3astructural genes 3agene expression 3amonocarboxylic acids 3aphytotoxins 3abiosynthesis 0acloning1 aGuenzi, A.C.1 aMitchell, R.E.1 aBender, C.L.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 Aug., v. 60, no. 8 p.2890-2897x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02444naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100003400129245006300163300001800226520131200244650002801556650001901584650001101603650002601614650001201640650001301652650003201665653001701697653002201714653004001736700001801776700001801794700002201812700001701834700001701851773009801868852000901966930003301975945001302008946001302021655001202034IND2042367120221118042416.0940930e199408  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204236712DNAL7 a163493612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, Aurelio Rodriguez.10aEffect of Penicillium chrysogenum on lignin transformation  ap. 2971-2976.  aA strain of Penicillium chrysogenum has been isolated from pine forest soils in Tenerife (Canary Islands). This strain was capable of utilizing hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated aromatic compounds, in particular cinnamic acid, as its sole carbon source. In an optimum medium with high levels of nitrogen (25.6 millimole) and low levels of glucose (5.5 millimole), it was able to decolorize Poly B-411 and to transform kraft, organosolv, and synthetic dehydrogenative polymerisate lignins. After 30 days of incubation, the amount of recovered kraft lignin was reduced to 83.5 and 91.3% of that estimated for uninoculated controls by spectrophotometry and klason lignin, respectively. At the same time, the pattern of molecular mass distribution of the lignin remaining in cultures was changed. The amount of organosolv lignin recovered from cultures was reduced to 90.1 and 94.6% of the initial amount as evaluated by spectrophotometry and klason lignin, respectively. About 6% of total applied radioactivity of O14CH3-organosolv lignin was recovered as after 30 days of incubation, and 18.5% of radioactivity from insoluble O14CH3-organosolv lignin was solubilized. After 26 days of incubation. 2.9% of 14C-beta-dehydrogenative polymerisate and 4.1% of 14C-ring-dehydrogenative polymerisate evolved as 14CO2. 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3abiodegradation 3alignin 3anutrient availability 3aglucose 3anitrogen 3aligninolytic microorganisms 0akraft lignin 0aorganosolv lignin 0adehydrogenative polymerisate lignin1 aCarnicero, A.1 aPerestelo, F.1 aFuente, G. de la.1 aMilstein, O.1 aFalcon, M.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 Aug., v. 60, no. 8 p.2971-2976x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01854naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245011500156300001800271520072700289650001301016650002301029650001601052650001501068650002201083650004301105700001801148700001801166700001401184700001401198700001901212773010201231852000901333856007901342930003301421945001301454946001301467655001201480IND2037099720221118042357.0940203e199208  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203709972DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00020a0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacomber, C.10aDetermination of the ethanesulfonate metabolite of alachlor in water by high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 1450-1452.  aA high-performance liquid chromatography method for the analysis of 2-[(2,6-diethylphenyl)(methoxy- methyl)amino]-2-oxoethanesulfonic acid, a major soil metabolite of alachlor, in groundwater and surface water is presented.

The fungus did not degrade or transform model lignin compounds that were representative of the predominant intermonomer linkages in lignin, nor did it solubilize acid detergent lignin that had been isolated from spear grass. In a stem fraction of sorghum, 33.6% of lignin was apparently solubilized by the fungus. Solubilization of ester- and ether-linked phenolics accounted for 9.2% of the lignin released. The amounts of free phenolic acids detected in culture fluid were equivalent to the apparent loss of ester-linked phenolics from the sorghum substrate. However, the fungus was unable to cleave the ether bond in hydroxycinnamic acid bridges that cross-link lignin and polysaccharide. It is suggested that the majority of the solubilized lignin fraction was a lignin carbohydrate complex containing ether-linked hydroxycinnamic acids. The lignin carbohydrate complex was probably solubilized through dissolution of xylan in the lignin-xylan matrix rather than by lignin depolymerization. 3aNeocallimastix 3arumen fungi 3alignin 3axylan 3asolubility 3abiodegradation 3aphenolic compounds 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aChytridiomycotaxmetabolism 2aHydroxybenzoatesxmetabolism 2aLigninxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aPoaceaexchemistry 2aRumenxmicrobiology 2aSolubility 0amodel lignin compounds 0aacid detergent lignin 0alignin xylan complex1 aDulieu, A.1 aKatayama, Y.1 aLowry, J.B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 Aug., v. 60, no. 8 p.2985-2989x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04015naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245012100165300001800286500001500304520165900319650002001978650002201998650002102020650001402041650002502055650001502080650002002095650001202115650001802127650002402145650005402169650001802223650005702241650003002298650002602328650004902354650001802403650002202421650001202443650002802455650001402483650003002497650003402527650002402561650001402585650002402599653001902623653001802642653001902660653001902679653002802698653001902726653001902745653001902764653001902783653001902802653001902821653001902840653001902859653001902878653001902897653001902916653002502935653001902960653001902979700001602998700001603014773009903030852000903129930003303138945001303171946001303184655001203197IND2042853220221118042505.0941026e199409  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204285322DNAL7 a79443562pmid7 aPMC2017772pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehmann, B.10aNucleotide sequence variation of chitin synthase genes among ectomycorrhizal fungi and its potential use in taxonomy  ap. 3105-3111.  a2019-12-05  aDNA sequences of single-copy genes coding for chitin synthases (UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:chitin 4-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.16) were used to characterize ectomycorrhizal fungi. Degenerate primers deduced from short, completely conserved amino acid stretches flanking a region of about 200 amino acids of zymogenic chitin synthases allowed the amplification of DNA fragments of several members of this gene family. Different DNA band patterns were obtained from basidiomycetes because of variation in the number and length of amplified fragments. Cloning and sequencing of the most prominent DNA fragments revealed that these differences were due to various introns at conserved positions. The presence of introns in basidiomycetous fungi therefore has a potential use in identification of genera by analyzing PCR-generated DNA fragment patterns. Analyses of the nucleotide sequences of cloned fragments revealed variations in nucleotide sequences from 4 to 45%. By comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences, the majority of the DNA fragments were identified as members of genes for chitin synthase class II. The deduced amino acid sequences from species of the same genus differed only in one amino acid residue, whereas identity between the amino acid sequences of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous fungi within the same taxonomic class was found to be approximately 43 to 66%. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of class II chitin synthase-encoding gene fragments by using parsimony confirmed the current taxonomic groupings. In addition, our data revealed a fourth class of putative zymogenic chitin synthases. 3aectomycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3astructural genes 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3aAgaricales 3achitin synthase 3aintrons 3achemotaxonomy 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aBasidiomycotaxclassificationxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aChitin Synthasexgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aFungixclassificationxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Variation 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosis 2aTreesxmicrobiology 0agenbank/x78093 0aBasidiomycota 0agenbank/x78099 0agenbank/x78090 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x78101 0agenbank/x78094 0agenbank/x78097 0agenbank/x78096 0agenbank/x78088 0agenbank/x78102 0agenbank/x78089 0agenbank/x78095 0agenbank/x78100 0agenbank/x78091 0agenbank/x78087 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/x78098 0agenbank/x780921 aBrunner, I.1 aBraus, G.H.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 Sept., v. 60, no. 9 p.3105-3111x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02039naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002400144245007100168300001400239500009800253520082100351650002001172650002101192650001201213650001701225650001601242650001801258650002001276650002501296651001301321653001401334653003401348773007501382852000901457856010401466930003301570945002501603946001301628655001201641IND4425045920221118042438.0090825s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442504592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Hundersmarck.  aIllegal dumping, a social problem greatly affecting some rural states, occurs at both the large and small scale as open dump sites and roadside trash. Focusing on Kentucky, a rural state without mandatory trash pickup and a per capita income below and a poverty rate above the national average, this photo essay describes the dumping and littering problem. As is shown, legislative and executive initiatives have made some inroads in large-scale clean up. Some local governments, however, appear apathetic about addressing illegal dumping in their own communities. Kentucky's litter problem is showing few signs of improvement and roadside littering seemingly is worsening. This problem, with resulting social, economic and environmental harms, is situated theoretically within a rural social disorganization thesis. 3arural sociology 3awaste management 3apoverty 3arural policy 3aphotography 3asocial impact 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironmental impact 3aKentucky 0alittering 0asocial disorganization thesis0 tSouthern rural sociology.g2008, v. 23, no. 2 p.29-42x0885-34367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ag.auburn.edu/auxiliary/srsa/pages/TOCs/vol23-2.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/09/30  aOther US 7aarticle02416naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245010700154300001600261500001500277520112000292650001701412650001801429650002201447650001901469650001501488650001201503650002201515650001501537650002501552650003601577650001701613650002001630653001901650653001101669653002401680700001901704773010001723852000901823856007901832930003301911945001301944946001301957655001201970IND2037405520221118042521.0940218e199303  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203740552DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00027a0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShea, E.M.10aCharacterization of a pectic fraction from smooth bromegrass cell walls using an endopolygalacturonase  ap. 380-387.  a2019-12-04  aAn endopolygalacturonase (PG) was isolated from a commercial enzyme preparation from Aspergillus niger. A fractionation scheme was developed for rapid purification of the enzyme for characterization of pectic polysaccharides from smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis L.). The purified PG had a pH optimum of 4.5 and a hydrolytic temperature stability range of 25-35 degrees C and yielded only tri-, di-, and monogalacturonic acid after exhaustive degradation of polygalacturonic acid. A pectic polysaccharide fraction was solubilized from bromegrass cell walls with hot sodium phosphate buffer and fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography. Degradation of two uronic acid rich fractions by PG revealed a polydisperse nature of the polysaccharide components. One fraction contained a complex makeup of neutral sugars along rhamnogalacturonans that exhibited limited degradation. The other fraction contained fewer neutral sugar components, and the rhamnogalacturonans were extensively degraded. Compositional characteristics of these polymers were similar to those of rhamnogalacturonans isolated from other plants. 3apolyuronides 3afractionation 3aAspergillus niger 3aBromus inermis 3acell walls 3apectins 3apolygalacturonase 3ahydrolysis 3acell wall components 3achemical constituents of plants 3auronic acids 3aenzyme activity 0aneutral sugars 0asugars 0arhamnogalacturonans1 aHatfield, R.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1993 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.380-387x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00027a0083Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02330naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245006900155300001600224520128400240650001001524650001301534650002501547650001001572650000901582650001601591650003801607700001401645700001601659700001601675700001801691773010001709852000901809856007901818930003301897945001301930946001301943655001201956IND2037409720221118042555.0940218e199303  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203740972DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00027a0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarco, M.P.10aDevelopment of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for carbaryl  ap. 423-430.  aSeven rabbit antisera were obtained by immunization with either N-(1-naphthylacetyl)-6-aminohexanoic acid (3) or 1-(1-naphthyl)-3-(5-carboxypentyl)urea (8) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). From these sera Ab2114 (against 8KLH) was used for the optimization of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the determination of the insecticide carbaryl. An I50 of 2-5 ng/mL and a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL were obtained using N-(2-naphthoyl)-6-aminohexanoic acid 5) coupled to conalbumin as a coating antigen. No interference with naphthol, the main degradation product of carbaryl, was observed. An enzyme tracer was prepared by covalently linking hapten 5 with alkaline phosphatase. When the ELISA was performed using a format involving coating the plate with antibodies, an I50 of 0.4-0.6 ng/mL and a detection limit of 0.05 ng/mL were obtained. Preliminary studies with different samples showed that this immunoassay can be used for the determination of carbaryl in water, soil, body fluids, and food samples. This paper demonstrates the flexibility of using stable derivatives of a target compound such as carbaryl to generate antibodies and a sensitive ELISA for molecules containing functionalities susceptible to chemical hydrolysis and biodegradation. 3afoods 3acarbaryl 3ainsecticide residues 3awater 3asoil 3abody fluids 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay1 aGee, S.J.1 aCheng, H.M.1 aLiang, Z.Y.1 aHammock, B.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1993 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.423-430x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00027a0153Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01903naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002700139245002900166300001800195520102400213650001201237650001001249650002201259653001201281700002001293700002601313773010301339852000901442856007901451930003301530945001301563946001301576655001201589IND2037235220221118042341.0940210e199212  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203723522DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00024a0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinguez-Mosquera, M.I.10aColor quality in paprika  ap. 2384-2388.  aThe carotenoid pigmentation of five varieties of pepper plant and their respective paprikas was quantified in three fractions: (1) beta-carotene, esterified cryptoxanthin, and diesterified zeaxanthin (Y); (2) diesterified capsanthin and capsorubin (R); (3) remaining pigments (B). Although the varieties analyzed vary in pigment richness, the ratio between fractions can be considered constant within the normal limits for natural products. These same ratios were confirmed in paprikas obtained in the laboratory from the fruits analyzed. Thus, this parameter can be used for quality control. Fluctuations outside the set limits may indicate either losses in pigmentation by oxidative processes or enhancement of color with natural or artificial pigments. The suitability of this methodology for quality evaluation and detection of alterations was also tested in four commercial paprikas. The results were compared with those obtained from the most commonly used methods of evaluation in this field (ASTA and STANDARD). 3apaprika 3acolor 3aspectral analysis 0aquality1 aJaren-Galan, M.1 aGarrido-Fernandez, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 Dec., v. 40, no. 12 p.2384-2388x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00024a0123Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02528naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001400139245013900153300001800292500001500310520128800325650002501613650002901638650001001667650001101677650001101688650002201699650002101721650002201742650001301764650002301777650001501800653001101815700001501826700001501841773010301856852000901959856007901968930003302047945001302080946001302093655001202106IND2037330320221118042429.0940215e199212  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203733032DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00024a0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlock, E.10aAllium chemistry: GC-MS analysis of thiosulfinates and related compounds from onion, leek, scallion, shallot, chive, and Chinese chive  ap. 2431-2438.  a2019-12-04  aExtracts of onion (Allium cepa), leek (Allium porrum L.), scallion (Allium fistulosum L.), shallot (Allium ascalonicum auct.), chive (Allium schoenoprasum L.), and Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum L.) were analyzed by GC-MS using wide-bore capillary columns (0.53 mm i.d.) with cryogenic (0 degree C) on-column injection and initial column temperature conditions, slow column heating rates (2-5 degrees C/ min), and GC-MS stransfer line temperatures of 80-100 degrees C.

Limulus polyphemus hemocyanin conjugates were used to immunize rabbits and produced high sera titers (> 10(6); 10(5) serum dilution could be used for assays). Bovine serum albumin coating conjugates were used in competitive enzyme immunoassays (EI) that detected and quantified the major solanidine glycoalkaloids (alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine) in commercial Solanum tuberosum cultivars.

Adsorption isotherms conformed to the Freundlich equation. Soil saturation by Na+ ions produced a strong decrease in acifluorfen adsorption, whereas the opposite finding was observed for Ca-saturated soils. Adsorption was found to be correlated with cation-exchange capacity (CEC) much better than with other soil properties and decreased with increasing pH. At comparable pH, variations of kf values after Ca saturation of soils indicated that complex formation reactions, leading to precipitation of insoluble complexes, contribute to simulate high adsorption. 3acation exchange capacity 3aexchangeable sodium 3aexchangeable calcium 3achemical precipitation 3aacifluorfen 3asoil pH 3aadsorption 0asoil1 aLiu, W.1 aFang, Z.1 aGessa, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1993 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.502-505x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00027a0293Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02515naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245011200158300001600270500001500286520118500301650002501486650002401511650002501535650003401560650003001594650002001624650001901644650001501663653001701678653001901695700001701714700001501731700001701746700001901763700002001782700002001802773010001822852000901922856007901931930003302010945001302043946001302056655001202069IND2037425520221118042323.0940218e199303  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203742552DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00027a0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernando, J.C.10aRapid detection of anticholinesterase insecticides by a reusable light addressable potentiometric biosensor  ap. 511-516.  a2019-12-04  aA light addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS) was used to detect organophosphate and carbamate anticholinesterases (anti-ChEs), using eel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as the biological sensing element. Biotinylated AChE was preincubated with inhibitor or buffer alone and then captured on biotinylated nitrocellulose membrane via streptavidin cross-linking, or AChE was preimmobilized on the capture membrane and then a sample containing the anti-ChE was filtered through the capture membrane. Hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh) by the captured AChE resulted in a strong potentiometric signal, and the immobilized AChE retained its affinity for ACh and anti-ChEs. IC50 values for inhibition of captured AChE obtained by the LAPS agreed with those obtained by a spectrophotometric method or a fiber optic evanescent fluorosensor. Paraoxon and bendiocarb were detected at 10 nM, while higher concentrations were required for monocrotophos, dicrotophos, dichlorvos, phosdrin, diazinon, tetraethyl pyrophosphate, aldicarb, and methomyl. Important features of the LAPS for detection of anti-ChEs are speed (eight samples assayed simultaneously in minutes), precision, and reusability. 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aimmobilized enzymes 3acarbamate pesticides 3aorganophosphorus insecticides 3acholinesterase inhibitors 3aenzyme activity 3apotentiometers 3abiosensors 0ainsecticides 0aimmobilization1 aRogers, K.R.1 aAnis, N.A.1 aValdes, J.J.1 aThompson, R.G.1 aEldefrawi, A.T.1 aEkdefrawi, M.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1993 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.511-516x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00027a0313Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01918naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245005400154300001600208520074700224650000900971650001700980650001900997650002701016650001701043650001201060650001501072650001901087650001201106650001501118650001601133650002301149653001701172700001601189700001401205700001801219773010001237852000901337856007901346930003301425945001301458946001301471655001201484IND2037424520221118042406.0940218e199303  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203742452DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00027a0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParris, N.10aAggregation of whey proteins in heated sweet whey  ap. 460-464.  aAggregation of whey protein after heat treatment was examined for sweet whey prepared from bulk whole milk and milk containing the A, the B, or both variants of beta-lactoglobulin by size exclusion chromatography.

To better understand the environmental signals involved in this pathway, we have investigated the effects of light on the induced expression of phosphoeno/pyruvate carboxylase mRNA and protein in response to stress by 400 millimolar NaCl or 10 micromolar abscisic acid in hydroponically grown plants. When plants were grown in high-intensity fluorescent or incandescent light (850 microeinsteins per square meter per second), NaCl and abscisic acid induced approximately an eightfold accumulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase mRNA when compared to untreated controls. Levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase protein were high in these abscisic acid- and NaCl-treated plants, and detectable in the unstressed control. Growth in high-intensity incandescent (red) light resulted in approximately twofold higher levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase mRNA in the untreated plants when compared to control plants grown in high-intensity fluorescent light. In low light (300 microeinsteins per square meter per second fluorescent), only NaCl induced mRNA levels significantly above the untreated controls. Low light grown abscisic acid- and NaCl-treated plants contained a small amount of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase protein, whereas the (untreated) control plants did not contain detectable amounts of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Environmental stimuli, such as light and osmotic stress, exert a combined effect on gene expression in this facultative halophyte. 3aMesembryanthemum crystallinum 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aenzyme activity 3asodium chloride 3aabscisic acid 3alight 3aosmotic pressure 3astress response 0ainduction1 aBohnert, H.J.1 aThomas, J.C.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 July, v. 99, no. 3 p.1261-1264x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02246naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245016600148300001800314520119400332650002101526650002101547650002101568650002001589650001901609650002001628650002001648653001501668653002401683700001401707700001501721700001701736773007601753852000901829939003301838946001301871655001201884IND9301819720221118042513.0930329e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930181972DNAL7 a166689952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlakeley, S.D.10aExpression of the genes for the alpha- and beta-subunits of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase in germinating and developing seeds from Ricinus communis  ap. 1245-1250.  aVarious tissues from both germinating and developing castor seeds (Ricinus communis L.) have been analyzed for the level of expression of the genes for the alpha- and beta-subunits of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFP). In tissues in which PFP is expressed, there is a single mRNA species of approximately 2 kilobases for each of the subunits. In germinating endosperm, the gene for the alpha-subunit is expressed at an earlier time after imbibition than that for the beta-subunit, whereas in developing castor seed endosperm, both genes are highly and coordinately expressed. During seedling development, there is tissue-specific expression of the two genes. Tissues in which there is a high level of mRNA correspond with tissues in which both subunits of PFP can be detected. The differential expression of the two subunit genes in germinating endosperm does not result in the presence of the alpha-subunit polypeptide in the absence of the beta-subunit polypeptide.

Mean time to pupation in the absence of UV radiation (survival was too low to conduct this analysis for insects exposed to UV) was significantly extended by the addition of either psoralens or B. thuringiensis. Larvae developing on diets containing B. thuringiensis plus psoralens required nearly 40% longer to pupate than controls. but their effects were additive as the interaction was not significant. Although the mean times to adult emergence were significantly different, time spent in the pupal stage did not vary significantly between treatments, indicating that increases in larval developmental time were responsible for the observed decrease in developmental rate. Mean time to mortality, a weighted average time of death, was not significantly affected by any of the treatments. In a 2 X 2 X 2 factorial analysis, all main effects (linear furanocoumarins. B. thuringiensis, UV radiation) reduced survival significantly, as did the three-way interaction. Thus, antagonistic interactions with psoralens that would reduce the effectiveness of B. thuringiensis in the field were not observed. When pairs of main effects were nested within the two levels (presence and absence) of the third factor, several two-way inter-actions were found. Interestingly, the activity of B. thuringiensis and the psoralens, individually or in combination, was enhanced by exposure to UV radiation. Implications of this research are discussed for both natural and agricultural ecosystems. 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aultraviolet radiation 3acoumarins 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3ainsect control 0ainteractions1 aMoar, W.J.1 aBrewer, M.J.1 aCarson, W.G.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1991 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.973-987x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF013956033Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02205naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012700126300001400253520123300267650002801500650001301528650001701541650001901558650001401577650000901591650001701600700002501617700002201642773007801664852000901742856008201751939003301833946001301866655001201879IND4478481020221118042318.0140314e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447848102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Siqun10aFundamentals of Vertical Density Profile Formation in Wood Composites. Part III. MDF Density Formation During Hot-Pressing  ap. 17-25.  aThe formation characteristics of the vertical density profile of MDF are presented herein. Results of laboratory studies indicate that the vertical density profile of MDF is formed from a combination of actions that occur both during compaction and also after the press has reached final position. The methodology, which was used to describe the formation of the density profile for OSB that used two periods and five stages, can also be used to describe the density profile formation of MDF mats. There was a clearer surface layer consolidation stage for MDF mats when compared to OSB mats. At least 58% of the area in an MDF mat was in'spring status' when the press reached 120% of final panel thickness. The observed stress-strain response of MDF mats in hot-pressing with the one-step closing schedule was similar to OSB pressing. This was characterized by a long stress plateau followed by a rapid increase in stress, followed by an immediate reduction in stress after the press reached final position. Compared to OSB hot-pressing, the same pressing schedules (traditional or step-closure) did not result in similar MDF density profiles. It appears that high-density surface layers are easier to create in MDF than in OSB. 3acomposite wood products 3apressing 3ashear stress 3athermodynamics 3athickness 3awood 3awood density1 aWinistorfer, Paul M.1 aYoung, Timothy M.0 tWood and fiber science.g2004 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.17-25x0735-61617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://swst.metapress.com/content/1207423Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140314  aOther US 7aarticle02079naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245007200131300001800203300002600221520123800247650001401485650002001499650001001519650002001529650000801549650002001557653001701577700001701594773007901611852000901690939003301699945000801732946001301740655001201753991627892090742620221118042433.0910315e199010  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910005892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnasuya, A.10aTamarind ingestion and lithogenic properties of urine: study in men  ap. 1109-1117.  ap. 1109-1117. charts.  aIn a controlled metabolic study, a balanced vegetarian diet based on normal ingredients of Indian foods was offered to healthy male adult volunteers. Small quantity of sesame, seeds (20 g/day) was added to the diet, to boost the intake of calcium and oxalate, and thus induce calcium oxalate crystalluria in the subjects. After being on this diet for seven days, urine was collected. Subsequently, an aqueous extract of tamarind fruit (10 gm/day) was included in the above diet for a week. Lithogenic properties of urine before and after ingestion of tamarind were studied and compared. The following changes were observed in the property of urine after consuming the diet containing tamarind extract: complete disappearance of calcium oxalate crystal aggregates; fall in density of crystalluria; reduction in crystal size; decreased excretion of oxalic acid; increased excretion of phosphorus and increased inhibitory activity of urine towards calcium oxalate crystal growth. Studies of this type emphasize the utility of certain natural foods in reducing the calculogenic properties of urine. The method evolved in this study for inducing calcium oxalate crystalluria in man, can serve as a useful model for studies of this nature. 3atamarinds 3acalcium oxalate 3aurine 3abladder calculi 3amen 3avegetarian diet 0acrystalluria1 aSasikala, M.0 tNutrition research.g1990 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.1109-1117x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02384naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245006600129300001600195300002400211520158900235650002001824650001901844650000801863650001001871650001801881653001501899700001701914773007601931852000902007939003302016945000802049946001302057655001202070991627892030742620221118042436.0910208e199008  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910001312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, T.E.10aEvaluation of a questionnaire to measure dietary fibre intake  ap. 847-857.  ap. 847-857. charts.  aSixty-eight subjects completed a dietary questionnaire designed to estimate fibre intake using the original factors from, Barasi et al. (1983) and factors derived independently. Thirty-two of the subjects (14 males and 18 females) kept seven-day weighed dietary records and thirty-six subjects (18 males and 18 females) kept three-day weighed dietary records. The mean daily intake of total fibre from three-day weighed records was 26.7g (n=68) and from seven-day records was 25.8g (n=32). The original questionnaire calculated daily fibre mean for all subjects was 25.1g and for the thirty two subjects who kept seven-day weighed records, was 26.8g. Correlations with the weighed records gave values of 0.66 and 0.71, respectively. Mean daily fibre intakes calculated from the questionnaires using the new factors, was 23.8g (r=0.69) and for the thirty-two subjects was 24.8g (r=0.77). Mean daily fibre intake derived from cereals calculated from three-day weighed records was 15.5g and from seven-day weighed records was 14.7g while that derived from fruit and vegetables was 11.2g and 11.1g for the three-day and seven-day weighed records, respectively. These correlated well with both the questionnaire estimates of cereal and fruit and vegetable fibre intakes. There was no significant difference between the mean daily fibre intakes for the three-day and the seven-day weighed records. It is concluded that questionnaires used to estimate fibre intake are sufficiently accurate, even when used with small samples of thirty subjects, and that fibre intake is relatively constant. 3anutrient intake 3aquestionnaires 3amen 3awomen 3adietary fiber 0aevaluation1 aShepherd, R.0 tNutrition research.g1990 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.847-857x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02109naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245011100135300001800246300002600264520103500290650001101325650002301336650000801359650002001367650002401387650001301411650001401424650002501438650002401463650001001487650001601497653002401513700001701537700001501554773007901569852000901648939003301657945000801690946001301698655001201711991627892010742620221118042553.0910315e199010  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910005862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, P.W.F.10aEffects of age, smoking, drinking, exercise and estrogen use on indices of copper status in healthy adults  ap. 1081-1090.  ap. 1081-1090. charts.  aErythrocyte Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), ceruloplasmin activity (CP) and serum copper concentration (SCu) were determined in normal adult males (n=239) and females (n=145). The effects of age, smoking, drinking frequency, exercise and oral contraceptive use or estrogen replacement therapy on these indices of copper status were investigated. For males, the mean SOD (U/mg hemoglobin +/- SD) was 77.42 +/- 15.7 and for females, 75.7 +/- 19.9. CP and SCu were highly correlated, while no significant relationship between these two indices of copper status and SOD could be detected. Both SCu and CP varied significantly with age in females but not in males. No age-related differences in SOD were found. Estrogen use, both in oral contraceptive preparations by pre-menopausal women and as replacement therapy by post-menopausal women significantly increased both SCu and CP but had no effect on SOD. Smoking, drinking frequency and activity level had no significant effect on any of these parameters of copper status. 3acopper 3anutritional status 3aage 3asmoking (habit) 3aalcoholic beverages 3aexercise 3aestrogens 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aoral contraceptives 3awomen 3aferroxidase 0abiochemical indices1 aL'Abbe, M.R.1 aGiroux, A.0 tNutrition research.g1990 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.1081-1090x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01933naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245006300132300001800195300002600213520102400239650001101263650002901274650001001303650001701313650002301330650001101353653001901364653002801383653002101411653000901432773007901441852000901520939003301529945000801562946001301570655001201583991627891940742620221118042447.0910709e199012  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910020662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattes, R.D.10aDiscretionary salt and compliance with reduced sodium diet  ap. 1337-1352.  ap. 1337-1352. charts.  aThe present study was designed to quantify dietary sodium sources and to monitor compliance with a diet reduced in sodium by proscriptions in table salt alone (group 1) or all discretionary salt (group 2). Individuals receiving no dietary intervention served as controls (group 3). Following a 3-week baseline period, diets were prescribed for 23 weeks, during which intake was measured by multiple 7-day diet records, weighed salt shakers and 24h-urinary collections. Sensory tests were administered to track shifts in salt preference. The principle findings were that 1) discretionary salt contributed little (< 10%) to total sodium intake, 2) total discretionary salt use was stable and precisely defended when the table source was eliminated, and 3) reduced exposure to the salty taste elicited a persistent reduced preference for an array of salty foods. These findings suggest that advice to restrict discretionary salt use to achieve a reduction in salt intake may be ineffectual and possibly counter-productive. 3asodium 3anutritional intervention 3ataste 3afood choices 3apatient compliance 3aadults 0afeeding habits 0asodium-restricted diets 0anutrient sources 0asalt0 tNutrition research.g1990 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.1337-1352x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01871naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245007300131300001800204300002600222520102600248650001501274650002601289650002001315650002401335651001601359653002201375700001801397773007901415852000901494939003301503945000801536946001301544655001201557991627891900742620221118042613.0910315e199010  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910005882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorsley, A.14aThe nutrition information needs of New Zealand general practitioners  ap. 1099-1108.  ap. 1099-1108. charts.  aA random sample of 1000 New Zealand general practitioners were selected to participate in a survey of their nutrition information needs. Three short questionnaires were administered, one to each third of the sample. The response rate was 78%. The results from the first questionnaire will be reported in this paper. The main findings from this subsample showed that most general practitioners wanted more information about a wide variety of nutrition issues (e.g. food allergies, dietary counselling techniques, weight loss, diabetes). Most relied on a variety of sources of nutrition information including several nutritionally unorthodox sources (e.g. the drug industry). Time sparing sources of nutrition information which were favoured by large majorities included text books, videos, seminars and leaflets, charts, specimen diet sheets and diet diaries for patients. The findings are discussed in relation to the time and knowledge limitations of general practitioners and their implications for nutrition promotion. 3aphysicians 3anutrition information 3adietary surveys 3ainformation sources 3aNew Zealand 0ainformation needs1 aWorsley, A.J.0 tNutrition research.g1990 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.1099-1108x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02456naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245009300131300001800224300002600242520146800268650002601736650002401762650002101786650002301807650002401830650002301854650001101877650000801888650002201896700001901918700001501937773007901952852000902031939003302040945000802073946001302081655001202094991627891850742620221118042522.0910709e199012  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910020672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZello, G.A.14aThe design and validation of a diet for studies of amino acid metabolism in adult humans  ap. 1353-1365.  ap. 1353-1365. charts.  aA dietary protocol developed for use in studies of amino acid and protein metabolism is reported in detail. The diet consisted of a mixture of free amino acids, an amino nitrogen-free liquid formula and protein-free cookies. Energy requirement for a group of adult men (n=10) was determined by multiplying each individuals resting metabolic rate, measured by indirect calorimetry, by a factor of 1.7. Subjects maintained a constant weight while consuming the experimental diet and had few complaints regarding palatability during a nine day study period. No significant variation (P=0.69) was evident over a six hour period in measurements of 13CO2 enrichment in the breath of subjects (n=4) consuming small hourly meals of the diet. Dietary adaptation to a constant level of 13C enrichment in breath CO2 with this dietary protocol was accomplished in a short period of time as shown by the lack of change in the mean (+/- SD) 13C enrichments of 0.02764 +/- 0.00084, 0.02818 +/- 0.00067 and 0.02812 +/- 0.00062 atoms percent enrichment in subjects (n=7) on days 3, 6 and 9 of the dietary period, respectively. The small within subject variation in repeated 13CO2 enrichment measurements indicates the reliability of the dietary protocol in studies where a steady isotope background is essential. This dietary protocol provides a constant and stable metabolic milieu for studies of amino acid metabolism, especially, for those involving the use of stable isotopes. 3aamino acid metabolism 3aexperimental design 3aisotope labeling 3aexperimental diets 3aenergy requirements 3anutrition research 3aadults 3amen 3ametabolic studies1 aPencharz, P.B.1 aBall, R.O.0 tNutrition research.g1990 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.1353-1365x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02013naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245010400133300001800237300002600255520105000281650001601331650001301347650002801360650001701388650003201405650001201437651001201449653002001461653002101481700001901502773007901521852000901600939003301609945000801642946001301650655001201663991627891830742620221118042602.0910315e199010  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910005872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbidoye, R.O.10aEffect of kolanut (cola nitida vent) on the anthropometric measurement of newborn babies in Nigeria  ap. 1091-1098.  ap. 1091-1098. charts.  aThe relationship between maternal caffein ingestion (kolanut) during pregnancy and birthweight was investigated in 100 women who delivered at the Lagos Island Maternity Hospital, Nigeria. Factors such as toxemia of pregnancy, preterm delivery, diabetes which could affect birthweight have been excluded from this study. Anthropometric measurements were taken such as weight, head circumference and chest circumference. There was a higher percentage of babies whose mothers took kolanut (71%) who had head circumference (30-35cm). This shows that a significant correlation between kolanut consumption and head circumference. A similar correlation was also seen between caffein (kolanut) consumption and the chest circumference. It was also found that 47% of the mothers who ingested kolanut during pregnancy did so to control nausea while in 53% it was habitual practice. 76% of the respondents consumed kolanut in quantities of 13-91 grams weekly.

Some evidence of an adaptation process in subclinical protein-energy malnutrition  ap. 1213-1221.  ap. 1213-1221. charts.  aAnthropometric measurements were taken from 14 preschool children from families with a rather high socio-economic status in Bangkok and from 14 age-matched village preschool children suffering from or just recovering from subclinical protein energy malnutrition (PEM). Subclinical malnutrition was defined as -2.00 standard deviation (SD) score and below, of weight for height based on an internationally used North American standard from the US National Centre for Health Statistics. The SD scores weight for height and height for age were calculated. The medians of SD scores for both indicators of the nutritional status were found to be statistically significantly lower for the Khon Kaen children compared to their Bangkok counterparts. The serum proteinase inhibitor, alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha-2-M) concentration was found to be statistically significantly higher and 3-Methylhistidine (3MH) excretion per 24 hours urine significantly lower for the village children compared with both variables derived from the urban children. These findings support the hypothesis that, in a marginal nutritional situation, muscle catabolism is influenced to adjust to actual protein, or protein and energy requirements to intake, by slowing down the metabolic rate. Alpha-2-macroglobulin may be directly or indirectly involved in this process; possibly by interacting with the muscle proteases. 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3aglobulins 3aanthropometric measurements 3aurban population 3arural population 3apreschool children 3aThailand 0amethylhistidine1 aSchelp, F.P.1 aVudhivai, N.1 aSupawan, V.1 aMigasena, P.0 tNutrition research.g1988 Nov., v. 8, no. 11 p.1213-1221x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01846naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245010400132300001800236300002600254500001500280520087700295650002001172650001001192650002401202650002301226653001701249653001301266700001601279700001601295700001701311700001501328773007801343852000901421939003301430945000801463946001301471655001201484991627891690742620221118042502.0900402e198912  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900004302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewer, M.M.10aAssessment of postpartum body fat change from underwater weight and skinfold thickness measurements  ap. 1331-1337.  ap. 1331-1337. charts.  a2019-12-05  aPostpartum body fat change was monitored in 11 women using hydrostatic (underwater) weight (UWW) and a combination of triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfold measurements. Overall mean percent body fat (PBF) estimates from UWW and the skinfold sum did not differ. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that 82.2% of the variance in the UWW estimate of PBF was explained by a linear combination of the triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac estimates (P less than 0.01). Simple linear regression models indicated that the suprailiac estimate of PBF was the best single predictor of UWW PBF (P less than 0.001) explaining nearly as much of the variance as the linear combination of the 3 sites. Results suggest that skinfold thickness measurements can serve as a useful clinical tool for monitoring body fat change in the postpartum female under specific conditions. 3ahuman lactation 3awomen 3apostpartum interval 3askinfold thickness 0abody density 0abody fat1 aWozniak, P.1 aBates, M.R.1 aVannoy, L.P.1 aMangum, M.0 tNutrition research.g1989 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.1331-1337x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02115naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245011300130300001600243300002400259520106200283650001301345650002001358650001701378650001701395650002701412650001001439650002101449653002101470700001401491700001301505700001801518700001301536700001501549700001501564773007501579852000901654939003301663945000801696946001301704655001201717991627891650742620221118042321.0891020e198908  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890017492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, T.14aThe relation of dietary selenium to erythrocyte and plasma selenium concentrations in Japanese college women  ap. 839-848.  ap. 839-848. charts.  aIt was examined whether dietary selenium (Se) was correlated with Se levels in erythrocyte and in plasma and with erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px, EC 1.11.1.9.) activities in a group of 25 female college students for a 5-day period.

An attempt has been made to examine the effect of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) on the serum lipids of human nephrotic syndrome patients. This patient group is typically hyperlipidemic, placing the patient at high atherosclerotic risk.

The level of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol were measured at day 0, after 9 days of treatment, and 9 days after supplementation ceased. A significant decrease in serum triglyceride (by 31%) was observed, while there were no overall changes in the total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels. Our results suggest that dietary fish oil supplementation may possibly offer benefit to some nephrotic syndrome patients since triglyceride-lowering is considered to have a protective effect against the development of cardiovascular disease. 3afish oils 3anephrotic syndrome 3ablood lipids 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3adocosenoic acids 3atriacylglycerols 3acholesterol 3adietary supplements 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3adocosahexaenoic acid1 aHaberstroh, B.N.1 aPhilbrick, D.J.1 aHolub, B.J.0 tNutrition research.g1989 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.27-34x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02144naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245012900132300001600261300002400277520110100301650002501402650001401427650002301441650001401464650001501478650000901493650003501502650002301537650002301560700001701583700001601600700001501616773007601631852000901707939003301716945000801749946001301757655001201770991627890900742620221118042436.0900911e199003  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900009742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSindel, L.J.10aNutritional deficiencies associated with vitamin E deficiency in sickle cell patients; the effect of vitamin supplementation  ap. 267-273.  ap. 267-273. charts.  aSeventy-seven patients with sickle cell disease were screened for vitamin E deficiency. Of those, 69% (53) were found to be deficient based on vitamin E levels of less than 12 micromole/L (5 mg/L) or vitamin E to lipid ratios less than 2.3 micromole/g. Riboflavin, zinc and vitamin A status were examined in the vitamin E deficient subjects. Deficiencies in these nutrients were found in 90%, 10% and 76%, respectively. Supplementation with 800 IU of vitamin E daily resulted in a progressive increase in serum vitamin E over a 6 month period. Vitamin A, zinc and riboflavin were supplemented at the RDA level for 3 months in subjects receiving either vitamin E or placebo. Serum vitamin A levels remained unchanged. Zinc levels were increased (p less than 0.01). Measurement of riboflavin did not demonstrate any repletion. This study demonstrates a high incidence of vitamin E, riboflavin and vitamin A deficiencies in patients with sickle cell disease and that repletion with RDA levels of riboflavin and vitamin A are insufficient to raise the status of sickle cell patients to normal levels. 3avitamin deficiencies 3avitamin E 3asickle cell anemia 3avitamin A 3ariboflavin 3azinc 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aclinical nutrition 3anutrition research1 aBaliga, B.S.1 aBendich, A.1 aMankad, V.0 tNutrition research.g1990 Mar., v. 10, no. 3 p.267-273x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02436naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245011600133300001600249300002400265520140800289650001301697650002101710650001001731650001201741650002001753650001301773650001001786653001801796653002201814700001601836700002301852700001801875700001801893773007601911852000901987939003301996945000802029946001302037655001202050991627890850742620221118042423.0900816e199006  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900008442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDale, D. van.10aChanges in sleeping metabolic rate and glucose induced thermogenesis during a diet or a diet/exercise treatment  ap. 615-626.  ap. 615-626. charts.  aAfter 4 weeks of dieting, 4 weeks of frequent exercise training (6 h/wk) were added to a low energy diet of 3.0 MJ/day in 6 out of 12 healthy obese female subjects (aged 30-46 years) in order to compare changes in sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) and glucose induced thermogenesis (GIT). On the basis of BMI and percentage of body fat a diet group (D) and a diet-exercise group were formed (DE). SMR and GIT were both measured during a 36-h stay in a respiration chamber. Weight loss and changes in body composition were similar after 4 weeks of dieting. Adding 4 weeks of physical training for the DE group after 4 weeks of dieting did not result in significant differences between D and DE. SMR decreased significantly after 4 weeks of dieting (D 13%; DE 12%, P less than 0.05), a decrease which was not restored by the addition of 4 weeks of exercise in the DE group. However, compared to the values obtained after 4 weeks of dieting SMR in the DE group tended to increase, which was in agreement with the lower decrease of triiodothyronine (T3) in the DE group (3.5%) compared to the D group (12%). GIT tended to decrease during the first 4 weeks of dieting but a significant decrease in GIT was only demonstrated in the diet-exercise group after 8 weeks. After weight reduction plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin decreased for the D and DE group both during fasting and after a glucose load. 3aexercise 3abasal metabolism 3asleep 3aglucose 3aheat production 3abody fat 3awomen 0aweight losses 0aweight loss diets1 aBeckers, E.1 aSchoffelen, P.F.M.1 aHoor, F. ten.1 aSaris, W.H.M.0 tNutrition research.g1990 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.615-626x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02659naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115245010500128300001600233300002400249520165000273650002301923650001401946650000901960650001501969650001701984650001602001650002002017650002302037650001902060650001302079651001002092700001602102700001702118773007502135852000902210939003302219945000802252946001302260655001202273991627890840742620221118042422.0900816e199005  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900008552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeng, W.10aNutritional status of gestating Chinese women and its influence upon neonates, with emphasis on iron  ap. 493-502.  ap. 493-502. charts.  aOne hundred healthy primiparous pregnant women in Beijing were observed longitudinally from the first trimester to delivery. Sixty-eight healthy nonpregnant females were also observed as controls. The mean hemoglobin and plasma ferritin values in the pregnant women were 11.4 g/dl and 11 ng/ml, respectively, in the second trimester, and 11.3 g/dl and 10 ng/ml in the third trimester. These values were lower than those of the controls (P less than 0.005). The mean free erythrocyte protoporphyrin values were 48 ug/dl and 67 ug/dl in the second and third trimesters, respectively. These values were higher than the value of 38 ug/dl in the controls (P less than 0.005). The incidence of iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency were 34% and 35%, respectively, in the second trimester and 36% and 49% in the third trimester. The values of hemoglobin, red cell count, plasma ferritin, plasma iron, and transferrin saturation were much higher in the newborns than in the mothers. There was a negative correlation between transferrin saturation levels of the third trimester mothers and erythrocyte protoporphyrin values of the newborns (r=-0.41, P less than 0.02). The results of 6-day-record dietary surveys indicated that the intakes of iron and ascorbic acid were higher than those suggested in the Chinese Recommended Dietary Allowances. A stepwise regression process showed that the initial iron status of pregnant women was more important than their nutrient intake to the maintenance of good iron status during pregnancy. We strongly suggest that iron supplements of iron-fortified drinks or foods begin and continue throughout pregnancy. 3anutritional status 3apregnancy 3airon 3ahemoglobin 3ablood plasma 3atransferrin 3anutrient intake 3amaternal nutrition 3apregnant women 3aferritin 3aChina1 aXuencun, C.1 aWenguang, W.0 tNutrition research.g1990 May, v. 10, no. 5 p.493-502x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01879naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245009500131300001800226300002600244500001500270520093000285650000901215650001701224650002301241650002101264650002401285653001801309653001801327700002501345700001801370773007801388852000901466939003301475945000801508946001301516655001201529991627890740742620221118042455.0890310e198812  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890004292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, F.D.10aConsumer characteristics, food related attitudes and consumption of meat and meat products  ap. 1333-1344.  ap. 1333-1344. charts.  a2019-12-05  aConsumer respondents (203) in the metro-Atlanta statistical area answered a detailed questionnaire pertaining to their attitudes and perceptions of different food groups and food uses.

High dietary oxalate levels were fed throughout the study. The fiber sources were fruit and vegetables or their juices and spinach was the source of oxalate. Five minerals and cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, glucose and urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured in fasting plasma and correlated with fecal oxalate, mineral intake and apparent mineral balance.

After 2-days urine collection for measurement of baseline lithium excretion, an oral supplement of 250 micromole lithium was taken daily for 5 days. A further 3 days of 24-h urine collections allowed the decline of urinary lithium to be measured. Urinary excretion of lithium was not different between the two groups; 95.5% of added lithium was recovered in the urine of both groups. Lithium and sodium excretions in 12-h sweat collections were significantly higher in the physically active group than in the non-runners, but were not different within each group between the baseline and supplemental days. Sweat is not an important route of excretion of added lithium, so lithium tagged salt can be used to estimate intake of salt from a specific source but not to monitor the fraction of sodium lost in sweat by physically active people. 3asodium 3anutrient intake 3alithium 3asweat 3aurine 3aexcretion 3aphysical activity 3amen 3alaboratory techniques 0amarkers 0anutrient sources1 aCasey, C.E.1 aJames, W.P.T.0 tNutrition research.g1990 July, v. 10, no. 7 p.717-722x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02209naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245017800139300001600317300003000333520109700363650000901460650001301469650002201482650001701504650002001521650003201541653004001573700001501613700001501628700002001643700001801663700001601681773007501697852000901772939003301781945000801814946001301822655001201835991627888960742620221118042616.0880422e198708  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880002042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollingsworth, J.W.10aImmunodeficiency and lymphocyte ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity in the elderly: a comparison of the effect of a trace mineral supplement (1 USRDA) with high zinc (6.7 X USRDA)  ap. 801-811.  ap. 801-811. ill., charts.  aExtract: The effect of administering a total mineral supplement (TMS) or 100 mg of elemental zinc alone on immune function was studied in 17 normal subjects, aged 66-85. Subjects were given either TMS containing 1 USRDA of zinc, copper, iron, and manganese or 100 mg of elemental zinc alone as zinc sulfate (ZnSO4). Administration of either supplement led to a slight increase in peripheral blood lymphocytes and improved maturation of B-lymphocytes to antibody-producing cells in culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Ecto-5'-nucleotidase, a zinc obligate enzyme of lymphocyte cell membranes, increased when TMS was administered daily but failed to increase when ZnSO4 was administered. Serum zinc levels increased in all subjects receiving the ZnSO4. Only those subjects with low initial serum zinc levels had higher serum zinc levels after 3 months on the TMS. These studies indicate that dietary supplementation with a TMS (1 USRDA) can improve certain in vitro parameters of immune competence in the aged, avoiding the deleterious effects possible with excessive intake.(author) 3azinc 3aimmunity 3aelderly nutrition 3anucleotidase 3aenzyme activity 3adietary mineral supplements 0au.s. recommended dietary allowances1 aOtte, R.G.1 aBoss, G.R.1 aFryberger, M.F.1 aStrause, L.G.1 aSaltman, P.0 tNutrition research.g1987 Aug., v. 7, no. 8 p.801-811x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880422c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02209naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245008800137300001800225300002600243520124800269650002301517650001501540650001501555650001301570650002001583650001301603700001801616700002001634700001701654700001701671700001801688773007801706852000901784939003301793945000801826946001301834655001201847991627888940742620221118042505.0880420e198710  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880001972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStockberger, R.A.10aVitamin B-6 status of children undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis  ap. 1021-1030.  ap. 1021-1030. charts.  aExtract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the vitamin B-6 status of children undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and to determine the renal and peritoneal clearance of vitamin B-6 in these children.

Dialysate total protein and serum alkaline phosphatase were also measured and a three day dietary record was obtained. Plasma PLP was measured in six subjects one year following the first study after they had been receiving daily pyridoxine supplements for one year. Mean plasma total vitamin B-6 and PLP were 304 and 25.5 nM, respectively, in the first study. The mean ratio of plasma PLP/total vitamin B-6 was 0.146. Mean plasma PLP in supplemented subjects was 60.4nM. Renal and dialysate clearance of vitamin B-6 was 0.41 and 0.90 mls/min, respectively. Mean dietary intake of vitamin B-6 was 59% of the RDA. CAPD treated children appear to be deficient in vitamin B-6 although dialysate losses are minimal. Pyridoxine supplements of at least 2 mg/day are necessary to increase plasma PLP to normal concentrations in these children.(author) 3anutritional status 3apyridoxine 3aperitoneum 3adialysis 3arenal clearance 3achildren1 aParrott, K.A.1 aAlexander, S.R.1 aMiller, L.T.1 aLeklem, J.E.1 aJenkins, R.D.0 tNutrition research.g1987 Oct., v. 7, no. 10 p.1021-1030x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880420c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01891naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245007100132300001600203300002400219520104000243650000801283650001001291650002301301650001301324650001801337700001501355700001401370700001401384700001801398773007401416852000901490930003301499945000801532946001301540655001201553991627888410742620221118042315.0880906e198805  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880029462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, A.10aCaffeine reduces spontaneous energy intake in men but not in women  ap. 553-558.  ap. 553-558. charts.  aExtract: The present study was conducted to determine whether a sex difference exists in the short-term adaptation of energy intake following caffeine consumption. To investigate this phenomenon, spontaneous food intake was measured on two occasions in young men (n = 10) and women (n = 10). At the beginning of the sessions, subjects randomly consumed 300 mg caffeine or a placebo 30 min before they had free access to various foods. Following the ingestion of caffeine, energy intake was reduced by 21.7% in men in comparison to their control situation (816 +/- 221 vs 1043 +/- 209 kcal, p less than 0.05). On the other hand, caffeine had essentially no effect on energy intake in women (603 +/- 205 vs 625 +/- 208 kcal, p greater than 0.10). This demonstration of a sex dimorphism in the short-term adaptation of energy intake in response to caffeine is consistent with the concept that women tend to preserve their body energy stores more than men when they are exposed to factors activating the sympathetic nervous system.(author) 3amen 3awomen 3agender differences 3acaffeine 3aenergy intake1 aMasson, E.1 aLeduc, S.1 aHoude, A.1 aDespres, J.P.0 tNutrition research.g1988 May, v. 8, no. 5 p.553-558x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02272naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245012300133300001800256300002300274520125300297650001301550650001301563650001401576650001201590650001301602650001701615650001701632650001201649700001901661700001701680700001501697700001701712700001601729773007801745852000901823939003301832945000801865946001301873655001201886991627888140742620221118042406.0880420e198710  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880001982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrisson, G.R.10aBlood somatotropin response to oral D-fructose and D-glucose during prolonged moderate exercise in trained adult males  ap. 1099-1102.  ap. 1099-1102. ill.  aExtract: The anti-lipolytic effects of glucose-induced blood insulin rises have prompted athletes to consider the use of fructose, a weak insulinotropic sugar. This study was designed to evaluate the response of substrate-mobilizing blood somatotropin (GH) during prolonged exercise on a cycle ergometer while given oral D-fructose. Seven healthy male volunteers exercised on an ergometer at 50 +/- 5% VO2 max for 180 min, on three occasions during which they ingested either water (W) only, D-glucose (G), or D-fructose (F) (140 +/- 12 g, diluted at 7% in water, and evenly distributed over the exercise period). Blood glucose significantly decreased during exercise with W but remained stable with G or F ingestion. Decreases in plasma insulin levels were significantly greater with W and F than with G ingestion. Initial response of blood GH was similar under the three treatments. From the 80th min and thereafter, blood GH levels stabilized at a low but identical level for both hexose ingestions, while in subjects receiving W blood GH remained significantly higher until cessation of exercise. It is concluded that F is as efficient as G in preventing blood GH from increasing under prolonged exercise substrate-requiring conditions.(author) 3aathletes 3aexercise 3aingestion 3aglucose 3afructose 3ablood plasma 3asomatotropin 3ainsulin1 aMassicotte, D.1 aPeronnet, F.1 aLedoux, M.1 aBoisvert, P.1 aSenecal, L.0 tNutrition research.g1987 Oct., v. 7, no. 10 p.1099-1102x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880420c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01921naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245007200133300001600205300003000221520100400251650002301255650001501278650001401293650001701307650001801324653002601342700001701368700001601385700001701401700001501418773007501433852000901508930003301517945000801550946001301558655001201571991627888070742620221118042307.0880225e198703  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870029072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallant, M.P.10aPyridoxine and magnesium status of women with premenstrual syndrome  ap. 243-252.  ap. 243-252. ill., charts.  aExtract: Pyridoxine and magnesium status of nine women with premenstrual syndrome was compared with that of ten asymptomatic women. Three-day food intake records were analyzed for selected nutrients in both the pre- and postmenstrual phases. Plasma magnesium was the measure of magnesium status, while plasma pyridoxal phosphate and erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase stimulation were used to evaluate pyridoxine status. Average magnesium intake was significantly higher among controls in the premenstrual phase, but there was no significant difference in plasma magnesium levels between the two groups. Pyridoxine intakes did not differ significantly between groups during either phase of the menstrual cycle, and both groups showed adequate pyridoxine status according to biochemical measures. A significant positive correlation was found between aspartate aminotransferase stimulation and ratings of both anxiety related symptoms (p = 0.078) and fluid retention symptoms (p = 0.0001).(author) 3anutritional status 3apyridoxine 3amagnesium 3aerythrocytes 3atransaminases 0apremenstrual syndrome1 aBowering, J.1 aShort, S.H.1 aTurkki, P.R.1 aBadawy, S.0 tNutrition research.g1987 Mar., v. 7, no. 3 p.243-252x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02233naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001600154245009400170300001800264520097800282650002101260650001501281650001901296650001401315650002101329650000901350650002301359653003501382700001801417700001701435700001501452700001701467700001701484700001701501700001901518773010501537852000901642856007701651930003301728945002501761946001301786655001201799IND4378595920221118042341.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437859592DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05238712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Some PTXs are toxic to experimental animals, whereas others are of much lower toxicity. Pectenotoxin-2, the most abundant PTX from most Dinophysis spp., is rapidly metabolized by most shellfish to a mixture of pectenotoxin-2 seco acid (2) and 7-epi-pectenotoxin-2 seco acid (1). A mixture of 1 and 2 was produced during purification of an extract from in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis of pectenotoxin-2. These were separated by preparative HPLC, and the structure of 1 was confirmed by one- and two-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and LC-MS3 analyses. No toxic changes were recorded in mice injected intraperitoneally with 1 or 2 at a dose of 5000 microgram/kg. PTX seco acids are therefore unlikely to be of consequence to human consumers at the concentrations found in contaminated shellfish. 3adinophysistoxins 3aDinophysis 3aacute toxicity 3abioassays 3atoxicity testing 3amice 3achemical structure 0a7-epi-pectenotoxin-2 seco acid1 aWilkins, A.L.1 aMunday, J.S.1 aMunday, R.1 aHawkes, A.D.1 aJensen, D.J.1 aCooney, J.M.1 aBeuzenberg, V.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1530-1534x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05238713Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle01674naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245004100134300001600175300003000191500008000221520068600301650002300987650001301010650001701023650001001040650002201050650002401072650002001096700002101116700002001137700002101157773007101178852000901249939003301258945000801291946001301299655001201312991627887480742620221118042343.0860127e198312  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860089992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLane, Helen W.10aSelenium status of industrial worker  ap. 805-817.  ap. 805-817. ill., charts.  aSupported by a grant from the Science and Education Administration of USDA.  aSelenium (Se) status and supplementation were examined in a well-defined industrial population of 86 oil refinery workers.

This novel analytical method is based on the derivatization of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of phenolic compounds with 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyldioxaphospholane and the identification of the phosphitylated compounds on the basis of the 31P chemical shifts. Quantification of a large number of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil can be accomplished by integration of the appropriate signals in the 31P NMR spectrum and the use of the phosphitylated cyclohexanol as internal standard.

  1 aCornet, V.10aDevelopment of a fast analytical method for the determination of sudan dyes in chili- and curry-containing foodstuffs by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection  ap. 639-644.  aA simple and fast analytical method for the determination of sudans I, II, III, and IV in chili- and curry-containing foodstuffs is described. These dyes are extracted from the samples with acetonitrile and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector. The chromatographic separation is carried out on a reverse phase C18 column with an isocratic mode using a mixture of acetonitrile and water. An "in-house" validation was achieved in chili- and curry-based sauces and powdered spices. Depending on the dye, limits of detection range from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg in sauces and from 1.5 to 2 mg/kg in spices. Limits of quantification are between 0.4 and 1 mg/kg in sauces and between 3 and 4 mg/kg in spices. Validation data show a good repeatability and within-lab reproducibility with relative standard deviations < 15%. The overall recoveries are in the range of 51-86% in sauces and in the range of 89-100% in powdered spices depending on the dye involved. Calibration curves are linear in the 0-5 mg/kg range for sauces and in the 0-20 mg/kg range for spices. The proposed method is specific and selective, allowing the analysis of over 20 samples per working day. 3acurry 3ahot peppers 3asauces 3apowdered foods 3adyes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3adetection 3afood additives 0asudan dyes 0aphotodiode array detection 0apowdered spices 0achili powder 0acurry powder1 aGovaert, Y.1 aMoens, G.1 aLoco, J. van1 aDegroodt, J.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 8, v. 54, no. 3 p.639-644x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05173913Available from publisher's Web site  a20060512b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/03  aOther US 7aarticle01619naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009300126300001600219520082800235650003701063650001701100650001301117650001601130650001301146653001101159700001701170773008901187852000901276939003301285946001101318655001201329IND9301779620221118042315.0930325e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930177962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, R.K.10aProtoplast-induced curing of bacteriocin plasmid in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 484  ap. 337-341.  aPlasmid-specified traits like lactose metabolism and bacteriocin production could be eliminated from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 484 culture during production and regeneration of protoplasts with lysozyme at the concentration of 300 microgram/ml after 3 h treatment.

It is used for culinary and medicinal purposes and also for fodder in various parts of the world. The hypoglycemic effect of fenugreek seeds and leaves was tested in normal and diabetic subjects. Six protocols A, B, C, D, E and F involved the acute administration (single dose of 25 g of seeds, 5 g of gum isolate and 150 g of leaves) of whole fenugreek seeds, defatted fenugreek seeds, gum isolate, degummed fenugreek seeds, cooked fenugreek seeds and cooked fenugreek leaves to healthy subjects. The rise in plasma glucose after a dose of glucose or meal was prevented by fenugreek seeds. The serum insulin levels were also modified. The reduction in area under glucose curve was greatest with whole seeds (42.4%), followed by gum isolate (37.5%), extracted seeds (36.9%), and cooked seeds (35.1%) in that order. The degummed seeds and fenugreek leaves showed little effect on glycemia. Fenugreek seeds were also administered for 21 days to diabetic subjects. A significant improvement in plasma glucose and insulin responses was observed in these subjects. The 24 hr urinary glucose output and serum cholesterol levels were also reduced.(author) 3adiet 3afenugreek 3aseeds 3aleaves 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3ablood serum 3ainsulin 3acholesterol 3aadults0 tNutrition research.g1986 Dec., v. 6, no. 12 p.1353-1364x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19871009c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02416naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171100001600188245011600204300001800320500010600338520092000444650002001364650001101384650002101395650001001416650002201426650001601448650001801464650001301482650002401495650002001519650001801539650001501557650002601572650003001598653003001628700001401658773010501672852000901777856007701786930003301863945002501896946001301921655001201934IND4378581320221118042218.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858132DNAL7 a10.1021/jf050917n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study presents results of aquatic biotests using four organisms, namely, a water flea, a freshwater alga, a soil alga, and a luminescent bacterium. The tested substances were 10 benzoxazinone derivatives, 3 of them known to be wheat allelochemicals, benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (BOA), 6-methoxybenzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (MBOA), and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA), and 7 identified degradation intermediates and metabolites. For comparison, two commercial pesticide formulations (BAS, Betanal) were tested by applying the same set of biotests. The data set produced could be seen as an ecotoxicological evaluation for effects of allelochemicals against nontarget organisms and as a base for further risk assessment. 3aallelochemicals 3adimboa 3ahydroxamic acids 3awheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3ametabolites 3aecotoxicology 3atoxicity 3anontarget organisms 3aVibrio fischeri 3aDaphnia magna 3amicroalgae 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 0abenzoxazinone derivatives1 aBraun, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1105-1110x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf050917n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02193naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171072001700188100001300205245011800218300001800336500010600354500001500460520056900475650002101044650002501065650002401090650001101114650001801125650001701143650002001160650002401180650001401204650002401218650003201242650002101274650002101295650002201316653001901338653001301357700001601370700001501386773010501401852000901506856007701515930003301592945002501625946001301650655001201663IND4378580620221118042253.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858062DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05091532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Eighty-three pairs of subjects matched for age, hemoglobin (Hb), body surface area, blood lactate and PR values before intervention were randomly assigned to either the treatment or placebo group. The treatment group received 60 mg elemental Fe/day as FeSO4 for 60 days at the commencement of school terms I and II, and the placebo group received sugar tablets for the same time period. Hb levels and PWC parameters were assessed four months apart, at the initiation of the study, 0 month; at the end of school term I, 4th month; at the end of school term II, 8th month; and following a withdrawal of inputs, 12th month evaluation. Results indicated (a) on hematinic supplementation (4th and 8th month evaluations) there was a significant reduction in the pre-exercise and post-exercise blood lactate levels, relative to the placebo and baseline values, (b) clearcut benefit on PR values was observed in post-exercise values at 4th month and in pre- and post-exercise values only at 8th month, compared to baseline and placebo values, (c) a drop in PWC at 12th month evaluation indicated a need for continued hematinic dosing for underprivileged school girls, year after year.(author) 3aschool children 3agirls 3airon 3alow income households 3adietary mineral supplements 0awork capacity1 aGopaldas, T.0 tNutrition research.g1988 Feb., v. 8, no. 2 p.145-154x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880701c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02022naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245008500169300001600254500001500270520094500285650001101230650002101241650001701262650001601279650002601295650000901321650002201330650001901352653001701371773010301388852000901491856007701500930003301577945002501610946001301635655001201648IND4377603420221118042241.0060203e20060125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437760342DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052123e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The characterizations of their molecular structures were also performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and infrared absorption spectrometry. As a result, these samples were revealed to inhibit the serine and cysteine proteinases chymotrypsin and papain (K(i) = 10(-6)-10(-4) M). The optimal inhibitory pH values of the P and B samples were observed to be approximately 5.5 and 5.0, respectively. The analyses of their UV-vis absorption spectra and infrared absorption spectra indicated that they would be a kind of humic substance. The mass spectrometry analyses showed that they possessed relatively small heterogeneous molecules with molecular masses around 692, 845, and 1389 Da for the P sample and around 551, 704, and 909 Da for the B sample. 3apapain 3amolecular weight 3achymotrypsin 3adried fruit 3aproteinase inhibitors 3afigs 3aenzyme inhibition 3aplant proteins 0apurification0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Jan. 25, v. 54, no. 2 p.562-567x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052123e3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060518b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/27  aOther US 7aarticle02659naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001900154245011300173300001600286500001500302520139000317650001701707650001901724650001001743650002401753650001401777650002301791650002101814653002301835653001901858653002601877700002701903700002301930700002401953773010301977852000902080856007702089930003302166945002502199946001302224655001202237IND4377602420221118042235.0060203e20060125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437760242DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051913l2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMacz-Pop, G.A.10aNew flavanol-anthocyanin condensed pigments and anthocyanin composition in Guatemalan beans (Phaseolus spp.)  ap. 536-542.  a2019-12-04  aIt has long been considered that the pigments resulting from direct condensation between anthocyanins and flavanols were formed exclusively during storage and processing, both in plant-derived foods and in drinks. Recently, however, the minor presence of this type of pigment has been shown in different plant extracts, among them beans. In this work we have studied this family of pigments in beans from Guatemala belonging to two distinct species of the genus Phaseolus, confirming the presence of (epi)gallocatechin carbon-carbon linked to the aglycone of delphinidin and (epi)catechin-cyanidin-3-glucoside. Furthermore, for the first time in this foodstuff another three flavanol-anthocyanin condensed pigments formed by the linkage of (epi)catechin with the corresponding aglycones of cyanidin, petunidin, and peonidin have been described. Also, the natural occurrence of anthocyanidins in this matrix has been confirmed in some of the samples analyzed in this work, the majority being components of their anthocyanin composition. The corresponding aglycones of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, and malvidin have been identified as well as two aglycones with identical mass to those of peonidin and petunidin, but with different retention times, which leads to the supposition that they are probably methylated derivatives of cyanidin and delphinidin, respectively. 3aanthocyanins 3afood chemistry 3abeans 3aPhaseolus coccineus 3aflavonols 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3afood composition 0acondensed pigments 0aplant pigments 0achemical condensation1 aGonzalez-Paramas, A.M.1 aPerez-Alonso, J.J.1 aRivas-Gonzalo, J.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Jan. 25, v. 54, no. 2 p.536-542x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051913l3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060518b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/27  aOther US 7aarticle01600naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002800115245010000143300001800243300002600261520070800287650002300995650002001018650002901038650003201067650001301099651001101112700002201123773007801145852000901223939003301232945000801265946001301273655001201286991627886320742620221118042239.0871008e198611  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870020052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez-Richmond, J.A.10aEffect of an integrated nutrition-primary health care package on nutritional status of children  ap. 1275-1280.  ap. 1275-1280. charts.  aExtract: An integrated nutrition-primary health care project was implemented in a poor Mexican rural mestizo community in order to test a method for the improvement of child health.

M103, enhanced by addition of iron and siderophore production was used as a biofertilizer. The strain was isolated from a colony on the surface root of a rice plant from a rice field in Bangladesh. It showed a marked and immediate increase in nitrogenase activity in response to the addition of iron and also a normal activity (compared with the control) under siderophore production. The addition of iron to iron-limited cultures resulted in a rapid increase in algal iron (11-fold) followed by a marked increase (9-fold) in nitrogenase activity, reaching about 11.8 kg N/ha/crop. This was more than twice the amount of nitrogen usually fixed by the alga during normal growth (controlled conditions), suggesting that pulsing algal inocula with iron would increase the efficiency of algae as a biofertilizer. Indeed, the use of an iron-pulsed inoculum of this strain as a biofertilizer resulted in an increase in the yield of sweetcorn by ca 143% over that produced by the control (no algal inoculation) and to ca a 73% increase over that produced by the normal inoculum (unpulsed with iron). The ability of this strain to produce siderophores has also led to both normal (compared with the control) nitrogenase activity as well as normal growth, which shows a marked contrast to other circumstances where the non-siderophore producing strains showed no growth at all. The significance of these observations on the enhancement of biofertilizer technology is discussed. 3aZea mays 3afertilizers 3airon 3aCalothrix 3acrop yield 3aacetylene 3asiderophores 3anitrogenase 3aenzyme activity 0areduction 0agrowth1 aTiwari, D.N.0 tJournal of applied bacteriology.g1992 Oct., v. 73, no. 4 p.286-289x0021-88477nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02408naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245010500131300001800236300003200254520154800286650001001834650000901844650002601853650003201879650001501911651001001926700001701936773007801953852000902031939003302040945000802073946001302081655001202094991627886230742620221118042244.0880617e198711  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880013792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashyap, P.10aHematinic supplementation and hematological status of underprivileged school girls (8-15 yrs of age)  ap. 1127-1138.  ap. 1127-1138. ill., charts.  aExtract: Effect of hematinic dosing with FeSO4 (60 mg elemental iron), for 60 days at a stretch, twice in a school year on the hematological status was investigated. Eighty-three pairs of subjects initially matched for age, Hb status, dietary energy, proteins, iron and ascorbic acid intakes were randomly assigned to either the treatment or placebo group. Data were collected four months apart at baseline (0 month); mid evaluation (4th month); final evaluation (8th month); and post final evaluation (12th month), following a withdrawal of inputs. Prevalence of anemia was near universal (90% by WHO norm of 12 g/dl) prior to supplementation and was reduced to 30% after two prophylactic treatments at the 8th month. Further, RCM examination at the initiation of the study, indicated that anemia was primarily of iron deficiency origin. Mean Hb values of the hematinic supplemented group rose from 10.28 +/- 0.14 g/dl at 0 mth, to 11.6 +/- 0.14 g/dl at 4th month, to 12.33 +/- 0.09 g/dl at 8th month and dropped to 10.66 +/- 0.12 g/dl at 12th month evaluation. For the placebo group the values remained practically stationary at baseline values. Comparative iron status values measured by serum iron, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation for hematinic treated and placebo group subjects at 8th month were 87.93 vs 59.17 mcg/dl; 388.03 vs 435.33 mcg/dl; 23.36 vs 14.47% respectively. Results indicated that the prophylactic dose and dosing schedule improved the hematological status of underprivileged school girls.

Sixty-five pairs of subjects initially matched for age, Hb, individual and total CF test scores were randomly assigned to either the treatment or placebo group. Hb levels and CF tests were assessed every four months ie. baseline at the initiation of the study (0 month); at the end of the first school term (4th month); at the end of the second school term (8th month); and following a withdrawal of inputs (12th month). Results of the study indicated that (a) Hb levels in the hematinic treated group were 12.33 +/- 0.09 g/dl as against 10.68 g/dl in the placebo group (b) CF test scores rose in both the hematinic treated and placebo groups with successive testing. Hematinic treated group demonstrated significantly higher scores versus the placebo group in Clerical Task (5.83 vs 4.93), Digit Span (4.75 vs 4.33), Mazes (7.54 vs 6.20) at 8th month evaluation, but not at 4th month evaluation. At 12th month, a significant drop in Mazes score and Total Score was noted. The beneficial effect of a twice-a-year hematinic dosing for subjects under study in tests of CF mainly, concentration, discrimination, perception and visual motor coordination was indicated.

How the use of modern techniques and a multidisciplinary approach can throw new light on a well-known phenomenon: allelopathy  ap. 987-990.  aIn the special section: Fate and toxicity of allelochemicals in relation to environment and consumer.  aA new holistic approach on research into allelopathy was launched in the FATEALLCHEM project. The project was financed by the European Commission in the 5th Framework Programme and involved agronomists, biologists, analytical chemists, organic chemists, environmental chemists, ecotoxicologists, and modelers. Benzoxazinones from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were the main group of compounds studied in the project. The project showed that future assessments of an extensive use of allelopathic crops must include the development of validated analytical methods, considerations of relevant concentrations, studies on soil transformation, ecotoxicological studies on individual compounds and mixtures, evaluation on human and mammal toxicity, and joint effect studies on weeds, insects, and pathogens. The project results clearly showed the relevance of optimizing the exploitation of cereal benzoxazinones. Crop rotation is a very traditional practice, which was given less importance for decades but is now regaining its importance in agricultural practice as a means of controlling weed seed banks and soilborne diseases and pests. When using cereals as catch crops and green manure, the allelopathic properties of the cereals could now be much more extensively exploited, choosing varieties with optimal production of benzoxazinones and optimizing the time of sowing in relation to the formation of bioactive metabolites. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aSecale cereale 3arye 3aallelochemicals 3aallelopathy 3aweed control 3ahydroxamic acids 3aecotoxicology 3abiodegradation 3asoil microorganisms 3aenvironmental fate 3achemical ecology 3acrop rotation 0abenzoxazinones0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.987-990x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051146q3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02440naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245007800174300001600252520130600268650002401574650002801598650001101626650001801637650001101655650001201666650001801678650001601696650001301712650002001725651001901745653001301764700001701777700001901794700001501813773009201828852000901920856005701929939003301986946001102019655001202030IND9301786020221118042237.0930326e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178602DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0885182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickinson, N.M.10aAcclimation of trees to pollution stress: cellular metal tolerance traits  ap. 569-572.  aCell suspension cultures were established from shoot explants of mature trees of Acer pseudoplatanus L. (sycamore) at a site contaminated by aerial deposition of copper and cadmium from metal processing industry, and from the same species at uncontaminated sites. The responses of cell cultures to elevated metal concentrations in growth media differed markedly according to site of origin. Both Cu and Cd, applied singly at concentrations of 10-15 mg l-1 inhibited growth and were toxic to cultures originating from the uncontaminated sites, but not to cultures from the contaminated site. This metal tolerance trait in the cultures from the contaminated site was stable through repeated sub-culturing. It could also be induced in one culture originating from the reference uncontaminated site, by gradually exposing the culture to increasing concentrations of Cu. A reduced level of metal removal from the media was found in tolerant cultures, compared to non-tolerant cultures. The results of these experiments demonstrate the occurrence of an alteration of gene expression in response to pollution stress, suggesting that metal tolerance may be induced within shoot meristems in vivo. It also represents the first example of non-mycorrhizal adaptation to metal toxicity identified in woody plants. 3aAcer pseudoplatanus 3acell suspension culture 3ashoots 3aair pollution 3acopper 3acadmium 3aphytotoxicity 3aacclimation 3aexplants 3astress response 3aUnited Kingdom 0ainjuries1 aTurner, A.P.1 aWatmough, S.A.1 aLepp, N.W.0 tAnnals of botany.g1992 Dec., v. 70, no. 6 p.569-572wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088518  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02870naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245009400170300001600264520178900280650001802069650002502087650002102112650002402133650002102157650001902178650001402197650002602211651001202237653001102249700001802260700001602278773009202294852000902386856005702395939003302452946001102485655001202496IND9301785420221118042314.0930326e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178542DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0885122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoode, J.A.10aProtonemal morphogenesis of the moss Tetraphis pellucida Hedw. in culture and in the wild  ap. 519-530.  aIn axenic culture, the protonemal filaments of Tetraphis pellucida derived from either spores and gemmae, or excised stems and leaves, share a mixture of attributes of chloronemata and caulonemata. Indirect immunofluorescence reveals that the tip cells contain cortical and endoplasmic arrays of microtubules at interphase, and phragmoplasts associated with cell plate formation, but pre-prophase bands are absent. Protonemal plates originate from the same sites as filamentous protonemal side branches or directly from young gemmae or excised stem fragments. These plates have a cylindrical base, the latter producing a single gametophore bud, and a unistratose lamina. The gametophores produce gemma cups in culture with the vegetative life cycle taking approximately 28 d. Gibberellic acid (GA3) has no visible effect on protonemal morphogenesis whereas the auxin naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) suppresses plate and side branch formation. In the presence of kinetin the plates are callus-like and produce supernumerary buds. Abscisic acid (ABA) induces malformed plates and filaments with swollen cells, similar to those found in ageing cultures. Rhizoids are produced in abundance from gametophores and protonemal plates in nature but were never seen in culture. In the wild, rhizoids produce numerous protonemal plates and occasional gametophore buds. The former are the main source of new shoots. The filamentous protonemal phase in nature mainly comprises upright filaments containing one or more abscission cells. The protonemal plates in Tetraphis are homologous with those in the allied genus Tetrodontium but are very different from those in Diphyscium and Sphagnum. Differences between culture and nature are attributed to lower nutrient levels and irradiances in the wild. 3amorphogenesis 3aasexual reproduction 3ain vitro culture 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aplant morphology 3aultrastructure 3aBryopsida 3amosses and liverworts 3aEngland 0agrowth1 aDuckett, J.G.1 aStead, A.D.0 tAnnals of botany.g1992 Dec., v. 70, no. 6 p.519-530wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088512  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01968naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011300124300001600237520115100253650002901404650001601433650001701449650001701466650001801483650000901501700001901510773009601529852000901625939003301634946001101667655001201678IND9301783920221118042345.0930325e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatje, G.10aLimitation of growth and lactic acid production in batch and continuous cultures of Lactobacillus helveticus  ap. 446-449.  aContinuous and batch cultures of Lactobacillus helveticus operated under different conditions were studied with respect to the limitation of growth and lactic acid production by increasing undissociated lactic acid and hydrogen ion concentrations, respectively. In a single-stage continuous culture without pH control a final pH of 3.8 and 65 mM undissociated lactic acid was obtained. In two-stage continuous cultures provided with different growth media and run at different pH values, 65-70 mM free acid was obtained in the second stage. Further batch-culture experiments showed growth limitation at 60-70 mM lactic acid. After growth ceased, production of lactate continued until a lactic acid concentration of about 100 mM was reached, obviously an uncoupling of growth and acid production had occurred. Examining the effect of different concentrations of either lactic acid or hydrochloric acid, added to growing batch cultures of L. helveticus, it was shown that the undissociated lactic acid concentration was responsible for growth limitation and lactic acid production in this organism, whereas the pH value had only an indirect effect. 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3alactic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acell culture 3aculture media 3awhey1 aGottschalk, G.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g1991 Jan., v. 34, no. 4 p.446-449x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01377naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006900126300001600195520055400211650001500765650001800780650001300798650001700811650001700828650002000845653001300865700001800878700001800896773009600914852000901010939003301019946001101052655001201063IND9301784020221118042158.0930325e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShlomai, P.10aProduction of carotene stereoisomers by Phycomyces blakesleeanus  ap. 458-462.  abeta-Carotene stereoisomers, mainly all-trans and to a small extent 9-cis, may be produced by the fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus under normal fermentation conditions.

The genes identified encode three subunits of the cytochome oxidase, apocytochrome b, nine subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase complex (nad1 to 7, nad4L and nad9), three Atpase subunits (atp6, atp9, atp1 (also referred to as atpA)), three ribosomal RNAS (5 S (rrn5), small subunit (srn) and large subunit (lrn) RNA), 26 tRNAs, and 13 ribosomal proteins. A total of five group I introns reside in lrn and cox1, two of which include intronic open reading frames (ORFs). Five free-standing ORFs longer than 60 codons are present. Three of these ORFs are counterparts to genes encoding proteins of unknown function in plant mitochondria (orf25 and orfB of angiosperms and or244 of liverwort), whereas two of them are unique. Mitochondrial genes are encoded on both DNA strands in a way that suggests the existence of two transcription units, each including approximately one half of the mitochondrial genome. The two intergenic regions in which transcription is believed to initiate and terminate are about ten times longer than the other intergenic regions (1118 and 1993 nt versus 100 to 150 nt). A total of 29 recurring sequence motifs (30 to 200 nt long) have been found in intergenic regions. Nine different types of motifs are present, most of them arranged as tandem repeats. These motifs may be implicated in transcription, e.g. as signals for initiation, termination and/or processing. Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of the cox1 gene strongly suggested that P. wickerhamii and plant mitochondrial genomes are monophyletic. The finding of plant-specific mitochondrial genes such as orf25, orf244, orfB and rrn5 in P. wickerhamii mitochondria corroborates this idea. 3astructural genes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aalgae 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3achromosome mapping 3aintrons 3arepetitive sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistry 2aGenetic Code 2aGenome 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aProtothecaxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aRNA, Transferxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0aalgae and seaweeds 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u029701 aPlante, I.1 aLang, B.F.1 aKuck, U.1 aBurger, G.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1994 Mar. 18, v. 237, no. 1 p.75-86x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02490naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010900146300001600255520104000271650001201311650001701323650001101340650002701351650002501378650001701403650002201420650001201442650003601454650001801490650003701508650001101545650002801556650002201584650002801606650003001634650003001664650006101694650002601755653002401781700001801805700001801823773008901841852000901930930003301939945001301972946001101985655001201996IND2040413320221118042406.0940621e19940304enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204041332DNAL7 a81209062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinberg, S.10aFitting the structurally diverse animal mitochondrial tRNAs(Ser) to common three-dimensional constraints  ap. 982-989.  aWe propose three-dimensional models for animal mitochondrial (amt) tRNAs lacking the D-domain based on consideration of universal constraints on tRNA to maintain functionality. The available tRNA sequences are classified into two groups, and distinct models are proposed for both classes derived from common structural features. The distance between the anticodon and the acceptor stem is comparable in the models and corresponds to that observed in conventional tRNAs. This fact averts the problem of how a shorter mitochondrial tRNA could function within the context of a protein synthesis machinery suited to full-sized tRNAs. In the models, the angle which defines the relationship between the helical domains composed of the acceptor/T-stem and the anticodon/D-stem is greater than in conventional tRNAs. These structures resemble more a "boomerang" than an "L". However, even in the boomerang model, the inner surface of tRNA would be sufficiently uncluttered to avoid steric clashes when two tRNA molecules cohabit the ribosome. 3aanimals 3atransfer RNA 3aserine 3amolecular conformation 3anucleotide sequences 3amitochondria 3acomputer graphics 2aAnimals 2aAnticodonxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMitochondriaxchemistry 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPan troglodytesxgenetics 2aRNA, Transfer, Serxchemistryxclassificationxgenetics. 2aSea Urchinsxgenetics 0acomputer simulation1 aGautheret, D.1 aCedergren, R.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1994 Mar. 4, v. 236, no. 4 p.982-989x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03639naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245006100147300001800208500001500226520149900241650002301740650001401763650002201777650002501799650002201824650001401846650001901860650003001879650002401909650001201933650002401945650004501969650004502014650001802059650002502077650006702102650002302169650004202192650002502234650002902259650003002288650002402318650001502342650002002357650003502377650001102412650002802423650003602451650003802487650003302525650003602558650003602594650005102630650003102681653001602712653001302728653001302741653002902754773009202783852000902875930003302884945001302917946001102930655001202941IND2040410020221118042337.0940621e19931220enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204041002DNAL7 a79033992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaverie, J.M.10aDetecting frame shifts by amino acid sequence comparison  ap. 1140-1157.  a2019-12-05  aVarious amino acid substitution scoring matrices are used in conjunction with local alignments programs to detect regions of similarity and infer potential common ancestry between proteins. The usual scoring schemes derive from the implicit hypothesis that related proteins evolve from a common ancestor by the accumulation of point mutations and that amino acids tend to be progressively substituted by others with similar properties. However, other frequent single mutation events, like nucleotide insertion or deletion and gene inversion, change the translation reading frame and cause previously encoded amino acid sequences to become unrecognizable at once. Here, I derive five new types of scoring matrix, each capable of detecting a specific frame shift (deletion, insertion and inversion in 3 frames) and use them with a regular local alignments program to detect amino acid sequences that may have derived from alternative reading frames of the same nucleotide sequence. Frame shifts are inferred from the sole comparison of the protein sequences. The five scoring matrices were used with the BLASTP program to compare all the protein sequences in the Swissprot database. Surprisingly, the searches revealed hundreds of highly significant frame shift matches, of which many are likely to represent sequencing errors. Others provide some evidence that frame shift mutations might be used in protein evolution as a way to create new amino acid sequences from pre-existing coding regions. 3asequence alignment 3aevolution 3acomputer analysis 3aamino acid sequences 3acomputer software 3adetection 3apoint mutation 2aAdenosine Triphosphatases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAromatasexgenetics 2aAspartate Carbamoyltransferasexgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aCarbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing)xgenetics 2aCatalasexgenetics 2aCholine O-Acetyltransferasexgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aDihydroorotasexgenetics 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aFrameshift Mutation 2aGenes, env 2aHIV-2xgenetics 2aHerpesvirus 1, Humanxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultienzyme Complexesxgenetics 2aMutS DNA Mismatch-Binding Protein 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgenetics 2aReceptors, Adrenergicxgenetics 2aRetroviridae Proteinsxgenetics 2aRibonucleoside Diphosphate Reductasexgenetics 2aSequence Analysisxmethods 0acomparisons 0amutation 0amatrices 0aamino acid substitutions0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1993 Dec. 20, v. 234, no. 4 p.1140-1157x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03630naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012800145300001600273500001500289520185600304650002102160650002802181650001302209650002902222650002102251650001202272650001802284650001402302650003002316650002102346650003802367650003102405650003402436650002802470650004102498650003102539650001902570650003902589650002302628650002702651653002602678653002302704653003102727653002302758653001402781653002502795653002502820700001902845700002002864773009002884852000902974930003302983945001303016946001103029655001203040IND2040409320221118042323.0940621e19931220enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204040932DNAL7 a82639452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContursi, C.10aFunctional dissection of two promoters that control sense and antisense transcription of Drosophila melanogaster F elements  ap. 988-997.  a2019-12-05  aDrosophila melanogaster F elements are members of the super-family of LINEs mobile repeated DNA sequences that lack LTRs and propagate by the reverse transcription of unit-length RNA intermediates. The F 5' end region harbors two promoters [F(in) and F(out)] that transcribe in a convergent manner. Each promoter has been functionally dissected by assaying in D. melanogaster cultured cells templates carrying base substitutions and/or deletions across the +1 to +245 region of the element F12. F(in), that likely controls the synthesis of gene products and transposition intermediates, is internal to the transcribed region. Two elements play a major role in F-sense transcription. The proximal element spans the interval +6 to +14 and includes a major RNA start site. Heterologous DNA featuring a nearly identical purine-pyrimidine sequence can functionally replace the initiator-like module only when properly spaced from downstream F sequences. The distal element is within the interval +18 to +46 and may correspond to a motif (AGACGTTT, +34 to +41) conserved in other Drosophila LINEs. F(out) is a TATA-less promoter that directs transcription predominantly from three nearby sites (a to c). F(out) expression is influenced by multiple elements located upstream of residue -68 relative to site a as +1 within a region (alpha) shown to stimulate the D. melanogaster hsp70 promoter in an orientation and position-independent fashion. Changes within the -43 to +24 interval may suppress or stimulate transcription from sites a and c. Initiation from a site approximately 30 nucleotides upstream of site a is enhanced by alterations of the interval -43 to -5. The expression of the two F promoters, determined by the interaction of the transcriptional machinery with distinct DNA sequences, is influenced by a common element within the alpha region. 3aretrotransposons 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3amutation 3atranscription (genetics) 3apromoter regions 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Line 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDNA, Recombinant 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxchemistry 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aRNA, Antisense 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aTemplates, Genetic 2aTranscription, Genetic 0af sense transcription 0agenetic regulation 0along interspersed elements 0ainternal promoters 0adeletions 0anucleotide sequences 0arepetitive sequences1 aMinchiotti, G.1 aDi Nocera, P.P.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1993 Dec. 20, v. 234, no. 4 p.988-997x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03473naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245011800142300001600260500001500276520185600291650002702147650002802174650004002202650002902242650002802271650001202299650002102311650002002332650002802352650002402380650001202404650006602416650003802482650003302520650002802553650003802581650003902619650001202658653002102670653002202691653001602713653001502729653002702744700001602771773009002787852000902877930003302886945001302919946001102932655001202943IND2040420920221118042250.0940621e19940114enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204042092DNAL7 a82892732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, M.P.10aLinker insertion mutagenesis of Drosophila topoisomerase II: probing the structure of eukaryotic topoisomerase II  ap. 436-447.  a2019-12-05  aThe sequences of all type II DNA topoisomerases, and possibly some of their key structural features. are conserved. The N-terminal and middle regions of the eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II are homologous to the bacterial gyrase subunits B and A, respectively, and the hydrophilic C-terminal region is more divergent among these enzymes. To gain further insights into the, structure of eukaryotic topoisomerase II, we constructed 23 linker insertion mutants of Drosophila DNA topoisomerase II. These mutant proteins were expressed in a heterologous yeast system, in which we have previously demonstrated that Drosophila DNA topoisomerase II could be functionally expressed and complement yeast top2 mutations. The linker insertion mutants were characterized genetically by testing for complementation of yeast top2ts mutation at the non-permissive temperature and complementation of yeast top2 null mutation using a color sector assay. We also partially purified the mutant proteins and examined their enzymatic, activity by unknotting the P4 knotted DNA. There appears to be a good correlation between the in vivo and in vitro activities. There, are nine fully active, six partially active, and eight negative linker insertion mutants. All five linker insertion mutants in the C-terminal region are active and two linker insertion mutants located in the junction of the two regions homologous to gyrB/gyrA subunits are also active. In addition. we also mapped the trypsin-sensitive sites in Drosophila DNA topoisomerase II. The C-terminal region is extremely sensitive to trypsin digestion. Another major trypsin-sensitive site is located between Lys406 and Thr407, which is near the protease sites also observed in the bacterial gyrB subunit and yeast topoisomerase II. We discuss the possible structural and functional implications of these results. 3agenetic transformation 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenetic complementation 3amutants 3aDNA conformation 3aenzyme activity 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aDNA Topoisomerases, Type IIxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDrosophilaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertionalxmethods 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aTrypsin 0adna modification 0ainsertion mutants 0amutagenesis 0aisomerases 0amolecular conformation1 aHsieh, T.S.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1994 Jan. 14, v. 235, no. 2 p.436-447x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03089naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008900126300001600215520207100231650002202302650001102324650000902335650003102344650001702375650002702392650001402419650002502433650001802458653001302476653001302489653001302502700001502515700001802530773008902548852000902637930003302646945001302679946001102692655001202703IND2040351420221118042711.0940617e19931205enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204035142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovejoy, B.10aCrystal structure of canine and bovine gramulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)  ap. 640-653.  aThe crystal structures of recombinant canine and bovine granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) have been determined by X-ray crystallography, using molecular replacement with recombinant human G-CSF as a model. G-CSF is a member of the cytokine family of glycoproteins that stimulate the differentiation and proliferation of blood cells. Human, bovine and canine G-CSF all have a molecular mass of about 19 kDa and share an amino acid sequence, identity of about 80%. Two crystal forms of canine G-CSF have been solved. Form I recombinant canine G-CSF (rcG-CSFI; space group C2) contains one molecule in the asymmetric unit while form II canine G-CSF (rcG-CSFII; space group P2(1)) has two molecules in the asymmetric, unit and bovine G-CSF (rbG-CSF; space group P2(1)2(1)2(1)) contains one molecule in the asymmetric unit. rcG-CSFI has been refined to an R factor of 20.7% with data to 2.3 angstrom resolution and rcG-CSFII has been refined to an R factor of 19.3% with data to 2.2 angstrom resolution. rbG-CSF has been refined to an R factor of 21.3% with data to 1.7 angstrom resolution. The structure of human, canine and bovine G-CSF is an antiparallel 4-alpha-helical bundle with up-up-down-down connectivity. With the exception of one highly exposed loop (residues 66 to 74), the human, canine and bovine structures are very similar to each other. Using our series of G-CSF crystal structures we developed a function that describes the probability that a particular residue position (i) contributes to a G-CSF receptor binding site based on two principles, (1) high sequence conservation in the primary sequence human, bovine, canine and murine G-CSF and (2) conservation of high solvent accessibility in the human, bovine and canine crystal structures. On the basis of this probability function as well as a comparison of G-CSF to the crystal structure of human growth hormone (hGH) complexed with the extracellular domain of the human growth hormone receptor (hGHbp), residues that contribute to potential G-CSF receptor binding sites are identified. 3aX-ray diffraction 3acattle 3adogs 3acolony-stimulating factors 3agranulocytes 3amolecular conformation 3areceptors 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 0apdb/1bgc 0apdb/1bgd 0apdb/1bge1 aCascio, D.1 aEisenberg, D.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1993 Dec. 5, v. 234, no. 3 p.640-653x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02202naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009800172300001600270500002400286520103800310650001101348650002501359650001401384650002801398650001801426650001001444650001501454651001001469651001101479700001901490700001901509700002001528700002601548700002101574700002001595773012501615852000901740856005501749655001201804IND4461177620221118042529.0110805e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446117762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.2010.00356.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Kuang-Ping10aAntioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities of Pteris multifida Poiret aqueous extract  ap. 252-258.  aIncludes references  aPteris multifida Poiret (Pteridaceae), also known as Fong-Wei-Cao, is the most commonly used material in herb beverages in Taiwan and also used as one of the vegetable resources in Main China. The aqueous extract of P. multifida Poiret (AEPM) was prepared and its antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities were studied. AEPM showed high antioxidant activities by conjugated diene method. At 20 mg/mL, AEPM exhibited high scavenging effects on α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl, ferrous radical (82.5, 80.1 and 85.4, respectively) and reducing power (Abs, 700 nm = 1.03). AEPM has various antioxidant activities that may be due to the different naturally occurring antioxidant components. Practical Applications: Consumers need high-quality herb-beverage products and to understand their potential functions. Our results indicated that the qualities of aqueous extract of P. multifida Poiret possess antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities and this evidence could be regard as the important scientific basis. 3aPteris 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3afree radical scavengers 3afree radicals 3aherbs 3avegetables 3aChina 3aTaiwan1 aShen, Ying-Pei1 aLee, Shui-Huei1 aWang, Tzu-Ching1 aWang-McCall, Tzu-Ling1 aLin, Chung-Ching1 aYang, Chi-Ching0 tJournal of food quality.g2011 Aug., v. 34, no. 4 p.252-258dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2010.00356.x 7aarticle02655naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245007900155300001600234500002400250500001500274520147100289650001201760650001001772650001701782650001401799650001801813650002001831650001301851650000901864650002201873650001001895650002401905650001501929650001001944650001001954651001601964653001601980700002101996700002302017700002202040773008802062852000902150856003802159655001202197IND4446538820221118042606.0101217s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444653882DNAL7 a10.1071/WR100882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Des H.V.10aPrey switching by stoats (Mustela erminea): a supplemental food experiment  ap. 604-611.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aContext Prey switching by invasive carnivorans to changing food supply could severely impact on endemic prey of conservation importance, but experimental evidence for prey switching in carnivorans is rare. Stoats (Mustela erminea) were introduced to New Zealand and now threaten survival of many native birds, reptiles and invertebrates. Aim Our primary objective was to see whether abundant food caused stoats inhabiting an alpine grassland site to alter the rate at which they preyed upon weta (Orthoptera:Hemiandrus sp.), hares (Lepus europeus), birds and mice (Mus musculus). Methods We used dead rabbits as supplemental food in a before-after-control-impact experiment. Stoat scats were collected from a treatment and non-treatment site before and following food supplementation. Percentage frequency occurrence of the different prey types was assessed for the two sites during each experimental phase. Conclusions Stoats ate fewer ground weta and hares, the two most abundant prey types, when supplemental food was added. In contrast, consumption of mice remained relatively stable at both sites throughout the experiment, and the consumption of birds declined at both sites. Implications Our experiment suggests that stoats may continue to eat scarce endemic prey at similar per capita rates even when alternative prey are available. However, endemic prey that are locally or regionally abundant may be indirectly impacted by fluctuations in alternative prey. 3arabbits 3afoods 3aMus musculus 3aingestion 3ainvertebrates 3aMustela erminea 3areptiles 3amice 3afood availability 3aLepus 3adietary supplements 3agrasslands 3abirds 3ahares 3aNew Zealand 0afood supply1 aMøller, Henrik.1 aWilson, Deborah J.1 aMurphy, Elaine C.0 tWildlife research.g2010, v. 37, no. 7 p.604-611dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR10088 7aarticle02522naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245009200158520123300250650002101483650000801504650001401512650000901526650002201535650002201557650001901579650002501598650001401623650001501637651001201652651001501664651001101679651001101690651001101701651001001712651001001722651001201732651002501744651001201769651002101781700001801802700001901820700001601839700001701855773010301872856004401975852000902019655001202028IND60533850820221118042723.0160801s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053385082DNAL7 a10.4454/JPP.V98I2.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Air, M.10aGenetic variability of RNA-1, RNA-2 and RNA-3 of fig mosaic virus isolates from Tunisia  aA brief account is given of the genetic variability of Fig mosaic virus (FMV) in Tunisia. The analysis of 10 isolates from different fig cultivars and areas of the country has shown nucleotide sequence identities ranging between 90-99% in RNA-1 (302 bp analyzed), 93-99% in RNA-2 (234 bp) and 96-100% in RNA-3 (304 bp). These identity levels decreased to 86%, 90% and 93% for RNA-1, -2 and -3, respectively, when isolates from other geographical areas were included in the analysis. In the phylogenetic tree constructed with partial sequences of RNA-3 of 34 different FMV isolates (13 from this study and 21 from GenBank), the isolates separated into four distinct clades according to their geographic origin: clade I included isolates from Turkey and Israel; clade II included isolates from North America (California and Canada), Japan and Turkey; clade III grouped all Tunisian isolates and those from other Mediterranean countries (Italy, Algeria, Lebanon and France); and clade IV included only Serbian isolates. The preliminary comparative analysis conducted on three RNA segments of FMV highlighted that RNA-3, which codes for the viral nucleoprotein, is the most conserved, being subjected to a strong negative selection. 3aFig mosaic virus 3aRNA 3acultivars 3afigs 3agenetic databases 3agenetic variation 3anucleoproteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aprovenance 3aAlgeria 3aCalifornia 3aCanada 3aFrance 3aIsrael 3aItaly 3aJapan 3aLebanon 3aMediterranean region 3aTunisia 3aTurkey (country)1 aMahfoudhi, N.1 aDhouibi, M.

Among the 24 isolates collected from two localities (Selenča and Gornji Tavankut), classical bacteriology tests, pathogenicity, as well as genetic methods based on PCR for syrB gene and DNA sequencing with four housekeeping genes (MLSA), were performed allowing identification of 10 isolates as P. syringae pv. syringae and 14 isolates as P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 1.

The associated fungal pathogen was isolated and identified as Sclerotium rolfsii on the basis of morphological characters and sequence analysis of ITS region of rDNA. The sequences shared 100% similarity with reliable sequence of S. rolfsii retrieved from GenBank. The detached leaf assay produced leaf blight symptoms seven days after inoculation. S. rolfsii known to infects a wide range of host plants including forest tree species.

Phoma novae-verbascicola causes light brown necrotic spots on the leaves of V. blattaria seedlings. In order to demonstrate the seed transmission of this pathogen, several V. blattaria seeds belonging to three samples collected in 2013, were tested in vitro to detect the presence of P. novae- verbascicola. Two samples were found to be contaminated and colonies of the pathogen were isolated from the tested seeds. Phoma novae-verbascicola was identified from the morphological features observed in vitro and through an ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) analysis. The virulence of one isolate was confirmed by means of a pathogenicity test. This work demonstrates that P. novae-verbascicola can be transmitted by affected V. blattaria seeds. 3aPhoma 3aVerbascum blattaria 3aflowers 3agardens 3ain vitro studies 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amoths 3apathogens 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3avirulence1 aOrtu, G.1 aGullino, M.

The method was used to accurately detect the effects of the construction of a diversion dam in 2003 on annual and seasonal maximum and minimum daily flows in the Manouane River, Quebec, Canada, measured from 1980 to 2014. The Lombard method yields results that are nearly identical to results obtained using the monitoring (Kruskal-Wallis test) and long-term trend (Mann-Kendall test) methods. The Lombard method revealed a shift in mean values of annual and seasonal minimum daily flows in 2003, the year the dam was built. This shift is sharp for all four seasons. The dam induced a significant decrease in minimum daily flows in all four seasons. As far as maximum daily flows are concerned, unlike the monitoring method, the Lombard method detected a significant decrease only in the mean values of annual and spring maximum daily flows. This decrease occurred two years prior to the construction of the diversion dam. Instead, this decrease is interpreted to be the result of a significant decrease in spring precipitation after 1997. These hydrological changes are different from those induced by other types of dams in Quebec.  aPublisher supplied data 3adams (hydrology) 3ahydrology 3amonitoring 3arivers 3aspring 3aQuebec0 tWater.g2016 Sept. 21, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w80904103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006400172300001600236520083700252592002801089650002501117650001101142650000901153650001201162650001001174650002301184650001401207650001401221650000901235650001001244653001001254653002301264653002001287653002301307653002701330653001201357653001701369653002501386653001501411700002201426773011001448856008801558961001301646852000901659655001201668IND60479867220221118012752.0160123e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047986722DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.36.2008.Suppl.B.502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeslie, John F.10a<i>Fusarium graminearum</i> : When species concepts collide  ap. 609-615.  aSpecies in fungi can be defined by reference to species concepts based on morphology, ecology, biology and phylogenetics. <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> , an important pathogen of wheat, barley, rice and maize has been subjected to analyses based on all four of these concepts.

In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data were used to obtain aeolian desertification land distribution in Northern China. Aeolian desertification land distribution from 2001 to 2015 was used to analyze the spatiotemporal change in this area. Results show that aeolian desertification situation of 70 counties is expanded with low slope values and 250 counties is reversed. Aeolian desertification situation in most areas is improved in recent 15 years. Gravity center of the aeolian desertification has a trend to move towards the direction of the high latitude and low longitude. It moves towards north about 0.06° and west about 2.2° from 2001 to 2015. The main distribution area is between 90–100°E, 30– 40°N and altitude which less than 2000 m in desert and steppe climate zone. Aeolian desertification is worsening in recent 5 years around rivers and lakes. In recent years, the government has made great efforts to strengthen ecological construction with positive effect, but we still need to pay more attention to environment deterioration of rivers, lakes and the nearby areas in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a201504420cForestry Public Benefit Scientific Research Special Project of PR China  a31670706cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31600585cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3adesertification 3alakes 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asteppes 3aChina1 aJia, Zhiqing1 aLi, Qingxue1 aZhao, Anzhou1 aZhang, Zhaojiang1 aZhao, Yuling0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2018 Oct., v. 46, no. 10 p.1555-1561dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-018-0793-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013300157300001600290520151400306592002801820650002801848650001801876650001201894650001501906650001701921650001301938650001301951650001501964650000901979650001801988650001002006650001702016650003002033650001702063650004402080650001402124650002202138650000902160650000902169650001502178650001202193650001002205700001902215700001302234700001902247700001602266700001702282700001802299773011902317856007402436852000902510655001202519IND60666758420221119004647.0190919e20141128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066675842DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra07215d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Linlin12aA ¹H NMR-based metabonomic investigation of time-dependent metabolic trajectories in a high salt-induced hypertension rat model  ap. 281-290.  aHigh salt-induced hypertension (HT) is an increasingly relevant health issue. However, the molecular mechanism of the metabolic transformation in HT development remains largely unknown. Features of the time-dependent metabolic transfer during HT onset and development should describe crucial aspects of HT phenotypes and may allow early prevention. To investigate the progression of HT and identify potential biomarkers, the metabolic profiles of urine, plasma, and fecal extracts of HT rats fed a high salt diet were investigated using a ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics approach. In this study, the profiles at the 4th and 8th weeks for urine and fecal extracts could be classified, which revealed progression axes from normal status to HT status. Changes in succinate, α-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG), citrate, creatine and creatinine, choline, phosphocholine (PC) and glycerophosphocholine (GPC), trimethylamine-N-oxide and betaine, taurine and hippurate in urine, in conjunction with gut flora disturbance in feces were observed during the initial stage of HT (6th week). During the severe HT period (8th week), these metabolic changes became more pronounced, and the metabolic disturbance in plasma lipid and choline indicated a possible increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Thus, an increase in dietary salt can induce a series of metabolic changes, and ¹H NMR-based metabonomics offers a non-invasive means to elucidate the progression of HT induced by this dietary pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3aanimal models 3abetaine 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3acitrates 3acreatine 3acreatinine 3adiet 3aeating habits 3afeces 3ahypertension 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylcholine 3arats 3arisk 3atable salt 3ataurine 3aurine1 aZheng, Lingyun1 aLuo, Ren1 aZhao, Xiaoshan1 aHan, Zhihui1 aWang, Yaling1 aYang, Yongxia0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 28, v. 5, no. 1 p.281-290dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra07215d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013000164300001600294520144800310592002801758650001301786650001501799650001501814650000901829650002501838650001501863650002001878650001301898650001301911650002301924650001501947650001501962650001501977650002101992650002902013650001802042650002202060700002102082700002202103700001902125700001902144700002002163773012902183856007802312852000902390655001202399IND60518230820160506000000.0160409e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051823082DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2015000172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFink, Jessé R.10aPhosphorus adsorption and desorption in undisturbed samples from subtropical soils under conventional tillage or no‐tillage  ap. 198-205.  aThe dynamics of P in soil is greatly influenced by the adsorption of phosphate onto Fe‐oxides. Access of phosphate to the surface of these minerals depends on the degree of soil aggregation, which in turn is influenced by soil management system. The primary purpose of this work was to investigate P adsorption and desorption in undisturbed and disturbed soil samples from an Ultisol (Rhodic Paleudult) and an Oxisol (Humic Hapludox) under conventional tillage (CT) or no‐tillage (NT). Phosphorus adsorption and desorption in undisturbed soil was studied by using a continuous flux system containing a P solution for adsorption measurements or deionized water and Mehlich‐I solution for desorption measurements. The Oxisol, which had higher clay, hematite, and goethite contents than the Ultisol, exhibited the highest maximum P adsorption capacity (Pₘₐₓ) values in disturbed samples. Also, the disturbed Ultisol samples had lower Pₘₐₓ values under NT than under CT. The undisturbed soil samples exhibited no significant differences in P adsorption between soil management systems, but P desorption was more marked under NT than under CT. The samples of Oxisol under NT exhibited lower P adsorption rates and higher P desorption rates than the CT samples of the same soil. The decreased P adsorption in undisturbed samples relative to disturbed samples suggests that P adsorption is influenced by physical properties of soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHapludox 3aPaleudults 3aadsorption 3aclay 3aconventional tillage 3adesorption 3adisturbed soils 3agoethite 3ahematite 3amanagement systems 3ano-tillage 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3asoil aggregation 3asoil physical properties 3asoil sampling 3asubtropical soils1 aInda, Alberto V.1 aBavaresco, Jovana1 aBarrón, Vidal1 aTorrent, José1 aBayer, Cimélio0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2016 Apr., v. 179, no. 2 p.198-205dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2015000173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013200166300001200298520175200310592002802062650000902090650001502099650001802114650001702132650001402149650000902163650001202172650001102184650001702195650001602212651001302228700001802241700002702259700007702286700002302363773015202386856008302538852000902621655001202630IND60794529220221121192525.0220930e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079452922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-10460-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucas, Kengni10aEvaluation of the purification capacity of soils: case of the Kouogouo and Djeleng V quarters in Bafoussam City (West Cameroon)  ap. 825.  aThis work aimed at evaluating the purification capacity of the Kouogouo and Djeleng V quarters’ soils (West Cameroon). Soil mapping was carried out, from which representative soil samples were collected, followed by their physical, chemical, and hydrodynamic characterization. Two types of effluents were identified, characterized, and subjected thereafter to filtration into these soil samples. The filtrates were then analyzed, in view of evaluating the performance of these soils through influent-effluent indicator level (physico-chemical parameters and fecal coliforms). The main results show four soil units in the study area, among which the indurated red brown clay soils and red clay loam soils with rock fragments were dominant, with 51.8% and 35.4%, respectively. The clayey texture was dominant (94.7%). These soils were classified as neutral to slightly acidic (5.83 to 7.19), while the permeability values ranged from 25.59 to 0.014 cm/h. Moreover, the hydrologic balance indicated a surplus of about 989.3 mm, which can contribute to the recharge of the water table at low depth, traditionally supplying wells and sources of drinking water, but also potentially to their pollution by the influx of organic and mineral matter. Two types of effluents were identified: these are latrines and domestic waste. They had contrasted physico-chemical and bacteriological pollution potentials, but sufficient to have a harmful effect on the population, compared to the WHO standards. The persistence of coliforms in some filtrates confirmed that water was exposed to pollution by the previous effluents and argued in favor of the installation of a safety distance between potential sources of pollution and water supply on the other hand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3afiltration 3ahydrodynamics 3apermeability 3apollution 3asoil 3atexture 3awastes 3awater supply 3awater table 3aCameroon1 aPaul, Tematio1 aJoël, Noukimi Yannick1 aIlalie, Manefouet Kentsa Bertille1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4163-86011 aAdoua, Njueya Kopa0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Nov., v. 194, no. 11 p.825-825dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10460-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011100163300001600274520101100290592002801301650001601329650001401345650001001359650001401369650001401383650001401397650000901411650001601420650001401436650001101450653001001461653002201471653002401493653000901517653002401526700002601550700001801576700002201594700002001616773012201636856007701758852000901835655001201844IND60550807820221120084343.0220422e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055080782DNAL7 a10.1556/004.2016.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJankowiak, Hanna10aCorrelation of carcass meat content with development of the reproductive system in sexually immature gilts  ap. 380-389.  aThis study evaluated the correlation of carcass meat content with the development of the reproductive system in sexually immature gilts of Polish Large White (PLW) and Polish Landrace (PL) breeds. The results, obtained from three groups (I, II, III) of gilts differing in lean meat percentage, indicate an effect on fattening and slaughtering traits as well as on the morphometric characteristics of the uterus. There were statistically significant differences in the values of fattening and slaughtering traits in the groups of gilts tested. Studies on the relationship between morphometric characteristics of the reproductive system and carcass meat content showed that there was a correlation between the weight of the uterus with and without the broad ligament and the meat content of the carcass. The weight of the uterus was higher (P ≤ 0.05) in gilts with lower meat content. The negative influence of high gilt meatiness on development of the reproductive system was more pronounced in PLW gilts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3afinishing 3agilts 3alandraces 3alean meat 3aligaments 3ameat 3amorphometry 3aslaughter 3auterus 0aGilts 0alean meat content 0amorphometric traits 0apigs 0auterine development1 aKapelański, Wojciech1 aBocian, Maria1 aSoltész, Angéla1 aBalogh, Péter,0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2016 Sept., v. 64, no. 3 p.380-389dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/004.2016.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245023000204300001600434520218500450592002802635650001302663650002402676650001502700650001702715650001502732650002102747650003002768650001302798650001002811650001702821650001602838650001402854650001902868650002202887650001102909651000902920651000902929651001602938651001002954653001402964653002202978700002503000700002903025773010203054856008203156852000903238655001203247IND60662835220221120113055.0191129e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066283522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2019.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlotz, Werner1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1104-561310aMiddle East Caridina (Decapoda: Atyidae): Redescription of C. fossarum Heller, 1862, description of three new species, and remarks on the status of C. syriaca Bouvier, 1904 and C. babaulti basrensis Al-Adhub & Hamzah, 1987  ap. 161-185.  aThe most species-rich genus, Caridina, of the shrimp family Atyidae is broadly distributed throughout five biogeographic realms, with the Indo-Malayan realm being the centre of its distributional range. Due to the scarcity of studies, very little is known regarding the Middle East species, which are placed on the north-western edge of the genus’ distribution. Numerous museum specimens from across the entire range of Caridina in the Middle East were thus analysed using morphological characters and mitochondrial sequences (16S) in order to gain insight into the biodiversity of the genus in the region. Consequently, the present study describes three new atyid species of the genus Caridina H. Milne Edwards, 1837, Caridina enbilului sp. nov., Caridina enkii sp. nov. and Caridina shahrazadae sp. nov. from freshwater habitats of Syria, Iraq and Iran respectively. Furthermore, Caridina fossarum Heller, 1862 is redescribed, while the taxonomic status of Caridina syriaca Bouvier, 1904 and Caridina babaulti basrensis Al-Adhub & Hamzah, 1987 is discussed and the latter synonymized with Caridina fernandoi Arudpragasam & Costa, 1962. C. shahrazadae sp. nov. differs from its congener C. fossarum by the reduced branchial formula of the latter species, the absence of an appendix interna at the endopod of the male's first pleopod, and the lack of a prominent sexual dimorphism on the propodus of the third and fourth pereiopods. C. enbilului sp. nov. differs from C. fossarum in the same characters as C. shahrazadae sp. nov., while from the latter species C. enbilului sp. nov. is different in showing a distinct tooth on the pterygostomial margin of the carapace, by a well-developed arthrobranch on the first pereiopod, a well-developed podobranch on the second maxilliped and a more slender endopod of the male's first pleopod. C. enkii sp. nov. can be distinguished from C. fossarum by the more developed sexual appendages of male specimens as well as more slender pereiopods. In addition, the genetic analysis supports the existence of multiple species in the Middle East, while their phylogenetic relationships and their geographic distribution are described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDecapoda 3aIndo-Malayan region 3aappendages 3abiodiversity 3afreshwater 3agenetic analysis 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3amales 3amitochondria 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aredescriptions 3asexual dimorphism 3ashrimp 3aIran 3aIraq 3aMiddle East 3aSyria 0aCrustacea 0afreshwater shrimp1 avon Rintelen, Thomas1 aChristodoulou, Magdalini0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2019 Nov., v. 283 p.161-185dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2019.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014900168506010400317506007600421520188600497592002802383506003702411650001002448650001502458650001102473650002502484650001302509650002202522650001602544650001202560651001702572653002602589653001702615653002302632653003202655653002002687700001302707700001702720700001502737700001702752773010502769856008702874852000902961655001202970IND60767127120221207055727.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076712712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1060792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Shuping10aDecomposition of water vapor flux divergence and its application to a blizzard event over Ili Valley in Central Asia during 30 Nov to 1 Dec 2018  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCentral Asia is experiencing an increase in the occurrence of extreme flood events while still featuring in scarce precipitation. These extreme events are governed by weather systems of various scales as well as complex terrain effects. It is therefore difficult to analyze and forecast precipitation with traditional methods. In this study, an approach is designed by decomposing water vapor flux divergence (Qᵥᵃˡˡ) under model's terrain following coordinates following the Helmholtz theorem. The traditionally used but important variable for depicting anomalous precipitation, Qᵥᵃˡˡ, is partitioned into three components, i.e., flow divergence (Qᵥᵈⁱᵛ), moisture advections by large-scale motion (Qᵥᴸ) and by sub-synoptic motion (QᵥS). Applications to a blizzard event occurred over Ili Valley during 30 Nov to 1 Dec 2018 is performed as an example. The eastward water vapor flux brings moisture from Balkhash Lake to Ili Valley during the entire precipitation event, while Qᵥᵃˡˡ fails to indicate the initiation and weakening of precipitation. Temporal and spatial evolutions of the three decomposed components are analyzed with comparison to precipitation on both windward slope and lee side. Qᵥᵈⁱᵛ with dominant magnitude always converges no matter precipitation intensifies or weakens, and therefore leads to false moisture aggregation signals in Qᵥᵃˡˡ. The other two components, Qᵥᴸ and QᵥS, converge prior to precipitation and diverge or weaken before the event ends. Besides, Qᵥᴸ performs better than QᵥS on windward slope and shows moisture transport from upper levels while QᵥS achieves better on lee side. Future applications of this flow decomposition approach may thus extend to improving precipitation predictions with negligible computational costs over complex topography in other places around the world.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amoisture diffusivity 3aresearch 3atopographic slope 3awater vapor 3aweather 3aCentral Asia 0aExtreme precipitation 0aCentral Asia 0aFlow decomposition 0aWater vapor flux divergence 0aComplex terrain1 aCao, Jie1 aZhao, Haijun1 aZhou, Xuan1 aRan, Lingkun0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 June 01, v. 270 p.106079-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1060793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012100170300001800291520152400309592002801833650000801861650001201869650001801881650001801899650001501917650001301932650001401945650001201959700001901971700002601990773010202016856008502118852000902203655001202212IND60569458720221122173725.0170530e20170530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056945872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.7b001232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Andrew
T.10aStructure and Dynamics of the Tetra-A Loop and (A-A)-U Sequence Motif within the Coliphage GA Replicase RNA Operator  ap. 2690-2700.  aThe three-dimensional structure of a RNA hairpin containing the RNA operator binding site for bacteriophage GA coat protein is presented. The phage GA operator contains the asymmetric (A-A)-U sequence motif and is capped by a four-adenine (tetra-A) loop. The uridine of the (A-A)-U motif preferentially pairs with the 5′-proximal cross-strand adenine, and the 3′-proximal adenine stacks into the helix. The tetra-A loop is well-ordered with adenine residues 2–4 forming a 3′ stack. This loop conformation stands in contrast to the structure of the 5′-AUUA loop of the related phage MS2 operator in which residues 1 and 2 form a 5′ stack. The context dependence of the (A-A)-U sequence motif conformation was examined using structures of 76 unique occurrences from the Protein Data Bank. The motif almost always has one adenine bulged and the other adenine adopting an A-U base pair. In the case in which the (A-A)-U motif is flanked by only one Watson–Crick base pair, the adenine adjacent to the flanking base pair tends to bulge; 80% of motifs with a 3′ flanking pair have a 3′ bulged adenine, and 84% of motifs with a 5′ flanking pair have a 5′ bulged adenine. The frequencies of 3′- and 5′-proximal adenines bulging are 33 and 67%, respectively, when the (A-A)-U motif is flanked by base pairs on both sides. Although a 3′ flanking cytidine correlates (88%) with bulging of the 5′-proximal adenine, no strict dependence on flanking nucleotide identity was identified for the 5′ side.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aadenine 3abinding sites 3acoat proteins 3acoliphages 3acytidine 3adatabases 3auridine1 aTran, Michelle1 aNikonowicz, Edward P.0 tBiochemistry.g2017 May 30, v. 56, no. 21 p.2690-2700dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.7b001233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245021700166300001800383520152900401592002801930596005601958650001102014650001602025650001602041650001502057650001102072650001502083650001902098650001502117650002902132651001002161700001902171700002202190700001802212773014402230856008102374852000902455655001202464IND60614255520221121134109.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061425552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-018-0810-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Md Soyeb10aAssessment of Land Surface Subsidence Due to Underground Metal Mining Using Integrated Spaceborne Repeat-Pass Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) Technique and Ground Based Observations  ap. 1569-1580.  aDifferential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is a novel remote sensing technique to measure earth surface deformation. It is capable of obtaining dense information related to the deformation of a large area efficiently, economically and effectively. Therefore, DInSAR is a promising technology for monitoring the earth surface deformation related to some natural hazardous events, such as earthquake, volcano eruption, land subsidence, landslide. In present study, Conventional DInSAR technique have been applied to a mineral rich zone, coming under the Khetri copper belt, a part of Northern Aravali range of hillocks in India, predominant with mining activities since late 1960’s to address the possibility of deformation phenomena due to hard rock underground metal mining. Four interferometric SAR data sets of Radarsat-2 was used for the study area to address the subsidence/uplift phenomena. Further, results obtained from conventional DInSAR technique using Radarsat-2 data sets compared with results obtained from ground based observation technique for its validity. In both the techniques, deformation results obtained in terms of average subsidence rate in mm (quarterly basis) of points under study within mining zone of Mine-A has well agreed to each other. Further, it has been observed that average subsidence rate in mm (quarterly basis) obtained from space based observation and ground based observation are 5.6 and 6.67, respectively over the points under study in mining zone of Mine-A.  aPublisher supplied data  aFRS(89)/2014-15/MEcINDIAN SCHOOL OF MINES, DHANBAD 3acopper 3adeformation 3aearthquakes 3alandslides 3amining 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3asubsidence 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aIndia1 aDheeraj Kumar,1 aChatterjee, R.

This study focuses on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where low rainfall, high rate of growth and agricultural development are resulting in a dramatic depletion of groundwater resources and an increased dependence on desalination. A water budget for the region was developed. It represents the variations in groundwater storage as a balance of total precipitation, desalinated water and evapotranspiration. The components of the water budget are obtained from ground observations, documented information, models and remote sensing data, using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to estimate changes in groundwater storage and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data to obtain precipitation and soil moisture respectively. Results show a negative trend of 0.5 cm/year in groundwater levels corresponding to an average decrease of 0.86 km3/year during the study period (2003 to 2012). This negative trend indicates that the aquifers are not being recharged fast enough to compensate for human withdrawals. Most of the precipitation was found to be lost through evapotranspiration. A discussion of the current water budget components is presented and propositions are made for a sustainable use of water resources in the UAE, including a more efficient use of recycled water. This analysis is applicable to other Gulf countries and it can help to determine the optimal allocation of water resources to optimize agricultural productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural productivity 3aaquifers 3aarid zones 3adesalination 3aeconomic development 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3apopulation growth 3arain 3arecycled water 3asatellites 3asoil water 3aspatial data 3awater budget 3awater table 3aUnited Arab Emirates1 aOuarda, Taha B.

The increasing concern with respect to the use of traditional inorganic electrode materials on resources and environmental issues has strongly inspired scientists to search for green energy electrodes. Organic compounds are potentially sustainable and renewable materials as many of them can be obtained from natural products and biomass. Additionally, the properties of organic compounds can be tuned through the modification of the structures as well as the introduction of functional groups. In this review, we summarise recently reported organic electrodes and further classify them into three types (anodes, cathodes and bi-functional electrodes) according to their functions. Moreover, we also highlight the recently reported conjugated ladder polymers, which are believed to be potential high performance electrodes due to their unique conjugated structures, environmental safety, and designing flexibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiomass 3acathodes 3aenergy density 3alithium batteries 3amoieties 3apolymers 3arenewable energy sources1 aZhang, Qichun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 May 11, v. 4, no. 19 p.7091-7106dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta01069e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012100168300001600289500001900305520111400324592002801438596008101466650002401547650001201571650001901583650001501602650001501617650001401632650000901646650001201655650001401667650001401681650001101695650001501706650001901721650001401740651001801754700002001772700002201792700002101814700002201835700001901857700002501876700005701901773014401958856008202102852000902184655001202193IND60717179320221121213847.0201109e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071717932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-020-03008-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimlick, Lauren10aEffects of Environmentally Relevant Residual Levels of Diluted Bitumen on Wild Fathead Minnows (Pimephales promelas)  ap. 699-704.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTransportation of crude oil across North America’s boreal ecozone creates the potential for spills in freshwater where less is known about the sensitivity of resident fish than for marine systems. The sensitivity of wild fathead minnows (FHM) to residual concentrations (ppb range) of the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of diluted bitumen (dilbit) was assessed by exposing them for 21 days followed by a 14 days depuration. Target concentrations were well below detection limits for GC–MS, but were estimated by dilution factor (1:100,000 and 1:1,000,000 WAF:water) to contain less than 0.0003 μg/L of polycyclic aromatic compounds. Confinement and handling stress caused by transfer of wild fish into tanks much smaller than their natural range resulted in mortality and lower body condition among all groups, but interactive effects of oil exposures still resulted in females with smaller cortical alveolar oocytes, and males with larger testicular lobe lumen sizes. Additional studies examining the compounded effects of stress and environmentally relevant oil exposures in wild fishes are needed.  aPublisher supplied data  aSTPGP 493786-16cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aPimephales promelas 3abitumen 3abody condition 3adepuration 3afreshwater 3amortality 3aoils 3aoocytes 3apetroleum 3apollution 3atestes 3atoxicology 3atransportation 3awild fish 3aNorth America1 aPeters, Lisa E.1 aWallace, Sarah J.1 aDettman, Heather1 aBrown, R.

In this study, the RADARSAT-2 observation data over a 4-year period (from November 2010 to September 2014) is used to investigate the trends of land subsidence in the eastern Chaoyang District in Beijing, China, and to analyze the impact of human activities on it. The observation results indicate that the temporal and spatial evolutions trend of land subsidence in this area is uneven, with deformation rates ranging from − 116.52 to 7.1 mm/year. There are two large subsidence areas located in the northern part of the study area, and we find that the groundwater exploitation and deformation rates are strongly linearly correlated. The effect of construction on land subsidence has also been investigated. Over time, land subsidence is generally increased in the study area, with an exception at the Longfor Changying Galleria area, which is under construction during the observation period. Based on the time-series analysis of permanent scattered points in the 200 m buffer area, construction activities are observed to cause both land subsidence and upheaval deformation of the surrounding soil. During the construction period, the displacement of the surrounding soil is disturbed. After completion, the initial displacement of surrounding soil is tended to involve the uplift of the surrounding soil, followed by a gradual subsidence with time.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 41771455/ D010702cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a8182013cBeijing Natural Science Foundation  a025185305000/194cCapacity Building for Sci-Tech Innovation - Fundamental Scientific Research Funds  aNo.16JCZDJC40400cNatural Science Foundation of Tianjin City 3aGalleria 3aconservation buffers 3adeformation 3agroundwater 3ametropolitan areas 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3asubsidence 3atime series analysis 3aChina1 aChen, Beibei1 aGong, Huili1 aGao, Mingliang0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2018 Oct., v. 46, no. 10 p.1657-1665dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-018-0821-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014700169300001600316520212200332592002802454650001302482650001702495650002502512650001102537650001502548650002002563650001502583650001602598650002102614650001902635650001102654650001202665651001002677653003202687653002802719653002802747653002802775653002902803653001802832653002102850653001802871653002202889653001102911700001702922700002102939773012802960856008203088852000903170655001203179IND60620797920221122214357.0181114e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062079792DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-85.2.1592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurya, Ramakant10aTaxonomic Redescriptions and a Review of the Status of Prosorhynchoides spp. (Digenea: Bucephalidae) Infecting Some Freshwater Fishes of India  ap. 159-176.  aSurveys of freshwater fishes of India were carried out during the period 2011–2017.

In this paper we also review the taxonomic status of Indian freshwater Prosorhynchoides spp. We transfer Prosorhynchoides macronius and Prosorhynchoides bagarius (previous name Neobucephalopsis bagarius) to P. fusiformis and accordingly revise the status of other Neobucephalopsis spp. We also transfer Prosorhynchoides sinhai, Prosorhynchoides eutropiichthis, and Prosorhynchoides mauryai (previous name Neobucephalopsis garuai) to P. garuai and consider Prosorhynchoides magnum (Verma, 1936) Srivastava and Chauhan, 1973, as a valid species. We transfer Prosorhynchoides pseudeutropei, Prosorhynchoides aspinosiensis, Prosorhynchoides mehrai, Prosorhynchoides confusus, and Prosorhynchoides minimus, including previous host records, to P. magnum, as these organisms are all similar in their position of organs and are similar in size. In revision, we transfer Prosorhynchoides belonea, Prosorhynchoides lateroporus, Prosorhynchoides gaurii, Prosorhynchoides chauhani, Prosorhynchoides canciliansis, and Neobucephalopsis (Prosorhynchoides) jhansiansis to P. karvei. We consider P. thapari as a valid species and transfer Prosorhynchoides gauhatiensis to P. thapari. A Y-shaped excretory vesicle is absent in adults of Prosorhynchoides spp. reported from India. The Gomti River, India, is a new locality record for both P. fusiformis and P. garuai. Freshwater Batchwa vacha (Eutropiichthys vacha) is a new host record for P. karvei and P. thapari. A key to distinguish adults of nominal Indian freshwater Prosorhynchoides spp. is included.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBagarius 3aBucephalidae 3aEutropiichthys vacha 3aadults 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3aintestines 3amarine fish 3anew host records 3aredescriptions 3arivers 3asurveys 3aIndia 0aProsorhynchoides fusiformis 0aProsorhynchoides garuai 0aProsorhynchoides magnum 0aProsorhynchoides karvei 0aProsorhynchoides thapari 0aBucephalopsis 0aNeobucephalopsis 0aBucephaloides 0afreshwater fishes 0aIndia.1 aGupta, Rahul1 aSaxena, Anand M.0 tComparative parasitology.g2018 July, v. 85, no. 2 p.159-176dThe CCBD practitioner journalwJournal:18529x1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654/1525-2647-85.2.1593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245017200170520179000342592002802132650002402160650001702184650001302201650001002214650001202224650001402236650001202250650003102262650002202293650001102315650004202326650001402368650001002382650002302392650002402415650001802439650002002457650001302477653002402490653002402514653002402538653002002562700001202582700001802594700001502612700001702627700001502644700001302659773009902672856009002771852000902861655001202870IND60662835620221120102401.0201104e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066283562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7344472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jiali10aComparative transcriptome analysis combining SMRT and NGS sequencing provides novel insights into sex differentiation and development in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain)  aThe underlying mechanism of sex differentiation and development remains mysterious concerning the economic crustaceans, hindering the development of mono-sex breeding technology of those species. Gene discovery by next generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely applied in those species without reference genome. Nevertheless, the pivotal molecular differences driving sex dimorphisms before gonad differentiation are largely unknown. Besides, accurate assembly and downstream analysis remain a challenge due to the short-read nature of NGS. Here, we reported a comprehensive long read transcriptome by single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing in an economic crustacean species, mud crab (Scylla paramamosain). Combined with NGS, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were further analyzed and validated between sexes with different gonadal differentiation status. It was demonstrated that the quality of the long-read transcriptome (N50 of unigenes, annotation rate, species-hit accuracy, etc.) was significantly higher than previously assembled transcriptomes. Furthermore, it was founded that narrow transcriptomic differences existed between sexes before gonad differentiation in the mud crab. Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 8 (17β-HSD8) gene involved in steroid biosynthesis was significantly up-regulated in genetic male juvenile crab, suggesting estradiol-17β (E2) may promote female differentiation in the mud crab. Moreover, novel enriched pathways including Hippo signaling pathway were firstly identified to be involved in gonadal development in crustaceans. Our data will not only provide valuable genetic resource for further diverse genetic research, but also help to understand the mechanism underlying sex differentiation and gonadal development of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScylla paramamosain 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding 3acrabs 3aenzymes 3aestradiol 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic variation 3agonads 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ajuveniles 3amales 3asexual development 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 0aScylla paramamosain 0aSex differentiation 0aGonadal development 0aSMRT sequencing1 aShi, Xi1 aFang, Shaobin1 aZhang, Yin1 aYou, Cuihong1 aMa, Hongyu1 aLin, Fan0 tAquaculture.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 513 p.734447-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7344473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245012400205300001600329520140800345592002801753650002201781650003601803650001501839650001501854650001901869650001801888650001101906650001701917650002601934650001301960650002401973650002501997650000902022650000902031650001402040650001402054650002102068650001102089650001402100650002002114650001802134650001302152650001202165650001102177650001102188650002302199650001402222650001502236653002502251653002502276653002302301653001502324653002202339700001302361700001302374700001302387700001602400700001602416700001702432700001802449700001702467700001702484773011802501856008602619852000902705655001202714IND60630960620221119022021.0190516e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063096062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Suiyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9784-269810aValorization of manganese-containing groundwater treatment sludge by preparing magnetic adsorbent for Cu(II) adsorption  ap. 446-454.  aMn-containing sludge from groundwater treatment was converted to magnetic particles (MPs) via a one-step hydrothermal method using sodium ascorbate (SA) as the reductant. The MPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, magnetometry and Gran titration and the results showed that magnetic jacobsite was obtained as an intermediate product in transformation of Fe/Mn oxides to siderite and rhodochrosite. When the molar ratio of SA to Mn in the sludge was two, the produced MPs-2 contained a mixture of ferrihdyrite, hematite, jacobsite and Si/Al oxides, and could magnetize at 2.4 emu/g. Ferrihydrite content in MPs decreased with increase of the SA/Mn molar ratio, leading to decrease of the surface sites concentration (Hs). Thus, MPs-2 contained optimized Hs of 6.7 mmoL/g and a desirable adsorption capacity of Cu(II) (73.1 mg/g). The adsorption isotherms of MPs-2 on Cu(II) complied with the Langmuir model and the adsorption kinetics fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model. The major mechanism of adsorption was cationic exchange of the coordinated H and Na ions on MPs-2 surface sites with the Cu(II) ions. This study was the first time to report preparation of MPs by recycling Mn-containing sludge, which could be used as a high-capacity and low-cost adsorbent in treatment of heavy metal-containing wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3aascorbic acid 3acopper 3aferrihydrite 3agroundwater treatment 3ahematite 3ahot water treatment 3aintermediate product 3aions 3airon 3amagnetism 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3amodels 3arecycling 3areducing agents 3arhodochrosite 3asiderite 3asilicon 3asludge 3asodium 3asorption isotherms 3atitration 3awastewater 0aMn-containing sludge 0aHydrothermal process 0aMagnetic particles 0aAdsorption 0aCationic exchange1 aLin, Xue1 aDong, Ge1 aYu, Yang1 aYu, Hongbin1 aBian, Dejun1 aZhang, Lanhe1 aYang, Jiakuan1 aWang, Xianze1 aHuo, Mingxin0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 236 p.446-454dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007900163300001600242520141600258592002801674650003701702650001201739650002001751650002001771650001801791650001001809650001501819651001101834653001901845653001501864653001301879653001601892653001601908700002001924700001301944700001201957773012401969852000902093856008202102655001202184IND4405239820221117164442.0200513e20080601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440523982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-008-0068-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakker, M. R.10aRoot distribution of Fagus sylvatica in a chronosequence in western France  ap. 176-184.  aThe distribution of fine (<2 mm diameter) and small roots (2–20 mm diameter) was investigated in a chronosequence consisting of 9-year-old, 26-year-old, 82-year-old and 146-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica) stands. A combination of trench wall observations and destructive root sampling was used to establish whether root distribution and total biomass of fine and small roots varied with stand age. Root density decreased with soil depth in all stands, and variability appeared to be highest in subsoil horizons, especially where compacted soil layers occurred. Roots clustered in patches in the top 0–50 cm of the soil or were present as root channels at greater depths. Cluster number, cluster size and number of root channels were comparable in all stands, and high values of soil exploitation occurred throughout the entire chronosequence. Overall fine root biomass at depths of 0–120 cm ranged from 7.4 Mg ha⁻¹ to 9.8 Mg ha⁻¹, being highest in the two youngest stands. Small root biomass ranged from 3.6 Mg ha⁻¹ to 13.3 Mg ha⁻¹. Use of trench wall observations combined with destructive root samples reduced the variability of these estimates. These records showed that variability in fine root distribution depended more on soil depth and edaphic conditions than on stand age, and suggest that trench wall studies provide a useful tool to improve estimates of fine root biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3abiomass 3achronosequences 3acompacted soils 3aroot channels 3aroots 3asoil depth 3aFrance 0aEuropean beech 0aFine roots 0aHardpans 0aSmall roots 0aTrench wall1 aTurpault, M.-P.1 aHuet, S.1 aNys, C.0 tJournal of forest research.g2008 June 1, v. 13, no. 3 p.176-184dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-008-0068-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01998naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008300153300002000236520080900256592002801065650001501093650001601108650001101124650001801135650001301153650000901166650001601175650001501191650001501206650001501221650002101236650002101257650002001278650002301298700001801321700001201339700001801351773012401369856007401493852000901567655001201576IND60664788720221119063948.0190912e20140613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066478872DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra46601a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Le10aFacile production of a large-area flexible TiO₂/carbon cloth for dye removal  ap. 25556-25561.  aThrough the precoating of TiO₂ on carbon fiber sheet and the subsequent hydrothermal reaction of the coated species with NaOH and tetrabutyl titanate, we successfully demonstrated the engineering growth of TiO₂ nanofibers on carbon fiber sheet.

This process involves preparation of modified MWCNTs, sequential deposition of Au and then oxide shells, and finally calcination at high temperature to remove the organics. The obtained samples were characterized by several techniques, including N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), UV-Vis spectra, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results established that all the oxide shells could serve as effective barriers to prevent the migration and aggregation of Au NPs during calcination. Moreover, different oxide layers have an obvious influence on the distribution of Au nanoparticles. Additionally, the prepared catalyst exhibited a mesoporous structure because of the preservation of carbon nanotubes. In our experiments, the catalytic activities of MOₓ/Au/CNTs were investigated by photo-metrically monitoring the reduction of p-nitrophenol (p-NPh) by an excess of NaBH₄. It was found that the prepared TiO₂/Au/CNTs catalyst revealed excellent catalytic activity and the sample could be easily recycled without a decrease of the catalytic activity in the reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aencapsulation 3agold 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3anitrogen 3ap-nitrophenol 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asodium borohydride 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc oxide1 aZhang, Yiwei1 aZhou, Yuming1 aZhang, Zewu1 aSheng, Xiaoli1 aXu, Yuanmei0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 4, no. 93 p.51334-51341dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra07236g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011800169520168700287592002801974650003502002650002002037650002502057650001202082650001302094650001402107650003702121650002002158650001602178650002202194650002202216650001402238650001102252650002302263650001502286650002102301650001202322650002002334650001602354650001902370650001902389650002502408653001902433653001602452653002102468653001902489653000902508653002002517700005302537700001402590700001202604700001502616700001702631700002002648773011202668856008402780852000902864655001202873IND60767127620221120045222.0220222e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076712762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2022.1536402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiao-Hua10aGR24-mediated enhancement of salt tolerance and roles of H2O2 and Ca2+ in regulating this enhancement in cucumber  aThis study investigated the regulation of the exogenous strigolactone (SL) analog GR24 in enhancing the salt tolerance and the effects of calcium ion (Ca²⁺) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) on GR24's regulation effects in cucumber. The seedlings were sprayed with (1) distilled water (CK), (2) NaCl, (3) GR24, then NaCl, (4) GR24, then H₂O₂ scavenger, then NaCl, and (5) GR24, then Ca²⁺ blocker, then NaCl. The second true leaf was selected for biochemical assays. Under the salt stress, the exogenous GR24 maintained the ion balance, increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, reduced the membrane lipid peroxidation, and increased the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), accompanied by a decrease in relative conductivity, an increase in the proline content, and elevated gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), salt overly sensitive SOS1, CBL-interacting protein kinase 2 (CIPK2), and calcineurin B-like protein 3 (CBL3). Such protective effects triggered by GR24 were attenuated or almost abolished by ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), lanthanum chloride (LaCl3, Ca²⁺ channel blocker), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, NADPH oxidase inhibitor), and dimethylthiourea (DMTU, hydroxyl radical scavenger). Our data suggest that exogenous GR24 is highly effective in alleviating salt-induced damages via modulating antioxidant capabilities and improving ionic homeostasis and osmotic balance and that H₂O₂ and Ca²⁺ are required for GR24-mediated enhancement of salt tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acalcium 3acatalase 3acucumbers 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alanthanum 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aperoxidase 3aplant physiology 3aproline 3aprotein kinases 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astrigolactones 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aStrigolactones 0aIon balance 0aOxidative stress 0aCalcium signal 0aH2O2 0aGene expression1 aMa, Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2107-03101 aZhang, Lu1 aSu, Min1 aWang, Juan1 aZheng, Sheng1 aZhang, Teng-Guo0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2022 Mar., v. 270 p.153640-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2022.1536403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014800163300001800311520119300329592002801522650000801550650001501558650002001573650002601593650002901619650001301648650001901661650001901680650001401699700001501713700001701728700001601745700005501761700005301816773012801869856008401997852000902081655001202090IND60627021020221117223607.0190128e20181220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062702102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b046382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei10aPerylene Derivative/Luminol Nanocomposite as a Strong Electrochemiluminescence Emitter for Construction of an Ultrasensitive MicroRNA Biosensor  ap. 1516-1523.  aIn this work, an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) biosensor was constructed on the basis of amino-modified 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride/luminol (PTC-NH₂/Lu) nanocomposite as emitter and bipedal DNA walker signal amplification strategy for ultrasensitive detection of microRNA-21 (miRNA-21). The PTC-NH₂/Lu nanocomposite was prepared as signal tag via π–π stacking molecular assembly, in which amino-modified 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTC-NH₂) as a novel coreaction accelerator significantly enhanced the ECL emission of luminol-H₂O₂ system. Moreover, target miRNA-21 triggered bipedal DNA walker was powered by toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction (TSDR) for signal amplification. Consequently, the proposed ECL biosensor achieved ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-21 with a linear range from 100 aM to 100 pM and a limit of detection of 33 aM. Simultaneously, the biosensor was also successfully applied to detect target miRNA-21 in lysates from human cancer cells. As a result, this work constructed a new signal amplification platform, exhibiting great application potential in biomedical analysis and early clinical diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3amicroRNA 3ananocomposites 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms1 aChen, Anyi1 aLi, Shengkai1 aPeng, Kanfu1 aChai, Yaqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4392-95921 aYuan, Ruo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3664-62360 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Dec. 20, v. 91, no. 2 p.1516-1523dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b046383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04162naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002000167245014200187300001600329520178700345592002802132650002402160650002102184650001902205650001702224650001502241650001402256650002102270650000902291650001002300650001302310650001902323650001702342650001802359650001102377650002502388650001802413650001202431650001402443650001202457650004302469650002402512650002402536650003902560650002302599650003202622650002002654650003802674650001302712650004502725650002802770650002202798650002702820650001402847650004002861650004202901650003202943653000702975653000802982653000802990653000802998653001203006653001303018653001303031653001603044653000903060653002403069700001903093700002003112700001803132700001703150773007403167856008203241852000903323655001203332IND60099032020221116204511.0161021e20130225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009903202DNAL7 a232323562pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.11.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyun, Tae Kyung10aComputational identification and phylogenetic analysis of the oil-body structural proteins, oleosin and caleosin, in castor bean and flax  ap. 454-460.  aOil bodies (OBs) are the intracellular particles derived from oilseeds. These OBs store lipids as a carbon resource, and have been exploited for a variety of industrial applications including biofuels. Oleosin and caleosin are the common OB structural proteins which are enabling biotechnological enhancement of oil content and OB-based pharmaceutical formations via stabilizing OBs. Although the draft whole genome sequence information for Ricinus communis L. (castor bean) and Linum usitatissimum L. (flax), important oil seed plants, is available in public database, OB-structural proteins in these plants are poorly indentified. Therefore, in this study, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis including analysis of the genome sequence, conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships to identify OB structural proteins in castor bean and flax genomes. Using comprehensive analysis, we have identified 6 and 15 OB-structural proteins from castor bean and flax, respectively. A complete overview of this gene family in castor bean and flax is presented, including the gene structures, phylogeny and conserved motifs, resulting in the presence of central hydrophobic regions with proline knot motif, providing an evolutionary proof that this central hydrophobic region had evolved from duplications in the primitive eukaryotes. In addition, expression analysis of L-oleosin and caleosin genes using quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that seed contained their maximum expression, except that RcCLO-1 expressed maximum in cotyledon. Thus, our comparative genomics analysis of oleosin and caleosin genes and their putatively encoded proteins in two non-model plant species provides insights into the prospective usage of gene resources for improving OB-stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aRicinus communis 3abioinformatics 3acastor beans 3acotyledons 3adatabases 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflax 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bodies 3alipid content 3alipids 3anucleotide sequences 3aoilseed crops 3aoleosin 3aphylogeny 3aproline 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astructural proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCastor Beanxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aConserved Sequence 2aFlaxxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenomics 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificity 2aOrganellesxmetabolism 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 0aOB 0aOLE 0aCLO 0aTAG 0aOleosin 0aCaleosin 0aOil body 0aCastor bean 0aFlax 0aExpression analysis1 aKumar, Dhinesh1 aCho, Young-Yeol1 aHyun, Hae-Nam1 aKim, Ju-Sung0 tGene.g2013 Feb. 25, v. 515 p.454-460dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.11.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013500155300001800290520124300308592002801551650002401579650001401603650001401617650002401631650001901655700001401674700001601688700001801704700001301722700001801735773014201753856007401895852000901969655001201978IND60641762720221120232509.0190506e20160426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064176272DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta01092j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Dandan12aA NiCo/NiO–CoOₓ ultrathin layered catalyst with strong basic sites for high-performance H₂ generation from hydrous hydrazine  ap. 6595-6602.  aThe exploration of non-noble-metal recyclable catalysts for high efficiency H₂ generation from N₂H₄·H₂O is of great significance for the sustainable strategy of society. A NiCo/NiO–CoOₓ ultrathin layered catalyst was fabricated successfully via a dynamics controlling coprecipitation–reduction (DCCR) process followed by calcination and applied to H₂ generation from N₂H₄·H₂O. Small nanosized NiCo particles (∼4 nm) were uniformly anchored on the surface of the NiO–CoOₓ ultrathin layered supports. Based on the cooperation between the NiCo active-centers and high intensity base-sites of the NiO–CoOₓ support, the Ni₇₀Co₃₀/NiO–CoOₓ ultrathin layered nanocomposite exhibits over 99% selectivity for H₂ generation from N₂H₄·H₂O with a high reaction rate (molN₂H₄ molNᵢCₒ⁻¹ h⁻¹) of 5.49 h⁻¹ without using alkali as a catalyst promoter at 25 °C, which is superior to the reported studies. Moreover, the NiCo nanoalloys loading on the NiO–CoOₓ sheets enables an outstanding recycle performance over 10 cycles. The non-noble-metal NiCo/NiO–CoOₓ layered nanocomposite shows great value in catalyzing H₂ generation from N₂H₄·H₂O in practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3acatalysts 3ahydrazine 3ahydrogen production 3ananocomposites1 aWen, Ming1 aLin, Xijian1 aWu, Qingsheng1 aGu, Chen1 aChen, Hanxing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Apr. 26, v. 4, no. 17 p.6595-6602dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta01092j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245008700150300001600237520133800253592002801591650002501619650001501644650001601659650001201675650001701687650001401704650000901718650004301727650001301770650002201783700002001805773008801825856007301913852000901986655001201995IND60518231820221120131828.0160409e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051823182DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.123852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, C.10aPhosphodiesterase‐4 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders  ap. 429-441.  aPhosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4) hydrolyses cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a crucial secondary messenger for cellular adaptation to diverse external stimuli. The activity of PDE4 is tightly controlled by post‐translational regulation, structure‐based auto‐regulation and locus specific ‘compartmentalization’ of PDE4 with its interactive proteins (signalsomes). Through these mechanisms, PDE4 regulates cAMP levels and shapes the cAMP signalling, directing signals from the diverse external stimuli to distinct microenvironments exquisitely. Derangement of the PDE4‐cAMP signalling represents a pathophysiologically relevant pathway in metabolic disorders as demonstrated through a critical role in the processes including inflammation, disordered glucose and lipid metabolism, hepatic steatosis, abnormal lipolysis, suppressed thermogenic function and deranged neuroendocrine functions. A limited number of PDE4 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation for treating disorders such as type 2 diabetes and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis. The discovery of novel PDE4 allosteric inhibitors and signalsome‐based strategies targeting individual PDE4 variants may allow PDE4 isoform selective inhibition, which may offer safer strategies for chronic treatment of metabolic disorders. © 2016 World Obesity  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3acyclic AMP 3afatty liver 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3alipolysis 3aloci 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aproteins 3asecond messengers1 aRajagopalan, S.0 tObesity reviews.g2016 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.429-441dBlackwell Pub.x1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.123853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016500167300001600332520101100348592002801359650001301387650002501400650001101425650003001436650000901466650003101475650001401506650001701520650001201537650001401549700002301563700002401586773011301610856008201723852000901805655001201814IND60614256320221121101911.0211006e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061425632DNAL7 a10.1007/s12600-018-0687-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarshney, Richa10aFunctional response of Geocoris ochropterus Fieber (Hemiptera: Geocoridae) to different egg densities of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 451-458.  aThe biology and predatory efficiency of Geocoris ochropterus Fieber (Hemiptera: Geocoridae) has been studied extensively against many insect pests, but information on functional response of different stages of G. ochropterus to Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is lacking so far. The functional response of different stages of G. ochropterus to varying densities of eggs of H. armigera was investigated in the laboratory at 26 ± 2°C, 65 ± 2% RH and 12 L: 12D. Immature stages i.e. 3rd, 4th, 5th instar and adult predator exhibited type II functional response. Handling time decreased with increasing predator’s developmental stage. Adult G. ochropterus followed by fifth instar exhibited highest egg consumption and attack rate compared to other stages. Functional response parameters indicate that the adult and fifth instar of G. ochropterus were more voracious and efficient than other juveniles and might be useful as promising biocontrol agent against H. armigera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeocoris 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aadults 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3afunctional response models 3aimmatures 3ainsect pests 3ainstars 3ajuveniles1 aBudhlakoti, Neeraj1 aBallal, Chandish R.0 tPhytoparasitica.g2018 Sept., v. 46, no. 4 p.451-458dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9750x0334-21237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-018-0687-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245008400157520085900241592002801100650001101128650001701139650002001156650001501176650001101191650002201202650002201224650001101246650001901257650001601276650001501292651001701307700002001324700002101344773012001365856007201485852000901557655001201566IND60653160820221117225623.0190714e20160928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065316082DNAL7 a10.3390/w81004252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPittock, Jamie10aModeling the Hydropower–Food Nexus in Large River Basins: A Mekong Case Study  aAn increasing global population and growing wealth are raising demand for energy and food, impacting on the environment and people living in river basins. Sectoral decision-making may not optimize socio-economic benefits because of perverse impacts in other sectors for people and ecosystems. The hydropower–food supply nexus in the Mekong River basins is assessed here in an influence model. This shows how altering one variable has consequent effects throughout the basin system. Options for strategic interventions to maximize benefits while minimizing negative impacts are identified that would enable national and sub-national policy makers to take more informed decisions across the hydropower, water and food supply sectors. This approach should be further tested to see if it may aid policy making in other large river systems around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afood availability 3aissues and policy 3arivers 3asocioeconomics 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aMekong River1 aDumaresq, David1 aBassi, Andrea M.0 tWater.g2016 Sept. 28, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w81004253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245013600209300001800345500001900363520133500382592002801717650001601745650001101761650001401772650001401786650001101800650001701811650001301828650001401841650001101855650001701866650001201883650001301895650002001908653002401928653001401952653000901966653001001975653002101985700006002006773013702066856008702203852000902290655001202299IND60706765620221118003902.0201023e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070676562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGüzel, Melih1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5374-883810aPreparation and characterization of bacterial cellulose produced from fruit and vegetable peels by Komagataeibacter hansenii GA2016  ap. 1597-1604.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study focused on the investigation of bacterial cellulose production potency of some fruit and vegetable peels (cucumber, melon, kiwifruit, tomato, apple, quince and pomegranate) with Komagataeibacter hansenii GA2016. Fruit and vegetable peels were hydrolyzed, used for bacterial cellulose (BC) production and their chemical, physical, thermal and structural features were compared to BC from Hestrin–Schramm medium (HSBC) and plant cellulose (CP). Except for pomegranate peel hydrolysate, all the fruit and vegetable peel hydrolysates supplied to K. hansenii GA2016 supported the BC production. Among the fruit and vegetable peel hydrolysates, the highest BC production was observed in kiwifruit peel hydrolysate (11.53%), while the lowest production was observed in apple peel hydrolysate (1.54%). Water-holding capacities of the BCs were ranged from 627.50% to 928.79% and higher than HSBC (609.30%), average fiber diameters were ranged from 47.64 nm to 61.11 nm and thinner than HSBC (74.29) and CP (10,420 nm), crystallinities were ranged from 80.27% to 92.96%, thermal capacities BCs were higher than HSBC and CP. For the BC productions, utilization of the fruit and vegetable peels as the sole nutrient source could reduce the production costs and among the polysaccharides, increase the use of BC in industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapple peels 3aapples 3acellulose 3acucumbers 3afruits 3ahydrolysates 3aindustry 3akiwifruit 3amelons 3apomegranates 3aquinces 3atomatoes 3avegetable peels 0aBacterial cellulose 0aVegetable 0aPeel 0aWaste 0aCharacterization1 aAkpınar, Özlem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6593-84950 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 162 p.1597-1604dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010600171300001600277520183300293592002802126650001302154650001702167650001502184650001302199650001502212650001502227650001502242650001302257650002402270650003502294651001102329700002202340773011102362856008102473852000902554655001202563IND60112861720221116193019.0141111e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011286172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-013-1082-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeda, Eduardo Eiji10aSpatiotemporal characterization of land surface temperature in Mount Kilimanjaro using satellite data  ap. 497-509.  aMount Kilimanjaro is considered the highest free-standing mountain in the world and a symbol of the African continent. Steep slopes and high altitudes are on the backdrop of unique biophysical characteristics, in which changes between savannas, tropical cloud forests, and subalpine vegetation can be observed in relatively small distances. In the context of this complex and heterogeneous landscape, describing the interactions between climatic variables and ecosystem functions is crucial for understanding the drivers of biodiversity. However, the characterization of climatic variables, especially surface temperature, still remains a critical bottleneck for a comprehensive understanding of habitats in Kilimanjaro. This study applies satellite-based estimates of land surface temperature (LST), from 2001 to 2011, to delineate a thorough characterization of the spatiotemporal patterns of surface temperature in Mount Kilimanjaro. The ample spatial coverage and continuous observations provided by the satellite measurements allowed the detailed description of characteristics so far poorly understood or not yet described in the literature. We demonstrate that the spatial patterns of LST in this region are rather complex, in the sense that it is characterized by non-linear behaviors and strong interactions with land cover and topography. Daytime observations (measured at 10:30 am) were shown to be strongly influenced by land cover characteristics, which is responsible for defining not only the spatial patterns (e.g., lapse rate) but also the seasonal signature of LST. At nighttime measurements (10:30 pm), the influence of land cover virtually disappears and the spatial patterns are mostly driven by altitude. Moreover, this study provides a brief assessment of LST trends observed within the analyzed period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3asatellites 3asavannas 3asurface temperature 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aAfrica1 aHurskainen, Pekka0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 Nov., v. 118, no. 3 p.497-509dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1082-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002200174245008200196300001600278520119800294592002801492650002701520650002401547650001901571650001601590650003601606650002501642650002301667650001401690650006101704650003801765650002201803650001101825650007501836650001401911650002001925650007201945653002302017653002402040653001402064653001102078653001702089653002202106700003402128773013702162856009002299852000902389655001202398IND50070506220221117025104.0190318e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007050622DNAL7 a241846092pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLianou, Alexandra10aStrain variability of the behavior of foodborne bacterial pathogens: A review  ap. 310-321.  aDifferences in phenotypic responses among strains of the same microbial species constitute an important source of variability in microbiological studies, and as such they need to be assessed, characterized and taken into account. This review provides a compilation of available research data on the strain variability of four basic behavioral aspects of foodborne bacterial pathogens including: (i) virulence; (ii) growth; (iii) inactivation; and (iv) biofilm formation. A particular emphasis is placed on the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica. The implications of strain variability for food safety challenge studies and microbial risk assessment are discussed also. The information provided indicates that the variability among strains of foodborne bacterial pathogens with respect to their behavior can be significant and should not be overlooked. However, in order for the mechanisms underlying the observed strain variability to be elucidated and understood, phenotypic variability data, such as those reviewed here, should be evaluated in conjunction with corresponding findings of studies assessing the molecular/physiological basis of this variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella enterica 3afood pathogens 3afood safety 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3aphenotypic variation 3astrain differences 3avirulence 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aPhenotype 2aRisk Assessment 2aSalmonella entericaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 0aStrain variability 0aFoodborne pathogens 0aVirulence 0aGrowth 0aInactivation 0aBiofilm formation1 aKoutsoumanis, Konstantinos P.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 Nov. 01, v. 167, no. 3 p.310-321dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024003500126040001800161100001900179245015200198506007600350506003100426520149900457592002801956596000901984506003701993650002502030650002702055650002402082650001702106650001802123650003102141650001802172650002202190650001302212650001702225650001402242700002102256700002302277700001802300700002002318700001802338700002302356773009702379856007902476961001302555852000902568655001202577IND60735009120221207100814.0220901e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073500912DNAL7 a10.1093/femsle/fnaa1692doi7 a10.1093/femsle/fnaa1692chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLange, Miles D10aProteome analysis of virulent <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> reveals the upregulation of iron acquisition systems in the presence of a xenosiderophore  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe Gram-negative bacterium, Aeromonas hydrophila, has been responsible for extensive losses in the catfish industry for over a decade. Due to this impact, there are ongoing efforts to understand the basic mechanisms that contribute to virulent A. hydrophila (vAh) outbreaks. Recent challenge models demonstrated that vAh cultured in the presence of the iron chelating agent deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) were more virulent to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Interestingly, differential gene expression of select iron acquisition genes was unremarkable between DFO and non-DFO cultures, posing the question: why the increased virulence? The current work sought to evaluate growth characteristics and protein expression of vAh after the addition of DFO. A comparative proteome analysis revealed differentially expressed proteins among tryptic soy broth (TSB) and TSB + DFO treatments. Upregulated proteins identified among the TSB + DFO treatment were enriched for gene ontology groups including iron ion transport, siderophore transport and siderophore uptake transport, all iron acquisition pathways. Protein-protein interactions were also evaluated among the differentially expressed proteins and predicted that many of the upregulated iron acquisition proteins likely form functional physiological networks. The proteome analysis of the vAh reveals valuable information about the basic biological processes likely leading to increased virulence during iron restriction in this organism.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aIctalurus punctatus 3adeferoxamine 3afish industry 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3asiderophores 3avirulence1 aAbernathy, Jason1 aShoemaker, Craig A1 aZhang, Dunhua1 aKirby, Augustus1 aPeatman, Eric1 aBeck, Benjamin H.,0 tFEMS Microbiology Letters.dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:jnl50329x1574-69687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnaa1693Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245011900170300001400289506002800303520082400331592002801155506003701183653001401220653001301234653001401247653001701261653001501278653000901293653001901302653001101321653001401332653001601346700002001362773012601382856008901508852000901597655001201606IND60784920920221207063058.0180531e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078492092DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.1992.26.2.11982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoignon, F.10aAction des inhibiteurs de la biosynthèse de l'ergostérol sur la fermentation alcoolique du moût de raisin blanc  ap. 87-96.  aResource is Open Access  aLes fongicides appartenant aux familles des Triazoles et Imidazoles agissent en bloquant la voie de biosynthèse de l'ergostérol chez les champignons parasites de la vigne.

The results derived from three observational datasets (the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation, International Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set, and Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature) indicate that significant winter persistence barriers (WPBs) occur during IOD events, both in its growing and decaying phases. The simulation skill of the 14 models within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 with respect to persistence barriers was also evaluated and compared with observational data. The results show that although most models were able to simulate the WPB reasonably well during the growing phase, only five models could capture the appropriate WPB during the decaying phase. Further analysis demonstrates that the zonal equatorial gradient of climatological sea surface temperature (SST) and zonal sea surface winds at the equator in the Indian Ocean are very weak in winter, which indicates that the coupling between ocean and atmosphere is weakest in winter and encourages a rapid variation of IOD events and a swift reduction of persistence, favoring the occurrence of WPBs; furthermore, a deep climatological thermocline in winter implies that the subsurface water temperature cannot influence SST readily, and the memory of the subsurface temperature cannot help SST to recover from the loss of persistence during this period, leading to the occurrence of WPBs. In addition, an analysis of the climatological conditions in the outputs from the 14 models shows that those models that can (cannot) capture the winter climatological conditions frequently simulate the WPBs appropriately (poorly). This confirms that the occurrence of the WPB for IOD events may be closely related to particular winter climatological conditions, indicating that the WPB is an inherent property of IOD events.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amodels 3asurface water temperature 3awind 3awinter 3aIndian Ocean1 aMu, Mu1 aDuan, Wansuo0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 Nov., v. 118, no. 3 p.523-534dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1083-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245016200176500001400338520157900352592002801931650002201959650001101981650002001992650001602012650001002028650002002038650001302058650002002071650002002091650001002111650001802121650002602139650001002165650001002175650001302185650001502198650001402213650001102227650001502238653001602253653001502269653001302284653001702297653001902314653001202333700002702345700002002372700002102392700002502413700001702438700001902455773009102474856009002565852000902655655001202664IND60719347720221116143756.0210108e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071934772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuljević, Damir10aAssessing hexavalent chromium tissue-specific accumulation patterns and induced physiological responses to probe chromium toxicity in Coturnix japonica quail  aNAL-light  aHexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is an environmental pollutant with vast mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. Various past and recent studies confirm the deleterious effects of Cr(VI) in different models, from invertebrates to mammalians. However, there is a lack of studies that comprehensively assess and correlate Cr(VI) accumulation patterns and the resulting physiological responses. Here we used an attractive toxicological model, male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), as an alternative probing system to evaluate Cr(VI) accumulation in the vital organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and testes after 20 days of exposure to 1.2 μg/mL and 2.4 μg/mL potassium dichromate-K₂Cr₂O₇ ingested in the form of drinking water. The observed effects were correlated with the shift in immune system readiness, hematological indices, serum biochemistry and enzyme activity. Regardless of the exposure dose, the Cr(VI) distribution and accumulation pattern in terms of relative Cr(VI) concentration in tissues was: testes > kidneys > liver > heart > brain. Moreover, Cr(VI) triggered the development of microcytic and hypochromic anemia and reduced the immune system’s readiness to cope with challenges. Besides, serum biochemistry presented significant shifts, including reduction of serum electrolytes and proteins and an increase in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Our study provides novel toxicological data that can be translated to higher animal models to help in the extrapolation of Cr(VI) toxicity in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3aanemia 3ablood chemistry 3ablood serum 3abrain 3acarcinogenicity 3achromium 3acreatine kinase 3aenzyme activity 3aheart 3aimmune system 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aliver 3amales 3amutagens 3apollutants 3apotassium 3aquails 3atoxicology 0aHeavy metal 0aBird model 0aToxicity 0aAccumulation 0aTarget tissues 0aEnzymes1 aSulejmanović, Jasmina1 aFočak, Muhamed1 aHalilović, Erna1 aPupalović, Džemila1 aHasić, Azra1 aAlijagic, Andi0 tChemosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 266 p.129005-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245006300166300001400229520098600243592002801229650001601257650001601273650001701289650001901306650002301325650001601348650001101364650001301375650001601388651001001404653001201414653001301426653001701439653001201456653001201468653001501480700002301495700002001518773014101538856008001679852000901759655001201768IND60763196020221117015417.0220118e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076319602DNAL7 a10.2478/ausae-2021-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopinath, Rajesh10aInadvertent implications of climate change for butterflies  ap. 13-22.  aClimate change is one of the leading challenges of this century with an impending threat to wipe out more vital butterfly species than ever before. Climate shift has the potential to affect their life cycles, flight times, essential bio-interactions, and ultimately survival. As the first such study in India, this case study highlights the inferential discussion on the importance of butterflies in maintaining the earth’s fragile ecological balance and consequently the impact of climate change upon them with inadvertent implications. Due to the shifting climate, a number of butterfly species are now migrating to newer places in their search for comfortable temperature and availability of food, as the reduction/loss/change of habitat lowers the diversity of microclimates and availability of food plants for larvae and adult butterflies. Consequently, the butterflies become even more vulnerable to natural perturbations and susceptible to predators and local extinctions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3abutterflies 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aecological balance 3aenvironment 3aflight 3ahabitats 3atemperature 3aIndia 0aclimate 0asurvival 0ainteractions 0aspecies 0abalance 0aecological1 aRam, Aadarsa V.

However, soil temperature records are not routinely available from meteorological stations. This work aimed to estimate daily soil temperature using the coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) in arid and semiarid regions. For this purpose, daily soil temperatures were recorded at six depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 cm below the surface at two synoptic stations in Iran. According to correlation analysis, mean, maximum, and minimum air temperatures, relative humidity, sunshine hours, and solar radiation were selected as the inputs of the CANFIS models. It was concluded that, in most cases, the best soil temperature estimates with a CANFIS model can be provided with the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy model and the Gaussian membership function. Comparison of the models’ performances at arid and semiarid locations showed that the CANFIS models’ performances in arid site were slightly better than those in semiarid site. Overall, the obtained results indicated the capabilities of the CANFIS model in estimating soil temperature in arid and semiarid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3afuzzy logic 3ahydrology 3arelative humidity 3asemiarid zones 3asoil temperature 3asolar radiation 3aIran0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 Nov., v. 118, no. 3 p.481-489dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1084-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01787naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006400159300001600223500002000239520081400259592002801073650001701101650002401118650001501142650002401157650002301181700001901204700002501223773014201248856007401390852000901464655001201473IND60645916620221120200146.0190604e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064591662DNAL7 a10.1111/rssb.123152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrot, Benjamin10aRobust causal structure learning with some hidden variables  ap. 459-487.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe introduce a new method to estimate the Markov equivalence class of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in the presence of hidden variables, in settings where the underlying DAG among the observed variables is sparse, and there are a few hidden variables that have a direct effect on many of the observed variables. Building on the so‐called low rank plus sparse framework, we suggest a two‐stage approach which first removes the effect of the hidden variables and then estimates the Markov equivalence class of the underlying DAG under the assumption that there are no remaining hidden variables. This approach is consistent in certain high dimensional regimes and performs favourably when compared with the state of the art, in terms of both graphical structure recovery and total causal effect estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3acomputer simulation 3aestimation 3amathematical theory 3astatistical models1 aNandy, Preetam1 aMaathuis, Marloes H.0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.g2019 July, v. 81, no. 3 p.459-487dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867066x1369-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssb.123153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245009000166300001600256506002800272520181300300592002802113506003702141650004302178650001702221650001802238650001002256650002102266650002102287650001002308650001902318650002402337650001302361650001102374650001402385650002202399650001602421650002302437650000702460650000902467650002402476650002202500650002002522650002202542650001902564650001502583650002302598650001302621650002502634650001602659650001702675700002402692700002602716700002002742773013502762856007702897852000902974655001202983IND60784921020221207072600.0111202e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078492102DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha39260702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDİLMAÇÜNAL, Tuba14aThe Effects of Several Postharvest Treatments on Shelf Life Quality of Bunch Tomatoes  ap. 209-213.  aResource is Open Access  aBunch tomatoes (Lycopersicon lycopersicum L.) ‘Bandita’ cv. were hand-harvested at red ripe stage. The plants were grown on hanging carrying system with high wire support training in coco peat media in a plastic greenhouse located in Antalya (Turkey). Harvested fruits were divided to four groups for these treatments: (1) control-not treated; (2) tomato wax (Tomato wax is a wax formulated from 99% food grade mineral oil and 1% water); (3)Nutrient solution (1% potassium nitrate + 0.5% zinc sulfate + 1% calcium chloride + 0.1% boron + 0.2% copper sulfate + 0.5% ascorbic acid + 0.1% salicylic acid) and (4) Herbal oil (Herbal oil is a natural product obtained from hazelnut fruit membrane contains a high level of antioxidant). Bunches, placed in carton boxes, stored at 20°C temperature and 90±5% relative humidity for 16 days. Weight loss of bunches, firmness, respiration rate, ethylene production, colour, soluble solid content, pH, titratable acidity and sensory attributes (external appearance and taste-aroma of fruits and wilting and drying of calyxes) of tomatoes were evaluated during storage. Tomato wax treatment was limited the weight loss and preserved firmness better than the others. Tomato wax, nutrient solution and herbal oil treatments were limited the respiration rate. Ethylene production of nutrient solution treated fruits showed the highest value followed by herbal oil, tomato wax and control group. The highest colour change was found in control group. The lowest soluble solid content and the highest level of acidity were found in fruits treated with tomato wax. Control , herbal oil and nutrient solution treatments were lost marketable quality after 8 days of storage. TW treatment gave the best result and provided to store bunch tomatoes at good quality for 12 days.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aboron 3acalcium chloride 3acell respiration 3acolor 3acopper sulfate 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afruits 3ahazelnuts 3amanual harvesting 3amineral oil 3anutrient solutions 3apH 3apeat 3aplastic greenhouses 3apotassium nitrate 3aquality of life 3arelative humidity 3asalicylic acid 3ashelf life 3atitratable acidity 3atomatoes 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 3azinc sulfate1 aKOYUNCU, Mehmet Ali1 aAkta̧s, H.q(Hakan),1 aBAYINDIR, Derya0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 2 p.209-213dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha39260703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03746naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009700171520218700268592002802455650001802483650001602501650001202517650001902529650001202548650002902560650000902589650002602598650002002624650001802644650001602662650002002678651001302698653001902711653001902730653001902749653002102768653002402789653002302813653001502836653002102851653002502872653002802897653001402925653001602939700002102955700001702976700002102993773009903014856008203113852000903195655001203204IND60732954920221118161620.0210519s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073295492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crm.2021.1003022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisser-Quinn, Annie10aMapping future water scarcity in a water abundant nation: Near-term projections for Scotland  aWith its abundant water resources, Scotland has ambitions to become a 'hydro nation'. Hydroclimatological projections indicate that the spatial and temporal distribution of water is likely to change, with parts of Scotland becoming significantly drier. This study, conducted in conjunction with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) looked to identify which regions and sectors may be subject to increased water scarcity pressures in the near-future (2020–2049).Accounting for more than 99% of (non-public water) surface water abstractions, four key water using sectors were considered: agriculture, aquaculture (finfish), hydropower (with storage; excluding run-of-river (ROR)) and whisky. Drought events, defined by SEPA as a period where daily flow falls below a long-term Q95 threshold for more than 30-days, were profiled in terms of their average frequency, duration and intensity (over a 30-year time slice).Two hotspots (of drought and abstraction) identified were the rivers Spey and Tay, which represent the centres of the Scotch whisky sector and agriculture respectively. Under climate change, the frequency of drought events could see a two or three-fold increase (median 2–7 additional events). The direction of the change in average drought duration was more uncertain (median change of 0–4 days per event). The results indicated that abstraction exacerbated the pressure. Capturing different sources of uncertainty (parameter and structural), the hydroclimatological data was drawn from two climate ensembles. Overall, the PPE (parameter uncertainty) was found to have narrower uncertainty bounds overall, though the MME (structural uncertainty) was subject to less uncertainty in specific locales in the north. These results highlight the limitation of focussing on one ensemble type/source of ensemble uncertainty across such a diverse domain.Overall, the paper demonstrates the need for a consistent approach to future water resource planning across Scotland. This planning must consider all sectors consistently and requires cross-sector and cross-disciplinary input and collaboration in order to facilitate wise use of future water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScotch whisky 3aaquaculture 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aenvironmental protection 3afish 3aparameter uncertainty 3arisk management 3asurface water 3awater power 3awater shortages 3aScotland 0aClimate change 0aWater scarcity 0aWater security 0aWater insecurity 0aClimate projections 0aFuture projections 0aRiver flow 0aFlow projections 0aEnsemble uncertainty 0aWater resource planning 0aWater use 0aAbstraction1 aBeevers, Lindsay1 aLau, Tiffany1 aGosling, Richard0 tClimate risk management.g2021, v. 32 p.100302-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2021.1003023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01532naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245006000168300001400228520052200242592002800764650001600792650001600808650001200824651001200836653002400848653001600872653002700888653002500915700003600940773014100976856008001117852000901197655001201206IND60763196220221117014810.0220118e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076319622DNAL7 a10.2478/ausae-2021-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBálint, Krisztina10aSustainable and preservative historic garden management  ap. 36-47.  aThe restoration of historic gardens in Hungary puts an increasing responsibility on the shoulders of management.

This study aims to develop the scientific foundations for practical solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aenvironment 3agardens 3aHungary 0aheritage protection 0amaintenance 0agreen space management 0aresearch methodology1 aNagy, Ildikó Réka Báthoryné0 tActa Universitatis Sapientiae.

Accordingly, by applying some successful two‐sample test statistics in the literature, two tests are constructed to check the lack of fit for low and high dimensional quantile regression models. The low dimensional test works well when the number of covariates is moderate, whereas the high dimensional test can maintain the power when the number of covariates exceeds the sample size. The null distribution of the high dimensional test has an explicit form, and the p‐values or critical values can then be calculated directly. The finite sample performance of the tests proposed is examined by simulation studies, and their usefulness is further illustrated by two real examples.  aPublisher supplied data  a11571218cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a11690012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91546202cState Key Program in the Major Research Plan of the National Science Foundation of China  cProgram for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics  a17325416cHong Kong Research Grants Council  a17304617cHong Kong Research Grants Council 3aequations 3amodels 3aregression analysis1 aLi, Guodong1 aFeng, Xingdong0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.g2019 July, v. 81, no. 3 p.629-648dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867066x1369-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssb.123213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010400174300001600278520154300294592002801837650002301865650001201888650001101900650001801911650001301929650001101942650000701953650001301960650001801973650001701991650001602008653001702024653002502041653002402066653001302090653001802103700001602121700002602137773009002163856009002253852000902343655001202352IND60545268020221119160003.0220906e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054526802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.08.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnskjær, G.G.10aDialysis experiments for assessing the pH-dependent sorption of sulfonamides to soil clay fractions  ap. 116-123.  aEquilibrium dialysis experiments, a novel approach for conducting soil/water distribution experiments in environmental samples, were found to be applicable for assessing pH-dependent partitioning and to quantify the sorption of three sulfonamides, sulfadiazine, sulfadoxine, and sulfacetamide. Clay fractions from two agricultural soils including both particulate and dissolved soil matter were used in the experiments to achieve a high sorption capacity when varying pH in a relevant environmental range. Stabilizing and controlling pH was done by using organic buffers. In two clay fractions, Kd for sulfadiazine was determined to be 43 and 129Lkg⁻¹, and 1.3 and 4.6Lkg⁻¹ at pH 4.0 and pH 9.0, respectively. This corresponded to Kd for the neutral and ionized form of sulfadiazine, respectively. The difference in sulfadiazine sorption between the two clay fractions could to some extent be related to the difference in the amount of organic carbon. Sorption experiments with sulfacetamide and sulfadoxine also exhibited decreasing sorption when increasing pH. At low pH, maximum Kd for sulfacetamide and sulfadoxine was determined to be 83 and 211Lkg⁻¹, respectively, while at high pH minimum Kd was 4.8 and 1.2Lkg⁻¹, respectively. Hence, compound speciation was important for the quantity of sorbed sulfonamide, which was confirmed by a correlation (R²) close to unity, when using the experimentally obtained Kd values with a simple model weighing the contribution from the neutral and the ionized compound, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3abuffers 3acarbon 3aclay fraction 3adialysis 3amodels 3apH 3asorption 3asulfacetamide 3asulfadiazine 3asulfadoxine 0aSulfonamides 0aEquilibrium dialysis 0aIonizable compounds 0aSorption 0aClay fraction1 aKrogh, K.A.1 aHalling-Sørensen, B.0 tChemosphere.g2014 Jan., v. 95 p.116-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.08.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012200170300001800292520158800310592002801898650003001926650002701956650002201983650001702005650001702022650001202039650002302051650003602074650001102110650001302121650002002134650002102154650002202175650001302197650001102210650001702221650001402238650001502252650000902267650001402276650000702290650002202297650001602319650002202335653002202357653002502379653002202404653001202426653001802438653001902456700001902475700002902494700005702523773013402580856008702714852000902801655001202810IND60612973320221121081721.0200117e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061297332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Shu-Ping10aConjugation of Agrobacterium radiobacter epoxide hydrolase with ficoll: Catalytic, kinetic and thermodynamic analysis  ap. 1098-1105.  aEpoxide hydrolase-mediated biocatalysis has a great prospective in the biosynthesis of optically pure epoxides. The present work targets toward the thermo-stabilization of epoxide hydrolase by covalent conjugation with polysaccharide. An epoxide hydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter (ArEH) was modified by covalent coupling to seven oxidized polysaccharides with different chemical structures and characteristics. Among all conjugates, ArEH with ficoll exhibited both the highest specific activity (494 U/mg) and half-life at 60 °C (t₁/₂ = 183 min). The conjugated enzyme also displayed wider optimum pH and temperature ranges, higher catalytic number (kcₐₜ), and catalytic efficiency (kcₐₜ/Kₘ) as compared to its native counterpart. The conjugation significantly decreased the enthalpy of activation (ΔH*), free energy of transition state binding (ΔG*E₋T), and free energy of activation (ΔG*) for epichlorohydrin hydrolysis. Moreover, the conjugated ArEH showed enhanced thermal stability as evidenced by its longer half-life (t₁/₂), lower thermal deactivation constant (kd), and higher D values at 50–70 °C. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of conjugated ArEH elevated significantly by Ca²⁺ and it showed increased tolerance against Co²⁺, Fe³⁺ and EDTA inhibitors. Finally, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis were performed to confirm the noticeable conformational changes in ArEH structure after conjugation with ficoll, which could be responsible for the observed catalytic and stability enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aGibbs free energy 3abiocatalysis 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3achemical structure 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acobalt 3aenthalpy 3aenzyme activity 3aepichlorohydrins 3aepoxide hydrolase 3aepoxides 3aficoll 3afluorescence 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3aoxidation 3apH 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aEpoxide hydrolase 0aCovalent conjugation 0aThermal stability 0aKinetic 0aThermodynamic 0aPolysaccharide1 aXuan, Xiu-Ling1 aWang, Z.

Areas containing suitable physicochemical soil properties and suitable soil taxonomy, together with land slopes of less than 10° and suitable land uses for date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) were selected as appropriate refining tools to ensure the CLIMEX results were accurate and robust. Results showed that large regions of Iran are projected as likely to become climatically suitable for date palm cultivation based on the projected scenarios for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100. The study also showed CLIMEX outputs merit refinement by nonclimatic parameters and that the incremental introduction of each additional parameter decreased the disagreement between GCMs. Furthermore, the study indicated that the least amount of disagreement in terms of areas conducive to date palm cultivation resulted from CS and MR GCMs when the locations of suitable physicochemical soil properties and soil taxonomy were used as refinement tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aland use 3asoil properties 3asoil taxonomy 3atopography 3aIran1 aKumar, Lalit1 aTaylor, Subhashni0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 Nov., v. 118, no. 3 p.553-567dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1064-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245015700169300001400326500001400340520065100354592002801005650001001033650001201043650002001055650001601075651001201091651001301103653000901116653001001125653002101135653001101156653002001167700002401187773009401211856008101305852000901386655001201395IND60699262120221123000956.0210117e20131120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069926212DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.353.41982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, Dorothee12aA catalog of bird specimens associated with Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied and potential type material in the natural history collection in Wiesbaden  ap. 81-93.  aNAL-light  aBird specimens collected by 19ᵗʰ century explorer and ornithologist Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied form one of the foundation collections of the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

For the time being these regulatory constraints tend to be articulated in terms of limits upon withdrawals, partly because of limited knowledge of the condition and resilience of the aquatic ecosystems. A more sophisticated approach to regulation would be more directly related to indicators of ecological condition. Moreover, it would consider ecosystem response to climatic events not present in the historical record. In this paper we use a combination of empirical evidence of ecosystem condition with simulation to propose and test reductions to regulatory limits on river water withdrawals and downstream minimum flow requirements. The study uses multi-level linear regression to relate the Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE) to antecedent flow statistics observed in the Lee catchment, England. The selected flow statistics included extreme low (Q90) and high (Q10) flows in the summer season (April-Sept), and the median flows observed in the winter season (Oct-Mar). The derived model is used to forecast the response of the macroinvertebrate index to future flow scenarios and demand forecasts, incorporating the uncertainties in ecosystem response. Simulation is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the indices to different regulatory limits. Results indicate that macroinvertebrate health will worsen under 21st Century climate conditions, and that the existing regulation policy must be modified to maintain historically observed LIFE scores into the future. The framework demonstrates how regulations could move from precautionary limits on withdrawals to an approach based on observations, forecasting and simulation, allowing planners to refine the trade-offs between river health and reliable water supply in the face of uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3afreshwater 3ahistorical records 3aissues and policy 3amacroinvertebrates 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arisk management 3ariver water 3arivers 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aEngland 0aRiver health 0aWater planning 0aWater management 0aClimate change 0aResilience1 aHall, J.W.0 tClimate risk management.g2021, v. 32 p.100303-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2021.1003033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245006400152300001600216500002000232520102600252592002801278650001501306650001401321650001301335650000901348650001101357650002401368700001901392700001601411700001701427700001901444700001801463773014201481856007401623852000901697655001201706IND60645917120221120200012.0190604e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064591712DNAL7 a10.1111/rssb.123202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Mu10aIntrinsic Gaussian processes on complex constrained domains  ap. 603-627.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe propose a class of intrinsic Gaussian processes (GPs) for interpolation, regression and classification on manifolds with a primary focus on complex constrained domains or irregularly shaped spaces arising as subsets or submanifolds of R, R2, R3 and beyond. For example, intrinsic GPs can accommodate spatial domains arising as complex subsets of Euclidean space. Intrinsic GPs respect the potentially complex boundary or interior conditions as well as the intrinsic geometry of the spaces. The key novelty of the approach proposed is to utilize the relationship between heat kernels and the transition density of Brownian motion on manifolds for constructing and approximating valid and computationally feasible covariance kernels. This enables intrinsic GPs to be practically applied in great generality, whereas existing approaches for smoothing on constrained domains are limited to simple special cases. The broad utilities of the intrinsic GP approach are illustrated through simulation studies and data examples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3aequations 3ageometry 3aheat 3amodels 3anormal distribution1 aCheung, Pokman1 aLin, Lizhen1 aDai, Zhenwen1 aLawrence, Neil1 aDunson, David0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.g2019 July, v. 81, no. 3 p.603-627dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867066x1369-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssb.123203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008200162300001600244520111300260592002801373650002301401650001501424650001601439650001501455650001301470650001701483653000901500653001501509653001701524653001701541700001201558700001701570700001401587700001501601773011101616856008301727852000901810655001201819IND60553574120221122102824.0180831e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055357412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Jing10aSERS nanoprobes for the monitoring of endogenous nitric oxide in living cells  ap. 324-330.  aNitric Oxide (NO) is a significant gaseous signalling molecule in various pathological and physiological pathways, whereas many of its functions are still ambiguous in part because of the shortage of powerful detection approaches. Herein, we present a type of reaction-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobes, o-phenylenediamine-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs/OPD), to detect the level of the endogenous NO in living cells. The detection is achieved through the SERS variation of AuNPs/OPD caused by the reaction between NO and OPD on the surface of AuNPs. The proposed SERS nanoprobes have a good stability and a rapid response to NO within 30s Moreover, as a result of the reaction specificity coupled with SERS fingerprinting, AuNPs/OPD nanoprobes demonstrate high selectivity towards NO over other biologically relevant species with a sensitivity at 10⁻⁷M level. Thereby, this SERS strategy can be used for monitoring NO that is endogenously produced in living macrophages, indicating immense potential in studying NO-involved pathophysiological processes in biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiosensors 3amacrophages 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3anitric oxide 0aSERS 0aMonitoring 0aNitric oxide 0aLiving cells1 aHu, Kai1 aSun, Jia-Jia1 aQu, Lu-Lu1 aLi, Da-Wei0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 85 p.324-330dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245006600161300001600227500002000243520075300263592002801016596006901044596006901113650002001182650001701202650002301219650001501242650001301257650001401270650001101284650002901295650001401324700002001338773014201358856007401500852000901574655001201583IND60645917220221120200004.0190604e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064591722DNAL7 a10.1111/rssb.123162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanella, Giacomo10aScalable importance tempering and Bayesian variable selection  ap. 489-517.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe propose a Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from high dimensional probability distributions that combines Markov chain Monte Carlo and importance sampling.

Though the toxicity and endocrine disrupting effect of CBZ on non-target organisms have been studied, its lipotoxity are scarcely known. To assess the lipotoxicity of CBZ, 2-month-old Chinese rare minnow were exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 100 μg/L CBZ for 90 d. Obvious dyslipidemia was observed after 30 d and 90 d exposure, whereas overt hyperlipidemia was observed in males at 100 μg/L treatments. Severe lipid droplet accumulation in livers was observed at 10 and 100 μg/L treatments for 30 d and in females, whereas those was observed at all treatments in males. In addition, serious mitochondria damage was observed in males at 100 μg/L treatments. After 90 d exposure, the enzyme activities of FAS and ACCα were significantly increased at 10 and 100 μg/L treatments, whereas HMGCR were markedly increased at 100 μg/L treatments (p < 0.05). However, ACCβ were markedly decreased in females at 10 and 100 μg/L treatments and in males at all treatments (p < 0.05). The transcription levels of fasn, accα, hmgcrα, fdft1, idi1, plin1, plin2, caveolin1, and caveolin2 were significantly increased at 100 μg/L treatments (p < 0.05). Moreover, the body weight was obviously increased at 10 and 100 μg/L treatments in males (p < 0.05). Our results confirmed that environmental relevant concentrations CBZ induced lipid metabolism disorder and mitochondria damage of Chinese rare minnow in a gender-specific pattern, which provided a new insight into the lipotoxicity mechanism of CBZ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGobiocypris rarus 3aanticonvulsants 3aaquatic environment 3abody weight 3adroplets 3aemotions 3aenzymes 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipids 3alipotoxicity 3amitochondria 3astabilizers 3atoxicity 0aCarbamazepine 0aSex-differences 0aChinese rare minnow1 aYan, Saihong1 aHong, Xiangsheng1 aZhang, Huan1 aZha, Jinmiao0 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 265 p.129080-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011200170300001600282520165400298592002801952650002001980650002102000650001302021650002502034650002302059650002002082650002002102650001802122650002002140650002402160650001402184650001302198650001602211650001402227653003202241653002702273653002002300653002102320653001802341700003502359700002302394700002202417773011102439856008302550852000902633655001202642IND60553574220221122054122.0180831e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055357422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaldonado, Jesús10aLabel-free bimodal waveguide immunosensor for rapid diagnosis of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients  ap. 310-316.  aSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an acute bacterial infection of ascitic fluid; it has a high incidence in cirrhotic patients and it is associated with high mortality. In such a situation, early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for the survival of the patient. However, bacterial analysis in ascitic fluid is currently based on culture methods, which are time-consuming and laborious. We report here the application of a photonic interferometer biosensor based on a bimodal waveguide (BiMW) for the rapid and label-free detection of bacteria directly in ascitic fluid. The device consists of a straight waveguide in which two modes of the same polarization interfere while interacting with the external medium through their evanescent fields. A bimolecular event occurring on the sensor area of the device (e.g. capturing bacteria) will differently affect each light mode, inducing a variation in the phase of the light exiting at the output of the waveguide. In this work, we demonstrate the quantitative detection of Bacillus cereus in buffer medium and Escherichia coli in undiluted ascitic fluid from cirrhotic patients. In the case of Bacillus cereus detection, the device was able to specifically detect bacteria at relevant concentrations in 12.5min and in the case of Escherichia coli detection, the analysis time was 25min. Extrapolation of the data demonstrated that the detection limits of the biosensor could reach few bacteria per milliliter. Based on the results obtained, we consider that the BiMW biosensor is positioned as a promising new clinical tool for user-friendly, cost-effective and real-time microbiological analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aearly diagnosis 3aimmunosensors 3ainterferometers 3amicrobial detection 3amortality 3apatients 3aperitonitis 3aphotonics 0aBimodal waveguide biosensor 0aLabel-free immunoassay 0aBacillus Cereus 0aEscherichia coli 0aAscitic fluid1 aGonzález-Guerrero, Ana Belén1 aDominguez, Carlos,1 aLechuga, Laura M.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 85 p.310-316dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245008200174300001600256520181900272592002802091650001002119650001802129650001502147650001302162650001602175650001302191650001702204650001302221650000902234650001602243650001502259650003502274650001902309650001402328650003102342650001502373650001502388650002002403650002102423650001102444650001402455650002002469650001102489651002102500653002002521653001602541653001702557653001502574653002102589700001702610700001702627700001902644773009002663856009002753852000902843655001202852IND60545268520221119160040.0220906e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054526852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.08.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Seung-Woo10aOccurrence and removal of selected micropollutants in a water treatment plant  ap. 156-165.  aThe levels of 14 micropollutants including nine pharmaceuticals, two pesticides, and three endocrine disruptors were measured in a water treatment plant (WTP) in Seoul, Korea. Among the measured micropollutants, 12 (excluding atrazine and triclocarban) were found in the influent and effluent from the WTP, at levels ranging from 2 to 482ngL⁻¹. The removal efficiencies of the detected micropollutants in the WTP ranged from 6% to 100%. Among them diclofenac, acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, and 2,4-D were effectively removed (>80%). Metoprolol was unlikely to be removed (6%) in the WTP process. Concentrations of acetaminophen, metoprolol, ibuprofen, and naproxen were higher in winter, while levels of herbicides of 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were higher in summer. Metoprolol was hardly removed in the water treatment process. Laboratory experiments showed that compounds with logKₒw>2.5 (especially bisphenol-A, 2,4-D, carbamazepine, triclocarban and 4-nonylphenol) were effectively removed by coagulation process, and adsorption effect increased in proportion with hydrophobicity of micropollutants and the turbidity of water. Sunlight photodegradation also effectively removed sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, caffeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, which are photosensitizes. Chlorination was relatively not effective for the removal of micropollutants due to the lower chlorine dosage (2mgL⁻¹), lower contact time (1h), and already lower levels of micropollutants at the chlorination stage at WTP. Our results imply that micropollutants during coagulation stage at WTP can be removed not only by coagulation itself, but also by adsorption to clay particle especially for high turbidity water, and by sunlight photodegradation in the areas open to the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aacetaminophen 3aadsorption 3aatrazine 3abisphenol A 3acaffeine 3achlorination 3achlorine 3aclay 3acoagulation 3adiclofenac 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3ahydrophobicity 3aibuprofen 3alaboratory experimentation 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3asolar radiation 3asulfamethoxazole 3asummer 3aturbidity 3awater treatment 3awinter 3aKorean Peninsula 0aMicropollutants 0aCoagulation 0aChlorination 0aAdsorption 0aPhotodegradation1 aJo, Byung-Il1 aYoon, Yeomin1 aZoh, Kyung-Duk0 tChemosphere.g2014 Jan., v. 95 p.156-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.08.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009700170300001600267520101400283592002801297650003001325650001201355651001201367700001901379700002101398773011101419856008101530852000901611655001201620IND60112862820221119064542.0141111e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011286282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-013-1073-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVũ, Thanh Hằng,10aEvolution of meteorological drought characteristics in Vietnam during the 1961–2007 period  ap. 367-375.  aThe drought conditions over the seven sub-climatological regions in Vietnam are examined using three meteorological drought indices: de Martonne J, PED, and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). According to the seasonal probabilities of drought occurrence estimated by the de Martonne index, droughts mainly occur between November and March in all the sub-regions. The PED index and the SPI index generally show high probabilities of drought occurrence from April to August and from May to October, respectively. In the southern sub-regions of Vietnam, droughts more frequently occur in El Niño years and wet conditions are more frequently observed in La Niña years. However, such El Niño–Southern Oscillation influences are not clearly observed in the northern sub-regions. During 1961–2007, droughts significantly increased in the northern part of Vietnam. In the southern regions, PED shows increasing drought conditions while J and SPI show decreasing drought trends for almost all the stations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adrought 3aVietnam1 aNgo-Duc, Thanh1 aPhan, Văn Tân,0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 Nov., v. 118, no. 3 p.367-375dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1073-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245015300163300001800316500001900334520232600353592002802679650002002707650001902727650002002746650002902766650001502795650001502810653003602825653002202861653001702883653002102900653003902921700001602960700001702976700001402993700001303007773013903020856008603159852000903245655001203254IND60705410920221122044936.0200928e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070541092DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17577822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xue10aEvaluating generative adversarial networks based image-level domain transfer for multi-source remote sensing image segmentation and object detection  ap. 7343-7367.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAppearances and qualities of remote sensing images are affected by different atmospheric conditions, quality of sensors, and radiometric calibrations. This heavily challenges the generalization ability of a deep learning or other machine learning model: the performance of a model pretrained on a source remote sensing data set can significantly decrease when applied to a different target data set. The popular generative adversarial networks (GANs) can realize style or appearance transfer between a source and target data sets, which may boost the performance of a deep learning model through generating new target images similar to source samples. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of GAN-based image-level transfer methods on convolutional neural network (CNN) based image processing models that are trained on one dataset and tested on another one. Firstly, we designed the framework for the evaluation process. The framework consists of two main parts, the GAN-based image-level domain adaptation, which transfers a target image to a new image with similar probability distribution of source image space, and the CNN-based image processing tasks, which are used to test the effects of GAN-based domain adaptation. Second, the domain adaptation is implemented with two mainstream GAN methods for style transfer, the CycleGAN and the AgGAN. The image processing contains two major tasks, segmentation and object detection. The former and the latter are designed based on the widely applied U-Net and Faster R-CNN, respectively. Finally, three experiments, associated with three datasets, are designed to cover different application cases, a change detection case where temporal data is collected from the same scene, a two-city case where images are collected from different regions and a two-sensor case where images are obtained from aerial and satellite platforms respectively. Results revealed that, the GAN-based image transfer can significantly boost the performance of the segmentation model in the change detection case, however, it did not surpass conventional methods; in the other two cases, the GAN-based methods obtained worse results. In object detection, almost all the methods failed to boost the performance of the Faster R-CNN and the GAN-based methods performed the worst.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aneural networks 3aprobability distribution 3aradiometry 3asatellites 0agenerative adversarial networks 0adomain adaptation 0asegmentation 0aobject detection 0amulti-source remote sensing images1 aLuo, Muying1 aJi, Shunping1 aZhang, Li1 aLu, Meng0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 41, no. 19 p.7343-7367dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.17577823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015900165300001600324520105800340592002801398650001501426650001301441650001501454650002601469650001701495650002401512650001401536650001501550653001301565653000801578653001901586653001901605653001601624653001401640700001501654700001601669700001801685700001501703700001601718700001901734700001301753700001201766773011101778856008301889852000901972655001201981IND60553574420221122131858.0180831e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055357442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Xuehui10aUltrasensitive photoelectrochemical aptasensing of miR-155 using efficient and stable CH3NH3PbI3 quantum dots sensitized ZnO nanosheets as light harvester  ap. 142-150.  aAn ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on a novel signal amplification strategy was developed for the quantitative determination of microRNA (miR)-155. CH3NH3PbI3 quantum dots (QDs) functionalized ZnO nanosheets (NSs) were employed as the light harvester. Owing to the synergetic effect between CH3NH3PbI3 QDs and ZnO NSs, ZnO@CH3NH3PbI3 can provide an obviously increasing PEC signal by forming the heterojunction. Due to the larger steric hindrance, the sensitive decrease of the PEC signal can be achieved by the specific recognition between the primers and ssDNA of miR-155. In this sense, this developed aptasensor can achieve a high sensitivity (especially in the presence of the low concentrations of miR-155) and a wide detection range (0.01fmol/L to 20,000pmol/L). Under the optimal conditions, the proposed aptasensor offered an ultrasensitive and specific determination of miR-155 down to 0.005fmol/L. This aptassay method would open up a new promising platform at ultralow levels for early diagnose of different miRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3amicroRNA 3ananosheets 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantum dots 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asynergism 3azinc oxide 0aMicroRNA 0aPEC 0aZnO@CH3NH3PbI3 0aHeterojunction 0aQuantum dot 0aNanosheet1 aQi, Jianni1 aZhang, Yong1 aRen, Yangyang1 aSu, Minhui1 aJia, Baoxiu1 aWang, Yaoguang1 aWei, Qin1 aDu, Bin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 85 p.142-150dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00762naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245005100138300001400189520012400203592002800327650001300355650002000368650001100388650001000399773010200409852000900511655001200520IND60612229920221120121303.0180905e198201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061222992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDANIELS, ELIZABETH W.10aWhy Children Eat Paint and Other Sweet Tidbits  ap. 18-22.  aWhy do sweet things taste sweet?

A random sampling approach was adopted in groundwater sampling in Khana and Gokana local government areas of Rivers State. Groundwater samples were collected from a total of twenty-two (22) boreholes in the area. Ten (10) residential boreholes were sampled in Khana while 12 boreholes were sampled in Gokana local government area. Various indices were used to determine the quality of groundwater for irrigation in the study area such as Electrical Conductivity (EC), Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Permeability Index (PI), Percent Sodium (%Na), Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR), Kelly’s Ratio (KR) and Potential Soil Salinity (PS). In Khana area, all the water samples have PI values which render the groundwater unsuitable for irrigational purposes. Meanwhile, in Gokana, the groundwater samples show good to excellent quality for irrigation purposes. A high permeability index enhances crops yield, because the soils becomes more aerated and allows flow to occur easily, carrying plant nutrients from one part of the soil to the other. All groundwater samples in the area plotted in the C1-S1 (low sodium hazard and low salinity), C2-S1 (low sodium hazard and moderate salinity) and C3-S1 (low sodium hazard and high salinity) category which represents low sodium hazard and low salinity hazards and are therefore suitable for irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadsorption 3aelectrical conductivity 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3alocal government 3amagnesium 3aoils 3apermeability 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asoil salinity 3awater quality 3aNigeria 3aPakistan 0amodeling 0aborehole 0asoil productivity 0aoil producing areas.1 aAmachree,  T0 tEarth sciences Pakistan.g2020 May, v. 4, no. 2 p.47-52dZibeline InternationalwJournal:27885x2521-29077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.26480/esp.02.2020.47.523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245026700166300001600433500001500449520071800464592002801182650001801210650000801228650003001236650002901266650001601295650001101311650001301322653001401335653001101349653003201360653002201392653001801414773015301432856007901585852000901664655001201673IND60522533320221118205703.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052253332DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1974-9-10212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeiderbeck, Rolf10a8 -Methoxypsoralen macht Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Kalanchoe daigremontiana und die Tumorinduktion empfindlich für langwelliges UV / 8-Methoxypsoralen Makes Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Kalanchoe daigremontiana, and the Tumor Induction Sensitive for Long Wave UV  ap. 572-576.  a2019-12-06  aIf Agrobacterium tumefaciens is treated with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MP) and irradiated with long wave UV the subsequent growth of the bacteria is stopped whereas respiration continues for at least 7 hours.

However, they are targets of adulteration. This study evaluates the lipid quality of five brands of oral/enteral nutrition supplements incorporated with fish oil, available on the Brazilian market (Brazil, Holland, and Germany). The fatty acids are quantified by gas chromatography–flame ionization detection, and the lipid profile is acquired by direct electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry, to assess how fatty acids are present in those samples. The eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contents found ranged from 1.54 to 19.36% and 4.34 to 27.29%, respectively, in the form of triacylglycerols. However, brand 1 presents the lowest levels of EPA + DHA in its lipid composition, and in three brands, the addition of medium chain triglycerides is identified. The lipid quality assessment of these supplements allows an informed choice of appropriate supplements for the nutritional support of patients. Practical Applications: The study highlights and provides information of the lipid composition and fatty acids of oral/enteral nutrition supplements enriched with fish oil, indicated for malnourished patients. The findings allow health professionals to make a more informed choice of oral/enteral nutrition for the adequate treatment of patients. Fatty acids of five brands of oral/enteral nutrition supplements enriched with fish oil and available on the Brazilian market are quantified by gas chromatography–flame ionization detection, and the lipid profile is acquired by electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry.

Climate change is causing large-scale forest declines globally, in addition to distributional shifts of many tree species. Because environmental cues dictate insect seasonality and population success, climate change is also influencing tree-killing bark beetles. The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, is a major disturbance in Pinus forests of the western US. Using a mechanistic, phenology-based demographic model driven by downscaled daily temperature data, we describe recent and future spatial and temporal thermal suitability for mountain pine beetle population growth in a topographically complex region. Trends in model-predicted growth rates among Global Climate Models were similar and suggest that, relative to future trends, mountain pine beetle population growth within the past 60 years was most optimal at middle elevations and least optimal at the lowest and highest elevations. This trend aligns with observed mountain pine beetle-caused tree mortality that was greatest at middle elevations between 1997 and 2013, as estimated from Aerial Detection Surveys. However, thermal suitability for optimal phenological synchrony was predicted to shift in recent years, and by the end of the century, the best thermal habitats for mountain pine beetle will be at the lowest and highest elevations. Mechanistic demographic models are valuable tools for modelling future thermal regimes that may be both beneficial and maladaptive for mountain pine beetle population growth and subsequent tree mortality.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Forest Service  cUSDA Forest Service 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aPinus 3abark 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforestry 3aforests 3aphenology 3apopulation growth 3atemperature 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aWestern United States1 aDuncan, Jacob P.1 aPowell, James A.0 tForestry.dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:jnl45842x1464-36267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpv0543Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003600112245015300148300001600301506002800317520154000345592002801885506003701913650001201950650001801962650001401980650000901994650001502003650002102018650001502039653001802054653001302072653001402085653000902099653001102108700001802119700001902137773013702156852000902293655001202302IND60784922820221207064308.0190504e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078492282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNia, Seyedeh Sadaneh Tabatabaei10aHistological investigation of the effects of nano titanium dioxide on the development of the first mandibular molar bud in NMRI mouse strain in vivo  ap. 137-146.  aResource is Open Access  aNowadays, with the applications of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) in pharmacy, food industry, cosmetics, toothpaste and sunscreens, pregnant women are exposed to nanoparticles. Since tooth development is vuln-erable to environmental impacts and mandibular first molar bud develops before maxillary first molar bud, in this ex-perimental study the effects of TiO2-NPs on the development of first mandibular molar bud in NMRI mouse was inve-stigated. Twenty five female NMRI mice were randomly divided into five groups (N=5); Control group (pregnant mice without any treatment), sham group (treated with distilled water), experimental groups 1, 2 and 3 (treated with 50, 150 and 500 mg/kg BW TiO2-NPs, respectively, via gavage from embryonic days 10.5-14.5). On E14.5, embryos heads were prepared for histological examination and dental tissues were evaluated. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc test (Tukey). Microscopic observation showed tissue disorganization in experimental groups. Findings showed that in experimental groups 1 and 2, the diameter of bud and dental papilla and the length of dental bud decreased sign-ificantly. In experimental group 2, decrease in the diameter of dental follicle, dental bud and dental papilla and the le-ngth of dental bud was significant. On the other hand, in experimental group 3, only the decrease in the length of dental bud was significant. These findings showed that nano titanium dioxide can reduce the size of dental buds and is capable of preventing tooth development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afemales 3afood industry 3ahistology 3amice 3amicroscopy 3atitanium dioxide 3atoothpaste 0aodontogenesis 0abud stag 0acap stage 0aTiO2 0agavage1 aFarhadi, Mona1 aParivar, Kazem0 tYāftah/hā-yi nuvīn dar ̒ulūm-i zīstī.g2017 Sept., v. 4, no. 2 p.137-146dKharazmi UniversitywJournal:27935x2476-71157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle00856naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245004800133300001400181520024800195592002800443650001200471650002000483650001200503773010200515852000900617655001200626IND60612230020221121080949.0180905e198201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061223002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBray, George A.,10a“Brown‘’ Tissue and Metabolic Obesity  ap. 23-25.  aMore and more experts in trying to solve the riddle of obesity are becoming intrigued with the role that so-called brown tissue might play.

Although AO genes have been studied in depth, some articles have mistakenly identified AO homologues as AO genes. Overall, the divergence between AO genes and AO homologues has not been explored. Meanwhile, there is little information concerning AO and the AO homologue with respect to Camellia sinensis. In the present study, one CsAO homologue and three CsAOs were confirmed by RT-PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing. Multicopper oxidase type 1 (PF00394), type 2 (PF07731) or type 3 (PF07732) domains and one transmembrane helix were the key domains for each member of the cupredoxin family. The CsAOs with their counterparts from seven dicotyledonous plants and three monocotyledonous plants were used to build phylogenetic tree and compare the deduced polypeptides. CsAO may be strongly expressed in the stretch expanded tissues, including bud and root. The abiotic stress-induced expression pattern of the CsAO homologue (CsAO2) is similar to those of CsAO1, CsAO3 and CsAO4. A new and very large group of AO homologues, which may function as AO genes, was present in both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. Our study may help in identifying stress-responsive AO genes of plants.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31270729].  aPublisher supplied data  a31270729cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aCamellia sinensis 3aascorbate oxidase 3acell growth 3agene expression regulation 3amolecular cloning 3amultigene family 3aphylogeny 3apolypeptides 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atissues 0aascorbate oxidase 0aascorbate oxidase homologue 0aabiotic stress 0aqRT-PCR 0aCamellia sinensis1 aPan, Cheng1 aYang, Yuan-Fei1 aWang, Lei-Gang1 aSun, Qi-Lu1 aPan, Yu-Ting1 aLi, Ye-Yun1 aJiang, Jia-Yue1 aJiang, Chang-Jun0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2019 Mar. 4, v. 94, no. 2 p.160-170dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2018.14955813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014800171300001400319520171600333592002802049650001902077650001602096650002502112650001202137650001102149650004302160650002102203650002702224650001802251650001002269650002402279650003602303653001702339653001702356653000902373653003002382653002102412653000802433653000802441653000902449653000802458653001102466653000902477653000902486653000902495653001002504653000802514653000802522653000802530653001002538653000802548700006302556700002002619700001702639700002702656773007402683856008402757852000902841655001202850IND60552238720221117005629.0161020e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055223872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2015.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Anuradha10aDifferential regulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and nuclear factor-κB by angiotensin II receptor subtypes in type 2 diabetic kidney  ap. 71-81.  aAngiotensin II (Ang II) acts through Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)/Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis to promote renal failure whereas the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R)/Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Ang1–7/Mas axis constitutes the protective arm of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS). Though Ang II has been known to activate the Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling pathway through different receptor subtype(s) in different tissues under various diseases, the subtype orchestrating this stimulation in type 2 diabetic kidney remains elusive. ACE2, a protective monocarboxypeptidase, responsible for conversion of Ang II to Ang1–7, opposes the deleterious effects of RAS pathway but how its expression is altered with blockade of AT1R and AT2R is not yet known. Hence, the present study was conceived to understand the regulation of NF-κB and ACE2 by using specific AT1 and AT2 receptor antagonists in non-genetic model of type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Our results show that the AT1R and AT2R antagonists lead to the repression and activation of NF-κB signalling pathway, respectively which suggests the role of AT1R in NF-κB activation. The blockade of AT2R led to an increase in ACE2 expression, which may be a compensatory response to the drastically increased inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress in the diabetic kidney. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the differential regulation of NF-κB and ACE2 by Ang II receptor subtypes and thus this study improves our understanding regarding regulation of inflammatory cascade and ACE2 by AT1R and AT2R in type 2 diabetic kidney, which may help in designing novel strategies to combat the disease in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiotensin II 3aantagonists 3adiabetic nephropathy 3akidneys 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arenal failure 3arenin 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aAT1 receptor 0aAT2 receptor 0aACE2 0aNF-кB signalling pathway 0aOxidative stress 0aRAS 0aT2D 0aT2DN 0aNOX 0aAng II 0aAT1R 0aAT2R 0aACE2 0aKeap1 0aSTZ 0aHFD 0aNPD 0aTBARS 0aSBP1 aGoru, Santosh Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4420-34351 aKadakol, Almesh1 aMalek, Vajir1 aGaikwad, Anil Bhanudas0 tBiochimie.g2015 Nov., v. 118 p.71-81dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2015.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012100171520140100292592002801693650001301721650002101734650001401755650001401769650001801783650001101801650001501812650002101827650002201848650001701870651001001887653001801897653003401915653001701949653002701966653003201993700001302025773010902038856009002147852000902237655001202246IND60767124720221120103324.0220621e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076712472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.1043802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Qiang10aHow does town planning affect urban-rural income inequality: Evidence from China with simultaneous equation analysis  aDue to the triple process of marketization, decentralization, and globalization, China has become one of the most unequal countries since the beginning of the new century. Though a huge volume of research has investigated the mechanism of China’s urban–rural income disparity, few studies have examined the influence of urban/town planning, which is regarded as a value creation tool in regional development. With a panel data of 30 provinces/municipalities in mainland China during the period 2008–2019, the paper explores the causality correlation between urban–rural income inequality and town planning. The results of Granger causality tests and the simultaneous equation model show that town planning has both direct and indirect influences on urban–rural income inequality. The impact of the government’s planning expenditure on urban–rural income inequality is positive, while that of the coverage of town planning and the size of planning staffing is negative. These findings indicate that, though China’s town planning is pro-growth orientated in the context of rapid urbanization, town planners are increasingly concerned about social equality. Therefore, we argue that town planning is an important coordination instrument for the urban–rural disparity. The local government should enhance the coverage of town planning and the education of advocacy planning as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3adecentralization 3aeducation 3aequations 3aglobalization 3aincome 3alandscapes 3alocal government 3asocial inequality 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aTown planning 0aUrban-rural income inequality 0aUrbanization 0aGranger causality test 0aSimultaneous equation model1 aShi, Wei0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2022 May, v. 221 p.104380-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.1043803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245008300162300001400245520152900259592002801788650002301816650002201839650001901861650001901880650001901899650001201918650001601930650001101946650001001957650001501967650001301982651001701995651001802012653002502030653002002055653003202075653001902107700002402126700003102150700003202181700002402213700002002237700002302257773010802280856007802388961001202466852000902478655001202487IND60569456220221121200735.0170529e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056945622DNAL7 a10.1653/024.100.01062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallman, Guy J.10aPhytosanitary Cold Treatment Against Anastrepha grandis (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 29-31.  aAnastrepha grandis (Macquart) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is endemic to the lowland Andean region of South America and considered a quarantine pest of cucurbits by most tropical and subtropical countries outside of the infested region. Despite its regulatory significance, the only phytosanitary treatment available is a generic phytosanitary irradiation dose of 150 Gy that is accepted for all Tephritidae but that was developed without any data on radiotolerance of A. grandis. The objectives of this research were to determine the most cold-tolerant developmental stage of A. grandis and to estimate a time period required for a phytosanitary cold treatment in zucchini squash, Cucurbita pepo L. (Cucurbitaceae). The most cold-tolerant developmental stage of A. grandis in fruit was the 3rd instar, and the time required for a phytosanitary cold treatment in zucchini squash when treated at a minimum of 1.0 °C was estimated at ~23 d. This indicates that A. grandis is approximately as cold tolerant as the most cold-tolerant Anastrepha species known, i.e., Anastrepha ludens (Loew). However, in small-scale testing, no survivors were found at 14 d (n = 340) and the estimated time of 23 d needs to be confirmed by large-scale testing before it should be used commercially. As statistical estimates of extreme values (>99.9%) are not very reliable, and data from 3rd instars did not fit the model well, large-scale testing should be initiated at a treatment time <23 d to not result in an excessive commercial treatment dose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnastrepha grandis 3aAnastrepha ludens 3aCucurbita pepo 3acold tolerance 3acold treatment 3ainstars 3airradiation 3amodels 3apests 3aquarantine 3azucchini 3aAndes region 3aSouth America 0aquarantine treatment 0aphytosanitation 0aSouth American cucurbit fly 0aCucurbita pepo1 aMaset, Bruno Aguiar1 aMartínez, Elena I.

The effects of solvents such as water and ethylene glycol on the morphology and size of the Bi₂S₃ nanostructures were studied. A structural study showed an orthorhombic phase of Bi₂S₃. We observed nanorods 30–50 nm in diameter and dandelion flowers assembled with these nanorods. A formation mechanism for the hierarchical nanostructures of Bi₂S₃ is proposed. Based on the tuneable band gap of these nanostructures in the visible and near-IR regions, we demonstrated the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from H₂S under normal sunlight. Abundantly available toxic H₂S was used to produce hydrogen under normal sunlight conditions. We observed an excellent hydrogen production of 8.88 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ under sunlight (on a sunny day between 11.30 am and 2.30 pm) for the Bi₂S₃ flowers and 7.08 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ for the nanorods. The hierarchical nanostructures suppress charge carrier recombination as a result of defects, which is ultimately responsible for the higher activity. The evolution of the hydrogen obtained is fairly stable when the catalyst is used repeatedly. The evolution of hydrogen via water splitting was observed to be lower than that via H₂S splitting. Bi₂S₃ was observed to be a good eco-friendly photocatalyst active under natural sunlight. The photo-response study showed that the Bi₂S₃ microstructures are good candidates for applications in highly sensitive photo-detectors and photo-electronic switches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaraxacum 3abismuth 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amicrostructure 3ananorods 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asolar radiation 3asolvents 3atoxicity1 aPanmand, R.

However, its hygroscopic nature has prompted the quest for water-resistant alternatives. Recent studies have suggested that mixing MAPI with lower dimensional, bulky-A-site-cation perovskites helps mitigate this environmental instability. On the other hand, low dimensional perovskites suffer from poor device performance, which has been suggested to be due to limited out-of-plane charge carrier mobility resulting from structural dimensionality and large binding energy of the charge carriers. To understand the effects of dimensionality on performance, we systematically mixed MA-based 3D perovskites with larger A-site cations to produce dimethylammonium, iso-propylammonium, and t-butylammonium lead iodide perovskites. During the shift from MAPI to lower dimensional (LD) PSCs, the efficiency is significantly reduced by 2 orders of magnitude, with short-circuit current densities decreasing from above 20 mA cm⁻² to less than 1 mA cm⁻². In order to explain this decrease in performance, we studied the charge carrier mobilities of these materials using optical-pump/terahertz-probe, time-resolved microwave photoconductivity, and photoluminescence measurements. The results show that as we add more of the low dimensional perovskites, the mobility decreases, up to a factor of 20 when it reaches pure LD perovskites. In addition, the photoluminescence decay fitting is slightly slower for the mixed perovskites, suggesting some improvement in the recombination dynamics. These findings indicate that changes in structural dimensionality brought about by mixing A-site cations play an important role in determining the measured charge carrier mobility, and in the performance of perovskite solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3aenergy 3amixing 3aphotoluminescence 3asolar cells1 aSun, Shijing1 aGélvez-Rueda, María C.1 aPierone, Polly J.1 aErodici, Matthew P.1 aYoo, Jason1 aWei, Fengxia1 aBawendi, Moungi1 aGrozema, Ferdinand C.1 aSher, Meng-ju1 aBuonassisi, Tonio1 aCorrea-Baena, Juan-Pablo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Oct. 22, v. 7, no. 41 p.23949-23957dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta05241k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245006800203300001200271506007600283520115800359592002801517506003701545650002001582650001001602650001701612650000901629650001301638650001301651650001501664700002201679700002301701700002201724700002501746700002501771700001901796773009701815856004501912852000901957655001201966IND4471325220221207082936.0130327e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447132522DNAL7 a10.1186/1746-6148-8-982doi7 aPMC34534962pmcid7 a227476392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahal, Sheila C10aCongenital deformity of the paw in a captive tiger: case report  ap. 413.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The aim of this report was to describe the clinical signs, diagnostic approach, treatment and outcome in the case of a tiger with a deformity of the paw. CASE PRESENTATION: A 1.5-year-old tiger (Panthera tigris) was presented with lameness of the left thoracic limb. A deformity involving the first and second metacarpal bones, and a soft tissue separation between the second and third metacarpal bones of the left front paw were observed. The second digit constantly struck the ground during locomotion. Based on the physical and radiographic evaluations, a diagnosis of ectrodactyly was made. A soft tissue reconstruction of the cleft with excision of both the second digit and distal portion of the second metacarpal bone was performed. Marked improvement of the locomotion was observed after surgical treatment, although the tiger showed a low degree of lameness probably associated with the discrepancy in length between the thoracic limbs. CONCLUSION: This report shows a rare deformity in an exotic feline that it is compatible to ectrodactyly. Reconstructive surgery of the cleft resulted in significant improvement of limb function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPanthera tigris 3abones 3acase studies 3acats 3aexcision 3alameness 3alocomotion1 aVolpi, Reinaldo S1 aTeixeira, Carlos R1 aMachado, Vania MV1 aSoares, Guilherme DP1 aNeto, Carlos Ramires1 aLinn, Kathleen0 tBMC veterinary research.g2012 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.413-413dSpringer-Verlagx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-98  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011700159300001600276520091300292592002801205650001001233650002101243650001801264650001401282650001601296650000901312650002101321650002101342650002101363650001401384700001901398700002001417700002301437700002001460700002001480700001901500700002201519700001901541700001901560773014701579856007301726852000901799655001201808IND60518229020221118192522.0160409e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051822902DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.124552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaniguchi, Saya10aRelationships between immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G or A in colostrum of Japanese black multiparous cows  ap. 536-540.  aThis study was conducted to clarify the relationships among immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgG, IgA, β‐carotene, vitamin A and α‐tocopherol contents in colostrum of 24 Japanese Black multiparous cows in order to evaluate the role of IgM on colostral IgG and IgA production. Compared with colostral IgG, colostral IgM and IgA were very low but varied widely. There was positive correlation between colostral IgM and IgG, but colostral IgM was not related with colostral IgA. There was no relationship between colostral IgM and age of cows, although colostral IgG was increased with aging. There were positive correlations among colostral β‐carotene, vitamin A and α‐tocopherol and these vitamins were positively correlated with colostral IgM and IgG. These results indicate that fat‐soluble vitamins may affect colostral IgG and IgM in cows and colostral IgG increases with the increase of colostral IgM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWagyu 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abeta-carotene 3acolostrum 3acorrelation 3acows 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3avitamin A1 aWang, Mengdong1 aIkeda, Shuntaro1 aYoshioka, Hidetugu1 aNagase, Hiroshi1 aKitamura, Shoko1 aItoyama, Erina1 aMurakami, Hiroaki1 aSugimoto, Miki1 aKume, Shinichi0 tAnimal science journal =.g2016 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.536-540dJapanese Society of Zootechnical Science, Jan. 1999-<Apr. 2003>x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.124553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245023100161300002000392520180100412592002802213650002202241650001502263650002202278650002202300650002802322650002402350650001402374650001902388650001102407650001902418650001702437650001802454650003302472650003702505700003002542700003102572700002302603700002002626700002302646700002502669773012502694856007402819852000902893655001202902IND60666756420221119005130.0190919e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066675642DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra07145j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazra, Subhenjit10aDevelopment of a novel one-pot synthetic method for the preparation of (Mn₀.₂Ni₀.₄Zn₀.₄Fe₂O₄)ₓ–(BaFe₁₂O₁₉)₁₋ₓ nanocomposites and the study of their microwave absorption and magnetic properties  ap. 45715-45725.  aThe development of a simple yet novel aqueous solution based ‘one-pot’ method has been reported for the preparation of nanocomposites composed of soft ferrite (Mn₀.₂Ni₀.₄Zn₀.₄Fe₂O₄) and hard ferrite (BaFe₁₂O₁₉) phases. A physical mixing method has also been employed to prepare nanocomposites having the same compositions. The effects of synthetic methodologies on the microstructures of the nanocomposites as well as their magnetic and microwave absorption properties have been evaluated. The crystal structures and microstructures of these composites have been investigated using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In the nanocomposites prepared by both methods, the presence of nanocrystalline Mn₀.₂Ni₀.₄Zn₀.₄Fe₂O₄ and BaFe₁₂O₁₉ phases were detected. However, nanocomposites prepared by the one-pot method possessed better homogeneous distribution of hard and soft ferrite phases than the nanocomposites prepared by the physical mixing method. Very good spring exchange coupling interaction between the hard and soft ferrite phases was observed for the nanocomposites prepared by the one-pot method and these composites exhibited magnetically single phase behaviour. The spring exchange coupling interaction enhanced the magnetic properties (high saturation magnetization and coercivity) and microwave absorption properties of the nanocomposites prepared by the one-pot method, in comparison with the nanocomposites prepared by the physical mixing method as well as pure Mn₀.₂Ni₀.₄Zn₀.₄Fe₂O₄ and BaFe₁₂O₁₉ nanoparticles. The minimum reflection loss of the composites was found to be ∼−25 dB (i.e. >99% absorption) at 8.2 GHz with an absorber thickness of 3.5 mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acrystal structure 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3amicrostructure 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aGhosha, Baruṇa Kumāra,1 aJoshi, Hrishikesh Ravindra1 aPatra, Manoj Kumar1 aJani, Raj Kumar1 aVadera, Sampat Raj1 aGhosh, Narendra Nath0 tRSC advances.g2014 Sept. 24, v. 4, no. 86 p.45715-45725dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra07145j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010100161300001600262520131800278592002801596650002301624650002401647650001601671650002001687650001601707650000901723650001801732650002501750650002601775650001801801700001501819700001801834700001501852700001301867700001701880773011201897856004802009852000902057655001202066IND4468803520221117164436.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446880352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-012-1752-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yunfei10aRapid detection method for nitrofuran antibiotic residues by surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy  ap. 555-561.  aNitrofurans are a group of widely used veterinary antibiotics which have been forbidden in many countries. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with gold nanoparticles was used in this study for the rapid detection and characterization of nitrofuran antibiotics (including furadantin, furaltadone, and their mixture). Density functional theory calculations were conducted with Gaussian 03 at the B3LYP level using the 6-31G(d) basis set to analyze the assignment of vibrations. The SERS measurement of nitrofuran antibiotics has been investigated by active SERS substrate of gold nanoparticles with average size around 50 nm. The SERS qualitative analysis has been studied for furadantin and furaltadone by their characteristic SERS peaks. The peaks at 1,420 and 1,456 cm−1 could be used to discriminate between the two compounds in a mixture. The SERS peaks at 1,008 and 1,162 cm−1 were used as the index of quantitative analysis for furadantin and furaltadone, respectively. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection could reach the level of 5 ppm. The results showed that the SERS method with gold nanoparticles is capable of identifying and characterizing furaltadone and furadantin, which is valuable to be further applied on the detection of antibiotic residues in food samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibiotics 3adetection limit 3afuraltadone 3agold 3ananoparticles 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods1 aZhu, Xinyu1 aSun, Yingying1 aWang, Heya1 aQian, He1 aYao, Weirong0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2012 Sept., v. 235, no. 3 p.555-561dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-012-1752-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007100159300001800230520094300248592002801191650001501219650002701234650002301261650001401284650001701298650001001315650001601325650001301341650001101354650001501365650002001380650002001400650001601420650001601436700002001452700002901472700001701501773012201518856007401640852000901714655001201723IND60664786020221119061938.0190912e20140207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066478602DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra46555a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthamizhi, K.10aInvestigation and modelling of surface tension of power-law fluids  ap. 9771-9776.  aThermo-physical properties of power-law fluids are both required for engineering and product design applications in food, drugs, cosmetics and agriculture. Surface tension not only determines the quality of many of the products resulting from different industries as noted before, but also affects some important steps in the production process: catalysis, adsorption, distillation and extraction, etc. This study involved the measurement of surface tension of power-law fluids (xanthan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose and sodium alginate) using the drop weight method for the concentration range of 0.1–0.6% w/w and temperature range of 293.15–333.15 K. The experimental measurements are often unavailable, expensive and time consuming; hence a model has been developed for predicting the surface tension of power-law fluids. Central composite rotatable design-response surface methodology (CCRD-RSM) has been used for model prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acatalytic activity 3acosmetics 3adistillation 3adrugs 3aengineering 3aindustry 3amodels 3aprediction 3asodium alginate 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3axanthan gum1 aKalaichelvi, P.1 aPowar, Shubhangi Tukaram1 aJaishree, R.0 tRSC advances.g2014 Feb. 07, v. 4, no. 19 p.9771-9776dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra46555a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245007200209300001600281500001100297520137700308592002801685650001201713650001901725650001201744650001501756650001601771650001001787650001101797650001501808650001101823650001501834651002601849773013701875856008102012852000902093655001202102IND60620795720221122024834.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062079572DNAL7 a10.1007/s40641-018-0109-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLittell, Jeremy S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5302-828010aDrought and Fire in the Western USA: Is Climate Attribution Enough?  ap. 396-406.  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: I sought to review the contributions of recent literature and prior foundational papers to our understanding of drought and fire. In this review, I summarize recent literature on drought and fire in the western USA and discuss research directions that may increase the utility of that body of work for twenty-first century application. I then describe gaps in the synthetic knowledge of drought-driven fire in managed ecosystems and use concepts from use-inspired research to describe potentially useful extensions of current work. RECENT FINDINGS: Fire responses to climate, and specifically various kinds of drought, are clear, but vary widely with fuel responses to surplus water and drought at different timescales. Ecological and physical factors interact with human management and ignitions to create fire regime and landscape trajectories that challenge prediction. The mechanisms by which the climate system affects regional droughts and how they translate to fire in the western USA need more attention to accelerate both forecasting and adaptation. However, projections of future fire activity under climate change will require integrated advances on both fronts to achieve decision-relevant modeling. Concepts from transdisciplinary research and coupled human-natural systems can help frame strategic work to address fire in a changing world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3afire regime 3afuels 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3aWestern United States0 tCurrent climate change reports.g2018 Dec., v. 4, no. 4 p.396-406dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22893x2198-60617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40641-018-0109-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008200164300001600246500001100262520122500273592002801498650000801526650001901534650001001553650002601563650002001589650001701609650003001626650001701656650002201673700001901695700001801714773014001732856008101872852000901953655001201962IND60614253420221121101854.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061425342DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-018-8238-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Eun-Ji10aProgress of analytical tools and techniques for human gut microbiome research  ap. 693-705.  aReview  aMassive DNA sequencing studies have expanded our insights and understanding of the ecological and functional characteristics of the gut microbiome. Advanced sequencing technologies allow us to understand the close association of the gut microbiome with human health and critical illnesses. In the future, analyses of the gut microbiome will provide key information associating with human individual health, which will help provide personalized health care for diseases. Numerous molecular biological analysis tools have been rapidly developed and employed for the gut microbiome researches; however, methodological differences among researchers lead to inconsistent data, limiting extensive share of data. It is therefore very essential to standardize the current methodologies and establish appropriate pipelines for human gut microbiome research. Herein, we review the methods and procedures currently available for studying the human gut microbiome, including fecal sample collection, metagenomic DNA extraction, massive DNA sequencing, and data analyses with bioinformatics. We believe that this review will contribute to the progress of gut microbiome research in the clinical and practical aspects of human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abioinformatics 3afeces 3afunctional properties 3ahealth services 3ahuman health 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametagenomics 3asequence analysis1 aLee, Eun Sook,1 aNam, Young-Do0 tjournal of microbiology.g2018 Oct., v. 56, no. 10 p.693-705dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-018-8238-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015800156300001800314520093500332592002801267650001401295650001401309650002101323650001301344650001301357650002201370700001801392700001201410700001501422700001701437700001701454700001601471700001901487773014101506856007401647852000901721655001201730IND60641759920221120034130.0190506e20160607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064175992DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta00945j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Jianwei10aCo₃ZnC/Co nano heterojunctions encapsulated in N-doped graphene layers derived from PBAs as highly efficient bi-functional OER and ORR electrocatalysts  ap. 9204-9212.  aThe oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key half reaction involved in electrochemical water splitting. However, it is kinetically not favored and hence requires highly active electrocatalysts. Non-precious metal based catalysts have emerged as the most promising materials for the replacement of state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts. However, more progress is still needed to improve the activity and stability of these catalysts. Herein, we synthesized Co₃ZnC/Co nanojunctions encapsulated in highly nitrogen doped graphene layers by one-step annealing of Prussian blue analogues (PBA). The catalyst shows a low overpotential of only 366 mV at 10 mA cm⁻², which is superior to state-of-the-art commercial RuO₂ catalysts. Besides, it exhibits a better performance compared with similar metallic carbide-based catalysts towards ORR with an onset potential and cathodic peak potential at 0.912 V and 0.814 V, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3anitrogen 3aoxygen production1 aXia, Guoliang1 aLi, Ran1 aYang, Yang1 aChen, Jitang1 aShi, Ruohong1 aJiang, Peng1 aChen, Qianwang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 June 7, v. 4, no. 23 p.9204-9212dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta00945j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010100168300001800269520124600287592002801533650001401561650001501575650001001590650001601600650001301616650002101629700001801650700001801668700002201686700002001708700005601728773011201784856008301896852000901979655001201988IND60794527320221120211123.0220925e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079452732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04809-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandlez, Daniel10aQuantifying the contribution of fines production during refining to the resulting paper strength  ap. 8811-8826.  aPulp refining is an essential process step prior to paper production. The contribution of fines production during refining to the resulting paper strength so far has mostly been considered qualitatively. A quantitative and experimental evaluation regarding their effect has not yet been published. Unbleached softwood kraft pulp was refined using a PFI mill and a disc refiner at different refining intensities. Prior to handsheet forming, fines were removed in a lab scale pressure screen from one part of the refined and unrefined samples in order to investigate the difference in tensile strength between sheets with and without fines, which were furthermore produced with and without additional wet pressing. It was found, that fines formed in a disc refiner at 250 kWh/t are responsible for up to 25% of the breaking length increase, while the PFI mill at 10,000 revolutions fines only contribute to a maximum of 12%. In terms of fines efficiency, the disc refiner was able to achieve higher results compared to the PFI mill, which however might be attributed to the higher fibre flexibilization in the PFI mill. Thus fines formed in the refining process are of high importance for strength development especially for the disc refiner.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3akraft pulp 3apaper 3apapermaking 3asoftwood 3atensile strength1 aKoller, Sarah1 aEckhart, Rene1 aKulachenko, Artem1 aBauer, Wolfgang1 aHirn, Ulrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1376-90760 tCellulose.g2022 Nov., v. 29, no. 16 p.8811-8826dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-022-04809-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013100170300002000301500001900321520166100340592002802001650004402029650003702073650001502110650001702125650001302142650002002155650001102175650002002186650002202206653001902228653002602247653002702273653002302300653001702323653002202340700002402362700002002386700005502406700005902461700007002520773014602590856008502736852000902821655001202830IND60717177320221120115731.0201109e20201028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071717732DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c057892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Aruna N.10aIn Situ Doping-Enabled Metal and Nonmetal Codoping in Graphene Quantum Dots: Synthesis and Application for Contaminant Sensing  ap. 16565-16576.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFluorescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared from low-cost and sustainable precursors are highly desirable for various applications, including luminescence-based sensing, optoelectronics, and bioimaging. Among different natural precursors, the unique structural and compositional variety and the abundance of aromatic carbon in lignin make it a unique and renewable precursor for the green synthesis of advanced carbon-based materials including GQDs. However, the inferior photoluminescence quantum yield of GQDs prepared from natural precursors, including lignin, limits their practical utility. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that the presence of heteroatoms in the innate structure of lignosulfonate can be leveraged to derive in situ heteroatom-doped GQDs with excellent photophysical properties. The as-synthesized lignosulfonate-derived GQDs showed compelling blue fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 23%, which is attributed to in situ S and N doping as confirmed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. Assisted by the in situ doping, we further engineered the lignosulfonate-derived GQDs by incorporating a metal atom dopant to derive an enhanced quantum yield of 31%, the highest for any lignin-derived GQDs. Moreover, fundamental photoluminescence studies reveal the presence of multiple emissive centers, with edge states acting as dominant emission centers. Finally, we also demonstrate the applicability of the luminescent, metal- and nonmetal-codoped lignin-derived GQDs as a highly selective sensor for the sub-nanomolar level detection of mercuric ions in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abioimaging 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3agreen chemistry 3alignin 3alignosulfonates 3aphotoluminescence 0alignosulfonate 0agraphene quantum dots 0ahydrothermal synthesis 0ain situ S,N doping 0ametal doping 0amercury detection1 aChava, Venkata S.N.1 aBose, Saptasree1 aZheng, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4115-46261 aPilla, Srikanth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3728-65781 aSreenivasan, Sreeprasad T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5728-05120 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Oct. 28, v. 8, no. 44 p.16565-16576dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c057893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04075naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001900167245015800186300001600344500001500360520173300375592002802108650001502136650001202151650001602163650002202179650002002201650001702221650002002238650002502258650001102283650001602294650001402310650002302324650001202347650002102359650001802380650001802398650002302416650001002439650001602449650002602465650003002491650002502521650003702546650002002583650003402603650002802637650002002665650001402685650002802699650002702727653000902754653002402763653001002787653001502797653000702812653000902819653000702828653000802835653002502843653000902868653000702877653001902884653002002903653000802923653001802931653000702949653000902956653001102965653002402976653000903000700001603009700001903025773007403044856008203118852000903200655001203209IND60099030020221116204239.0161021e20130225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009903002DNAL7 a232200202pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiushuai14aThe complete mitochondrial genome of Biston panterinaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), with phylogenetic utility of mitochondrial genome in the Lepidoptera  ap. 349-358.  a2019-12-06  aThe complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the Chinese pistacia looper Biston panterinaria was sequenced and annotated (15,517bp). It contains the typical 37 genes of animal mitogenomes and a high A+T content (79.5%). All protein coding genes (PCGs) use standard ATN initiation codons except for cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COX1) with CGA. Eleven PCGs use a common stop codon of TAA or TAG, whereas COX2 and NADH dehydrogenase 4 (ND4) use a single T. All transfer RNA (tRNA) genes have the typical clover-leaf structure with the exception of tRNASer(AGN). We reconstructed a preliminary mitochondrial phylogeny of six ditrysian superfamilies and performed comparative analyses of inference methods (Bayesian Inference (BI), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Maximum Parsimony (MP)), dataset compositions (including and excluding 3rd codon positions), and alignment methods (Muscle, Clustal W, and MAFFT). Our analyses indicated that inference methods and dataset compositions more significantly affected the phylogenetic results than alignment methods. BI analysis consistently revealed uncontroversial relationships with all dataset compositions. By contrast, ML analysis failed to reconstruct stable phylogeny at two nodes, whereas MP analysis had more difficulties in the tree resolution and nodal support. Distinct from most previous studies, our analyses revealed that Geometroidea had a closer lineage relationship with Bombycoidea than Noctuoidea. Similar to previous molecular studies, our analyses revealed that Hesperiidae were nested in the Papilionoidea clade, providing further evidence to the previous concept that Papilionoidea was paraphyletic, and none of the butterflies were associated with the Macroheterocera.  aPublisher supplied data 3astop codon 3aanimals 3aHesperiidae 3amitochondrial DNA 3adata collection 3atransfer RNA 3aBayesian theory 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aBiston 3abutterflies 3aparaphyly 3aNADH dehydrogenase 2aAnimals 2aBase Composition 2aBase Sequence 2aBayes Theorem 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCodon 2aGenes, rRNA 2aGenome, Mitochondrial 2aInsect Proteinsxgenetics 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMothsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Transferxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0arRNA 0aBiston panterinaria 0agenes 0aMitogenome 0aMP 0aTΨC 0aBP 0aDHU 0aMitochondrial genome 0aPCGs 0aML 0aND1-6 and ND4L 0alrRNA and srRNA 0aPCR 0aATP6 and ATP8 0aBI 0aCYTB 0aCOX1-3 0aMolecular phylogeny 0atRNA1 aXue, Dayong1 aHan, Hongxiang0 tGene.g2013 Feb. 25, v. 515 p.349-358dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007600166300001800242520134800260592002801608596007301636650002201709650002101731650001601752650001401768650002001782650002601802650002401828650001201852650001801864650000701882650001901889650001601908700001501924700001401939700001401953700001701967700005601984773011202040856008302152852000902235655001202244IND60794527620221120190340.0220925e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079452762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04810-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Chunyang10aCellulose-based functional polycarbonates as degradable enzyme carriers  ap. 8769-8780.  aCellulose-based matrices are expected to be ideal enzyme carriers due to their sustainability and biocompatibility. However, the linkages between immobilized enzymes and celluloses often suffer from low-density and non-biodegradability, leading to inefficient loading of enzymes as well as persistent generation of solid wastes after reuse. In the present study, cellulose-based functional materials with degradable polycarbonates brushes have been successfully synthesized as enzyme carriers via ring-opening polymerization of 5-methyl-5-allyloxycarbonyl-1,3-dioxan-2-one (MAC) following with ally epoxidation of MAC units. After covalent bonding with laccase, the resulting HPC-PMAC-Laccase could assemble in aqueous solution to form spherical nanoparticles with an enzyme immobilization efficiency of 88%. The immobilized laccase showed more tolerance towards pH and high temperature compared with free laccase. Moreover, the immobilized laccase demonstrated effective removal efficiency of bisphenol A and reached 83% in 3 h. After repeated usage for 8 times, the HPC-PMAC-Laccase still maintained relatively high enzyme activity. Especially, the polycarbonates brushes in the enzyme carriers could be totally hydrolyzed in 12 h to achieve its degradable property.

The influence of water level fluctuations on vegetation distribution is of growing interest as wetlands are increasingly disturbed by climate change and intensive human activity. Based on time series MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery from 2000 to 2012, we investigated the spatial–temporal dynamics of wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake using a combined Sen’s slope and Mann–Kendall (MK) test approach, and explored their correlations with water level fluctuations in different hydrological periods. The results showed that more than 34% of wetlands at lower elevations of Poyang Lake had experienced an increasing trend in the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), whereas EVI in about 11% of the wetlands at higher elevations decreased significantly. Responses of grassland area extracted from MODIS EVI were found to be more sensitive to water level fluctuations in the southern lakes. The change rate of grassland area decreased with the rising water level during the rising period, but increased with the rising water level during the retreating period. Correlations between grassland area and water level were much weaker in the dry period. In addition, we found fluctuations of the main water body had negligible effect on grassland area since the water level at Xingzi station was below 14 m. These results provide new insights for predicting future changes of wetland vegetation influenced by the ongoing threats from climate change and human activity, and form a foundation for ecosystem management of Poyang Lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aecosystem management 3agrasslands 3alakes 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3apopulation distribution 3aprediction 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3avegetation index 3awetlands 3aChina1 aJiang, Jiahu0 tWater.g2016 Sept. 13, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w80903973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005900188245011700247300001100364506007600375520190300451592002802354506003702382650002402419650001202443650001502455650001002470650001102480650002102491650002102512650001402533650001602547650002402563650002102587650001102608650001502619650002202634650001802656650001002674700002202684700001802706700002002724700002102744773013302765856008202898852000902980655001202989IND60614253920221207124224.0200721e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061425392DNAL7 a302945152pmid7 aPMC61538642pmcid7 a10.1186/s12302-018-0162-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmer, Elke I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7921-593010aModelling effects of time-variable exposure to the pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin on rainbow trout early life stages  ap. 36.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Available literature and regulatory studies show that the severity of effects of beta-cyfluthrin (a synthetic pyrethroid) on fish is influenced by the magnitude and duration of exposure. To investigate how the exposure pattern to beta-cyfluthrin (constant vs peak) may influence the response of the fish, we used a mechanistic effect model to predict the survival and growth of the rainbow trout over its early life stages (i.e. egg, alevin and swim-up fry). We parameterized a toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic (TKTD) module in combination with a dynamic energy budget model enabling us to describe uptake and elimination, as well as to predict the threshold concentration for survival and sublethal effects (feeding behaviour and growth). This effect model was calibrated using data from an early life stage experiment where trout was exposed to a constant concentration of cyfluthrin. The model was validated by comparing model predictions to independent data from a pulsed-exposure study with early life stages of rainbow trout. RESULTS: The co-occurrence of effects on behaviour and growth raised the possibility that these were interrelated, i.e. impairment of feeding behaviour may have led to reduced food intake and slower growth. We, therefore, included ‘effect on feeding’ as mode of action in the TKTD module. At higher concentrations, the constant exposure led to death. The model was able to adequately capture this effect pattern in the calibration. The model was able to adequately predict the response of fish eggs, alevins and swim-up fry, from both the qualitative (response pattern) and quantitative points of view. CONCLUSIONS: Since the model was successfully validated, it can be used to predict survival and growth of early life stages under various realistic time-variable exposure profiles (e.g. profiles from FOCUS surface water modelling) of beta-cyfluthrin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aalevins 3acyfluthrin 3adeath 3aenergy 3aexposure profile 3afeeding behavior 3afish eggs 3afood intake 3amechanism of action 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apyrethrins 3asublethal effects 3asurface water 3atrout1 aPreuss, Thomas G.1 aNorman, Steve1 aMinten, Barbara1 aDucrot, Virginie0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2018 Dec., v. 30, no. 1 p.36-36dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-018-0162-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013800159300001600297500001100313520149300324592002801817650001601845650002201861650001301883650001401896650001801910650002401928650002001952650002201972650001701994650002202011650001602033700002102049700002502070700002102095700002102116773009702137856007302234852000902307655001202316IND60522948420221120220451.0160604e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052294842DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.124132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlewitt, Claire10aAssociations between parent–child relationship quality and obesogenic risk in adolescence: a systematic review of recent literature  ap. 612-622.  aREVIEW  aAdolescence is a period of significant cognitive, social and physiological change, presenting unique risk factors for weight gain. Childhood obesity research has traditionally focused on the influence of parent‐level factors on children's eating and weight status. Increasingly, emphasis is turning towards the reciprocal nature of the parent–child relationship and its influence on health behaviour. A systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the relationship between parent–child relationship quality (defined as the felt emotional bond between parent and child) and obesogenic risk (weight status, eating attitudes and behaviours, level of physical activity and sedentary behaviour) in adolescence; 26 papers were included in the review. The results neither support nor challenge an association between parent–child relationship quality and weight, with study design flaws and limited measurement of the parent–child relationship precluding robust conclusions. The review does however suggests that several aspects of the parent–child relationship are important in understanding eating attitudes and behaviours, including the felt emotional bond between the parent and child, the child's perception of how much the parent cares for them and the mother's sensitivity towards the child. The need for further longitudinal research into the association between parent–child relationship quality and obesity risk across this developmental period is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acognition 3aeating habits 3aexperimental design 3ahealth behavior 3aphysical activity 3arisk factors 3asystematic review 3aweight gain1 aBergmeier, Heidi1 aMacdonald, Jacqui A.1 aOlsson, Craig A.1 aSkouteris, Helen0 tObesity reviews.g2016 July, v. 17, no. 7 p.612-622dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.124133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009600166300001600262520143600278592002801714650002801742650003301770650002501803650002901828650001601857650001001873650002101883650002001904650002001924650001701944650001901961650002101980650001902001650001802020650002402038650000902062650003702071650001302108650001102121650002002132650001402152650002402166650001602190650001102206650003202217653001502249653001902264653003002283700001602313700001502329700001402344700001302358700002002371773007602391856008402467852000902551655001202560IND60552239520221117005541.0161020e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055223952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2015.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Xuewei13aAn immunoregulatory peptide from tsetse fly salivary glands of Glossina morsitans morsitans  ap. 123-128.  aTsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans is an important insect vector of African trypanosomes, which cause human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). As other hematophagous arthropods, tsetse fly relies heavily on the pharmacological propriety of their saliva to suppress host's immune reactions and get blood meal. However little information is available on immune regulators from testes fly. An immunoregulatory peptide named Gloss 2 containing amino acid sequence of QKNDTAFSCHFFEIYL SNCFNKEKYIKNYLQIM has been identified from salivary glands of the tsetse fly of G. morsitans morsitans (Diptera: Glossinidae). Gloss 2 has the ability to inhibit the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ),interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse splenocytes. Besides, Gloss 2 significantly suppressed the LPS-induced activation of MAPK signaling pathway through blocking phosphorylations of JNK, Erk and P38. Gloss 2 probably inhibits host inflammatory responses by inhibiting secretion of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6. Considering IL-10's ability to promote humoral immune responses by enhancing class II expression B cells and inducing immunoglobulin (Ig) production, Gloss 2 may inhibit host humoral immune response by inhibiting IL-10 secretion. The immune-suppression may facilitate the blood feeding of tsetse fly and transmission of African trypanosomes to hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican trypanosomiasis 3aGlossina morsitans morsitans 3aamino acid sequences 3ahematophagous arthropods 3ahematophagy 3ahosts 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainflammation 3ainsect vectors 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anecrosis 3asaliva 3asalivary glands 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3asplenocytes 3atestes 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aTsetse fly 0aSalivary gland 0aImmunosuppressant peptide1 aYao, Huimin1 aDu, Canwei1 aChen, Yan1 aLai, Ren1 aRong, Mingqiang0 tBiochimie.g2015 Nov., v. 118 p.123-128dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2015.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015200171300002000323500001900343520143100362592002801793650001301821650001401834650002801848650001901876650002101895650001301916650002001929650001301949650001101962650001301973650001301986650001101999650001502010653002802025653002202053653002402075653003302099653003002132700002602162700006102188700002802249700007102277773014602348856008502494852000902579655001202588IND60717177620221123001109.0201109e20201027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071717762DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c059092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Rajneesh10aNitrogen and Sulfur Codoped Graphene Macroassemblies as High-Performance Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Microbial Fuel Cells  ap. 16591-16599.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) are receiving considerable attention for generating clean and sustainable electrical energy directly from wastewater. The development of highly efficient, durable, and inexpensive oxygen reduction electrocatalysts is vital to the fabrication of commercially viable MFCs. Herein, nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) codoped graphene aerogels (NSGAs) were synthesized hydrothermally via an environmentally benign method, and their application potential as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in double-chamber MFCs was systematically evaluated. The NSGAs displayed outstanding electrocatalytic activity for ORR in both cyclic voltammogram experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Further, when applied as cathodes in MFCs, the NSGAs could deliver a maximum volumetric power density of up to 13.78 ± 0.43 W m–³, which was nearly two times higher than that of the conventional platinum/carbon catalyst (7.01 ± 0.36 W m–³). The impressive electrocatalytic performance of the NSGAs can be attributed to their interconnected porosity, and the presence of N and S elements with diverse bonding states in their two-dimensional nanoscale building blocks. The outcome of this investigation lays out an important research direction for the development of the next generation of robust metal-free ORR electrocatalysts for application in MFCs and related devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3acatalysts 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3agreen chemistry 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3aporosity 3asulfur 3awastewater 0acathode electrocatalyst 0agraphene aerogels 0amicrobial fuel cell 0anitrogen and sulfur codoping 0aoxygen reduction reaction1 aChakraborty, Indrajit1 aChowdhury, Shamik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2183-92621 aGhangrekar, Makarand M.1 aBalasubramanian, Rajasekhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5627-36280 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Oct. 27, v. 8, no. 44 p.16591-16599dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c059093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245011800209300001800327506007600345520147700421592002801898506003701926650001601963650001701979650001601996650001202012650001502024650002102039650002302060650001202083650001302095650001202108650001402120650002202134650001502156650002002171650001302191650002002204650002002224650002002244700001602264700006102280773012802341856008402469852000902553655001202562IND60627019420221207105213.0190128e20181129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062701942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b040882doi7 aPMC64677272pmcid7 a304959342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Chunyang10aProtein-Metal-Ion Interactions Studied by Mass Spectrometry-Based Footprinting with Isotope-Encoded Benzhydrazide  ap. 1416-1423.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMetal ions, usually bound by various amino-acid side chains in proteins, play multiple roles in protein folding, conformational change, cellular communication, and catalysis. Ca(II) and Mg(II), abundant among biologically relevant cations, execute their cellular functions associated with the conformational change of bound proteins. They bind with proteins where carboxylic acid residues are dominant ligands. To develop mass spectrometry for mapping protein-binding sites, we implemented a new carboxyl group footprinter, benzhydrazide, and refined it with isotope encoding. The method uses carbodiimide chemistry to footprint carboxylic residues, whereby 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide activates a carboxyl group followed by nucleophilic attack by benzhydrazide forming a stable labeled product. We tested the effectiveness of isotope-encoded benzhydrazide by studying Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ binding of calmodulin, an EF-hand protein. The footprinting results indicate that the four active sites for metal-ion binding (EF hands I, II, III, and IV) and the linker region (peptide 78–86) undergo conformational changes upon Ca(II) and Mg(II) binding, respectively. The outcome is consistent with previously reported results and 3-D structures, thereby validating a new reagent that is more reactive and discriminating for specific amino-acid protein footprinting. This reagent should be important for locating metal-binding sites of other metalloproteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLewis bases 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3aisotopes 3aligands 3amagnesium 3amass spectrometry 3ametal ions 3ametalloproteins 3amoieties 3apeptide mapping 3aprotein binding 3aprotein folding1 aCheng, Ming1 aGross, Michael L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1159-46360 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 29, v. 91, no. 2 p.1416-1423dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b040883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245012400184300001600308520061800324592002800942650003200970650002701002650001601029650001001045650001301055650003901068650001401107650001901121650001801140650002801158650003201186650001101218650000901229650001601238650003701254650006301291650005701354650002301411650005901434653001001493653000901503653001001512653001001522653000801532653001001540653000901550653000801559653000901567653001701576653001101593653002501604653001501629653001401644700002201658700002201680700002201702700001701724700002501741773007401766856008201840852000901922655001201931IND60099030320221116204340.0161021e20130225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009903032DNAL7 a232666232pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.12.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuno, Morten12aA novel mitochondrial mutation m.8989G>C associated with neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa — The NARP syndrome  ap. 372-375.  aThe archetypal NARP syndrome is almost exclusively associated with the m.8993T>C/G mutation in the sixth subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, whereas other mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene primarily associate with Leigh syndrome or Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).

This review summarizes the results of clinical studies on patients with MetS involving the chronic supplementation of a polyphenol‐rich diet, foods, extracts or with single phenolics on the features of MetS (obesity, dyslipidemia, blood pressure and glycaemia) and associated complications (oxidative stress and inflammation). Polyphenols were shown to be efficient, especially at higher doses, and there were no specific foods or extracts able to alleviate all the features of MetS. Green tea, however, significantly reduced body mass index and waist circumference and improved lipid metabolism. Cocoa supplementation reduced blood pressure and blood glucose. Soy isoflavones, citrus products, hesperidin and quercetin improved lipid metabolism, whereas cinnamon reduced blood glucose. In numerous clinical studies, antioxidative and anti‐inflammatory effects were not significant after polyphenol supplementation in patients with MetS. However, some trials pointed towards an improvement of endothelial function in patients supplemented with cocoa, anthocyanin‐rich berries, hesperidin or resveratrol. Therefore, diets rich in polyphenols, such as the Mediterranean diet, which promote the consumption of diverse polyphenol‐rich products could be an effective nutritional strategy to improve the health of patients with MetS. © 2016 The Authors.

Furthermore, GMOs might produce naturally occurring dsRNA molecules in higher or lower quantities than its non-transgenic counterpart. This study is the first to use high-throughput technology to characterize the miRNome of commercialized GM maize events and to investigate potential alterations in miRNA regulatory networks. RESULTS: Thirteen different conserved miRNAs were found to be dys-regulated in GM samples. The insecticide Bt GM variety had the most distinct miRNome. These miRNAs target a range of endogenous transcripts, such as transcription factors and nucleic acid binding domains, which play key molecular functions in basic genetic regulation. In addition, we have identified 20 potential novel miRNAs with target transcripts involved in lipid metabolism in maize. isomiRs were also found in 96 conserved miRNAs sequences, as well as potential transgenic miRNA sequences, which both can be a source of potential off-target effects in the plant genome. We have also provided information on technical limitations and when to carry on additional in vivo experimental testing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not reveal hazards per se but show that robust and reproducible miRNA profiling technique can strengthen the assessment of risk by detecting any new intended and unintended dsRNA molecules, regardless of the outcome, at any stage of GMO development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acommercialization 3acorn 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenetic engineering 3agenome 3ainsecticides 3alipid metabolism 3amicroRNA 3arisk assessment 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants1 aVilperte, Vinicius1 aTraavik, Terje Ingemar1 aNodari, Rubens Onofre0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2018 Dec., v. 30, no. 1 p.37-37dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-018-0168-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008000172300001600252520163100268592002801899650001301927650001701940650001101957650000901968650001401977650001001991650001202001650001002013650003002023650001502053650002702068650001002095650001202105650001602117651001202133653002102145653003002166653002602196653002702222653002902249700002702278700002002305700001902325700001702344700002502361773011002386856008802496852000902584655001202593IND60479866220221118012753.0160123e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047986622DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.36.2008.Suppl.B.512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGörtz, Andreas10aBiodiversity of <i>Fusarium</i> species causing ear rot of maize in Germany  ap. 617-622.  aIn Germany, maize is one of the most important agriculture commodities, a major component in animal feed as well as an essential substrate producing biogas. Maize ear rot poses a major impact worldwide as it is caused by several <i>Fusarium</i> spp., most of which have the ability to produce mycotoxins. Despite of the expansion of the maize acreage in recent years, limited information is available concerning the incidence of Fusarium ear rot in Germany. Therefore, in a two-year survey maize crops were sampled in the major maizeproducing areas in Germany to establish the severity of Fusarium ear rot and the biodiversity of <i>Fusarium</i> species. In 2006, the frequency of kernels infected by <i>Fusarium</i> spp. ranged from 0.7 % to 99.7 %; the average incidence was 32.4 %. Thirteen <i>Fusarium</i> species were isolated from maize kernels, with <i>F. verticillioides</i> , <i>F. graminearum</i> and <i>F. proliferatum</i> being the predominant species. In 2007, the highest incidence of Fusarium ear rot was 64 %; the mean level of infection was 21.7 %. <i>F. graminearum</i> was by far the most frequent species isolated from all sampled fields in 2007. In addition, <i>F. crookwellense</i> , <i>F. subglutinans</i> and <i>F. avenaceum</i> were also frequently isolated. In particular, the fumonisin-producing species <i>F. verticillioides</i> an <i>F. proliferatum</i> were less frequent than in 2006. The year-to-year variability in the frequency of <i>Fusarium</i> species and in the overall infection rate may be explained by significant differences in temperature and precipitation during the growth periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3abiodiversity 3abiogas 3acorn 3acorn ears 3acrops 3aear rot 3afeeds 3afungal diseases of plants 3amycotoxins 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aseeds 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aGermany 0aFusarium ear rot 0a<i>F. verticillioides</i> 0a<i>F. graminearum</i> 0a<i>F. proliferatum</i> 0ayear-to-year variability1 aOerke, Erich-Christian1 aSteiner, Ulrike1 aWaalwijk, Cees1 aVries, Ineke1 aDehne, Heinz-Wilhelm0 tCereal research communications.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 36, no. 0 p.617-622dAkadémiai Kiadóx0133-37207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FCRC.36.2008.Suppl.B.513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013600164300001600300500001500316520182800331592002802159650002002187650001502207650001202222650001702234650001502251650002102266650001602287650001802303650002702321650002102348650000902369650001802378650001702396650002302413650002402436650001202460650001202472650001402484650002002498650001002518650001802528650001502546650001402561650001302575651001202588653001902600700002202619700002002641773012902661856007802790852000902868655001202877IND60518229920160506000000.0160409e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051822992DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2015004722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrietzel, Jörg10aSpeciation of phosphorus in temperate zone forest soils as assessed by combined wet‐chemical fractionation and XANES spectroscopy  ap. 168-185.  a2019-12-06  aPhosphorus availability in terrestrial ecosystems is strongly dependent on soil P speciation. Here we present information on the P speciation of 10 forest soils in Germany developed from different parent materials as assessed by combined wet‐chemical P fractionation and synchrotron‐based X‐ray absorption near‐edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Soil P speciation showed clear differences among different parent materials and changed systematically with soil depth. In soils formed from silicate bedrock or loess, Fe‐bound P species (FePO₄, organic and inorganic phosphate adsorbed to Fe oxyhydroxides) and Al‐bound P species (AlPO₄, organic and inorganic phosphate adsorbed to Al oxyhydroxides, Al‐saturated clay minerals and Al‐saturated soil organic matter) were most dominant. In contrast, the P speciation of soils formed from calcareous bedrock was dominated (40–70% of total P) by Ca‐bound organic P, which most likely primarily is inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP) precipitated as Ca₃‐IHP. The second largest portion of total P in all calcareous soils was organic P not bound to Ca, Al, or Fe. The relevance of this P form decreased with soil depth. Additionally, apatite (relevance increasing with depth) and Al‐bound P were present. The most relevant soil properties governing the P speciation of the investigated soils were soil stocks of Fe oxyhydroxides, organic matter, and carbonate. Different types of P speciation in soils on silicate and calcareous parent material suggest different ecosystem P nutrition strategies and biogeochemical P cycling patterns in the respective ecosystems. Our study demonstrates that combined wet‐chemical soil P fractionation and synchrotron‐based XANES spectroscopy provides substantial novel information on the P speciation of forest soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil properties 3asoil depth 3aapatite 3aforest soils 3aphosphorus 3acalcareous soils 3aX-radiation 3aclay minerals 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aferric phosphate 3airon 3aorganic soils 3aspectroscopy 3airon oxyhydroxides 3asoil organic matter 3acalcium 3abedrock 3ainositols 3atemperate zones 3aloess 3afractionation 3aabsorption 3anutrition 3aaluminum 3aGermany 0aorganic matter1 aKlysubun, Wantana1 aWerner, Florian0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2016 Apr., v. 179, no. 2 p.168-185dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2015004723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015600172500001900328500002200347520152600369592002801895650002501923650001601948650001501964650001501979650001301994650000902007650002102016650001402037650001502051650001502066650002502081650002002106650001302126653003702139653001202176653002402188653001802212700002102230700006202251773008102313856008502394852000902479655001202488IND60662834120221121000242.0190906e20190828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066283412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.1150312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaz, Agnès de la10aUnravelling the role of vegetation in the attenuation of contaminants of emerging concern from wetland systems: Preliminary results from column studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPre-press version  aWater pollution with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) is widespread in water bodies due to the low effectiveness of industrial and urban wastewater treatment systems. In recent decades, the implementation of vegetation-based wastewater treatment systems such as wetlands has been observed to help solve this issue. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the removal percentage attributable to plants and how plants affect this removal improvement. In this study, we monitored planted (Phragmites australis) and unplanted sand columns to assess the effect of vegetation on the attenuation of 5 well-known CECs (benzotriazole, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, bisphenol A, and diclofenac) and link it to the presence of different root exudates. The columns were operated in a continuous feeding mode for more than 6 months at 3 hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) (70, 140, and 280 mm d−1). We found that the presence of vegetation increased CEC attenuation from no effect to more than 200% compared to the unplanted columns. The highest effect was observed for carbamazepine (94–200%), followed by diclofenac (22–171%), benzotriazole (48–127%), and sulfamethoxazole (no effect to 43%), depending on the tested HLR. Furthermore, the greater CEC attenuation in planted columns was linked to the release of certain root exudates that may shape the root microbiome. We expect our assay to be a starting point for exploring the role of root exudates in enhancing CEC removal efficiency in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3abisphenol A 3adiclofenac 3amicrobiome 3aresearch 3asand 3asulfamethoxazole 3atriazoles 3avegetation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awetlands 0aContaminants of emerging concern 0aRemoval 0aChemical signalling 0aRoot exudates1 aSalinas, Nèstor1 aMatamoros, Víctor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9701-49080 tWater research.g2019 Aug. 28, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.1150313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245015500161300001600316500001100332520147400343592002801817650001601845650002001861650002201881650001301903650002401916650001801940650001101958650002201969650001601991700001902007700002002026700002202046700001702068773009702085856007302182852000902255655001202264IND60522948920221120220219.0160604e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052294892DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.124142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzevedo, Liane B.14aThe effectiveness of sedentary behaviour interventions for reducing body mass index in children and adolescents: systematic review and meta‐analysis  ap. 623-635.  aREVIEW  aIntervention studies have been undertaken to reduce sedentary behaviour (SB) and thereby potentially ameliorate unhealthy weight gain in children and adolescents. We synthesised evidence and quantified the effects of SB interventions (single or multiple components) on body mass index (BMI) or BMI z‐score in this population. Publications up to March 2015 were located through electronic searches. Inclusion criteria were interventions targeting SB in children that had a control group and objective measures of weight and height. Mean change in BMI or BMI z‐score from baseline to post‐intervention were quantified for intervention and control groups and meta‐analyzed using a random effects model. The pooled mean reduction in BMI and BMI z‐score was significant but very small (standardized mean difference = −0.060, 95% confidence interval: −0.098 to −0.022). However, the pooled estimate was substantially greater for an overweight or obese population (standardized mean difference = −0.255, 95% confidence interval: −0.400 to −0.109). Multicomponent interventions (SB and other behaviours) delivered to children from 5 to 12 years old in a non‐educational setting appear to favour BMI reduction. In summary, SB interventions are associated with very small improvement in BMI in mixed‐weight populations. However, SB interventions should be part of multicomponent interventions for treating obese children. © 2016 World Obesity  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3asystematic review 3aweight gain1 aLing, Jonathan1 aSoós, István,1 aRobalino, Shannon1 aElls, Louisa0 tObesity reviews.g2016 July, v. 17, no. 7 p.623-635dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.124143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245008800176300001600264520108400280592002801364650002001392650002201412650002501434650001101459650001101470650001501481650001901496650003101515650001001546650001601556650001501572650001401587650002001601650001001621653001501631653001701646653002801663700001801691700001801709773011001727856008801837852000901925655001201934IND60479866420221118012726.0160123e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047986642DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.36.2008.Suppl.B.612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetti, Carloalberto10aInvestigating the mechanisms underpinning bacterium-mediated control of FHB disease  ap. 689-693.  aPseudomonads, including <i>P. fluorescens</i> strain MKB 158, can inhibit the development of Fusarium seedling blight disease on wheat and barley.

Bacterium-potentiated resistance to <i>Fusarium</i> affects the transcription of many genes that are involved in diverse processes, including cell rescue and defence, metabolism, cell cycle and DNA replication and signalling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aFusarium culmorum 3aFusarium head blight 3abarley 3ablight 3acell cycle 3adeoxynivalenol 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3ametabolism 3aseedlings 3atranscriptomics 3awheat 0abiocontrol 0apseudomonade 0atranscriptome profiling1 aMojibur, Khan1 aDoohan, Fiona0 tCereal research communications.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 36, no. 0 p.689-693dAkadémiai Kiadóx0133-37207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FCRC.36.2008.Suppl.B.613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300001800271520102800289592002801317650001501345650002201360650001701382650001101399650001601410650002201426700001501448700001901463700001401482700001601496700001701512700001401529700001501543773014201558856007401700852000901774655001201783IND60641760720221122150604.0190506e20160413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064176072DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta00976j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yantao10aTwo methoxyaniline-substituted dibenzofuran derivatives as hole-transport materials for perovskite solar cells  ap. 5415-5422.  a2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), one of the classical organic photoelectric materials, has been widely used as a hole transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its relatively higher conductivity, easier film formation, weak absorption in the visible region, etc. However, the complex synthesis process and the high synthesis cost of Spiro-OMeTAD severely limit the commercialization of this material. In this work, two economical methoxyaniline-substituted dibenzofuran derivatives, BF-002 and BF-003, are synthesized and successfully used as hole-transport materials in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The important properties including light absorption, thermal stability, energy level, conductivity, as well as photovoltaic performance are systematically demonstrated. The highest power conversion efficiencies of the PSCs based on BF-002 and BF-003 are 14.20% and 14.07%, respectively, comparable to that of the PSCs based on Spiro-OMeTAD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acommercialization 3adibenzofuran 3aenergy 3asolar cells 3athermal stability1 aHou, Kaili1 aWang, Yanxiang1 aWang, Kai1 aRen, HuiCai1 aPang, MaoYin1 aChen, Fan1 aZhang, Sen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Apr. 13, v. 4, no. 15 p.5415-5422dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta00976j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245017400165500001900339500002200358520145500380592002801835650002601863650002101889650001501910650005001925650002101975650002101996650002102017650001902038650001802057650001402075650001302089650001302102650001002115650001902125653002502144653003302169653002602202653003102228653002002259700001802279700001702297700006502314700001302379700006902392700002902461773008102490856008502571852000902656655001202665IND60662834320221121000344.0190906e20190830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066283432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.1150352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Qian10aElectrochemical pretreatment for stabilization of waste activated sludge: Simultaneously enhancing dewaterability, inactivating pathogens and mitigating hydrogen sulfide  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPre-press version  aStabilization of waste activated sludge (WAS) is an essential step for the disposal or reuse. In this study, WAS stabilization via electrochemical pretreatment (EPT) at 0–15V was evaluated for simultaneous dewaterability enhancement, pathogen removal and H2S mitigation. The mechanism underlying EPT was investigated and discussed based on the changes in the physicochemical (e.g., particle size, zeta potential, hydrophobicity and extracellular polymeric substances) and biological characteristics (i.e. cell morphology, and distribution and percentages of live/dead cells) of WAS with different EPT voltages. The results revealed that EPT disintegrated WAS flocs and disrupted the cell walls leading to a reduction in particle size (by up to 50%), increased release of extracellular and intracellular substances (by up to 4 times) to facilitate WAS stabilization. With EPT at 15V, the capillary suction time of WAS decreased by 42%, and the concentrations of E. coli and indicator pathogens (Salmonella spp. and Streptococcus faecalis) fell by nearly 5 log10 reaching U.S. EPA hygienization levels. Furthermore, EPT at 12V or higher suppressed the amounts of dissolved sulfide and H2S(g) produced from the WAS under anaerobic conditions by over 99%. This study demonstrates the feasibility of EPT for simultaneous WAS dewaterability enhancement, pathogen inactivation and H2S mitigation, providing a one-step alternative for sludge stabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aactivated sludge 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahydrophobicity 3aparticle size 3apathogens 3apolymers 3aresearch 3awater 3azeta potential 0aSludge stabilization 0aElectrochemical pretreatment 0aPathogen inactivation 0aDewaterability enhancement 0aSulfide removal1 aZan, Feixiang1 aHao, Tianwei1 aBiswal, Basanta Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7051-25681 aSen, Lin1 avan Loosdrecht, Mark C.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0658-47751 aChen, G.-H.q(Guanghao),0 tWater research.g2019 Aug. 30, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.1150353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012500164300001600289500001900305520094800324592002801272650001101300650001901311650002101330650001701351650001101368650001201379653001501391653002001406653002501426653002001451653002601471700001601497700001301513700001301526700001501539700001901554700001501573700001601588700001601604700001401620773012201634856008301756852000901839655001201848IND60714832520221122031616.0201230e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071483252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Tianyu10aLi2O-2B2O3 coating decorated Li4Ti5O12 anode for enhanced rate capability and cycling stability in lithium-ion batteries  ap. 574-582.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLi₂O-2B₂O₃ (LBO) ionic conductor with high conductivity plays an important role in boosting the rate performance and cycling stability of Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ (LTO) anode for lithium-ion batteries by preventing direct exposure of LTO to the electrolyte.

A plethora of interconnected interactions among the host, environment and microbes, occurring both above and below ground, drive recognition, recruitment and colonization of plant‐associated microbes, resulting in activation of downstream host responses and functionality. Dissecting these complex interactions by integrating multiomic approaches, high‐throughput culturing, and computational and synthetic biology advances is providing deeper understanding of the structure and function of native microbial communities. Such insights are paving the way towards development of microbial products as well as microbiomes engineered with synthetic microbial communities capable of delivering agronomic solutions. While there is a growing market for microbial‐based solutions to improve crop productivity, challenges with commercialization of these products remain. The continued translation of plant‐associated microbiome knowledge into real‐world scenarios will require concerted transdisciplinary research, cross‐training of a next generation of scientists, and targeted educational efforts to prime growers and the general public for successful adoption of these innovative technologies.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018‐67013‐28490cU.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  a2020‐70029‐33199cU.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  a2020‐67013‐31801cU.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  a1714276cUS National Science Foundation  a5344165cUS National Science Foundation 3acommercialization 3amarkets 3amicrobiome 3aphytobiome 3asustainable agriculture 3asynthetic biology1 aMattupalli, Chakradhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4221-96041 aEversole, Kellye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8784-49131 aLeach, Jan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7252-43970 tThe new phytologist.g2021 June, v. 230, no. 6 p.2129-2147dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.173193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04505naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011300166300001100279520237700290592002802667596007302695596007302768596007302841596007302914596007302987596007303060596007303133596004203206650001303248650001503261650001203276650001303288650002203301650002003323650001403343650001303357650001503370650001503385650001903400650001403419650000903433650001203442650001303454650003503467650004203502700001803544700002403562700001903586700001703605700002003622700005903642773012203701856008303823852000903906655001203915IND60701287420221121062304.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070128742DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-020-00558-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoney, Daniel10aExtending long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation algorithms to large and heterogeneous datasets  ap. 38.  aBACKGROUND: We describe the latest improvements to the long-range phasing (LRP) and haplotype library imputation (HLI) algorithms for successful phasing of both datasets with one million individuals and datasets genotyped using different sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Previous publicly available implementations of the LRP algorithm implemented in AlphaPhase could not phase large datasets due to the computational cost of defining surrogate parents by exhaustive all-against-all searches. Furthermore, the AlphaPhase implementations of LRP and HLI were not designed to deal with large amounts of missing data that are inherent when using multiple SNP arrays. METHODS: We developed methods that avoid the need for all-against-all searches by performing LRP on subsets of individuals and then concatenating the results. We also extended LRP and HLI algorithms to enable the use of different sets of markers, including missing values, when determining surrogate parents and identifying haplotypes. We implemented and tested these extensions in an updated version of AlphaPhase, and compared its performance to the software package Eagle2. RESULTS: A simulated dataset with one million individuals genotyped with the same 6711 SNPs for a single chromosome took less than a day to phase, compared to more than seven days for Eagle2. The percentage of correctly phased alleles at heterozygous loci was 90.2 and 99.9% for AlphaPhase and Eagle2, respectively. A larger dataset with one million individuals genotyped with 49,579 SNPs for a single chromosome took AlphaPhase 23 days to phase, with 89.9% of alleles at heterozygous loci phased correctly. The phasing accuracy was generally lower for datasets with different sets of markers than with one set of markers. For a simulated dataset with three sets of markers, 1.5% of alleles at heterozygous positions were phased incorrectly, compared to 0.4% with one set of markers. CONCLUSIONS: The improved LRP and HLI algorithms enable AlphaPhase to quickly and accurately phase very large and heterogeneous datasets. AlphaPhase is an order of magnitude faster than the other tested packages, although Eagle2 showed a higher level of phasing accuracy. The speed gain will make phasing achievable for very large genomic datasets in livestock, enabling more powerful breeding and genetics research and application.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/J004235/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/M009254/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/L020726/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/N004736/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/N004728/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/L020467/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/N006178/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aMR/M000370/cMedical Research Council 3aaccuracy 3aalgorithms 3aalleles 3abreeding 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aevolution 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3alivestock 3aloci 3aparents 3aresearch 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism arrays1 aWilson, David1 aJenko, J.q(Janez),1 aWhalen, Andrew1 aThorn, Steve1 aGorjanc, Gregor1 aHickey, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8314-148X0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2020 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.38-38dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-020-00558-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04118naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002300186245013900209300001200348500001500360506007600375520246300451592002802914506003702942650001502979650001902994650001603013650001903029650001403048650001703062650000903079650001403088650001503102650000903117650001503126650001303141650001003154650001603164650002203180650001403202650001003216650001103226650001003237653001603247653001603263700002603279700002303305700001803328700001803346773008803364856007903452852000903531655001203540IND60080311220221207131510.0150503e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008031122DNAL7 a250930352pmid7 aPMC41058382pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-4811-10-132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Marié, Chantal10aRhizoslides: paper-based growth system for non-destructive, high throughput phenotyping of root development by means of image analysis  ap. 287.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A quantitative characterization of root system architecture is currently being attempted for various reasons. Non-destructive, rapid analyses of root system architecture are difficult to perform due to the hidden nature of the root. Hence, improved methods to measure root architecture are necessary to support knowledge-based plant breeding and to analyse root growth responses to environmental changes. Here, we report on the development of a novel method to reveal growth and architecture of maize root systems. RESULTS: The method is based on the cultivation of different root types within several layers of two-dimensional, large (50 × 60 cm) plates (rhizoslides). A central plexiglass screen stabilizes the system and is covered on both sides with germination paper providing water and nutrients for the developing root, followed by a transparent cover foil to prevent the roots from falling dry and to stabilize the system. The embryonic roots grow hidden between a Plexiglas surface and paper, whereas crown roots grow visible between paper and the transparent cover. Long cultivation with good image quality up to 20 days (four fully developed leaves) was enhanced by suppressing fungi with a fungicide. Based on hyperspectral microscopy imaging, the quality of different germination papers was tested and three provided sufficient contrast to distinguish between roots and background (segmentation). Illumination, image acquisition and segmentation were optimised to facilitate efficient root image analysis. Several software packages were evaluated with regard to their precision and the time investment needed to measure root system architecture. The software 'Smart Root’ allowed precise evaluation of root development but needed substantial user interference. 'GiaRoots’ provided the best segmentation method for batch processing in combination with a good analysis of global root characteristics but overestimated root length due to thinning artefacts. 'WhinRhizo’ offered the most rapid and precise evaluation of root lengths in diameter classes, but had weaknesses with respect to image segmentation and analysis of root system architecture. CONCLUSION: A new technique has been established for non-destructive root growth studies and quantification of architectural traits beyond seedlings stages. However, automation of the scanning process and appropriate software remains the bottleneck for high throughput analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amicroscopy 3aplant breeding 3agermination 3aimage analysis 3aphenotype 3aroot systems 3afoil 3aseedlings 3afungicides 3acorn 3aautomation 3alighting 3apaper 3aroot growth 3acomputer software 3anutrients 3aroots 3aleaves 3afungi 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aKirchgessner, Norbert1 aMarschall, Daniela1 aWalter, Achim1 aHund, Andreas0 tPlant methods.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.287-287dSpringer-Verlagx1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4811-10-133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01714naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008700168300001800255520064800273592002800921650001600949650002300965650002000988650001301008650001201021653001901033653002901052653001701081653001501098653002201113700002401135773011201159856008401271852000901355655001201364IND60599461920221120183711.0180702e20140416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059946192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.02.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiehl, Julian10aUnexpected rearrangements of rhodium carbenoids containing a pyrrolidin-1-yl group  ap. 2629-2632.  aKetone- and ester-substituted diazo compounds, which contain a pyrrolidine moiety were treated with dirhodium tetraacetate generating the corresponding rhodium carbenoids.

Traditional supplier selection methods seldom consider the entire supply chain. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated model combining the linguistic entropy weight method (LEWM) with multi-objective programming for supplier selection and order allocation in a circular economy. First, a comprehensive system of green supplier evaluation criteria is established, with each criterion clearly defined. Second, the LEWM is used to select qualified green suppliers, whose rankings are calculated. The proposed LEWM can not only select qualified green suppliers but also analyze each supplier’s performance on each evaluation criterion; it can also provide improvement suggestions for suppliers. Third, based on the characteristics of current global supply chains in the automobile manufacturing industry, the order allocation model is established. The order allocation model constructed in this paper has three objectives: total cost minimization, carbon emission minimization, and procurement value maximization. The weighted maximum and minimum operator method is used to solve the model. Finally, the paper introduces how to use the proposed two-phase model to solve the problem of green supplier selection and order allocation, and conducts sensitivity analysis on the model results. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively resolve green supplier selection and order allocation for an automobile manufacture, and verify the scientific validity of the proposed method. This study could help to improve the relationship between companies and potential suppliers, and to improve green product development capabilities and supply chain management quality, thereby enhancing companies’ market competitiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3amanufacturing 3amarket competition 3aproduct development 3asupply chain 0aLinguistic entropy weight method 0aSupplier evaluation 0aGreen supply chain 0aOrder allocation 0aMulti-objective programming1 aGong, Zongrong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.122597-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245014100207300001800348500001900366500002000385520086500405592002801270596004601298596005401344650001101398650001301409650001601422650002101438650001501459650002001474650002001494650002101514650002901535650001901564651002301583700005701606700006301663700006201726700005601788700006001844773012201904856007302026852000902099655001202108IND60737957220221117210112.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073795722DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.172712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMwangangi, Immaculate M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6381-210810aCombining host plant defence with targeted nutrition: key to durable control of hemiparasitic Striga in cereals in sub‐Saharan Africa?  ap. 2164-2178.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHost plant defence mechanisms (resistance and tolerance) and plant nutrition are two of the most widely proposed components for the control of hemiparasitic weeds of the genus Striga in tropical cereal production systems. Neither of the two components alone is effective enough to prevent parasitism and concomitant crop losses. This review explores the potential of improved plant nutrition, being the chemical constituent of soil fertility, to fortify the expression of plant inherent resistance and tolerance against Striga. Beyond reviewing advances in parasitic plant research, we assess relevant insights from phytopathology and plant physiology in the broader sense to identify opportunities and knowledge gaps and to develop the way forward regarding research and development of combining genetics and plant nutrition for the durable control of Striga.  aPublisher supplied data  aCA\R1\191195cOffice of the Royal Society  aExpanding Excellence in EnglandcResearch England 3aStriga 3agenetics 3ahost plants 3aparasitic plants 3aparasitism 3aplant nutrition 3aplant pathology 3aplant physiology 3aresearch and development 3asoil fertility 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aBüchi, Lucie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1935-61761 aHaefele, Stephan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0389-83731 aBastiaans, Lammert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8465-30031 aRuno, Steven1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9043-23381 aRodenburg, Jonne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9059-92530 tThe new phytologist.g2021 June, v. 230, no. 6 p.2164-2178dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.172713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008400168300001600252520133200268592002801600650002801628650002001656650002801676650002401704650001701728650002101745650002001766650001101786650001501797650001401812650001401826650001501840653002201855653001901877653002501896653001901921653002701940653002301967653002301990700002402013700002502037700002602062700001802088700002302106700002202129700002702151773011902178856008302297852000902380655001202389IND60732448320221119222958.0211213e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073244832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2021.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreca, Davide10aFood flavonols: Nutraceuticals with complex health benefits and functionalities  ap. 194-204.  aFlavonols are one of the most promising class of bioactive compounds belonging to the broad family of the flavonoids, characterized by a unique set of features in their basic chemical skeleton and several specific substitutions in selected position of the rings A, B and C. This interesting class of phytochemicals includes compounds such as quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, rhamnetin, morin, fisetin, galagin, azaleatin and their respective glycosyl derivatives. They have been identified in several foods and provide them great health benefits.This review updates and integrates, in a critical fashion, the current knowledge on flavonols as food sources, chemical features, structure-activity relationships, bioavailability and health benefits (from preclinical and clinical studies), focusing on both in vitro and in vivo reports.Dietary flavonols are bioavailable molecules in human with impressive health benefits (such as antioxidation, cardioprotection, antibacterial, antiviral and anticancer activity) and the process of metabolization also produces compounds with remarkable bioactivities just like the corresponding precursors. Their inclusion into human diet is highly recommended for their unquestionable health promoting properties, being excellent nutraceuticals as well as ingredients for good functional food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3abioavailability 3acardioprotective effect 3adietary supplements 3afood science 3afunctional foods 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3akaempferol 3amyricetin 3aquercetin 3atechnology 0aDietary flavonols 0aNutraceuticals 0aAntioxidant activity 0aHealth benefit 0aAntibacterial activity 0aAntiviral activity 0aAntitumor activity1 aTrombetta, Domenico1 aSmeriglio, Antonella1 aMandalari, Giuseppina1 aRomeo, Orazio1 aFelice, Maria Rosa1 aGattuso, Giuseppe1 aNabavi, Seyed Mohammad0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Nov., v. 117 p.194-204dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001700186245012400203300001200327506007600339520102000415592002801435506003701463650001101500650001301511650000801524650001501532650001101547650004201558650001101600650002101611650002301632650002001655650002001675650002501695700002001720700001601740700002201756773008801778856007901866852000901945655001201954IND60080311320221207131457.0150503e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008031132DNAL7 a250539692pmid7 aPMC41055092pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-4811-10-212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHealey, Adam10aProtocol: a simple method for extracting next-generation sequencing quality genomic DNA from recalcitrant plant species  ap. 288.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNext-generation sequencing technologies rely on high quality DNA that is suitable for library preparation followed by sequencing. Some plant species store large amounts of phenolics and polysaccharides within their leaf tissue making genomic DNA extraction difficult. While many DNA extraction methods exist that contend with the presence of phenolics and polysaccharides, these methods rely on long incubations, multiple precipitations or commercially available kits to produce high molecular weight and contaminant-free DNA. In this protocol, we describe simple modifications to the established CTAB- based extraction method that allows for reliable isolation of high molecular weight genomic DNA from difficult to isolate plant species Corymbia (a eucalypt) and Coffea (coffee). The simplified protocol does not require multiple clean up steps or commercial based kits, and the isolated DNA passed stringent quality control standards for whole genome sequencing on Illumina HiSeq and TruSeq sequencing platforms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCoffea 3aCorymbia 3aDNA 3aEucalyptus 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aleaves 3amolecular weight 3aphenolic compounds 3apolysaccharides 3aquality control 3arecalcitrant species1 aFurtado, Agnelo1 aCooper, Tal1 aHenry, Robert J.,0 tPlant methods.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.288-288dSpringer-Verlagx1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4811-10-213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245018400205300001800389500001900407500002000426520126000446592002801706596007701734596009801811596009601909596008502005596008302090650001502173650001902188650002902207650002102236650001602257650001202273650001802285650000902303650001002312650001602322700005802338700005902396700005902455700002302514700006402537700006102601773012202662856007302784852000902857655001202866IND60737957320221117210203.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073795732DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.173522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBréchet, Laëtitia M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2744-882010aSimultaneous tree stem and soil greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, N2O) flux measurements: a novel design for continuous monitoring towards improving flux estimates and temporal resolution  ap. 2487-2500.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTree stems and soils can act as sources and sinks for the greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O). Since both uptake and emission capacities can be large, especially in tropical rainforests, accurate assessments of the magnitudes and temporal variations of stem and soil GHG fluxes are required. We designed a new flexible stem chamber system for continuously measuring GHG fluxes in a French Guianese rainforest. Here, we describe this new system, which is connected to an automated soil GHG flux system, and discuss measurement uncertainty and potential error sources. In line with findings for soil GHG flux estimates, we demonstrated that lengthening the stem chamber closure time was required for accurate estimates of tree stem CH₄ and N₂O flux but not tree stem CO₂ flux. The instrumented stem was a net source of CO₂ and CH₄ and a weak sink of N₂O. Our experimental setup operated successfully in situ and provided continuous tree and soil GHG measurements at a high temporal resolution over an 11‐month period. This automated system is a major step forward in the measurement of GHG fluxes in stems and the atmosphere concurrently with soil GHG fluxes in tropical forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aERC‐2013‐SyG 610028‐IMBALANCE‐PcH2020 European Research Council  aH2020‐2017‐MSCA‐IF‐796438‐RAINFOREST‐GHGcH2020 Marie Skłodowska‐Curie Actions  cUMR ‘Ecologie des Forêts de Guyane’ and the Research Fund of the University of Antwerp  cThe Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent University for Postdoctoral Fellowships  aIJC2018‐036123‐IcSpanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities 3aautomation 3acarbon dioxide 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3agreenhouses 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3asoil 3atrees 3auncertainty1 aDaniel, Warren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2073-78571 aStahl, Clément1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5411-11691 aBurban, Benoît1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8779-15591 aGoret, Jean‐Yves1 aSalomόn, Roberto L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2674-17311 aJanssens, Ivan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5705-17870 tThe new phytologist.g2021 June, v. 230, no. 6 p.2487-2500dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.173523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001400162245009600176300001600272500001500288520174800303592002802051650002902079650001702108650001502125650001402140650002002154650000902174650003802183650001602221650001702237650002802254650001902282650002002301650001502321650001202336650002702348650001102375650002502386650001302411650005102424650003202475650002502507653002002532700001802552700001602570700001402586700001702600773009702617856007702714852000902791655001202800IND60083380920221120134934.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008338092DNAL7 a222813192pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-46652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazri, C.10aEffect of high-pressure treatment on denaturation of bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase  ap. 549-557.  a2019-12-06  aLactoferrin and lactoperoxidase are whey proteins with biological properties that may provide health benefits to consumers. These properties are vulnerable to potentially denaturing conditions during processing. High-pressure treatment is an appealing alternative to the traditional heat processing of foods because it exerts an antimicrobial effect without changing the sensory and nutritional quality of foods. In this work, the effect of high-pressure treatment on the denaturation of lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase present in skim milk and whey, and as isolated proteins in buffer, was studied over a pressure range of 450 to 700MPa at 20°C. Denaturation of lactoferrin was measured by the loss of reactivity with their specific antibodies using a sandwich ELISA. Denaturation of lactoperoxidase was determined by measuring the loss of enzymatic activity using a spectrophotometric technique. No substantial inactivation of lactoperoxidase was observed in any treatment assayed. The concentration of the residual immunoreactive lactoferrin after each pressure treatment was determined, and the data were subjected to kinetic analysis to obtain D and Z values. Denaturation of lactoferrin increased with pressure and holding time, and D values were lower when lactoferrin was treated in whey than in milk, and lower in both whey and milk than in phosphate buffer. Thus, protein is denatured more slowly in buffer and in milk than in whey. Denaturation of lactoferrin in the 3 media was found to follow a reaction order of n=1.5. Volumes of activation of about −34.77, −24.35, and −24.09mL/mol were obtained for lactoferrin treated in skim milk, whey, and buffer, respectively, indicating a decrease in protein volume under pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3awhey protein 3aantibodies 3askim milk 3anutritive value 3awhey 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3alactoferrin 3adenaturation 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aheat treatment 3aenzyme activity 3aperoxidase 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesximmunology 2aCattle 2aHydrostatic Pressure 2aKinetics 2aLactoferrinxanalysisximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aLactoperoxidasexmetabolism 2aProtein Denaturation 0alactoperoxidase1 aSánchez, L.,1 aRamos, S.J.1 aCalvo, M.1 aPérez, M.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.549-557dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-46653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001700186245011100203300001200314506007600326520150800402592002801910506003701938650001401975650002101989650001702010650003902027650001002066650001902076650001102095650002202106650001302128650001502141650001302156650001202169700002402181700001802205700002502223700002702248773008802275856007902363852000902442655001202451IND60080311420221207131455.0150503e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008031142DNAL7 a250539702pmid7 aPMC41058342pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-4811-10-222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasin, Fabio10aRapid fluorescent reporter quantification by leaf disc analysis and its application in plant-virus studies  ap. 289.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Fluorescent proteins are extraordinary tools for biology studies due to their versatility; they are used extensively to improve comprehension of plant-microbe interactions. The viral infection process can easily be tracked and imaged in a plant with fluorescent protein-tagged viruses. In plants, fluorescent protein genes are among the most commonly used reporters in transient RNA silencing and heterologous protein expression assays. Fluorescence intensity is used to quantify fluorescent protein accumulation by image analysis or spectroscopy of protein extracts; however, these methods might not be suitable for medium- to large-scale comparisons. RESULTS: We report that laser scanners, used routinely in proteomic studies, are suitable for quantitative imaging of plant leaves that express different fluorescent protein pairs. We developed a microtiter plate fluorescence spectroscopy method for direct quantitative comparison of fluorescent protein accumulation in intact leaf discs. We used this technique to measure a fluorescent reporter in a transient RNA silencing suppression assay, and also to monitor early amplification dynamics of a fluorescent protein-labeled potyvirus. CONCLUSIONS: Laser scanners allow dual-color fluorescence imaging of leaf samples, which might not be acquired in standard stereomicroscope devices. Fluorescence microtiter plate analysis of intact leaf discs can be used for rapid, accurate quantitative comparison of fluorescent protein accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPotyvirus 3aRNA interference 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3ascanners 3aviruses1 aKulasekaran, Satish1 aNatale, Paolo1 aSimón-Mateo, Carmen1 aGarcía, Juan Antonio,0 tPlant methods.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.289-289dSpringer-Verlagx1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4811-10-223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245014600200520120700346592002801553596004601581596004301627650002001670650001801690650001501708650001301723650001201736650001001748650002201758650001001780650001701790650001401807650001601821650001401837650001801851650002501869650001201894651001301906700002301919700001701942700002201959773010201981856007602083852000902159655001202168IND60624356820221120193800.0181203e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062435682DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/39583272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCacciali, Pier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3263-881310aCryptic Diversity in the Neotropical Gecko Genus Phyllopezus Peters, 1878 (Reptilia: Squamata: Phyllodactylidae): A New Species from Paraguay  aThe gecko genus Phyllopezus is distributed mainly along South America’s “Dry Diagonal” (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Chaco). The genus has been the subject of recent taxonomic analyses and includes four described species and seven candidate species referred to here as Phyllopezus pollicaris sensu lato. In Paraguay, Phyllopezus is known from the Chaco and Cerrado where it is abundant, and also from a small isolated population from a rocky hill formation named “Cordillera de Los Altos” (Los Altos mountain range). Here we analyzed genetic samples from across its range, including new samples from Paraguay, using DNA barcoding analysis of the mitochondrial 16S gene and phylogenetic analyses using both Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. We found genetic and morphological differences among geckos from the Los Altos mountain range and the remaining Phyllopezus populations. Using both molecular and morphological evidence we describe a new Phyllopezus species, sister to P. przewalskii. Genetic differentiation among described and putative Phyllopezus species is greater than their morphological differences, which likely accounts for these cryptic taxa remaining undescribed for so long.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  cDeutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA barcoding 3aGekkonidae 3acaatinga 3acerrado 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahills 3amitochondria 3amountains 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3astatistical analysis 3azoology 3aParaguay1 aLotzkat, Sebastian1 aGamble, Tony1 aKöhler, Gunther,0 tInternational journal of zoology.g2018 July 16, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:21406x1687-84857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/39583273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01375naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245007700163300001800240520017600258592002800434650002200462650001400484650002300498650002300521650001200544650002400556650002400580650002200604650002000626650002000646653001400666653001500680653001500695653001200710700001700722700002100739773011200760856008400872852000900956655001200965IND60599462020221122131527.0180702e20140409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059946202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaveta,10aF−/Cl− mediated microwave assisted breakdown of cellulose to glucose  ap. 2467-2470.  aMicrowave irradiation of aqueous solution of cellulose in the presence of NaF/NaCl resulted into disintegration of cellulose to its monomeric unit, glucose (55%) in 20min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aglucose 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3aorganic compounds 3asodium chloride 3asodium fluoride 0aCellulose 0aMicrowaves 0aHydrolysis 0aGlucose1 aBansal, Neha1 aPalwinder Singh,0 tTetrahedron letters.g2014 Apr. 09, v. 55, no. 15 p.2467-2470dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245010400182300001600286500000900302520120200311592002801513650002601541650002201567650002801589650001101617650002301628650002001651650002001671650001001691650002601701650001701727650003001744650001701774650001601791650002301807650001601830650003001846650001401876650001501890650001701905650001001922650001801932650001601950650001601966650001701982651001701999773014802016856009602164852000902260655001202269IND60668338820221117181706.0191125e196011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066833882DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1960.03615995002400060016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, James P.10aFungi and Nematodes in South African Citrus Orchard Soils in Relation to the Citrus Replant Problem  ap. 469-472.  aepub  aTrichoderma viride, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium javanicum, P. decumbens, and P. lilacinum constituted dominant fungus species in South African virgin soils which were present in much smaller numbers in adjacent citrus soils.

There are few studies evaluating the ability of Brazilian Aedes aegypti populations to transmit dengue virus (DENV). The aim of this study was to compare DENV susceptibility of field-captured Ae. aegypti populations from nine distinct geographic areas of the city of Belo Horizonte in 2009 and 2011. Infection Rate (IR), Vector Competence (VC) and Disseminated Infection Rate (DIR) were determined. METHODS: Aedes aegypti eggs from each region were collected and reared separately in an insectary. Adult females were experimentally infected with DENV-2 and the virus was detected by qPCR in body and head samples. Data were analyzed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17. RESULTS: IR varied from 40.0% to 82.5% in 2009 and 60.0% to 100.0% in 2011. VC ranged from 25.0% to 77.5% in 2009 and 25.0% to 80.0% in 2011. DIR oscillated from 68.7% to 100.0% in 2009 and 38.4% to 86.8 in 2011. When the results were evaluated by a logistic model using IR as covariate, North, Barreiro, South-Central and Venda Nova showed the strongest association in 2009. In 2011, a similar association was observed for South-Central, Venda Nova, West and Northeast regions. Using VC as covariate, South-Central and Venda Nova showed the most relevant association in 2009. In 2011, South-Central, Venda Nova and Barreiro presented the greatest revelation associations. When DIR data were analyzed by logistic regression models, Pampulha, South-Central, Venda Nova, West, Northeast and East (2009) as well as South-Central, Venda Nova and West (2011) were the districts showing the strongest associations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Ae. aegypti populations from Belo Horizonte exhibit wide variation in vector competence to transmit dengue. Therefore, vector control strategies should be adapted to the available data for each region. Further analysis should be conducted to better understand the reasons for this large variability in vector competence and how these parameters correlate with epidemiological findings in subsequent years.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aDengue virus 3aadults 3adengue 3adisease outbreaks 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahead 3alogit analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arearing 3arisk 3asocial sciences 3avector competence 3avector control 3aviruses 2aAedesxphysiologyxvirology. 2aAnimals 2aDenguexepidemiologyxvirology. 2aDengue Virusxphysiology 2aEndemic Diseases 2aFemale 2aHeadxvirology 2aInsect Vectors 2aSalivary Glandsxvirology 3aBrazil 3aSouth Africa 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aMelo, Fabrício F1 aBezerra, Juliana MT1 aChaves, Bárbara A1 aSilva, Breno M1 aSilva, Luciana D1 aPessanha, José EM1 aArias, Jorge R1 aSecundino, Nágila FC1 aNorris, Douglas E1 aPimenta, Paulo FP0 tParasites & vectors.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.320-320dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-3203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008900168300001600257520126400273592002801537650001901565650001601584650003801600650001601638650003401654650002501688650001101713650001401724650002601738650001601764650001201780700001901792700001701811700002101828700002101849700001801870700002501888700001701913700002101930700002001951773010901971856008102080852000902161655001202170IND50073631720221122064809.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007363172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-014-0504-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaejima, Kensaku10aDevelopment of an on-site plum pox virus detection kit based on immunochromatography  ap. 176-183.  aSharka disease, caused by plum pox virus (PPV), is the most serious viral disease of stone fruit trees. Among the eight known strains of the virus, PPV-D is the most important due to its recent global spread. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most common approach for diagnosing sharka, it involves time-consuming steps and requires expensive equipment and trained technicians. In this study, an on-site PPV detection kit based on immunochromatography was developed using polyclonal antibodies against the coat protein (CP) of a PPV-D isolate. The immunochromatographic (IC) assay kit was as sensitive as a commercial ELISA system for detecting Japanese PPV-D isolates. Moreover, it was easy to use (a one-step procedure), and results could be obtained on-site within 15 min without special laboratory equipment. The IC assay kit detected the virus from every aerial part of symptomatic Japanese apricot trees. In a detailed study of viral localization in leaves, the most suitable plant parts for use in the IC assay were symptomatic mesophyll tissues and the region from the petiole to the main vein. A positive reaction was also observed using the CP of other major (PPV-M and PPV-Rec) and minor (PPV-EA, PPV-W, and PPV-T) strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlum pox virus 3aPrunus mume 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afruit trees 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3alaboratory equipment 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3apolyclonal antibodies 3atechnicians 3aviruses1 aHimeno, Misako1 aNetsu, Osamu1 aIshikawa, Kazuya1 aYoshida, Tetsuya1 aFujita, Naoko1 aHashimoto, Masayoshi1 aKomatsu, Ken1 aYamaji, Yasuyuki1 aNamba, Shigetou0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2014 Mar., v. 80, no. 2 p.176-183dSpringer-Verlagx1345-26307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-014-0504-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011300167300001600280520107900296592002801375650001801403650002501421650001401446650001201460650002301472650001901495650001301514651001301527651001101540653001101551653001601562653002101578653001401599653002301613653001301636773013401649856008001783852000901863655001201872IND60623081720221119013247.0181127e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062308172DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965103780972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhouri, Andréa,10a“Adverse Forces” in the Brazilian Amazon: Developmentalism Versus Environmentalism and Indigenous Rights  ap. 252-273.  aSince the 1970s, the ghost of an “international conspiracy” to occupy the Brazilian Amazon has emerged against the backdrop of shifting social and political realities. This article looks at how Brazilian political elites and military forces have influenced national interpretations of environmentalism and indigenous peoples’ rights. It considers the formation of long-standing images and ideas perpetuated through economic plans like Avança Brasil , Growth Accelerated Program (PAC), and the Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America (IIRSA) as well as international environmental initiatives such as on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD). Environmentalists and indigenous peoples have been viewed as opponents to economic growth and barriers to development. These images reflect entrenched political positions within Brazilian society, largely unrecognized on the international stage but critical to understanding Brazil’s ambiguous positions in international negotiations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeforestation 3adeveloping countries 3aemissions 3aforests 3aindigenous peoples 3ainfrastructure 3apolitics 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aamazon 0adevelopment 0aenvironmentalism 0aterritory 0aindigenous peoples 0amilitary0 tJournal of environment & development.g2010 Sept., v. 19, no. 3 p.252-273dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965103780973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009900163300001600262500001900278520137000297592002801667650002101695650001601716650001401732650002301746650002101769650004901790650001301839650001901852650001301871650001401884650001501898650001601913650001401929650001601943650001501959653002001974653002001994653002302014653002402037653002402061700001102085700001502096700001302111700001702124700001902141700002002160700001802180773012202198856008302320852000902403655001202412IND60714833120221122042250.0201230e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071483312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yang10aThermal removal of partial nitrogen atoms in N-doped graphene for enhanced catalytic oxidation  ap. 640-648.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarbon materials are effective catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for organic pollutant degradation. Both nitrogen doping and structural defects could enhance their catalytic performance for PMS activation. In this study, nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) is first synthesized by the calcination of graphene oxide (GO) with ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The obtained NG is then annealed further at a higher temperature under a N₂ atmosphere to remove partially doped N atoms and create new structural defects. The obtained defective nitrogen-doped graphene (D-NG) can activate PMS for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation more effectively. Different annealing temperatures from 850 to 1150 °C are investigated, and D-NG synthesized at 1050 °C exhibits the highest activity. The enhanced catalytic performance is proposed to originate from the synergistic effect between doped N atoms and created structural defects. According to radical quenching, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electrochemical results, both radical and nonradical pathways are present during PMS activation, and the nonradical pathway plays the dominant role. This study provides a facile method for metal-free catalyst synthesis, which also enriches the synergistic mechanism between doped N and structural defects and thus should have great potential in wastewater remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrate 3abisphenol A 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asynergism 3atemperature 3awastewater 0aNitrogen doping 0aThermal removal 0aStructural defects 0aSynergistic effects 0aCatalytic oxidation1 aWu, Di1 aChen, Ying1 aLi, Yang1 aFan, Xiaobin1 aZhang, Fengbao1 aZhang, Guoliang1 aPeng, Wenchao0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Mar., v. 585 p.640-648dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014100166300001200307520194400319592002802263650002002291650001902311650001902330650001702349650001802366650001202384650001002396650002702406650000902433650001102442650001402453650001302467650002202480650001902502650002202521700001502543700001502558700005702573700001702630773010502647856008302752852000902835655001202844IND60701288320221121213819.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070128832DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02476-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Fang Fei10aGlobal analysis of expression profile of members of DnaJ gene families involved in capsaicinoids synthesis in pepper (Capsicum annuum L)  ap. 326.  aBACKGROUND: The DnaJ proteins play critical roles in plant development and stress responses. Recently, seventy-six DnaJ genes were identified through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis in the pepper genome. However, there were no reports on understanding of phylogenetic relationships and diverse expression profile of pepper DnaJ genes to date. Herein, we performed the systemic analysis of the phylogenetic relationships and expression profile of pepper DnaJ genes in different tissues and in response to both abiotic stress and plant hormones. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the pepper DnaJ genes were grouped into 7 sub-families (sub-family I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII) according to sequence homology. The expression of pepper DnaJs in different tissues revealed that about 38% (29/76) of pepper DnaJs were expressed in at least one tissue. The results demonstrate the potentially critical role of DnaJs in pepper growth and development. In addition, to gain insight into the expression difference of pepper DnaJ genes in placenta between pungent and non-pungent, their expression patterns were also analyzed using RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR. Comparison analysis revealed that eight genes presented distinct expression profiles in pungent and non-pungent pepper. The CaDnaJs co-expressed with genes involved in capsaicinoids synthesis during placenta development. What is more, our study exposed the fact that these eight DnaJ genes were probably regulated by stress (heat, drought and salt), and were also regulated by plant hormones (ABA, GA3, MeJA and SA). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these results showed that some DnaJ genes expressed in placenta may be involved in plant response to abiotic stress during biosynthesis of compounds related with pungency. The study provides wide insights to the expression profiles of pepper DanJ genes and contributes to our knowledge about the function of DnaJ genes in pepper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aabiotic stress 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acapsaicinoids 3adrought 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3aheat 3apepper 3aphylogeny 3aplacenta 3aplant development 3aplant response 3asequence homology1 aLiu, Fawan1 aYang, Xian1 aWan, Hongjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7426-498X1 aKang, Yunyan0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.326-326dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02476-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04329naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100002900186245011600215300001200331506007600343520232100419592002802740506003702768650001002805650002402815650002602839650002902865650001502894650002402909650001302933650002702946650002102973650002002994650001203014650001103026650001203037650003003049650001803079650001403097650001803111650001103129650001103140650001203151650001103163650003103174650002703205650004503232650002503277700002503302700003303327700002303360700002803383700001803411700001803429700002203447700001803469773009203487856007903579852000903658655001203667IND60080311720221207132105.0161029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008031172DNAL7 aPMC41120392pmcid7 a250519192pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-7-3292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSant’Anna, Mauricio RV10aColonisation resistance in the sand fly gut: Leishmania protects Lutzomyia longipalpis from bacterial infection  ap. 329.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies transmit the haemoflagellate Leishmania, the causative agent of human leishmaniasis. The Leishmania promastigotes are confined to the gut lumen and are exposed to the gut microbiota within female sand flies. Here we study the colonisation resistance of yeast and bacteria in preventing the establishment of a Leishmania population in sand flies and the ability of Leishmania to provide colonisation resistance towards the insect bacterial pathogen Serratia marcescens that is also pathogenic towards Leishmania. METHODS: We isolated microorganisms from wild-caught and laboratory-reared female Lutzomyia longipalpis, identified as Pseudozyma sp. Asaia sp. and Ochrobactrum intermedium. We fed the females with a sugar meal containing the microorganisms and then subsequently fed them with a bloodmeal containing Leishmania mexicana and recorded the development of the Leishmania population. Further experiments examined the effect of first colonising the sand fly gut with L. mexicana followed by feeding with, Serratia marcescens, an insect bacterial pathogen. The mortality of the flies due to S. marcescens was recorded in the presence and absence of Leishmania. RESULTS: There was a reduction in the number of flies harbouring a Leishmania population that had been pre-fed with Pseudozyma sp. and Asaia sp. or O. intermedium. Experiments in which L. mexicana colonised the sand fly gut prior to being fed an insect bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, showed that the survival of flies with a Leishmania infection was significantly higher compared to flies without Leishmania infection. CONCLUSIONS: The yeast and bacterial colonisation experiments show that the presence of sand fly gut microorganisms reduce the potential for Leishmania to establish within the sand fly vector. Sand flies infected with Leishmania were able to survive an attack by the bacterial pathogen that would have killed the insect and we concluded that Leishmania may benefit its insect host whilst increasing the potential to establish itself in the sand fly vector. We suggest that the increased ability of the sand fly to withstand a bacterial entomopathogen, due to the presence of the Leishmania, may provide an evolutionary pressure for the maintenance of the Leishmania-vector association.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAsaia 3aLeishmania mexicana 3aLutzomyia longipalpis 3aOchrobactrum intermedium 3aPseudozyma 3aSerratia marcescens 3abacteria 3abacterial colonization 3adigestive system 3aentomopathogens 3afemales 3ahumans 3ainsects 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aleishmaniasis 3amortality 3apromastigotes 3asugars 3ayeasts 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aLeishmaniaxphysiology 2aPsychodidaexmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aSerratiaxphysiology1 aDiaz-Albiter, Hector1 aAguiar-Martins, Kelsilândia1 aAl Salem, Waleed S1 aCavalcante, Reginaldo R1 aDillon, Viv M1 aBates, Paul A1 aGenta, Fernando A1 aDillon, Rod J0 tParasites & vectors.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.329-329dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-3293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002300185245005900208300001600267520075500283592002801038653001301066653002801079653001701107653001701124653002701141700002401168773012801192856007801320852000901398655001201407IND60517100620221119121259.0160328e20140419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051710062DNAL7 a10.1139/cjpp-2013-04862doi7 aPMC43980632pmcid7 a248737602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurand, Matthew J.10aExercise and vascular function: how much is too much?1  ap. 551-557.  aExercise is a powerful therapy for preventing the onset of and slowing the progression of cardiovascular disease.

This review highlights examples of how vascular function can paradoxically be impaired in otherwise healthy individuals by extreme levels of exercise, with a focus on the causative role that reactive oxygen species play in this impairment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aexercise 0areactive oxygen species 0avasodilation 0anitric oxide 0aflow mediated dilation1 aGutterman, David D.0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2014 Apr. 19, v. 92, no. 7 p.551-557dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2013-04863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245009500188300001600283520120000299592002801499650003701527650001301564650001701577650001101594650001501605650001001620650001201630650001601642650001501658650002201673650001401695650001301709650001901722650001601741650001701757650001901774700003101793700002001824700002701844700003001871773010001901856008102001852000902082655001202091IND60080710620221118054601.0150216e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008071062DNAL7 a249741952pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-014-0218-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertini, Elisa V.10aGluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5 possesses an active quorum sensing regulatory system  ap. 497-506.  aThe endophytic bacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus colonizes a broad range of host plants. Its plant growth-promoting capability is related to the capacity to perform biological nitrogen fixation, the biosynthesis of siderophores, antimicrobial substances and the solubilization of mineral nutrients. Colonization of and survival in these endophytic niche requires a complex regulatory network. Among these, quorum sensing systems (QS) are signaling mechanisms involved in the control of several genes related to microbial interactions, host colonization and stress survival. G. diazotrophicus PAL5 possesses a QS composed of a luxR and a luxI homolog, and produces eight molecules from the AHL family as QS signals. In this report data are provided showing that glucose concentration modifies the relative levels of these signal molecules. The activity of G. diazotrophicus PAL5 QS is also altered in presence of other carbon sources and under saline stress conditions. Inactivation of the QS system of G. diazotrophicus PAL5 by means of a quorum quenching strategy allowed the identification of extracellular and intracellular proteins under the control of this regulatory mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGluconacetobacter diazotrophicus 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aendophytes 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrients 3aproteins 3aquorum sensing 3asalt stress 3asiderophores 3asolubilization1 aNieto Peñalver, Carlos G.1 aLeguina, Ana C.1 aIrazusta, Verónica P.1 ade Figueroa, Lucía I.

To better understand Arp2/3 complex regulation, we used single-particle electron microscopy to compare the structures of Arp2/3 complex bound to three different inhibitory ligands: glia maturation factor (GMF), Coronin, and Arpin. Although the three inhibitors have distinct binding sites on Arp2/3 complex, they each induced an “open” nucleation-inactive conformation. Coronin promoted a standard (previously described) open conformation of Arp2/3 complex, with the N-terminal β-propeller domain of Coronin positioned near the p35/ARPC2 subunit of Arp2/3 complex. GMF induced two distinct open conformations of Arp2/3 complex, which correlated with the two suggested binding sites for GMF. Furthermore, GMF synergized with Coronin in inhibiting actin nucleation by Arp2/3 complex. Arpin, which uses VCA-related acidic (A) motifs to interact with the Arp2/3 complex, induced the standard open conformation, and two new masses appeared at positions near Arp2 and Arp3. Furthermore, Arpin showed additive inhibitory effects on Arp2/3 complex with Coronin and GMF. Together, these data suggest that Arp2/3 complex conformation is highly polymorphic and that its activities can be controlled combinatorially by different inhibitory ligands.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3abinding sites 3acell movement 3aelectron microscopy 3aendocytosis 3aligands 0aArp 0aNPF 0aGMF 0aEM 0aGST 0aFSC 0aactin nucleation 0asingle-particle EM 0ayeast 0aconformation1 aChemeris, Angelina1 aGuo, Siyang1 aAlioto, Salvatore L.1 aGandhi, Meghal1 aPadrick, Shae1 aPechnikova, Evgeniya1 aDavid, Violaine1 aGautreau, Alexis1 aGoode, Bruce L.0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007900166300001800245520090600263592002801169650001101197650001401208650002301222650001801245650001101263650001201274650002101286700001801307700001301325773009801338856008101436990002301517852000901540655001201549IND60093786120221123032533.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009378612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2012.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBae, Sung Jong10aElectroreduction of oxygen on Pd catalysts supported on Ti-modified carbon  ap. 1476-1480.  aCarbon supports modified with well dispersed anatase TiO₂ (C–Ti-X; X (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) represents mass ratio of Ti precursor to carbon) were synthesized with various Ti loadings and used to support Pd catalysts for oxygen reduction. The anatase nanoparticles increased in size with increasing Ti loading. Pd dispersion improved with increasing Ti loading up to the C–Ti-0.75, which resulted in the best catalytic activity. Although the Pd dispersion was lowest on the C–Ti-1.0, it showed better catalytic performance than the catalysts supported on C–Ti-0.25 and C–Ti-0.5. At 0.8V (vs. RHE), the best catalytic activity achieved was respectively 2.7 and 2.7 times the mass and specific activities of Pd supported on un-modified carbon. The interaction between Pd and highly dispersed TiO₂ is believed to improve the catalytic activity of Pd supported on TiO₂-modified carbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aphysics 3atitanium dioxide1 aNahm, Kee Suk1 aKim, Pil0 tCurrent applied physics.g2012 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.1476-1480dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2012.04.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002500153245012300178300001400301520162000315592002801935650002801963650001301991650002902004650002402033650002702057650001702084650001402101650001002115650001902125650001802144650001702162650001202179650001902191650002002210650002402230650001302254650002002267650001202287650002602299650001402325700001702339700001902356700001702375700001902392773009702411856008902508852000902597655001202606IND4477276920221121055418.0141112e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447727692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Alessandro, A.G.10aHow the nutritional value and consumer acceptability of suckling lambs meat is affected by the maternal feeding system  ap. 83-91.  aThe effects of two lambs rearing systems – suckling from stall-fed (hay and concentrate) or pasture-fed mothers – on carcass characteristics, meat quality, fatty acids composition, vitamin E content and collagen characteristics, were studied in eighteen lambs. The effect of consumer knowledge about the lamb-rearing system on the hedonic ratings of meat was also assessed through consumer testing. Lambs subdivided into two experimental groups (No. 9) of different maternal feeding system received exclusively maternal milk and were slaughtered at 45 days of age. A higher leg weight with a higher proportion of fat and a lower proportion of lean resulted from the lambs of pasture-fed mothers, while total muscle protein content was higher in lambs of stall-fed mothers. Intramuscular saturated fatty acids (SFA) were lower in lambs from pasture-fed mothers, while polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), linolenic acid (18:3 n-3), and n-3 fatty acids were higher, displaying more favourable indexes for human health (n-6/n-3, SFA/PUFA, thrombogenic index). Maternal pasture feeding also caused higher α-tocopherol content and different collagen characteristics. The consumer test showed that when information on the animal rearing system was provided, the meat from lambs of pasture-fed mothers was preferred to meat from lambs of stall-fed mothers. In conclusion, this study has shown that maternal feeding system in the stall or in pasture affects the nutritional value of suckling lamb meat and consumer acceptability after they are given information on the production system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcass characteristics 3acollagen 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aconsumer acceptance 3afatty acid composition 3ahuman health 3alamb meat 3alambs 3alinolenic acid 3amaternal milk 3ameat quality 3amothers 3amuscle protein 3anutritive value 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apastures 3aprotein content 3arearing 3asaturated fatty acids 3avitamin E1 aMaiorano, G.1 aKowaliszyn, B.1 aLoiudice, P.1 aMartemucci, G.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2012 Aug., v. 106, no. 2-3 p.83-91dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013500171300001800306500001900324520098100343592002801324650002501352650001101377650003001388650001601418650002601434650002301460650001401483650001301497650001101510651001101521700002201532700002001554700002001574773013501594856004801729852000901777655001201786IND50064309020221116141357.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006430902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1139-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonopoulos, I.-S.10aApplying waste management scenarios in the Peloponnese region in Greece: a critical analysis in the frame of life cycle assessment  ap. 2499-2511.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this paper is to apply life cycle assessment in the waste management sector, in order to compare the environmental performance of different waste management methods. The methods that are studied are: landfilling, aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment, incineration and recycling, focusing on mass and energy balances and the environmental performance of each applied scenario. The Peloponnese Region in Greece was selected as a case for the application of this methodology and more specifically its largest municipalities, where a significant amount of waste is presented. The conducted LCA study proves the necessity of the adoption of an integrated waste management system and indicates its principal objectives by measuring environmental impacts. Thermal scenario contributes significant to the mitigation on the Greenhouse Gases. On the other hand, separation at source and recycling practices provides significant benefits to the abiotic depletion impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological treatment 3aenergy 3aenvironmental performance 3agreenhouses 3alife cycle assessment 3amanagement systems 3apollution 3aresearch 3awastes 3aGreece1 aKaragiannidis, A.1 aTsatsarelis, T.1 aPerkoulidis, G.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Apr., v. 20, no. 4 p.2499-2511dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1139-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002000171245010800191300001600299520099400315592002801309650004401337650002501381650002701406650001101433650001901444650001901463650001601482650002401498650001801522650001901540650001301559650001301572650002501585650001201610650001101622650001101633650003501644650004501679650001401724650004801738650001701786650002401803650002801827650003701855650005401892650002301946700001901969700001801988700001602006773009602022856008602118852000902204655001202213IND60095598420221120170511.0141104e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009559842DNAL7 a208881942pmid7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dong-Hao10aEffect of hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of magnetic microspheres on the immobilization of BSA  ap. 302-306.  aCore-shell magnetic poly(styrene-acrylamide-acrylic acid) microspheres with carboxyl groups were successfully synthesized via dispersion copolymerization in the presence of nano-particle of Fe₃O₄. The microspheres were characterized by FTIR spectra. They were used as carrier to immobilize bovine serum albumin (BSA). To investigate the effect of the microsphere surface properties on the immobilization of BSA, a series of microspheres with different hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface characteristics were prepared by adjusting molar percentages of monomers. The results showed that microspheres with different hydrophobicities/hydrophilicities had different immobilized ratios of BSA. In comparison with microspheres having hydrophilic characteristics those with hydrophobic characteristics had a much higher immobilized ratio. The possible reasons for these observations are discussed. In addition, ester activation and coupling times were optimized with respect to immobilized ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abovine serum albumin 3achemical concentration 3aesters 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3airon oxides 3amagnetic properties 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asurfaces 2aAcrylatesxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aEsters 2aFerrosoferric Oxidexchemistry 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aMagnetics 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmissionxmethods 2aMicrospheres 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aPolystyrenesxchemistry 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexchemistry 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aSurface Properties1 aZhang, Ya-Fang1 aZhi, Gao-Ying1 aXie, Yu-Lei0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 82, no. 2 p.302-306dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245011000189300001800299520210300317592002802420650001802448650002602466650001902492650001102511650001902522650002302541650001002564650005002574650002502624650001002649650002002659650001802679650001002697650001402707650003802721650001002759650003002769650001002799651001102809700002302820700002302843773014002866856008203006852000903088655001203097IND50067483720221117231006.0210324e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006748372DNAL7 a232919152pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-012-3051-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolton, Douglas K.10aMeasuring forest structure along productivity gradients in the Canadian boreal with small-footprint Lidar  ap. 6617-6634.  aThe structure and productivity of boreal forests are key components of the global carbon cycle and impact the resources and habitats available for species. With this research, we characterized the relationship between measurements of forest structure and satellite-derived estimates of gross primary production (GPP) over the Canadian boreal. We acquired stand level indicators of canopy cover, canopy height, and structural complexity from nearly 25,000 km of small-footprint discrete return Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data and compared these attributes to GPP estimates derived from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). While limited in our capacity to control for stand age, we removed recently disturbed and managed forests using information on fire history, roads, and anthropogenic change. We found that MODIS GPP was strongly linked to Lidar-derived canopy cover (r = 0.74, p < 0.01), however was only weakly related to Lidar-derived canopy height and structural complexity as these attributes are largely a function of stand age. A relationship was apparent between MODIS GPP and the maximum sampled heights derived from Lidar as growth rates and resource availability likely limit tree height in the prolonged absence of disturbance. The most structurally complex stands, as measured by the coefficient of variation of Lidar return heights, occurred where MODIS GPP was highest as productive boreal stands are expected to contain a wider range of tree heights and transition to uneven-aged structures faster than less productive stands. While MODIS GPP related near-linearly to Lidar-derived canopy cover, the weaker relationships to Lidar-derived canopy height and structural complexity highlight the importance of stand age in determining the structure of boreal forests. We conclude that an improved quantification of how both productivity and disturbance shape stand structure is needed to better understand the current state of boreal forests in Canada and how these forests are changing in response to changing climate and disturbance regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage structure 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aboreal forests 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3aforest mensuration 3alidar 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aprimary productivity 3aroads 3astand structure 3astate forests 3atrees 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aRadar 2aRemote Sensing Technology 2aTrees 0aCanada1 aCoops, Nicholas C.1 aWulder, Michael A.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Aug., v. 185, no. 8 p.6617-6634dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-3051-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245007100207300001600278520107900294592002801373596002801401596002801429650000901457650001701466650001801483650001501501700002501516773010801541856008101649852000901730655001201739IND60634952420221120183614.0190327e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063495242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-018-9866-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHautala, Johanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4451-629010aCreativity-related mobilities of peripheral artists and scientists  ap. 381-394.  aCreativity and mobility are often connected but rarely studied from a process perspective. In this article, we study the strategies and practices of creativity-related long- and short-term mobilities during the careers of 61 artists and scientists who live and work in peripheral locations. We identified home-based visiting practices, transnational circulating practices, and local (im)mobility practices that facilitate differently the creative outcomes of these artists and scientists. With this multi-case study on creativity-related mobility, we develop a broader understanding of centres and peripheries from a process perspective. In general, to move forward in their careers, peripherally located artists and scientists need to be in contact with the centre and its key paradigms. The mobilities of studied artists and scientists blur the simplistic division of the world of creativity that is divided into centre and periphery. From creativity-related mobility emerge cores that foster the center’s paradigms and edges that challenge the mainstream of the centre.  aPublisher supplied data  a266212cSuomen Akatemia  a259078cSuomen Akatemia 3aarts 3acase studies 3aprofessionals 3ascientists1 aJauhiainen, Jussi S.0 tGeoJournal.g2019 Apr., v. 84, no. 2 p.381-394dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl10001x0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-018-9866-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013800171300001600309500001500325520136000340592002801700650001701728650001401745650001701759650002701776650001901803650002401822650001201846650002001858650000901878650000901887650001301896653002601909653002501935653001801960653003801978653001202016700005302028700001702081700001602098700002302114773011302137856008602250852000902336655001202345IND60542866120221120070036.0190408e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054286612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.08.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassiotis, C.N.10aEnvironmental and developmental factors affect essential oil production and quality of Lavandula angustifolia during flowering period  ap. 359-366.  a2019-12-06  aThe world demand for lavender essential oil is still increasing. Despite of growing interest and the commercial importance of lavender oil it is not clear how environmental and developmental factors influence the optimum period of harvesting lavender flowers for essential oil production. In this report, it was evaluated how the quality and quantity of Lavandula angustifolia cv. Etherio essential oil (EO) is influenced during blooming by environmental factors. It was examined if lavender EO is correlated with gene expression during blooming, targeting to manage the optimum EO harvesting time. The EO content was positively regulated by temperature and flowering stage development while it was negatively affected by rainfall during flowering period. The quality of EO and specifically linalool content was influenced by temperature, flower development, LaLINS expression and rainfall. Although rainfalls remarkably decrease linalool production, the quality of lavender oil was recovered after ten days, suggesting that linalool biosynthesis is regulated during flowering period by both environmental and developmental cues. It is suggested, that the optimum harvesting period to obtain valuable lavender essential oil is when flowering reaches at 60%, ambient temperature is over 26°C and no precipitations were occurred ten days before harvesting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvest date 3aflowering 3abiosynthesis 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aessential oils 3aambient temperature 3aflowers 3agene expression 3aoils 3arain 3alinalool 0aEnvironmental factors 0adevelopmental stages 0aEssential oil 0aLinalool synthase gene expression 0aGC–MS1 aNtana, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5592-44921 aLazari, D.M.1 aPoulios, S.1 aVlachonasios, K.E.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Dec., v. 62 p.359-366dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.08.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04132naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010600168300001200274520254200286592002802828650000802856650004202864650002202906650000902928650001402937650001202951650001202963650002102975650002202996650002203018650002403040650001003064650001003074650003003084650001203114650000903126650001403135650003003149650001003179650001403189650001003203650001303213650001403226651001103240700001803251700002203269700001303291700002203304700001903326773012903345856008303474852000903557655001203566IND60549164620221117180155.0160907e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054916462DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-12-0738-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarboza, E. A.10aIdentification of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici Race 3 Infecting Tomatoes in Northeast Brazil  ap. 422.  aThe three races of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL) are important tomato pathogens throughout the world, causing severe economic losses (1). In Brazil, races 1 and 2 are widespread, but the current geographic distribution of race 3 is restricted to the mild climate areas of Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro States in the southeast region (2,3). Here we report the spread of FOL race 3 to the warm northeast region of Brazil. Plants in commercial fields of the hybrid ‘Alambra’ (resistant to FOL races 1 and 2) were found displaying chlorosis, vascular browning, and wilt symptoms in Jaguaquara County, Bahia State, Brazil. Disease incidence ranged from 10 to 50%. The virulence profile of six isolates obtained from three distinct tomato-producing fields was investigated by root-dipping inoculation (10⁶ conidia/ml) of 21-day-old seedlings from a set of FOL race differential accessions: ‘Ponderosa’ (susceptible to all races), ‘IPA-5’ (FOL race 1 resistance; I-1 locus); ‘Alambra’ and ‘Floradade’ (FOL races 1 and 2 resistance; I-2 gene), and Solanum pennellii ‘LA 716’ (resistant to all three races; I-3 locus). All six isolates were able to induce severe wilt symptoms in 100% of the plants from all lines but S. pennellii ‘LA 716’. FOL race 3 identity was confirmed via PCR assays employing a specific set of primers that are able to discriminate all the three FOL races as well as F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici isolates (1). Total DNA was extracted from pure fungal colonies growing in agar medium. The typical FOL race 3 amplicon profiles (i.e. positive for the primers uni, sp13, and sp23 and negative for the primer sprl) were observed only in the six FOL 3 isolates from Bahia as well as in five reference isolates of race 3 (previously obtained from tomato in Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro States), thus confirming their race identities. This recent, fast, and wide geographic expansion of the FOL race 3 in Brazil suggests that the pathogen has been introduced into new tomato producing areas via either contaminated seeds or seedlings. Because of the complexity of establishing effective chemical and cultural control strategies, these epidemics caused by FOL race 3 in distinct areas of Brazil might cause the replacement of the currently grown susceptible hybrids by resistant ones.References: (1) Y.

K.,10aEffect of neutral pressure on the He plasma flow measurement in a linear device  ap. 1497-1502.  aAxial and azimuthal flow velocities have been measured in a linear plasma device called NAGDIS-II (NAGoya DIvertor Simulator-II), along with plasma density and electron temperature, using a vector Mach probe composed of two Mach probes, one of which is for the axial flow, and the other is for the azimuthal flow. To study the effect of neutral pressure on the deduction of the Mach numbers, the ratio of upstream to downstream currents are measured by changing the neutral pressure for the deduction of flow velocities. Helium plasma was generated with pressure of 2–35 mTorr. Since the ion gyro-radius at the magnetic flux of 300 G is larger than the probe size, an unmagnetized collisionless Mach probe theory was used for the deduction of Mach numbers and their variations. In order to check the range of collisionality, plasma density (nₑ = 10¹⁰–10¹¹ cm⁻³) and electron temperature (Tₑ = 2–9 eV) are measured by a single electric probe using a conventional collisionless probe theory. Variations of Mach number, electron temperature and plasma density with collisionless models are to be compared with those using collisional models for different pressures where ionization and ion-neutral collision are included. Mach numbers by the collisionless model are found to be overestimated by 120% for the maximum difference even in weakly collisional plasmas. A clear flow reversal exists in the axial direction with higher pressure plasma, even in the linear machine. Azimuthal flows are also measured simultaneously along with axial flows, yet they seem to be very small in the present cold ion plasma (Tᵢ/Tₑ << 1).  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3ahelium 3aionization 3amodels 3atemperature1 aWoo, H.-J.1 aChung, K.-S.1 aTanaka, H.1 aKajita, S.1 aOhno, N.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2012 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.1497-1502dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2012.04.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04406naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010500166300001600271500001500287520265900302592002802961650001602989650002103005650002503026650001503051650002203066650002103088650001303109650001103122650001003133650002303143650002403166650001403190650001503204650001803219650002003237650001103257650002503268650001303293650002703306650001503333651001003348653002403358653001903382653001503401653003603416653002203452653002803474700002003502700001603522700001303538700001703551700001603568773011403584856008503698852000903783655001203792IND60535917620221119034914.0190415e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053591762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2013.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qingxue10aEffects of soil improvement of Caragana intermedia plantations in alpine sandy land on Tibet Plateau  ap. 123-128.  a2019-12-06  aThe restoration of vegetation is an important measure to combat land desertification. In this process, the distribution of soil water, soil organic matter and soil available nutrient may be affected by vegetation. Caragana intermedia, a leguminous shrub, is one of the major species widely planted to fix the moving and semi-moving sand dunes in the alpine sandy land in Gonghe Basin on Tibet Plateau. The objective of this study was to determine how soil conditions on sand dune were affected by C. intermedia plantation after this shrub grows up. Effects of the plantation age on soil water content (SWC), soil organic matter (SOM) content and available nutrient content were examined in four ages of C. intermedia plantation, e.g. 3-, 11-, 25-, and 37-year-old. Soil samples were collected for four replicates from six depths (0–5cm, 5–10cm, 10–20cm, 20–50cm, 50–70cm and 70–100cm) at leeside of the plant. The results showed that: (1) SWC of 25- and 37-year-old C. intermedia plantations was significantly higher than 3- and 11-year-old plantations in 0–10cm and 10–20cm (P<0.05). (2) SOM content of 25-year-old C. intermedia plantation was significantly higher than 3-, 11- and 37-year-old C. intermedia plantations in 10–20cm (P<0.05). With the increase of plantation age, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+–N) content of C. intermedia plantation increased significantly in 10–100cm (P<0.05). The nitrate nitrogen (NO3-–N) content of 3-, 11- and 25-year-old C. intermedia plantations in 0–50cm increased significantly with the increase of plantation age (P < 0.05); however, the NO3-–N content of 37-year-old C. intermedia plantation decreased significantly (P <0.05). The available phosphorus (P) content of 3-, 11- and 25-year-old C. intermedia plantations in 20–100cm significantly decreased with increasing plantation age (P <0.05). The available P content of 25-year-old C. intermedia plantation was significantly lower than the other three ages of plantation in 20–100cm (P <0.05). The available potassium (K) content of 25-year-old C. intermedia plantation in 20–50cm and 50–70cm was significantly lower than the other three ages of plantations (P <0.05). (3) Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that SWC, SOM, NH4+–N, NO3-–N, available P and available K content were affected significantly by plantation age (P < 0.001). Therefore, soil property on sand dune could be improved after the establishment of C. intermedia plantation in alpine sandy land of Gonghe Basin, including water, organic matter and nitrogen. However, phosphorus and potassium in soil was consumed by plant after C. intermedia plantation grows up.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplantations 3anutrient content 3aCaragana korshinskii 3aphosphorus 3aammonium nitrogen 3anitrate nitrogen 3aplanting 3abasins 3adunes 3asoil water content 3asoil organic matter 3apotassium 3asoil water 3asoil sampling 3adesertification 3ashrubs 3aanalysis of variance 3anitrogen 3aecological restoration 3avegetation 3aChina 0aSoil organic matter 0aorganic matter 0aSoil water 0aCaragana intermedia plantations 0aAlpine sandy land 0aSoil available nutrient1 aWang, Yongsheng1 aZhu, Yajuan1 aLi, Hong1 aJia, Zhiqing1 aLiu, Haitao0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2014 Apr., v. 34, no. 2 p.123-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2013.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100003400150245010500184300001600289520101200305592002801317650001701345650001501362650002301377650001901400650001201419650002201431650001301453650001601466650001201482650001401494650001801508700002301526700002801549700002701577700002601604700001801630773008801648856008601736852000901822655001201831IND4446547920221120221815.0141111e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444654792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.10.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorarinsdottir, Kristin Anna14aThe effects of salt-curing and salting procedures on the microstructure of cod (Gadus morhua) muscle  ap. 109-115.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of salting and different pre-salting procedures (injection and brining versus brining only) on the microstructure and water retention of heavy salted cod products. Salting resulted in shrinkage of fibre diameter and enlargement of inter-cellular space. Water was expelled from the muscle and a higher fraction became located in the extra-cellular matrix. These changes were suggested to originate from myofibrillar protein aggregation and enzymatic degradation of the connective tissue. During rehydration, the muscle absorbed water again and the fibers swelled up to a similar cross-sectional area as in the raw muscle. However, the inter-cellular space remained larger, resulting in a higher water content of the muscle in the rehydrated stage. The effects of different salting procedures were strongest after salting. At that stage of the process, the inter-cellular space tended to be larger in the injected and brined muscle than in the brined only.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGadus morhua 3acod (fish) 3aconnective tissues 3amicrostructure 3amuscles 3aprocessing stages 3aproteins 3arehydration 3asalting 3ashrinkage 3awater content1 aArason, Sigurjón,1 aSigurgisladottir, Sjofn1 aGunnlaugsson, Valur N.1 aJohannsdottir, Jonina1 aTornberg, Eva0 tFood chemistry.g2011 May 1, v. 126, no. 1 p.109-115dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.10.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04141naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011000163300001400273520221400287592002802501650000802529650002302537650002502560650001202585650002102597650001802618650001002636650001202646650002302658650001502681650001402696650002002710650002402730650002502754650002302779650002602802650000902828650001002837650002702847650001202874650001202886650003002898650002202928650001402950650001702964650001102981650001702992651001003009653004103019653003003060653002603090653001403116700001503130700001603145700002003161700001803181700001603199700001603215773014203231856008503373852000903458655001203467IND60535917720221118032405.0190415e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053591772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2013.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jun10aIndividual and sexual identification for the wild black muntjac (Muntiacus crinifrons) based on fecal DNA  ap. 13-18.  aThe black muntjac (Muntiacus crinifrons), endemic to China, was categorized as a Grade I National Key Protected Animal by the Ministry of Agriculture of China and classified as Vulnerable (VU) by IUCN. Recent years, studies had been conducted on this species mainly focusing on habitat selection, food habit, gene flow etc., only with a few reports on the population dynamics. Individual identification of wild animals is one of the most important subjects in the population dynamic research. Of various molecular markers, microsatellite DNA fingerprinting has been used most frequently and successfully on many kinds of animals. Here, we constructed identification system for the black muntjac using 8 microsatellite loci. 31 black muntjacs were identified from 141 fecal samples, whereas 43 samples could be used for PCR after repeated trials. Further, the sequencing for Cytb gene was also conducted for convincing us the identity of fecal samples. The results, highly consistent between sequencing consequence and sequence data from Genebank, implied that those experienced local people are of the convincing knowledge about wild animals, especially at the respects of identification to black muntjac’ feces pellets. Moreover, we detected the specificity of identification system to black muntjac. BM1225 was the only one locus that unsuccessful PCR for the muscle samples of Muntiacus reevesi was observed, which suggested that our identification system could be used for excluding the non-researched objects in some cases. Analyses using softwares CERVUS 3.0 and POPGENE 1.21 showed that the present identification system had strong discrimination power: 0.938 per loci (DP) or 0.999 in total (CDP). The mean observed number of alleles (Na), mean effective number of alleles (Ne), and mean excepted heterogosity (He) were 8.875, 6.375, and 0.829 respectively. Considering that the change of sex ratio in population could exert significant impact on population growth, density to some extent, we also analyzed the sex ratio of those individuals that had been identified based on fecal samples from filed using SRY (Sex-determining region Y) gene amplification, which identified 19 males and 12 females.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aMuntiacus crinifrons 3aalleles 3acrystal proteins 3aeating habits 3afeces 3afemales 3agene amplification 3agene banks 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3ahabitat preferences 3aindigenous knowledge 3aindigenous peoples 3ainsecticidal proteins 3aloci 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amuscles 3apellets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation growth 3asex ratio 3asex reversal 3asodium 3awild animals 3aChina 0aBlack muntjac (Muntiacus crinifrons) 0aIndividual identification 0aSexual identification 0aFecal DNA1 aBao, Yixin1 aWang, Yanni1 aZheng, Weicheng1 aChen, Xiaonan1 aHe, Weiping1 aShi, Weiwei0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2014 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.13-18dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of China.wJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2013.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002400171245008600195300001600281520071500297592002801012650004401040650002401084650002501108650001301133650002601146650001801172650002101190650001301211650003301224650002501257650004401282650001601326650001401342650002601356650001101382650002501393650003101418650001301449650004401462650002901506650002401535650002701559650003101586650005401617650002501671650003001696700001801726773009601744856008601840852000901926655001201935IND60095598720221120190607.0141104e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009559872DNAL7 a208893162pmid7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalajīta Siṅgha,10aDesign of sterculia gum based double potential antidiarrheal drug delivery system  ap. 325-332.  aIn view of the antidiarrheal properties of sterculia gum and ornidazole, an attempt has been made to synthesize novel hydrogels by functionalization of sterculia gum with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) for release of the model antidiarrheal drug ornidazole.

S.10aFirst Report of Hosta virus X Infecting Hosta Plants in China  ap. 429.  aHosta (Hosta spp.) plants showing leaf deformation, puckering, and ink-bleed symptoms were collected in July 2012 from a park at Dongcheng district, Beijing, China. Three out of six samples tested positive for Hosta virus X (HVX) by immunostrip and double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA with HVX-specific serological reagents from Agdia Inc. (Elkhart, IN, USA). Filamentous viral particles were trapped and observed from the infected hosta leaf sap by immuno-serological electron microscopy (ISEM) (antibodies from Agdia). To confirm HVX infection, three ELISA-positive samples were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR assay, using virus-specific primers HVXf (5′-ATCCGTTATCTACAGGGGACCAG-3′) and HVXr (5′-TAAGTTAGTGGAACGGTTAGCCCGAT-3′) that amplified a 1,067-bp fragment including the coat protein (CP) coding region. The CP nucleotide sequence comparisons showed 99% to 100% homology among the three isolates named HVXBJ4, HVXBJ5, and HVXBJ6 (GenBank Accession No. JX535292, JX535293, and JX535294) and with the HVX sequences previously reported in GenBank. HVX has been reported from the United States, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, France, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand (1,2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of HVX infecting hosta plants in China. As an ornamental and medicinal plant, hosta has been cultivated in China for more than 2,000 years. The presence of HVX in Beijing is a potential threat to the landscape in the city. HVX can be spread by vegetative propagation material or mechanical contact (3). Hence, to cultivate HVX-free hosta and restrict the movement of HVX-infected hosta is vitally important in the future. HVX has become economically important in the world more recently. Globalization of trade in hosta plants has increased the risk of movement of HVX. The national plant protection organization should establish effective quarantine strategy and the growers take proper planting measures to avoid further spreading of this virus.References: (1) S.

The long-term ingestion of groundwater containing high concentrations of fluoride is one of the main causes of fluorosis. We used artificial neural network to model the relationship between groundwater fluoride concentrations from throughout China and environmental variables such as climatic, geological. and soil parameters as proxy predictors. The results show that the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model in the test dataset are 80.5% and 0.86%, respectively, and climatic variables are the most effective predictors. Based on the artificial neural network model, a nationwide prediction risk map of fluoride concentrations exceeding 1.5 mg/L with a 0.5 × 0.5 arc minutes resolution was generated. The high risk areas are mainly located in western provinces of Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, and Sichuan, and the northern provinces of Inner Mongolia, Hebei and Shandong. The total number of people estimated to be potentially at risk of fluorosis due to the use of untreated high fluoride groundwater as drinking water is about 89 million, or 6% of the population. The high fluoride groundwater risk map helps the authorities to prioritize areas requiring mitigation measures and thus facilitates the implementation of water improvement and defluoridation projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adefluoridation 3afluorosis 3agroundwater 3aneural networks 3apeople 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3aChina 0aFluoride 0aArtificial neural network1 aXie, Xianjun1 aWang, Yanxin1 aLiu, Hongxing0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2022 May, v. 115 p.140-148dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012600174300001600300500001500316520173600331592002802067650002502095650001302120650001702133650001402150650003402164650004302198650001202241650002102253650001802274650002002292650001902312650001802331650002102349650001702370650002502387650002202412650001802434650002102452653001602473653002102489653003302510653001702543653000902560653002202569653002102591700002302612700001702635700002002652700002302672773011302695856008602808852000902894655001202903IND60542866420221120065958.0190408e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054286642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarikurkcu, Cengiz10aPhenolic content, enzyme inhibitory and antioxidative activity potentials of Phlomis nissolii and P. pungens var. pungens  ap. 333-340.  a2019-12-06  aDue to the excellent ethnopharmacological uses or scientifically proved biological properties, members of the genus Phlomis is worth investigating. In this study, we reported antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities of the ethyl acetate, methanol and water extracts of Phlomis nissolii L. and P. pungens WILLD. var. pungens as well as their phenolic contents. Antioxidant activities were screened by β-carotene bleaching and phosphomolybdenum assays. Scavenging activities of the species were determined against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazloine-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), superoxide anion, and nitric oxide radicals. Additionally, reducing power (by cupric ion reducing activity – CUPRAC and ferric reducing antioxidant power – FRAP assays) and metal chelating effects of the samples were tested in vitro. The samples were also evaluated for their inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), tyrosinase, α-amylase, and α-glycosidase. Antioxidant activity of P. nissolii was found slightly higher than P. pungens var. pungens. In general, the best antioxidant activity was exhibited by the polar fractions (water extracts). In enzyme inhibition assays, both plants showed remarkable inhibition potential. Ethyl acetate extracts, especially, showed better inhibition capacity. Data presented for the antioxidant activities of the samples were found consistent with their phytochemical contents. According to HPLC analysis, (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, benzoic acid, and rosmarinic acid found as the major compounds for P. nissolii, while chlorogenic acid was the major phytochemical for the all fractions of P. pungens var. pungens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3amethanol 3anitric oxide 3ableaching 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aPhlomis 3asuperoxide anion 3abeta-carotene 3arosmarinic acid 3acholinesterase 3aethyl acetate 3achlorogenic acid 3abenzoic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aalpha-amylase 3ain vitro studies 0aAntioxidant 0aPhenolic content 0aPhlomis pungens var. pungens 0aantioxidants 0aHPLC 0aEnzyme inhibitory 0aPhlomis nissolii1 aUren, Mehmet Cemil1 aTepe, Bektas1 aCengiz, Mustafa1 aKocak, Mehmet Sefa0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Dec., v. 62 p.333-340dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011100166300001400277520155300291592002801844650001201872650001101884650001101895650001101906650001401917650001001931650002801941653002301969653002501992653003002017653002702047700001602074700001702090700001802107700002002125700001702145773014202162856008502304852000902389655001202398IND60535917920221118032348.0190415e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053591792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2013.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shasha10aAssessment of spatial distribution and cysts resources of Artemia in late autumn in Dangxiong Co salt lake  ap. 26-33.  aBased on the vertically interval sampling in 25 sampling sites in Dangxiong Co salt lake in 2011, a preliminary investigation on population spatial distribution and cysts resources of Artemia in the lake has been conducted. The study achieves four new progresses. First, the average density of Artemia and Artemia cysts in the lake is 4.157×103ind.m−2 and 8.069×104ind.m−2, respectively. Among Artemia, the adults account for 60.31%; Second, different from other salt lakes in horizontal distribution, the Artemia population mainly distributes in the open water, only a little in the shallow water, and there is no distribution in the longshore area in the north part and the estuary region; Third, in vertical distribution, 44.24% of individuals intensively distribute in the upper water layer within 2.0m, especially 0–0.2m, where the average density of Artemia and cysts are maximum (129.488ind.L−1 and 5.728ind.L−1, respectively). A decrease of distribution density is accompanied by an increase of water depth basically, the percentage of Artemia and cysts decrease to 0.68% and 4.60%, respectively; Fourth, the cysts resources of 14.96t in the lake are assessed using contour map. 66.35% of them distributed in 0.0–2.0m water layer and 49.06% concentrate in the 18.21% areas of the central water; Fifth, quantity of cysts suitable for development in the lake is 2.399±0.320t, with an upper limit of 0.879t. The study can provide a reference for the sustainable development and exploitation of Artemia in Dangxiong Co salt lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aadults 3aautumn 3acobalt 3aestuaries 3alakes 3asustainable development 0aArtemia population 0aSpatial distribution 0aCysts resource estimation 0aDangxiong Co salt lake1 aLiu, Xifang1 aJia, Qinxian1 aKong, Fanjing1 aZheng, Mianping1 aLv, Guangjun0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2014 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.26-33dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of China.wJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245012400172520163500296592002801931650001601959650002101975650001301996650001102009650001302020650002402033650002202057650001702079650001102096650001502107700002702122700002502149773012302174856008102297852000902378655001202387IND60754110520221116220921.0211023e20211016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075411052DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy111020732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPersiani, Alessandro 10aAgronomic and Environmental Performances of On-Farm Compost Production and Application in an Organic Vegetable Rotation  aHorticultural crops produce huge amounts of wastes due to the large difference between total and marketable yields, and plant residues. The biological stabilization and sanitization of these organic materials directly on-farm through a simple technique such as composting may be a feasible and sustainable management strategy. The objectives of this research were to (i) estimate the sustainability and the energy impact of the on-farm composting process; (ii) to evaluate the agronomic performance and sustainability of the compost application, compared to a commercial organic fertilizer; and (iii) to identify the management and environmental hotspots. To accomplish these aims, a composting process was set up and monitored using the organic wastes and residues produced in the experimental farm. The compost produced was compared to a commercial organic fertilizer in combination with the use of cover crops in the rotation, in a two-year pepper cultivation. All processes were assessed using an energy analysis and a carbon stocks and emissions evaluation. Our findings point out that the composting process on-farm was environmentally sustainable in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions and produced a good quality fertilizer. The use of this compost determined the best agronomic performance, especially when it was combined with other agro-ecological techniques. The yield values were slightly higher and statistically comparable with the commercial fertilizer ones. Moreover, the treatments that included the compost were most energy efficient and showed the best compromise between C emissions and C stocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3aagronomic traits 3aagronomy 3acarbon 3acomposts 3ademonstration farms 3aenergy efficiency 3ahorticulture 3apepper 3avegetables1 aMontemurro, Francesco 1 aDiacono, Mariangela 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Oct. 16, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111020733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245018400164300001600348520143400364592002801798596006301826650002201889650001301911650001001924650001301934650001201947650001101959650001301970650001401983650001601997650001602013650001102029650002002040650002602060650001602086650001102102650000802113650001902121650000902140700001602149700001402165700002002179700001402199700001302213700001802226773012102244856008202365852000902447655001202456IND60634952920221122095939.0190327e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063495292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-019-00478-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jinlei10aInfluence of exogenous calcium on the physiological, biochemical, phytochemical and ionic homeostasis of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) subjected to fluorine stress  ap. 455-465.  aTea plant (Camellia sinensis) may hyperaccumulate fluorine (F) in its leaves, which may cause fluorosis in tea consumers. Recent studies have implied that exogenous calcium (Ca) may reduce F in tea leaves, although our mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. Here, the effects of exogenous Ca on the physiological, biochemical and ionic homeostasis of tea leaves were investigated in the presence and absence of F. Elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and impaired cellular ultrastructure indicated that exogenous F induced stress in tea plants subjected to deficient Ca (0.01, 0.05 mM) and extremely excessive Ca (10 mM) treatments. Additionally, more F were accumulated in leaves compared to the control when tea plants were treated with 0.5 mM Ca. The lowest levels of MDA and F were observed at an optimal level of 5 mM Ca. F increased the levels of caffeine, polyphenols, and catechins, but decreased the content of soluble sugars and gallic acid when the level of Ca was within 5 mM. Moreover, based on a multivariate analysis on ionic composition, the Ca-regulated disorder in the homeostasis of B, Al, Cu, and Zn was strongly correlated with the accumulation of F. Our results demonstrate that within a range of concentrations, exogenous Ca was able to reduce F content and enhance F tolerance in tea leaves. These effects of exogenous Ca on F tolerance may be related to ionic homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 31470691cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCamellia sinensis 3aaluminum 3aboron 3acaffeine 3acalcium 3acopper 3afluorine 3afluorosis 3agallic acid 3ahomeostasis 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amultivariate analysis 3apolyphenols 3asugars 3atea 3aultrastructure 3azinc1 aNi, Dejiang1 aHe, Chang1 aZhang, Shanming1 aLiu, Siyi1 aDu, Yaru1 aChen, Yuqiong0 tPlant growth regulation.g2019 Apr., v. 87, no. 3 p.455-465dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-019-00478-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015500167300001600322500001500338520214500353592002802498650001302526650001702539650001502556650001302571650001102584650001202595650001902607650003002626650001902656650001402675650001102689653001602700700002202716773009602738856004802834852000902882655001202891IND50068511720221123001629.0130814e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006851172DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-013-9612-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFodrie, F.

We investigated patterns of size-at-ingress for larval and post-larval California halibut entering the Punta Banda Estuary (PBE), Mexico, using both otolith geochemistry and carbon stable isotope ratios (SIR). Juvenile halibut (n = 126; 38-163 mm standard length (SL)) were collected from inside PBE and the adjacent exposed coast during the fall of 2003, and otoliths (geochemistry) and muscle tissues (SIR) were analyzed to reconstruct the environmental histories of individuals. Based on geochemical analyses, nearly all fish collected from PBE were characterized by a non-estuarine signature (e.g., low Mn and Ba) in the otolith growth bands deposited when fish were <30 mm SL. Although fish collected from the coast retained that signature throughout their lives, fish collected within PBE showed elevated concentrations of Mn and Ba in the otolith growth bands deposited once halibut were 30-70 mm SL, thereby recording ingress. Carbon SIR of juvenile halibut prey also differed between the estuary and coast. Muscle [delta] 13C values of halibut captured along the coast were consistent (ca.-15aEuro[degree]), while those captured in the estuary were variable and generally more enriched in 13C (-16aEuro[degree] to -11aEuro[degree]). Both natural tagging approaches agreed that most halibut ([approximately]75 %) enter PBE long after settlement (> > 8-12 mm SL), although size-at-ingress estimates were significantly larger (mean difference = 27 mm; p < 0.001) when derived via carbon SIR than with otolith geochemistry. Potential explanations for the differences in size-at-ingress estimates involve the magnitude of isotopic and trace element gradients at this ocean-estuary boundary, the temporal resolution of environmental tags stored within otoliths and soft tissues, and the size-at-capture or somatic growth rate of juvenile halibut. We conclude by discussing the relative merits of otolith geochemistry and SIR as natural tags, and by considering the implications of secondary dispersal into estuaries by post-larval fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aotoliths 3ageochemistry 3apostlarvae 3aisotopes 3acarbon 3ahalibut 3amuscle tissues 3aParalichthys californicus 3atrace elements 3aestuaries 3alarvae 0arecruitment1 aHerzka, Sharon Z.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2013 Sept., v. 36, no. 5 p.906-917dSpringer-Verlagx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9612-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009600172300001600268520161700284592002801901650004401929650002201973650003101995650002302026650002202049650003802071650002202109650001402131650001602145650001902161650001802180650004202198650001802240650003102258650003302289650001302322650001002335700002302345700002502368700002202393700002302415700002702438773009602465856008602561852000902647655001202656IND60095599020221120222435.0141104e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009559902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdibkia, Khosro10aNaproxen–eudragit® RS100 nanoparticles: Preparation and physicochemical characterization  ap. 155-159.  aThe objective of the present study was to formulate naproxen–eudragit® RS100 nanoparticles and investigate the physicochemical characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles. The nanoparticles of naproxen with eudragit® RS100 were formulated using the solvent evaporation/extraction technique (the single emulsion technique). The effect of several process parameters, i.e., drug/polymer ratio, aqueous phase volume and speed of homogenization were considered on the size of the nanoformulations. The physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles were studied applying particle size analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray crystallography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The release rate of naproxen from various drug/polymer nanoparticles was investigated as well. All the prepared formulations using eudragit® RS100 resulted in nano-range size particles with relative spherical smooth morphology. The nanoparticles of naproxen–eudragit® RS100 displayed lower crystallinity. The intermolecular interaction between naproxen and eudragit® RS100 was detected in the FT-IR spectrum of the nanoparticles. All the nanoparticles displayed a slowed release pattern with the reduced burst release in comparison with the intact drug powder and physical mixtures of drug and polymer. According of these findings, formulation of the naproxen–eudragit® RS100 nanoparticles was able to improve the physicochemical characteristics of the drug and possibly will increase the anti-inflammatory effects of drug following its ocular or intra-joint administration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrug formulations 3aemulsions 3aevaporation 3ahomogenization 3ananoparticles 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3awater1 aJavadzadeh, Yousef1 aDastmalchi, Siavoush1 aMohammadi, Ghobad1 aNiri, Fatemeh Kari1 aAlaei-Beirami, Mahmood0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 83, no. 1 p.155-159dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01441naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011600156300001800272520029800290592002800588650001800616650001700634650001100651650002200662650002300684650002300707650002200730650001600752650002200768700002300790700002200813700002300835700001900858773010600877856007500983852000901058655001201067IND60578565220180316000000.0170813e20130719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057856522DNAL7 a10.1021/ol401490u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaju, Ritesh10aOleaceran: A Novel Spiro[isobenzofuran-1,2′-naptho[1,8-bc]furan] Isolated from a Terrestrial Streptomyces sp.  ap. 3487-3489.  aChemical analysis of a terrestrial-derived Streptomyces sp.

Two microwave power settings were used, corresponding to wall plug powers of 635 and 1021 W. To limit the maximum temperature rise of the wet algal samples, exposure times were capped to 15 s intervals and followed by 15 min of cooling. Samples were treated in total from 1 to 5 min of microwave treatment (i.e. 1 min was 4 × 15 s treatments). The lysed fraction increased with exposure time for both power levels and the extracted lipids closely followed the lysed fraction. The highest extracted lipid content, after 5 min, was 0.036 g/g dry algae weight (g/g) for 635 W (68.86% cell lysis), while with 1021 W the yield was 0.052 g/g (92.81%). The control sample, which did not receive any microwave treatment, was only 0.016 g/g dry algae weight. Significance was observed between treatment time, cell lysis and lipid yield, (p < 0.05). For the 5 min of treatment, the lipid produced per total number of Joules consumed was found for each microwave power setting; yielding values of 1.889 × 10⁻⁴ g/g/kJ (635 W) and 1.697 × 10⁻⁴ g/g/kJ (1021 W).  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3aalgae 3abiodiesel 3aexposure duration 3afuel production 3alipid content 3alipids 3amicrowave treatment 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aThermal treatment 0aLipid extraction 0aBiodiesel 0aLysis 0aMicrowave 0aNannochloropsis oculata1 aWatson, Ian A.0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Apr., v. 76 p.470-477dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04979naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012900167300001200296500001500308520334500323592002803668650001803696650001203714650001303726650001403739650001403753650001003767650002503777650001803802650001103820650004503831650001503876650000903891650003003900650002303930650001303953650003903966650001304005650002504018650002204043650001604065650001004081651001804091651000904109651001104118651001104129651001104140653004004151700001904191773011104210856008304321852000904404655001204413IND60549165220221116140115.0160907e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054916522DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-09-12-0818-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanale, M. C.10a‘Candidatus Phytoplasma brasiliense’ (16SrXV-A Subgroup) Associated with Cauliflower Displaying Stunt Symptoms in Brazil  ap. 419.  a2019-12-06  aCauliflower stunt, caused by a phytoplasma of the group 16SrIII-J, was reported in the beginning of 2012 and has occurred with high incidences of infected plants (up to 90%) in crops located in the state of São Paulo in the southeast region of Brazil (3). Diseased plants exhibit general stunting, malformation of inflorescence, reddening leaves, and vessel necrosis (3). Further investigations with plants displaying identical symptoms collected in Nova Bassano, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazilian south region, have revealed the presence of a phytoplasma distinct from 16SrIII-J subgroup. Four symptomatic plus four asymptomatic samples were assayed from a field, and the presence of phytoplasma was evidenced by nested PCR assays performed with primers P1/Tint followed by R16F2n/16R2 in three affected plants, which amplified genomic fragments of 1.2 kb from the 16S rRNA gene. No amplification occurred in non-affected samples. Nested PCR products analyzed by conventional RFLP (2) using the enzymes AluI, RsaI, KpnI, HpaII, MseI, HhaI, MboI, and BstUI pointed to the presence of a phytoplasma belonging to group 16SrXV-A in all three phytoplasma-positive samples. Virtual RFLP analysis based on restriction patterns, derived from in silico digestion with 17 endonucleases (4), confirmed the previous results obtained from those samples by conventional RFLP. The 16S rDNA sequences of this phytoplasma identified in cauliflower (GenBank Accession No. JN818845) shared 99% sequence similarity with the reference phytoplasma for subgroup 16SrXV-A (Hibiscus witches'-broom phytoplasma, AF147708), designated ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma brasiliense.’ Analysis of putative restriction sites showed excellent identity between the phytoplasma studied here and the reference phytoplasma. In addition, the arrangement of branches of a phylogenetic tree constructed with phytoplasmas representing diverse 16Sr groups and subgroups supported that the phytoplasma found in cauliflower is closed related to the representative of the subgroup 16SrXV-A. Association of distinct phytoplasmas with the same kind of disease is not rare and the present pathosystem constitutes a new example. Members of this subgroup have been described almost exclusively in Brazil and previously reported in Sida sp., periwinkle, and hibiscus (1). In some European countries, as well as in the United States and Canada, phytoplasmas belonging to group 16SrI has been associated with this type of disease, which has been reported for various species of the genus Brassica, as published in previous works (3). However, a representative of the group 16SrVI was described in infected plants in Iran (3). Although the 16SrIII-J phytoplasma is currently the most important agent of cauliflower stunt in Brazil, and members of 16SrI are prevalent in other countries, this study revealed that a 16Sr XV-A phytoplasma may be also associated with this important disease of brassicas. Besides, the findings here reported expand the natural host range, including cauliflower as new host for phytoplasmas affiliated with 16SrXV-A.References: (1) B. Eckstein et al.

In contrast to relatively larger satellites, CubeSats are often launched with minimal shielding structures. Therefore, detailed modeling of a CubeSat is performed based on currently available standard platforms. The geometrical modeling is then used for an estimation of the ionizing doses for various locations within the CubeSat spacecraft operating at low altitudes. The calculation is reiterated and extended for more exotic orbits, such as geostationary Earth orbits and lunar orbits, for the potential application of CubeSats in challenging space missions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aionization 3aionizing radiation 3aions 3amodels 3aprotons 3asatellites1 aKim, Y.H.1 aPark, S.H.1 aSeon, J.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2012 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.1541-1547dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2012.04.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245012700173520174000300592002802040650002602068650001302094650002002107650002302127650002402150650001602174651001302190700002202203773012302225856008102348852000902429655001202438IND60754111020221116221136.0211023e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075411102DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy111020772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Gonçalo C.10aEstimation of Daily Reference Evapotranspiration from NASA POWER Reanalysis Products in a Hot Summer Mediterranean Climate  aThis study aims at assessing the accuracy of estimating daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) computed with NASA POWER reanalysis products. Daily ETo estimated from local observations of weather variables in 14 weather stations distributed across Alentejo Region, Southern Portugal were compared with ETo derived from NASA POWER weather data, using raw and bias-corrected datasets. Three different methods were used to compute ETo: (a) FAO Penman-Monteith (PM); (b) Hargreaves-Samani (HS); and (c) MaxTET. Results show that, when using raw NASA POWER datasets, a good accuracy between the observed ETo and reanalysis ETo was observed in most locations (R² > 0.70). PM shows a tendency to over-estimating ETo with an RMSE as high as 1.41 mm d⁻¹, while using a temperature-based ET estimation method, an RMSE lower than 0.92 mm d⁻¹ is obtained. If a local bias correction is adopted, the temperature-based methods show a small over or underestimation of ETo (–0.40 mm d⁻¹ ≤ MBE < 0.40 mm d⁻¹). As for PM, ETo is still underestimated for 13 locations (MBE < 0 mm d⁻¹) but with an RMSE never higher than 0.77 mm d⁻¹. When NASA POWER raw data is used to estimate ETo, HS_Rs proved the most accurate method, providing the lowest RMSE for half the locations. However, if a data regional bias correction is used, PM leads to the most accurate ETo estimation for half the locations; also, when a local bias correction is performed, PM proved the be the most accurate ETo estimation method for most locations. Nonetheless, MaxTET proved to be an accurate method; its simplicity may prove to be successful not only when only maximum temperature data is available but also due to the low data required for ETo estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aagronomy 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3ameteorological data 3atemperature 3aPortugal1 aBraga, Ricardo P.0 tAgronomy.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111020773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016400164300001600328520166500344592002802009596007902037596007102116650001602187650003502203650003602238650002002274650001702294650001902311650002502330650001802355650001002373650001402383650002202397650001702419650002002436650001302456650004302469650005202512700001302564700001502577700002002592700001502612773012102627856008202748852000902830655001202839IND60634953320221122232027.0190327e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063495332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-019-00475-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Hualan10aCharacterization and expression profile analysis of YABBY family genes in Pak-choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) under abiotic stresses and hormone treatments  ap. 421-432.  aYABBY proteins are widely distributed among different plant species and exhibit a higher degree of prevalence in angiosperms than in gymnosperms; abaxial cell fate in the lateral organs of plants is mainly determined by the functions of YABBY genes. However, to date, no scientific study has been conducted on the functions and responses of these genes under different forms of abiotic stresses in Pak-choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis). In this study, we cloned and identified 12 YABBY family genes from Pak-choi. The evolutionary history of the YABBY genes was studied in nine species and showed that YABBY gene loss occurred during specific periods or in certain species during evolution. The putative YABBY family genes of Pak-choi were comprehensively analyzed by comparison with the corresponding orthologs in Arabidopsis and Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) and classified into five subfamilies based on the specific protein domains and phylogenetic clades. A subcellular localization assay involving BcYABBY1b and BcYABBY2c confirmed that the BcYABBY proteins were localized in the nucleus. qRT-PCR data revealed that the BcYABBY genes are specifically expressed in distinct organs and developmental stages. Furthermore, the expression profiles of the BcYABBY genes were investigated under different hormone treatments and abiotic stress factors. In this study, we comprehensively identified and analyzed the YABBY gene family in the Pak-choi genome. Our data provide possible functional information regarding the involvement of BcYABBY genes in plant growth and development and in the response to abiotic stress and hormone treatments.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0101701cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China  aBE2013429cScience & Technology Pillar Program of Jiangsu Province 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3aChinese cabbage 3aGymnospermae 3aabiotic stress 3adevelopmental stages 3agene deletion 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aprotein domains 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aWu, Peng1 aGao, Liwei1 aZhang, Changwei1 aHou, Xilin0 tPlant growth regulation.g2019 Apr., v. 87, no. 3 p.421-432dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-019-00475-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245008600170300001800256520064800274592002800922650001100950650001400961650002300975650001800998650001201016650002201028650002201050650001301072700002301085700002401108773010601132856007501238852000901313655001201322IND60578565320180316000000.0170813e20130719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057856532DNAL7 a10.1021/ol401494x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Pérez, Héctor10aSmall Bite-Angle P–OP Ligands for Asymmetric Hydroformylation and Hydrogenation  ap. 3634-3637.  aA series of small bite-angle phosphine-phosphite (P–OP) ligands have been synthesized by a two-step method. The key intermediate was prepared by an unprecedented asymmetric carbonyl reduction of a phosphamide using the CBS (Corey–Bakshi–Shibata) catalyst. The topology of these ligands (a configurationally stable stereogenic carbon with two heteroatom substituents) and their small bite-angle (created by the close proximity of the two ligating groups to the metal center) together provide a rigid asymmetric environment around this center, enabling high stereoselectivity in hydroformylations and hydrogenations of standard substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3ahydrogenation 3aligands 3aorganic compounds 3astereoselectivity 3atopology1 aBenet-Buchholz, J.1 aVidal-Ferran, Anton0 tOrganic letters.g2013 July 19, v. 15, no. 14 p.3634-3637dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol401494x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245013900195300001800334520104900352592002801401650002101429650002001450650000901470650002001479650000701499650001401506650001101520650002301531650001301554650001301567650003801580650004201618650002401660650005301684700002701737700002601764773014001790856008201930852000902012655001202021IND50067483020221117231059.0210324e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006748302DNAL7 a232424612pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-012-3044-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahnama Kozani, Reyhaneh10aRapid spectrophotometric determination of trace amounts of palladium in water samples after dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction  ap. 6531-6537.  aA simple, rapid, and efficient dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction method, followed by UV–Vis spectrophotometry was developed for the preconcentration and determination of Pd ions in water samples. Pd ions react with α-furildioxime (chelating agent) to form a hydrophobic complex. Various parameters were altered to study and optimize their effects on the extraction efficiency, such as pH, ligand concentration, the type and volume of extraction and dispersive solvents, extraction time, and salt concentration. Under optimized conditions, the method exhibited an enrichment factor (C ₒᵣg/C ₐq) of 25 and recovery more than 98 % within a very short extraction time. The linearity of the method ranged from 10 to 200 μg L⁻¹. The limit of detection was 1.1 μg L⁻¹. The relative standard deviation for the concentration of 100 μg L⁻¹ of Pd was 2.3 % (n = 10).

The effects of clarification (80°C; limed to pH 6.5; 5ppm polyanionic flocculant) and UV-C irradiation were investigated as stabilization and preservation treatments for juices stored at ambient temperature (∼25°C). Juices were extracted by roller press from various sweet sorghum cultivars grown in humid and dry environments in Louisiana and Tennessee, respectively. Raw juices contained up to 109 total bacteria cfu/mL. Initial results indicated that pilot plant clarified juice was considerably more stable than raw or UV-C irradiated (15W lamp aquaculture system at ∼25°C) juice, irrespective of cultivar. Further experiments were undertaken to elucidate if heating (80°C; 30min) or impurity precipitation or both of these components of the clarification process were responsible for improved juice stability. Clarification or heating both achieved 3- to 4-log reductions of lactic acid bacteria in juices to negligible levels (<150cfu/mL), and also significantly (P<0.05) reduced total bacterial counts. Juice heating gave similar results as the whole clarification process up to ∼24h storage, but became slightly worse between 24–28h. Overall, clarified or heated (80°C; 30min) juice stored at 25°C can be stored for at least 48h before unacceptable spoilage occurs. Fingerprint ion chromatography with integrated pulsed amperometric detection (IC-IPAD) oligosaccharide profiles can be used to monitor sweet sorghum juice spoilage >100cfu/mL lactic acid bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acultivars 3adry environmental conditions 3aheat 3aion exchange chromatography 3airradiation 3ajuices 3alactic acid bacteria 3aoligosaccharides 3apH 3aplate count 3aspoilage 3asweet sorghum 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater activity 3aLouisiana 3aTennessee 0aRt 0aUV-C 0aDNA 0aAw 0aHMW 0aMOL 0aGRAS 0aGL 0aBL 0aNTU 0aCJ 0aIC-IPAD 0aSweet sorghum juice 0aUV irradiation 0aJuice preservation 0aClarification 0aPasteurization 0aMicrobial inactivation1 aDeLucca, Anthony1 aSklanka, Scottie1 aDalley, Caleb1 aSt. Cyr, Eldwin1 aPowell, Randall0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2015 Feb., v. 64 p.258-270dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010600171300001200277520247300289592002802762650001602790650002302806650001102829650000902840650001002849650001002859650001402869650000902883650002002892650001402912650001202926650001502938650001502953650001402968650002302982650002403005650001003029650001203039650000903051651001103060700001803071700001503089773012903104856008303233852000903316655001203325IND60549165320221116140232.0160907e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054916532DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-09-12-0832-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, A. C. Z.10aFirst Report of the Root Knot Nematode, Meloidogyne inornata, on Common Bean in Paraná State, Brazil  ap. 431.  aCommon bean (Phaseolus vulgaris F.) is one of the most important crops in Paraná State, which is responsible for almost 10% of the Brazilian production (4). Root knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp., are common parasites of this crop worldwide, but damage caused by Meloidogyne inornata has not been reported. During a survey of nematode species present on common bean fields in Paraná State, Brazil, galled root samples of cultivars Tuiuiú and Eldorado were submitted, in June 2012, in the Nematology Laboratory from IAPAR, collected in the municipalities of Araucária (25°35′34″S, 49°24′36″W) and Santana do Itararé (23°45′18″S, 49°37′44″W). Plants did not exhibit any above-ground symptoms. The specimens were identified through perineal patterns and esterase phenotypes of 20 adult females extracted from dissected roots (2,3). The population densities observed in the samples were 140 and 700 J2 and eggs per gram of roots, respectively, for both samples. Characteristics were consistent with those described for M. inornata. For example, perineal patterns of M. inornata showed a high dorsal arch, with smooth to wavy striae, similar to those of M. incognita; but no punctate markings between anus and tail terminus were observed. However, from the esterase electrophoresis we obtained the I3 (Rm = 0.83, 1.15, and 1.32) phenotype, typical of M. inornata, a species-specific phenotype used to differentiate this species from M. incognita (1). Moreover, the excretory pore of adult females was located 32.1 (± 5.4) μm from the anterior end, consistent with the M. inornata description (25 to 53 μm) (1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of M. inornata parasitizing common bean roots. This finding has great importance for Brazilian agriculture, since this nematode may damage common bean plants and become an additional problem for this crop. Additional work is necessary in order to elucidate the losses caused by M. inornata on common bean.References: (1) R. M. D. G. Carneiro et al. Nematology 10:123, 2008. (2) P. R. Esbenshade and A. C.

In this study, we present a hybrid MAPbIₓCl₃₋ₓ perovskite-based triboelectric nanogenerator (P-TENG) based on the coupling of triboelectric and photoelectric conversion mechanisms for simultaneous vibrating energy and solar energy harvesting. By optimizing the device structure, for the first time, planar TiO₂ as electron transport layer (ETL) and ultrathin pentacene as hole transport layer (HTL) are combined together to photoenhance the output of a TENG. Experimental results reveal that P-TENG has achieved the optimal photoinduced enhancement due to the most effective charge separation that relies on the joint of HTL and ETL. As a result, the optimized P-TENG with ~ 0.7 cm² effective area, the open-circuit voltage (Vₒc), short-circuit current (Iₛc) and the maximum transfer charge amount (Qₛc) are increased by 55.7%, 50.8% and 58.2% upon illumination, respectively. Besides, the P-TENG shows fast response on both the full-spectrum simulated sunlight and monochromatic light extending from ultraviolet to entire visible region which enhances the potential application in photodetection. Our work presents a route to designing high-performance P-TENG via interfacial engineering to further boost the output ability of this photoelectric hybrid TENG.  aPublisher supplied data  a11774293cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXDJK2017A002cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aCXTDX201601011cProgram for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing  aSSKH[2015]55cKey Laboratory and Scientific Research Foundation of Zunyi City 3aelectric generators 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectron transfer 3alighting 3asolar energy 3atitanium dioxide1 aHan, Juan Juan1 aWang, Gang1 aLiao, Li Ping1 aXu, Cun Yun1 aHu, Wei1 aLi, Ping1 aWu, Bo1 aElseman, Ahmed Mourtada1 aZhou, Guang Dong1 aSong, Qun Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3797-037X0 tJournal of materials science.g2019 June, v. 54, no. 12 p.9004-9016dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-019-03351-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006600170300001600236520132300252592002801575650002301603650001501626650002201641650001301663773012701676856008501803852000901888655001201897IND60582651420221123042238.0180905e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058265142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2017.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Kraker, Joop10aSocial learning for resilience in social–ecological systems  ap. 100-107.  aFostering of social learning is generally considered an important governance instrument to build resilience in social–ecological systems. Empirical studies addressing the contribution of social learning to resilience are scarce however, and do not provide direct evidence but infer this contribution from the impacts of social learning on system governance and management. These impacts are found more frequently at the local level than at higher, regional or national levels, probably depending on the overlap between participants in social learning and actors in governance and management. Recent studies have shown that at higher levels a connection between social learning and policy can be achieved through bridging actors or organizations, and vertical linkages between governance levels. Conceptually and methodologically the study of social learning and its relation with resilience has advanced sufficiently to enable more rigorous and detailed empirical research. This should focus on how attempts to foster social learning within social–ecological governance systems can be made more effective and efficient, for example, through the use of new technologies to support the learning process or through the creation of permanent, informal multi-stakeholder learning spaces within formal policy structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3alearning0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2017 Oct., v. 28 p.100-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012800162300001600290520129200306592002801598653001401626653002001640653001301660653001801673653001501691700002101706773013701727856008201864852000901946655001201955IND60559614320221120143023.0161216e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055961432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.xphs.2016.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Tian10aEffect of Temperature and Moisture on the Physical Stability of Binary and Ternary Amorphous Solid Dispersions of Celecoxib  ap. 100-110.  aThe effectiveness of different polymers, alone or in combination, in inhibiting the crystallization of celecoxib (CEX) from amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) exposed to different temperatures and relative humidities was evaluated. It was found that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and PVP-vinyl acetate formed stronger or more extensive hydrogen bonding with CEX than cellulose-based polymers. This, combined with their better effectiveness in raising the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the dispersions, provided better physical stabilization of amorphous CEX against crystallization in the absence of moisture when compared with dispersions formed with cellulose derivatives. In ternary dispersions containing 2 polymers, the physical stability was minimally impaired by the presence of a cellulose-based polymer when the major polymer present was PVP. On exposure to moisture, stability of the CEX ASDs was strongly affected by both the dispersion hygroscopicity and the strength of the intermolecular interactions. Binary and ternary ASDs containing PVP appeared to undergo partial amorphous–amorphous phase separation when exposed 94% relative humidity, followed by crystallization, whereas other binary ASDs crystallized directly without amorphous–amorphous phase separation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aamorphous 0acrystallization 0apolymers 0astabilization 0asolubility1 aTaylor, Lynne S.0 tJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.g2017 Jan., v. 106 p.100-110dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Pharmacists Association®x0022-35497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2016.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245009000167300001600257520116300273592002801436650002401464650002901488650001701517650003701534650001401571650001601585650001101601650001401612700002201626700002201648700002801670700002401698773009801722856008501820852000901905655001201914IND4460136720221118072319.0141111e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446013672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2011.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulo, Luísa10aAnti-Helicobacter pylori and urease inhibitory activities of resveratrol and red wine  ap. 964-969.  aThere is considerable interest in alternative approaches for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori using biologically active compounds including antioxidants from a wide range of natural sources. In this work we have investigated the antibacterial properties of resveratrol towards different H. pylori strains. In addition we studied the inhibition of H. pylori urease by resveratrol and red wine. In those assays, resveratrol inhibited the growth of all the 17 H. pylori strains tested, with inhibition diameters ranging from 16 to 28mm and minimum inhibitory concentration values varying from 25 to 100μg/mL, confirming its antimicrobial properties. Moreover, resveratrol and red wines showed an inhibitory effect on H. pylori urease activity, which is considered a virulence factor of this organism and essential for colonization and establishment of the infection. Further kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition occurred in a non-competitive and concentration-dependent manner. Overall, the results suggest that resveratrol and red wine may have potential for new therapy schemes that include natural products as an alternative therapeutic approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidants 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ared wines 3aresveratrol 3aurease 3avirulence1 aOleastro, Mónica1 aGallardo, Eugenia1 aQueiroz, João António1 aDomingues, Fernanda0 tFood research international.g2011 May, v. 44, no. 4 p.964-969dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2011.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01594naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245013000167300001600297520056600313592002800879650002200907650001500929650001100944650002200955650001300977650001100990653002201001653002101023773015001044856007701194852000901271655001201280IND60521590620221121065329.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052159062DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-05052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurschka, Christian10aZur Kristallstruktur der Thiocuprate K3Cu8S6 und Rb3Cu8S6 / On the Crystal Structure of the Thiocuprates K3Cu8S6 and Rb3Cu8S6  ap. 675-677.  aThe title compounds can be synthesized by fusion reaction of the alkali carbonates with copper and sulfur at 790 °C.

Moench) with cattle slurry: Productivity and nitrogen-use efficiency  ap. 380-386.  aSweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is a viable alternative to maize when irrigation water is unavailable or too expensive. In areas with intensive livestock activities animal slurries are predominantly applied to maize. Although sweet sorghum is fairly investigated species, little is know about the efficiency with which the crop can use nitrogen (N) applied in the form of cattle slurry. Then, a field experiment was devised to explore the following research questions: (i) what is the effect of cattle slurry and industrial fertilizers on sweet sorghum productivity? (ii) which is the N-use efficiency for cattle slurry and industrial fertilizers applied to sweet sorghum? The study was conducted in the years from 2008 to 2012 (five years) in the alluvial plain of the Po Valley, Northern Italy. The fertilization treatments applied annually were: (i) no fertilization (control); (ii) industrial fertilizers 120kgNha−1, applied in the form of urea, +52kgP ha−1, applied in the form of superphosphate, (IF); (iii) cattle slurry 10mm, i.e. 10Lm−2 (CS10); and (iv) cattle slurry 20mm, i.e. 20Lm−2 (CS20). The indigenous soil N supply varied from 112 to 243kgNha−1. The experiment was not irrigated. The observed average annual yields were, in decreasing order: 34.6MgDMha−1 in 2008, 31.7 in 2011, 29.5 in 2009, 27.9 in 2010 and 27.2 in 2012. Physiological efficiency applied N (PEN, kg yield increase per kgN uptake), recovery efficiency applied N (REN, kgN uptake increase per kgN applied) and agronomic efficiency of applied N (AEN, kg yield increase per kgN applied) were evaluated in this study. In the range of observed values the PEN was 63kg DM yield per kgN uptake, the REN varied from 0 to 0.33 and the AEN was zero in all the years of experiment. Fertilization tends to increase N uptake but not yield nor stem juice sugar content. Our findings indicate that under conditions of good soil fertility, sweet sorghum should be considered poorly suited to receive cattle slurry application, due to the absence of yield gain and to the low N-use efficiency. Moreover, the high N uptake achieved by the crop with no fertilization, combined with the modest REN suggest the animal slurry should rather be applied to crops possessing higher efficiency in utilizing N applied with fertilizers. Nevertheless, the frugality of sweet sorghum should be considered a virtue in the light of the increasing interest in reducing the input for energy crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aalluvial plains 3acattle manure 3acorn 3acrop production 3aenergy crops 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3airrigation water 3ajuices 3alivestock 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asugar content 3asuperphosphate 3asweet sorghum 3aurea 3aItaly 0aEnergy crop 0aManure 0aAgronomic efficiency 0aRecovery efficiency 0aPhysiological efficiency of applied N1 aCastelli, Fabio1 aMoschella, Anna1 aDiozzi, Michele1 aDi Candilo, Mario0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Dec., v. 62 p.380-386dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010100161300001800262520069400280592002800974650002301002650002301025650002401048650001301072650001401085700001901099700001801118700002001136700002401156700001801180700002201198773010601220856007501326852000901401655001201410IND60578565520221117160335.0170813e20130719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057856552DNAL7 a10.1021/ol401516e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlowinski, Franck10aExpeditive Access to 2-Substituted 4H-Pyrido[1,3]oxazin-4-ones via an Intramolecular O-Arylation  ap. 3494-3497.  aUnreported 2-substituted 4H-pyrido[e][1,3]oxazin-4-ones are synthesized via an unprecedented intramolecular O-arylation of N-aroyl- and N-heteroaroyl-(iso)nicotinamides under microwave irradiations, in good to excellent yields.

Here, we explore the current and potential role of place-based research into informing global sustainability initiatives by assessing the strengths, challenges, and opportunities. We show that place-based research allows for a better understanding of global social–ecological dynamics, and that transformations towards sustainability are often triggered at the local scale through the co-construction of local solutions. We discuss that the very nature of place-based research can hinder its transferability because its global integration faces temporal, spatial and governance scale mismatches, and we identify some of the key challenges of scaling-up its findings. We highlight new opportunities to mainstream place-based research that are emerging from first, long-term networks of place-based research, second, new institutional research settings that contribute with conceptual comprehensive frameworks and capacity building tools, third, a global community of practice, and fourth, the concept of region as a bridge between local and global sustainability initiatives. We believe that the time is ripe to promote the role of place-based social–ecological research as a key contributor to achieve global sustainability goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3agovernance 3aresearch institutions 3aresearch methods 3asustainability science and engineering1 aCalderón-Contreras, Rafael1 aCastro, Antonio J.,1 aFelipe-Lucia, María R1 aGeijzendorffer, Ilse R1 aJacobs, Sander1 aMartín-López, Berta1 aArbieu, Ugo1 aIfejika Speranza, Chinwe,1 aLocatelli, Bruno1 aHarguindeguy, Natalia Pérez1 aMercado, Ilse Ruiz1 aSpierenburg, Marja J1 aVallet, Améline1 aLynes, Laura1 aGillson, Lindsey0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2017 Dec., v. 29 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2017.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011700178300001600295520065600311592002800967650001600995650002601011650002401037650002601061700002101087700001501108773009701123856008401220852000901304655001201313IND60553637020221122023204.0161021e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055363702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2015.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade los Reyes, Francis L12aA methodological framework for linking bioreactor function to microbial communities and environmental conditions  ap. 112-118.  aIn the continuing quest to relate microbial communities in bioreactors to function and environmental and operational conditions, engineers and biotechnologists have adopted the latest molecular and 'omic methods.

Sugarcane bagasse, which is subjected to pre-treatment, hydrolysis and fermentation for the production of ethanol in several test refineries, is the most promising source of raw material for the production of second generation renewable fuels in Brazil. One problem when screening hydrolytic activities is that the activity against commercial substrates, such as carboxymethylcellulose, does not always correspond to the activity against the natural lignocellulosic material. Besides that, the macroscopic characteristics of the raw material, such as insolubility and heterogeneity, hinder its use for high throughput screenings. RESULTS: In this paper, we present the preparation of a colloidal suspension of particles obtained from sugarcane bagasse, with minimal chemical change in the lignocellulosic material, and demonstrate its use for high throughput assays of hydrolases using Brazilian termites as the screened organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences between the use of the natural substrate and commercial cellulase substrates, such as carboxymethylcellulose or crystalline cellulose, were observed. This suggests that wood feeding termites, in contrast to litter feeding termites, might not be the best source for enzymes that degrade sugarcane biomass.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ascreening 3afermentation 3afuel production 3awood 3araw materials 3afuels 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aethanol production 3apretreatment 3asugarcane 3ahydrolysis 3asugarcane bagasse 3abiomass 3aIsoptera 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aBrazil 0acellulose1 aLima, Leile S1 aCordeiro, Luís SA, JrcJr1 aSant’Anna, Celso1 aConstantino, Reginaldo1 aAzambuja, Patricia1 aSouza, Wanderley de,1 aGarcia, Eloi S1 aGenta, Fernando A0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2011 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.122-122dSpringer-Verlagx1754-68347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-4-51  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014500172300001600317520118900333592002801522650002301550650001501573650001401588650001101602650002101613650002901634650002101663650001601684650000901700650001801709653002801727653002501755653002701780653002701807700006201834700002101896773009601917856008402013852000902097655001202106IND60603813620221123043330.0180716e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060381362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpinelli, Guido10aMulti-linear Monte Carlo simulation method for probabilistic load flow of distribution systems with wind and photovoltaic generation systems  ap. 283-295.  aIn this paper, a probabilistic method is proposed to analyze the steady-state operating conditions of an active electrical distribution system with Wind (WD) and Photovoltaic (PV) generation plants. This method takes into account the uncertainties of power load demands and power production from renewable generation systems and combines Monte Carlo simulation techniques and multi-linearized power flow equations. The power flow equations include models of wind turbine and PV generation units and multi-linearization is accomplished by applying a criterion based on the total active power of the system. The method properly extends a probabilistic method proposed in the relevant literature for traditional passive electrical distribution systems to the field of an active electrical distribution system with WD and PV generation units. Numerical applications are presented and discussed with reference to a 17-bus test distribution system characterized by WD and PV systems connected at different busbars. The results obtained with the proposed algorithm are compared with the results obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm that included non-linear power flow equations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalgorithms 3aequations 3amodels 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3auncertainty 3awind 3awind turbines 0aProbabilistic load-flow 0aDistribution systems 0aDistributed generation 0aMonte Carlo simulation1 aCaramia, Pierluigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8867-27811 aVarilone, Pietro0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Apr., v. 76 p.283-295dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007800173300001600251520137400267592002801641650003601669650001101705650002801716650001501744650001601759650002401775651000901799653000901808653001701817653003401834653002401868653000901892653002301901700002601924700002301950700002701973773011502000856008502115852000902200655001202209IND60582651720221123042130.0190416e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058265172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadkhani, Mohsen10aSpace-time epidemiology of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Iran  ap. 207-216.  aIran, as an endemic country of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), has been suffering from severe health issues and substantial economic burdens imposed by the disease. We analyzed monthly and yearly spatial and temporal distributions of CCHF to better understand the epidemiology of the disease in Iran. A cross-sectional survey was performed on 1027 recorded cases between 2000 and 2014. Global Moran’s I analysis was applied to statistically evaluate the spatial pattern of the disease. Additionally, spatial and space-time scan statistics were used to study the presence of possible spatial and space-time hotspots. Global Moran’s I analysis proved that the incidence of the disease is strongly clustered in Iran (p<0.01). Purely spatial scan statistics identified that there were three clusters in the eastern, southern and western parts of the country. Through space-time analysis, we found that the highest incidence of CCHF occurred in the eastern parts of the country between 2006 and 2012. Monthly clusters, which include cities with lower (average) temperatures, had been occurring in relatively short periods. The distribution of CCHF incidence in this country is spatially and temporally clustered. The majority of the clusters emerged during the critical years of 2009 and 2013. Summer is the predominant period for the formation of CCHF clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever 3acities 3across-sectional studies 3astatistics 3atemperature 3atick-borne diseases 3aIran 0aCCHF 0aEpidemiology 0aGeographic information system 0aSpace-time analysis 0aIran 0aTick-borne disease1 aAlesheikh, Ali Asghar1 aKhakifirouz, Sahar1 aSalehi-Vaziri, Mostafa0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2018 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.207-216dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01845naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009000173300001800263520067900281592002800960650002100988650001101009650002001020650000901040650001601049650001801065650001201083650001701095700002801112700003201140700002801172700001801200700003001218773009801248856008101346990002301427852000901450655001201459IND60093787920221123004626.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009378792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2012.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeelaviwat, Nattaporn10aMicrowave-induced fabrication of copper nanoparticle/carbon nanotubes hybrid material  ap. 1575-1579.  aCopper nanoparticle/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) hybrid material could be fabricated by microwave irradiation to a suspension of MWCNTs dispersed in copper precursor with the presence of ethylene glycol.

In Italy, this type of soil has proved to be greatly affected by aeolian deposits and to be widely distributed geographically.However, there are still many open questions, especially regarding the genesis of these soils. This paper focuses on five representative pedons taken from NVME. Soil forming processes and relationships between soil and underlying bedrock were investigated by using an integrated approach including geochemical, magnetic, mineralogical, micromorphological and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis. The 5 pedons showed andic character and similar morphology and micromorphology (e.g. silt illuviation, pedorelicts), as well as large differences in terms of soil reaction and clay mineralogy. The analysis of the vertical distribution of C, Al and Fe extracted in pyrophosphate along with related geochemical indices (e.g. Cp/Alp) enabled us to indicate andosolization as the main process of soil formation and to exclude podzolization. With respect to the soil-bedrock relationship, 2 soils showed great similarity to the underlying bedrock along with a clear aeolian particle size distribution footprint, whereas, in the remaining 3 soils, there was a clear soil-bedrock discontinuity and an evident volcanic fingerprint. Some of the soil-bedrock differences related to the geographical settings and latitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abedrock 3aclay 3aecosystems 3aeolian deposits 3ailluviation 3airon 3alatitude 3amicrostructure 3amineralogy 3aparticle size distribution 3asilt 3asoil 3asoil formation 3aspatial distribution 3aItaly 0aSoil–bedrock interaction 0aVolcanic soil 0aAndosolization process 0aLoess-like material 0aPyroclastic material1 aVingiani, Simona1 aManna, Piero1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0574-04651 aLangella, Giuliano1 aTerribile, F.q(Fabio),0 tCatena.g2017 Dec., v. 159 p.35-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013500175300001600310520137600326592002801702650002201730650003201752650002101784650001401805650002601819650002201845650001901867650001401886650000701900650001601907650001601923650003301939650001501972650002501987653001302012653001702025653001002042653000802052653000802060653000802068653000802076653001102084653001102095653001102106653000802117653000802125653000702133653001302140653000802153653001302161653001802174653001202192653000802204653000802212653000702220653000902227653000702236653000902243653000802252653001102260653001302271653000802284653000702292653000802299653000802307653000802315653001602323653003102339653002402370653002502394653003302419700002502452700002102477700002302498773010502521856008702626852000902713655001202722IND50065057520221120235541.0160902e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006505752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilde, Marcelo L.10aOxidation–coagulation of β-blockers by K2FeVIO4 in hospital wastewater: Assessment of degradation products and biodegradability  ap. 137-147.  aThis study investigated the degradation of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol beta-blockers by ferrate (K2FeO4) in hospital wastewater and in aqueous solution. In the case of hospital wastewater, the effect of the independent variables pH and [Fe(VI)] was evaluated by means of response surface methodology. The results showed that Fe(VI) plays an important role in the oxidation–coagulation process, and the treatment of the hospital wastewater led to degradations above 90% for all the three β-blockers, and to reductions of aromaticity that were close to 60%. In addition, only 17% of the organic load was removed. In aqueous solution, the degradation of the β-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol was 71.7%, 24.7% and 96.5%, respectively, when a ratio of 1:10 [β-blocker]:[Fe(VI)] was used. No mineralization was achieved, which suggests that there was a conversion of the β-blockers to degradation products identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry tandem. Degradation pathways were proposed, which took account of the role of Fe(VI). Furthermore, the ready biodegradability of the post-process samples was evaluated by using the closed bottle test, and showed an increase in biodegradability. The use of the ferrate advanced oxidation technology seems to be a useful means of ensuring the remediation of hospital and similar wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3abiodegradability 3ahospitals 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3apH 3apropranolol 3aremediation 3aresponse surface methodology 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0a[Fe(VI)] 0a[β-blocker] 0aANOVA 0aATE 0aCBT 0aCFU 0aCOD 0aDegATE 0aDegMET 0aDegPRO 0aDPs 0aERM 0aHO 0aHPLC-FLD 0aHWW 0aK2FeVIO4 0aLC-ESI-IT-MSn 0aLC–MS 0am/z 0aMET 0aMS 0aNPOC 0aOD 0aOECD 0aPRO 0aRedCOD 0aRedUV254 0aRSM 0aSI 0aSPE 0aSTP 0aTOC 0aβ-Blockers 0aFerrate advanced oxidation 0aHospital wastewater 0aDegradation pathways 0aResponse surface methodology1 aMahmoud, Waleed M.M.1 aKümmerer, Klaus1 aMartins, Ayrton F.0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 May 01, v. 452-453 p.137-147dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010600167300001200273500001400285520139000299592002801689596006501717596006501782596007501847650004101922650001801963650001601981650002101997650001702018650001602035650001602051650001702067650000902084650001602093650001802109650002102127650001002148650001602158650001002174700005602184773013202240856008202372852000902454655001202463IND60725524920221116211928.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552492DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-020-00292-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun-Jin,10aSeed dormancy and germination in Oenanthe stolonifera as affected by temperature and gibberellic acid  ap. 1-8.  aNAL-light  aOur aim was to investigate the dormancy type of water dropwort seeds for developing seed germination methods in the future. The mature fruit is a schizocarp with sponge-like and thickened ribs. However, the seeds were able to absorb moisture normally. In this study, less than 14% of seeds germinated without any pretreatment after 4 weeks at 20, 25, or 25/15 °C (12/12 h). However, there was a further increase in germination percentage after 10 weeks of incubation at 5/5, 15/6, 20/10, and 25/15 °C. The seeds germinated at higher ratios under relatively colder temperature regimes. Embryo growth in the seeds occurred at both warm and cold temperatures. However, water dropwort seeds require a period of cold temperatures for embryo growth to be completed. The germination percentage was significantly higher in GA₃-treated seeds, even though the absolute difference was relatively low. In water dropwort, GA can overcome seed dormancy but cold temperature alone for 8–10 weeks may effectively break seed dormancy and increase germination percentage. Based on these results, we propose that most water dropwort seeds showed intermediate complex morphophysiological dormancy and some seeds had morphological dormancy at the time of dispersal. These results provide useful information for seed propagation and a practical production plan for cultivation of water dropwort.  aPublisher supplied data  a1cMajor in Horticultural Science, Mokpo National University  a2cMajor in Horticultural Science, Mokpo National University  a3cNational Institute of Biological Resources, Ministry of Environment 3aOenanthe javanica subsp. stolonifera 3abiotechnology 3aenvironment 3agibberellic acid 3ahorticulture 3ainformation 3amethodology 3apretreatment 3aribs 3aschizocarps 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3atemperature 3awater1 aNa, Haeyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2190-13020 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2021 Feb., v. 62, no. 1 p.1-8dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-020-00292-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245014300198300001500341520156900356592002801925650002801953650002101981650001902002650001402021650001002035650001102045650001402056650002502070650000902095650001902104650001302123650001102136650002702147700002502174700002102199700002302220773015202243856007002395856010602465990002302571852000902594655001202603IND60608472820221123000805.0190510e20161105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060847282DNAL7 a10.3791/546642doi7 aPMC52261132pmcid7 a278423742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasek, Raymond C.10aSustained administration of β-cell mitogens to intact mouse islets Ex Vivo using biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres  ap. e54664.  aThe development of biomaterials has significantly increased the potential for targeted drug delivery to a variety of cell and tissue types, including the pancreatic β-cells. In addition, biomaterial particles, hydrogels, and scaffolds also provide a unique opportunity to administer sustained, controllable drug delivery to β-cells in culture and in transplanted tissue models. These technologies allow the study of candidate β-cell proliferation factors using intact islets and a translationally relevant system. Moreover, determining the effectiveness and feasibility of candidate factors for stimulating β-cell proliferation in a culture system is critical before moving forward to in vivo models. Herein, we describe a method to co-culture intact mouse islets with biodegradable compound of interest (COI)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres for the purpose of assessing the effects of sustained in situ release of mitogenic factors on β-cell proliferation. This technique describes in detail how to generate PLGA microspheres containing a desired cargo using commercially available reagents. While the described technique uses recombinant human Connective tissue growth factor (rhCTGF) as an example, a wide variety of COI could readily be used. Additionally, this method utilizes 96-well plates to minimize the amount of reagents necessary to assess β-cell proliferation. This protocol can be readily adapted to use alternative biomaterials and other endocrine cell characteristics such as cell survival and differentiation status.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acell viability 3acoculture 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3aislets of Langerhans 3amice 3amicroparticles 3amitogens 3amodels 3atranslation (genetics)1 aKavanaugh, Taylor E.1 aDuvall, Craig L.1 aGannon, Maureen A.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Nov. 05, , no. 117 p.e54664-e54664dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/546643Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54664/sustained-administration-cell-mitogens-to-intact-mouse-islets-ex-vivo  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245008200179300001600261500000900277520141800286592002801704650001201732650001001744650001401754650001301768650001101781650002101792650001101813650002801824650000901852700001801861700001901879700001701898773014801915856009602063852000902159655001202168IND60668336020221120045519.0191125e197907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066833602DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1979.03615995004300040014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Bashir10aUse of Gypsum Stones to Lower the Sodium Adsorption Ratio of Irrigation Water  ap. 698-702.  aepub  aMany sources of irrigation water have sufficiently high Na⁺/Ca²⁺ ratios to be harmful to soils and crops. When the salt contents of the waters are reasonably low, the primary method of lowering this ratio is to apply extra Ca²⁺ on the fields or in the water. Gypsum is generally the most reasonably priced source of Ca²⁺. A major portion of its current cost is associated with grinding the stones to a powder and application of this powder to the fields. This study shows that gypsum stones 5 to 20 kg in size are a useable source of the Ca²⁺ needed to bring down the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in sodic irrigation waters. The dissolution rate of the gypsum stones is proportional to the square root of the velocity of flow through the bed. Since the time of residence of solution in the bed is inversely proportional to its velocity through the bed, the increase in concentration of Ca²⁺ in solution as it passes through the whole bed is inversely proportional to the square root of the velocity of flow. Solution concentration is also inversely proportional to the square root of the size of the stones in the bed. Equations were developed to facilitate design of channels with the proper cross section and length to supply the needed amounts of Ca²⁺ to the water when the average size of the stones, the flow rate of the water, and the initial ionic concentration of the water are known.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acrops 3aequations 3agrinding 3agypsum 3airrigation water 3asodium 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asoil1 aKemper, W.

It can feed on a variety of plants, but trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) is its preferred host and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) serves as a secondary one in the northern part of its distribution. Because host plant characteristics influence insect performance and survival, we evaluated the impact of trembling aspen and sugar maple foliage on M. disstria performance. Host effects on insect cold hardiness and overwintering survival of offspring were also studied. Forest tent caterpillar reared on aspen leaves had a shorter development time, higher pupal weights and fecundity, and superior egg parameters (length and weight) compared with those reared on sugar maple leaves. Larvae from the two food treatments had low glucose levels during diapause, whereas glycerol content of insects reared on maple was significantly higher during diapause than larvae fed on aspen. Lower glycerol content may explain the higher overwinter mortality of pharate larvae from aspen-reared parents even though their supercooling points were as low as -36°C. This study shows the influence of host plant on insect life history and the need to consider overwintering success and offspring performance in studies to understand and predict population growth and cycling. 3apupae 3atemperate forests 3aAcer saccharum 3ainterspecific variation 3adeciduous forests 3aova 3aglucose 3afecundity 3aplant pests 3ainsect development 3aleaves 3ainsect pests 3aforest trees 3ahost plants 3aglycerol 3aMalacosoma disstria 3alarvae 3amortality 3aoverwintering 3aPopulus tremuloides 3acold tolerance 3aforest pests 2aAcclimatization 2aAcer 2aAnimals 2aCold Temperature 2aFemale 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aMale 2aMothsxphysiology 2aPopulus 2aSeasons 0aspecies differences1 aMauffette, Y.1 aRochefort, S.1 aHan, E.1 aBauce, E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2010 Apr., v. 39, no. 2 p.498-504dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN091393Available from publisher's Web site  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03117naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245007900190300001800269520120700287592002801494650002301522650002101545650001201566650002001578650001001598650001301608650001201621650002101633650000701654650001101661650003901672650002001711650001601731650001601747650002101763650003401784650007601818650002201894650002901916650004001945650002101985650003102006650006202037650002102099650002402120650001602144700002502160700002202185700002302207700001802230700001802248700002402266773012302290856008102413852000902494655001202503IND60080308820221120104602.0150216e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008030882DNAL7 a248451672pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-014-1670-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajben-Nagy, Enikő10aCharacterization of an extracellular laccase of Leptosphaerulina chartarum  ap. 2449-2458.  aLaccase-producing fungi were isolated from air, using selective media with a chromogenic substrate to indicate enzyme activity. The best laccase producer strain proved to be a Leptosphaerulina chartarum isolate. Laccase production was investigated in the presence of various inducers in different cultivation conditions. The extracellular laccase was purified for further investigations. SDS-PAGE showed that this laccase is a monomeric protein of 38 kDa molecular weight. The enzyme is active in the pH-range of 3.5–6, with an optimum at pH 3.8. It is active in the 10–60 °C temperature range, with an optimum at 40 °C. After 20 min incubation at temperatures above 70 °C the enzyme lost its activity. Degradation of seven aniline and phenol compounds (2,4-dichlorophenol; 2-methyl-4-chlorophenol; 3-chloroaniline; 4-chloroaniline; 2,6-dimethylaniline; 3,4-dichloroaniline and 3-chloro-4-methylaniline) was investigated, with or without guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) as mediator molecule. Addition of a mediator to the system significantly increased the degradation levels. These results confirmed that the isolated laccase is able to convert these harmful xenobiotics at in vitro conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aLeptosphaerulina 3aaniline 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3aguaiacol 3alaccase 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aphenol 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aselective media 3atemperature 3axenobiotics 2aAir Microbiology 2aAniline Compoundsxmetabolism 2aAscomycotaxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBiotransformation 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Stability 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLaccasexchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aTemperature1 aManczinger, László1 aŠkrbić, Biljana1 aŽivančev, Jelena1 aAntič, Igor,1 aKrisch, Judit1 aVágvölgyi, Csaba,0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2014 Sept., v. 30, no. 9 p.2449-2458dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-014-1670-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010200165300001800267520115300285592002801438596007601466596004601542596005901588596009501647650001501742650002101757650001601778650001801794650001801812650002301830650002501853650002801878700005501906773014401961856008302105852000902188655001202197IND60735836820221121065948.0211001e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073583682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-020-00902-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Guo-Hua10aIs a sustainable loop of economy and entrepreneurial ecosystem possible? a structural perspective  ap. 7002-7040.  aIs region-level entrepreneurial ecosystem valid in emerging markets? What is the mechanism between entrepreneurial ecosystem elements? Is region-level entrepreneurial ecosystem in emerging markets economic-promoting? An endogenous growth model with labor-preference technologic progress is introduced to interpret the interactions between entrepreneurial ecosystem layers and growth; besides, a panel vector auto-regression model based on Chinese provinces from 2002 to 2016 is used to test. Accordingly, we empirically prove the possibility of entrepreneurial ecosystem achieving sustainable development at the scope of Chinese provinces. However, several specific situations should be avoided, including (1) a too-low relative human capital return, (2) a too-low poor-conditions-led transaction efficiency, and (3) a too-low human-capital-stock-determined technology. Thus, short-term tolerance and continuous promoting efforts are necessary. By doing so, we contribute to the literature of region-level entrepreneurial ecosystem and economic growth, or to say the fields of institutional economics, regional economics, and development economics.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018CDYJSY0055cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a18AGL009cNational Fund of Social Science  a71772019cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a106112017CDJXY020002cBasic Scientific Research Operating Expenses of Central Universities 3aecosystems 3aentrepreneurship 3aenvironment 3agrowth models 3ahuman capital 3aregional economics 3astochastic processes 3asustainable development1 aZhang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6431-92860 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.7002-7040dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00902-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05293naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245015300210520356800363592002803931596003403959596007003993650000904063650002804072650001104100650001304111650000904124650000804133650001604141650001704157650001804174650001204192650001904204650001604223650001704239650001304256650001304269650003304282650001504315650001404330650001404344650001304358650001704371650001704388650001404405653001004419653001604429653002304445653002204468773013104490856008404621961001304705852000904718655001204727IND60782402020221118042251.0220708e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078240202DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-09-21-2036-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiland, Jerry E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1431-170210aFirst Report of Macrophomina phaseolina Causing Charcoal Root Rot of Hebe (Veronica cupressoides, V. ochracea, and V. pinguifolia) in Oregon, U.S.A.  aHebes (Veronica spp. in the section Hebe) are ornamental perennials and shrubs grown for their flowers and symmetric, evergreen leaves. They are uncommon in U.S. horticulture and are only produced by a few nurseries regionally (Oregon and Washington). In June, July, and August (2016 to 2021), stems on 1- to 5-year-old Veronica cupressoides, V. ochracea, and V. pinguifolia in five landscape plantings around Benton County, OR (17 plants total, locations 2 to 37 km apart), began to wilt, turn brown, and die. At least nine of the plants originated from a single nursery. Initially, just one or two stems per plant were affected, but eventually the entire plant died. Stem tissues were discolored brown to black internally, and the roots were dry and necrotic. Leaves turned brown and brittle but remained attached. Stems from each plant were disinfested in 0.5% NaOCl (1 min), rinsed in 70% ethanol, and dried (2 min). Pieces (5 mm²) were then plated onto 1/2 strength potato dextrose agar amended with streptomycin (50 mg/liter) and incubated in the dark at 20°C. Three to 5 days later, grayish-white cultures producing black microsclerotia (75 × 110 µm, n = 50) grew out of all samples. No spores were produced. All isolates were identified as Macrophomina phaseolina by morphology and by ≥99% homology (566 to 570/571 nt) to the internal transcribed spacer sequence (primers ITS1 and ITS4) from the type specimen (GenBank KF766195) (Hyde et al. 2014). Three representative sequences were deposited in GenBank (MZ726450 to MZ726452). Inoculum was prepared from these isolates by growing cultures in 250 ml of potato dextrose broth on a shaker (125 rpm at 25°C). After 2 weeks, the broth was decanted, and the fungal biomass was air dried for 3 days at 25°C before grinding into a powder with a mortar and pestle. Three plants each of 6-month-old V. ochracea ‘James Stirling’, V. cupressoides ‘McKean’, and V. pinguifolia ‘Sutherlandii’ were inoculated with each isolate by rinsing the soil off the roots with tap water, trimming off 0.5 cm of the roots, and then soaking the root ball in a slurry of 1 g of dried inoculum in 500 ml of 0.2% water agar (WA) for 10 min (Gaige et al. 2010). Three plants of each species that were soaked in plain 0.2% WA served as negative controls. Afterward, plants were potted into soilless media (Metro-Mix 840, Sun Gro Horticulture, Agawam, MA) in 8.9-cm square pots and arranged in a completely randomized design in a greenhouse set at 28/24°C day/night. The experiment was conducted three times. One to 3 months later, inoculated plants began to turn yellow, wilt, and die, whereas all control plants remained healthy. The same pathogen was reisolated from 90% of the inoculated plants, but never from negative controls. M. phaseolina was reported on strawberry in southern Oregon in 2014 (Pscheidt and Ocamb 2021) but has not been reported from locations further north in the state where soil temperatures are cooler. It is unusual that M. phaseolina was isolated from an uncommon host at five different locations in an area of the state where the pathogen was not known to occur. Based on this, and on the number of infected plants originating from a single source, it seems likely that M. phaseolina was accidentally spread on contaminated plants produced by the nursery industry, where the warmer temperatures in production greenhouses would provide a more conducive environment for the pathogen’s growth and spread. Growers should keep watch for symptoms of this pathogen in their nurseries.  aPublisher supplied data  a2072-22000-043-00-DcUSDA-ARS  a0500-00059-001-00-DcFloriculture and Nursery Research Initiative 3aHebe 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aOregon 3aVeronica 3aagar 3aair 3abrittleness 3acharcoal rot 3aculture media 3aethanol 3afungal biomass 3agreenhouses 3ahorticulture 3aindustry 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alandscapes 3apathogens 3asclerotia 3aslurries 3astrawberries 3astreptomycin 3atap water 0afungi 0aornamentals 0apathogen detection 0awoody ornamentals0 tPlant disease.g2022 July 01, v. 106, no. 7 p.1984-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-09-21-2036-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04016naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245011900178300001600297520217300313592002802486650001302514650001202527650000902539650001602548650001602564650001202580650001502592650001302607650002002620650002202640650001102662650001402673650001402687650001802701650000902719650001302728650001502741650001102756650002802767650001902795650002002814650002302834650001802857650002602875650001202901650001102913650002102924650001102945650005202956650004103008650002103049650001203070650001103082650001303093700001803106700001603124700001903140773009703159856007703256852000903333655001203342IND60083378720221122095848.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008337872DNAL7 a222813472pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-47522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezac, D.J.10aEffects of varying rates of tallgrass prairie hay and wet corn gluten feed on productivity of lactating dairy cows  ap. 842-849.  aProductivity of lactating dairy cows fed diets with wet corn gluten feed (WCGF, Sweet Bran, Cargill Inc., Blair, NE) as the primary energy substrate and prairie hay as the primary source of physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF) was assessed relative to a control diet. Forty-eight Holstein cows, 100 to 250 d in milk, were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 pens and pens were randomly assigned to treatment sequence in a replicated 3×3 Latin square. Treatments were a control diet with 18% alfalfa, 18% corn silage, 33% WCGF, and 15% forage NDF (CON); a diet with 20% tallgrass prairie hay, 46% WCGF, and 13% forage NDF (TPH20); and a diet with 14% tallgrass prairie hay, 56% WCGF, and 9% forage NDF (TPH14). Midway through period 2, TPH14 was discontinued due to the high prevalence of diarrhea among cows on that treatment. Data from period 2 for TPH14 pens were discarded, and the pens that had been assigned to TPH14 for period 3 were randomly assigned to the other 2 treatments. Pen-level data were analyzed using linear mixed models, including the random effects of period and pen and the fixed effect of treatment. For animal-level data, additional random effects were introduced to account for subsampling. No evidence for treatment effects was apparent on dry matter intake. Least squares mean milk yields were 36.2, 34.6, and 35.2kg/d for CON, TPH20, and TPH14, respectively, and were not significantly different. Milk fat concentration was higher for CON and TPH20 than for TPH14, with means of 3.48, 3.41, and 2.82%, respectively. Fat yield was significantly greater for CON compared with TPH20 and TPH14. Milk urea nitrogen was greatest for TPH20 and TPH14 and least for CON, consistent with differences in dietary protein content. Efficiencies, expressed as energy-corrected milk divided by dry matter intake, were 1.47, 1.42, and 1.24 for CON, TPH20, and TPH14, respectively, and were not significantly different. These data indicate that TPH14 did not provide adequate peNDF to support normal rumen function in mid lactation dairy cows; instead, TPH20 may be a feasible diet for use on dairies where high-NDF grass hay and WCGF are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aalfalfa 3abran 3acorn gluten 3acorn silage 3adairies 3adairy cows 3adiarrhea 3adietary protein 3adry matter intake 3aforage 3agrass hay 3alactation 3aleast squares 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aprimary energy 3aprotein content 3arumen fermentation 3aurea nitrogen 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aGlutensxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aPoaceae 2aSilage 2aZea mays1 aGrigsby, K.N.1 aBello, N.M.1 aBradford, B.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.842-849dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-47523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014300171520189800314592002802212650001802240650001502258650001602273650002102289650001602310650001102326650002002337650001102357650001302368650001502381650001902396650001902415650001302434650002102447653001802468653001002486653003002496653001802526653002202544653002002566700001702586700002702603700001902630700002202649700002402671700001902695773011202714856008302826852000902909655001202918IND60704828120221122190213.0210201e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070482812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2020.1124392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoomro, Razium Ali10aIn-situ engineered MXene-TiO2/ BiVO4 hybrid as an efficient photoelectrochemical platform for sensitive detection of soluble CD44 proteins  aInterfacial charge-carrier recombination is a bottle-neck issue restricting photoelectrochemical biosensors advancement in the wearable clinical electronics. In this study, we propose a simple approach to construct a highly efficient photoactive heterojunction capable of functioning as an active substrate in PEC biosensing of CD44 proteins. Taking the advantage of high photocatalytic activity of BiVO₄, and biocompatible yet conductive 2D-Ti₃C₂Tₓ nanosheets, a workable heterojunction was constructed between in-situ formed TiO₂ from the partially oxidized Ti₃C₂Tₓ and lysine functionalized BiVO₄ (TiO₂/MX-BiVO₄). The interfacial arrangement was ideal for promoting fast charge transfer from photo-excited BiVO₄ and TiO₂ to Ti₃C₂Tₓ, constructing an energy level-cascade that permits minimal charge-carrier recombination besides robust photocatalytic redox activity. The PEC biosensor relies on the ligand-protein interaction, where hyaluronic acid was directly immobilized over TiO₂/MX-BiVO₄ based on the interactions between carboxyl of lysine and amino moieties of hyaluronic acid. The PEC biosensor response depends on the inhibition in the measured photo-oxidation current of mediator species, i.e., ascorbic acid after the addition of CD44 proteins. The superior photo-activity, and robust heterojunction arrangement, produced a sensitive signal capable of recognizing CD44 in the wide concentration window of 2.2 × 10⁻⁴ ng mL⁻¹ to 3.2 ng mL⁻¹ with a low-detection limit of 1.4 × 10⁻² pg mL⁻¹. The strong interaction between lysine functionalized BiVO₄ and hyaluronic acid enabled biosensor to exhibit robust antifouling characteristics towards similar proteins such as PSA and NSE. The quantification of CD44 protein from real-blood serum samples further confirmed the biosensor's reliability for clinical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3ahyaluronic acid 3alysine 3amoieties 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotooxidation 3aproteins 3atitanium dioxide 0aPEC biosensor 0aMXene 0aPartially oxidized MXenes 0aCD44 proteins 0aBiVO4/TiO2 hybrid 0aHyaluronic acid1 aJawaid, Sana1 aKalawar, Nazar Hussain1 aTunesi, Mawada1 aKarakuş, Selcan,1 aKilislioğlu, Ayben1 aWillander, M.,0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 166 p.112439-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.1124393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001500162245016000177300001600337520201000353592002802363650001302391650001602404650002302420650001502443650002202458650001102480650001202491650001602503650001902519650000902538650002002547650002002567650001802587650001202605650001102617650002402628650002602652650001202678650001102690650002102701650001102722650004102733650002002774650001002794700001802804773009702822856007702919852000902996655001203005IND60083378820221122131351.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008337882DNAL7 a222813482pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-45092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFish, J.A.10aShort communication: Varying dietary dry matter concentration through water addition: Effect on nutrient intake and sorting of dairy cows in late lactation  ap. 850-855.  aThe objective of this study was to determine if feed sorting can be reduced and if nutrient consumption can be limited in late-lactation cows through water addition to a nutrient-dense total mixed ration (TMR) with a dry matter (DM) content greater than 60%. Twelve lactating Holstein cows (214.8±28.5 d in milk) were exposed to 2 diets in a crossover design with 28-d periods. Diets had the same ingredient composition and differed only in DM percentage, which was reduced by the addition of water. Treatment diets were (1) dry TMR (61.7% DM) and (2) wet TMR (51.9% DM). Dry matter intake and milk production (4% fat-corrected milk; FCM) were recorded for the last 14 d of each treatment period. For the final 4 d of each period, fresh feed and orts were sampled for particle size analysis and subsequent calculation of sorting activity (expressed as a percentage of predicted intake). Adding water to the diet tended to decrease the amount of DM in the fine particle fraction, increase starch concentration in the longer ration particles, and reduce starch concentration in the shortest ration particles. All cows sorted against long ration particles; the extent of this sorting did not differ between the dry and wet treatments (72.9 vs. 77.6%). There tended to be more sorting for fine ration particles on the dry diet compared with the wet (106.3 vs. 104.0%). Water addition had no effect on production, with similar DMI (27.9 vs. 26.5 kg/d), 4% FCM (28.7 vs. 27.6 kg/d), and efficiency of production (0.98 vs. 1.00kg of 4% FCM/kg of DMI) between the dry and wet treatments. Adding water to a TMR with greater than 60% DM containing primarily haylage and corn silage forage sources may change ration particle DM distribution and particle starch content, possibly contributing to less sorting for the smallest ration particles. This research does not provide evidence that water addition to such a TMR can effectively limit DMI in late-lactation cows and, thus, improve efficiency of milk production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acorn silage 3across-over studies 3adairy cows 3adry matter intake 3aforage 3ahaylage 3aingredients 3alate lactation 3amilk 3amilk production 3anutrient intake 3aparticle size 3asorting 3astarch 3atotal mixed rations 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNutritive Value 2aWater1 aDeVries, T.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.850-855dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-45093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04287naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005200140245010300192300001800295500001900313500002000332520197600352592002802328596005902356596005902415596004802474596008702522596005702609596009202666596008102758650003202839650002802871650001602899650001902915650001302934650001902947650001102966650002002977650003102997650001803028650002803046650001603074650002203090650001503112650002003127650005203147650001603199650001903215650002003234650001803254650002003272650001103292700001103303700001703314700001503331700001603346700001303362700001703375773015003392856007403542852000903616655001203625IND60737954920221117205931.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073795492DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.109762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3549-293610aComparative proteomic analysis of three Lactobacillus plantarum strains under salt stress by iTRAQ  ap. 3457-3471.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Lactobacillus plantarum, a common species of lactic acid bacteria, is used to improve the flavor of traditional fermented food. Under salt stress, different strains of L. plantarum can respond differently. In this work, proteomics and bioinformatics analysis of L. plantarum strains (ATCC14917, FS5‐5, and 208) grown under salt stress (240 g L⁻¹ sodium chloride (NaCl)) were investigated based on the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation method. RESULTS: Although 171 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were observed, only 44, 57, and 112 DEPs were identified in the strains ATCC14917, FS5‐5, and 208 respectively. There were 33, 191, and 179 specific DEPs in ATCC14917 versus FS5‐5, in 208 versus FS5‐5, and in strain 208 versus ATCC14917 in 240 g L⁻¹ NaCl. These DEPs indicate that the three strains, from pickles, fermented soybean paste, and fermented milk, may have different salt stress responses. Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that most DEPs observed were involved in protein biosynthesis, nucleotide metabolism, and sugar metabolism. Twenty‐six significantly different DEPs that were possibly associated with salt response were selected and further analyzed for gene expression level and pattern by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Pyruvate kinase and cysteine desulfurase had similar expression patterns in all three strains; glutamate decarboxylase expression was upregulated in FS5‐5 and significantly upregulated in strain 208; RNA polymerase subunit alpha was downregulated in FS5‐5 but upregulated in strain 208. CONCLUSIONS: These results also showed that the salt stress response of strain 208 may involve higher numbers of genes than the other strains. This research provides a theoretical basis for improvement of salt tolerance of L. plantarum in industrial production. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a31701623cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31972047cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cLiaoning BaiQianWan Talents Program Project  aRC200495cLiaoning Province Natural Science Foundation Regional Joint Fund Project  aXLYC1807040cLiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program  aLSNJC201902cScientific Research Project of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education  cShenyang City Youth Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Project 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aagriculture 3abioinformatics 3acysteine 3afermented milk 3aflavor 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3alactic acid 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3apyruvate kinase 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3asoybean paste 3astress response 3asugars1 aLi, Mo1 aZhang, Henan1 aYan, Danli1 aJi, Shuaiqi1 aWu, Rina1 aChen, Yongfu0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 June, v. 101, no. 8 p.3457-3471dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.109763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05538naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245012800205520368900333592002804022596005404050650002904104650002004133650000804153650002604161650002304187650000904210650001204219650001804231650001004249650001304259650001604272650001404288650002104302650001504323650001304338650003304351650001104384650002104395650001304416650001804429650001404447650001404461650002204475650002404497650000904521650001604530650002504546650001304571650002104584651001004605700005504615700001504670700001504685773013104700856008404831852000904915655001204924IND60782402220221118042302.0220708e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078240222DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-09-21-2066-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, C.

This orchid is cultivated and mostly adopted to treat diabetes and hepatitis. About two billion artificially cultivated seedlings of Jinxianlian are required each year, and approximately $600 million in fresh A. roxburghii seedlings are produced in China. Since 2011, sporadic occurrences of stem rot on Jinxianlian have been observed in greenhouses in Jinhua City (N 29°05′, E 119°38′), Zhejiang Province. In 2018, nearly 30% of seedlings of Jinxianlian grown in greenhouse conditions were affected by stem rot in Jinhua City. Symptoms initially occurred in the stem at the soil line causing dark discolored lesions, rotted tissues, wilting, and eventually plant death. A total of 23 diseased seedlings collected from seven different greenhouses were surface sterilized with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite for 3 min and rinsed in water. Pieces of disinfected tissues from each sample were plated on 2% potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C in the dark for 5 days (Kirk et al. 2008). A total of 19 isolates were recovered. They developed colonies with purple mycelia and beige or orange colors after 7 days of incubation at 25°C on PDA and carnation leaf agar (CLA) media (Kirk et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2016). Colonies on PDA had an average radial growth rate of 3.1 to 4.0 mm/day at 25°C. The colony surface was pale vinaceous and floccose with abundant aerial mycelium. On CLA, aerial mycelium was sparse with abundant bright orange sporodochia forming on the carnation leaves. Microconidia were hyaline and oval ellipsoid to cylindrical (3.7 to 9.3 × 1.3 to 2.9 μm) (n = 19). Macroconidia were three to five septate and fusoid subulate with a pedicellate base (27.4 to 35.6 × 3.2 to 4.2 μm) (n = 19). These morphological features were consistent with Fusarium oxysporum (Lombard et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2018). To confirm the identification, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and translation elongation factor1 (TEF) were amplified from the DNA of three of the isolates chosen at random using the primer sets ITS1/ITS4 and EF1/EF2 (Lombard et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2018), respectively. BLAST analysis revealed that the ITS sequences (OK147619, OK147620, and OK147621) had 99% identity to that of F. oxysporum isolate JJF2 (GenBank MN626452), and the TEF sequences (OK155999, OK156000, and OK156001) had 100% identity to that of F. oxysporum isolate gss100 (GenBank MH341210). A multilocus phylogenetic analysis by Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood trees based on ITS and TEF indicated that the pathogen grouped consistently with F. oxysporum. Three isolates were chosen at random to evaluate pathogenicity. Uninfected healthy A. roxburghii seedlings about 40-days-old planted in sterilized substrates were sprayed with distilled water containing 2 × 10⁶ conidia/ml suspensions as inoculums, and plants sprayed with distilled water alone served as controls. Plants were incubated at 25°C and 85% relative humidity. Ten plants were inoculated for each isolate. After 10 days, all inoculated plants developed stem rot symptoms, while control plants remained healthy. Cultures of Fusarium spp. were reisolated only from inoculated plants with a frequency of 100% and reidentified by morphological characteristics as F. oxysporum, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of F. oxysporum causing stem rot on A. roxburghii seedlings. As F. oxysporum is a devastating pathogenic fungus with a broad host range, measures should be taken in advance to manage stem rot of A. roxburghii.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020C02005a2021SNLF019cZhejiang Province, China 3aAnoectochilus roxburghii 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aagar 3aconidia 3aculture media 3adeath 3adiabetes 3agreenhouses 3ahepatitis 3aherbal medicines 3ahost range 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3arelative humidity 3asodium hypochlorite 3asoil 3asporodochia 3astatistical analysis 3astem rot 3avirulent strains 3aChina1 aChen, X.

Yet, resilient communities that have access to the needed information, as well as physical, economic, social, and human capitals, tend to prepare, respond, and recover from disasters better than other communities. Recently, a people-oriented approach of community resilience inducing a collaboration of various stakeholders has been advocated instead of the command and control approach widely adopted by governments. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research on the role of the different stakeholders in promoting the different capitals of community resilience. Hence, this paper seeks to investigate the extent to which the different stakeholders are involved in community resilience. By distributing a questionnaire on 273 of the inhabitants of a newly-established, urban sub-district for repopulating vulnerable people in Cairo, the paper offers deep insight into the roles of the government, private sector, and NGOs in promoting community resilience and illuminates how each stakeholder prioritizes different capitals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3ahumans 3aprivate sector 3aquestionnaires 3astakeholders 3aEgypt0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.7996-8011dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00894-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013300208300001800341520179100359592002802150650003002178650001502208650001702223650002202240650003002262650001102292650002602303650001002329650002302339650002002362700002302382700001902405700001802424773012702442856008302569852000902652655001202661IND60753845820221120022941.0211017e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075384582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-021-02962-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGullotta, Aurora1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3782-801512aA Simplified Methodology for Optimal Location and Setting of Valves to Improve Equity in Intermittent Water Distribution Systems  ap. 4477-4494.  aIn this paper, a simplified methodology to increase the water distribution equity in existing intermittent water distribution systems (WDSs) is presented. The methodology assumes to install valves in the water distribution network with the objective to re-arrange the flow circulation, thus allowing an improved water distribution among the network users. Valve installation in the WDS is based on the use of algorithms of sequential addition (SA). Two optimization schemes based on SA were developed and tested. The first one allows identifying locations of gate valves in order to maximize the global distribution equity of the network, irrespectively of the local impact of the valves on the supply level of the single nodes. Conversely, the second scheme aims to maximize the global equity of the network by optimizing both location and setting (opening degree) of control valves, to include the impact of the new flow circulation on the supply level of each node. The two optimization schemes were applied to a case study network subject to water shortage conditions. The software EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used for the simulations in the wake of previous successful applications for the analysis of intermittent water distribution systems. Results of the application of the SA algorithms were also compared with those from the literature and obtained by the use of the multi-objective Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II). The results show the high performance of SA algorithms in identifying optimal position and settings of the valves in the WDS. The comparison pointed out that SA algorithms are able to perform similarly to NSGA II and, at the same time, to reduce significantly the computational effort associated to the optimization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3astormwater management 3awater 3awater distribution 3awater shortages1 aCampisano, Alberto1 aCreaco, Enrico1 aModica, Carlo0 tWater resources management.g2021 Oct., v. 35, no. 13 p.4477-4494dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02962-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001800162245007200180300001600252520181100268592002802079650000802107650000802115650002302123650001202146650001502158650001002173650001802183650001302201650001202214650002502226650002402251650001802275650001202293650001102305650004202316650003302358650002202391650001302413650003902426650002002465650005402485650004002539650005902579650003402638650003902672700001902711700001902730773009702749856007702846852000902923655001202932IND60083379020221120203837.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008337902DNAL7 a222813142pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-49702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrick, D.J.10aInvited review: Genomic analysis of data from physiological studies  ap. 499-507.  aPhysiology deals with the functions of living organisms and their systems, and its scientific endeavors can be viewed as having temporally occurred in 3 phases. The first phase of physiology studies focused on determining the functions of particular organs and tissues and their functional differences according to physiological status. The second phase of studies focused on characterizing differences in these functions according to the environment, or productivity. The third phase of studies focuses on determining the physiological causes of differences in productivity. Distinguishing cause from effect in physiological systems of inter-related processes is problematic, such that science has struggled to identify the root physiological mechanisms and their role in the network of genes leading to differences in productivity. Genomics is the study of the entire genome and provides powerful new tools that will accelerate third-phase discoveries of causal physiological processes. That research exploits information on DNA polymorphisms known as markers, complete DNA sequence, RNA sequence, and RNA expression in particular tissues at specific life stages. Physiologists can determine the genetic cause of mutant animals, identify genetic differences between cases and controls, and identify genes responsible for differences in performance between average and above-average animals. In some species, physiologists can leverage genomic data being used to predict genetic merit in elite seedstock populations, as a starting point to identify genes that will then motivate detailed physiological studies in the organs or tissues and stages of life in which those genes are expressed. Such work will increase our knowledge of biology and may lead to novel approaches to manipulate animal performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aanimal performance 3aanimals 3agene banks 3agenes 3agenetic merit 3agenomics 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aphysiological state 3aphysiologists 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aGene Expression Profilingxveterinary 2aGenesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenomicsxmethods 2aGenotype 2aLinkage Disequilibriumxphysiology 2aModels, Genetic 2aMultifactorial Inheritancexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhysiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxveterinary1 aBaumgard, L.H.1 aNeibergs, H.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.499-507dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-49703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245011300180300001800293520114000311592002801451650001801479650001001497650001601507650002101523650002901544650002601573650002601599650001601625650002001641650001501661650001001676650001801686650001501704650001101719650002101730650000901751650001501760650004001775650002501815650002701840650002401867650002501891650003201916650001801948650002301966700001701989700001502006700001502021700001702036700001702053700001802070700001502088700001502103700001902118773012302137856008102260852000902341655001202350IND60080309220221121014833.0140728e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008030922DNAL7 a248883332pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-014-1674-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwain, P.10aAntimicrobial activity of metal based nanoparticles against microbes associated with diseases in aquaculture  ap. 2491-2502.  aThe emergence of diseases and mortalities in aquaculture and development of antibiotics resistance in aquatic microbes, has renewed a great interest towards alternative methods of prevention and control of diseases. Nanoparticles have enormous potential in controlling human and animal pathogens and have scope of application in aquaculture. The present investigation was carried out to find out suitable nanoparticles having antimicrobial effect against aquatic microbes. Different commercial as well as laboratory synthesized metal and metal oxide nanoparticles were screened for their antimicrobial activities against a wide range of bacterial and fungal agents including certain freshwater cyanobacteria. Among different nanoparticles, synthesized copper oxide (CuO), zinc oxide (ZnO), silver (Ag) and silver doped titanium dioxide (Ag–TiO₂) showed broad spectrum antibacterial activity. On the contrary, nanoparticles like Zn and ZnO showed antifungal activity against fungi like Penicillium and Mucor species. Since CuO, ZnO and Ag nanoparticles showed higher antimicrobial activity, they may be explored for aquaculture use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aMucor 3aPenicillium 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantifungal properties 3aaquaculture 3adisease control 3afreshwater 3afungi 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3asilver 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc 3azinc oxide 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxpharmacology 2aAquaculturexmethods 2aBacteriaxdrug effects 2aFungixdrug effects 2aMetalsxpharmacology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aNanoparticles 2aWater Microbiology1 aNayak, S.

The soils studied were representatives of the Prairie (Brunizem)³, Wiesenboden, and Planosol great soil groups. The time of soil weathering was assumed to have been the major soil formation variable affecting the soils investigated. The degree of soil profile development in southwestern Iowa had been found previously to increase maximally in a southeasternly direction from the major source of loessial material at the Missouri River. The total phosphorus was found to decrease in the profiles along the traverse in relation to the degree of profile development, and the vertical distribution was found to vary in a systematic manner also. The action of soil weathering was found to have reduced the amount of phosphorus in the A horizons of the soils in relation to the amount found in the C horizons. The phosphorus measured on the B horizons was less than in the A or C horizons and decreased along the traverse to a minimum in the Haig profile (maximal Wiesenboden) and then increased slightly in the Planosol soils. The organic phosphorus was found to decrease also in relation to the degree of soil profile development along the traverse and to decline vertically in the profiles at a progressively greater rate with each succeeding more strongly developed profile. The data indicate a definite relationship between the amount and distribution of phosphorus and the stage of soil development exhibited in each of the profiles studied.³Name proposed for Prairie soils by R.

In the Latin American–European network “Rural Society, Economy and Natural Resources—Integrating Competence in Rural Development” (SERIDAR), scientists and practitioners in rural areas have jointly elaborated research problems, which were then investigated—among other formats—by interdisciplinary teams of students within related study programmes. These projects had dual purposes: conveying essential professional competences to students and generating knowledge for and with participating rural actors. Linking approaches of transdisciplinary research and competence-oriented curriculum development, universities thus increased their efforts to fulfil their societal tasks and contribute to sustainable problem-solving. This article provides academic staff with insights into the didactic concept, tested and adapted in Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua and China according to local conditions. Results of a comprehensive evaluation and systematisation process on local and international level are presented, as well as conclusions on factors and conditions necessary for the implementation and integration of transdisciplinary and problem-based student team research into university curricula as well as on this format as an element of collaboration for problem-solving in multi-stakeholder platforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acurriculum 3aproblem solving 3arural development 3asustainability science and engineering 3aChina 3aColombia 3aMexico 3aNicaragua1 aHofmann-Souki, Susanne1 aCruz Morales, Juana0 tSustainability science.g2020 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.233-246dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-019-00687-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007600148245009800224300001100322520160500333592002801938650001801966650002601984650002202010650001602032650001302048650001402061650001702075650002402092650000902116650001902125650001302144700003802157700003802195700002502233700003102258700003102289773010502320856008302425852000902508655001202517IND60735837520221121065902.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073583752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-021-02819-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos Guimarães, Paulo Henrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7628-485310aIndex selection can improve the selection efficiency in a rice recurrent selection population  ap. 95.  aTo attain success with selection process, the breeders need to understand the genetic variability into each population developed by breeding program. In this purpose, breeders need to estimate the variance components and genetic and phenotypic parameters. Besides, they need to have the ability to select simultaneously genetically top progenies for multiple traits. This study used a field trial, with a panel of 198 S₀:₂ lowland rice progenies, evaluated in three environments during two years in order to: (i) estimate genetic parameters for different traits in a rice breeding population, (ii) evaluate the impact of direct selection and selection performed through three selection indices in a rice population developed by recurrent selection, and (iii) compare three selection indices using different economic weights with direct and indirect selection. Significant genetic variation was found among progenies for: grain yield, plant height, days to flowering, panicle blast, leaf scald and grain discoloration. The direct selection provided high gains for single trait selection, but this method may results in undesirable changes in related traits. Thus, between the evaluated indices and in comparison, to indirect selection the Mulamba and Mock index provided simultaneously greater gains for all the evaluated traits. Furthermore, we found that when the random weights and [Formula: see text]-variation index were used as economic weight, it was found lower gains or no gains, showing that the gains attained with Smith and Hazel and Tai indices were linked to economic weights used.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscoloration 3afield experimentation 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3apanicles 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3arecurrent selection 3arice 3ascald diseases 3avariance1 aGuimarães Santos Melo, Patrícia1 aCenteno Cordeiro, Antônio Carlos1 aPereira Torga, Paula1 aNakano Rangel, Paulo Hideo1 aPereira de Castro, Adriano0 tEuphytica.g2021 May, v. 217, no. 5 p.95-95dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-021-02819-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245013900188300001800327520098500345592002801330650002201358650002101380650002301401650001301424650002501437650001901462650001401481650001201495650005501507650004501562650004801607650005401655650001001709650005701719650004001776650005801816650003101874650002801905650003501933650002101968650005501989650003802044650004602082650003102128650006602159650001902225650002602244650003202270700001702302700002402319700002202343700002402365700002302389773009802412856008602510852000902596655001202605IND4466862320221118232244.0141110e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446686232DNAL7 a218903482pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.07.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendes, Sónia10aSynergistic action of azoreductase and laccase leads to maximal decolourization and detoxification of model dye-containing wastewaters  ap. 9852-9859.  aThe azoreductase PpAzoR from Pseudomonas putida shows a broader specificity for decolourization of azo dyes than CotA-laccase from Bacillus subtilis. However, the final products of PpAzoR activity exhibited in most cases a 2 to 3-fold higher toxicity than intact dyes themselves. We show that addition of CotA-laccase to PpAzoR reaction mixtures lead to a significant drop in the final toxicity. A sequential enzymatic process was validated through the use of 18 representative azo dyes and three model wastewaters that mimic real dye-containing effluents. A heterologous Escherichia coli strain was successfully constructed co-expressing the genes coding for both PpAzoR and CotA. Whole-cell assays of recombinant strain for the treatment of model dye wastewater resulted in decolourization levels above 80% and detoxification levels up to 50%. The high attributes of this strain, make it a promising candidate for the biological treatment of industrial dye containing effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas putida 3aazo dyes 3abiological treatment 3adecolorization 3aeffluents 2aAnimals 2aAzo Compoundsxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aBacillus subtilisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBiodegradation, Environmentalxdrug effects 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aColor 2aColoring Agentsxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aInactivation, Metabolic 2aLaccasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Chemical 2aNADH, NADPH Oxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effects 2aPseudomonas putidaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aToxicity Tests 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aFarinha, Ana1 aRamos, Christian G.1 aLeitão, Jorge H.1 aViegas, Cristina A.1 aMartins, Lígia O.0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Nov., v. 102, no. 21 p.9852-9859dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.07.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010900166300001200275500001900287520167300306592002801979596009802007650001502105650001202120650001602132650002302148650001602171650001202187650001102199650002002210650001902230650002102249650001702270650000902287650002102296650001302317700001402330700001802344700001802362700001402380773013102394856008302525852000902608655001202617IND60701285220221123020533.0200809e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070128522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-020-03118-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiliang10aFoliar application of humic acid decreased hazard of cadmium toxicity on the growth of Hybrid Pennisetum  ap. 129.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe positive effects of humic acid (HA) in alleviating the toxicity of cadmium (Cd) were demonstrated in pot grown Hybrid Pennisetum. Twelve treatments consisting of six concentrations of Cd (0, 10, 20, 50, 70 and 100 mg kg⁻¹) combined with two levels of HA (0 and 1.0 g L⁻¹) were applied. Our results showed that although Cd toxicity significantly inhibited plant growth, decreased the dry weights of leaves, stems and roots and substantially increased the leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) and Cd concentrations in different plant tissues, Hybrid Pennisetum had a strong ability in the uptake and transfer of Cd and could be used for phytoremediation in Cd-contaminated soils. The chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity of the leaves also decreased under Cd stress. The foliar application of HA alleviated the symptoms of Cd toxicity by increasing the net photosynthetic rate (Pₙ) and the content of photosynthetic pigments, although HA did not significantly decrease the concentration of Cd in the leaf, stem and root tissues. Compared with the zero-HA treatment, 1.0 g L⁻¹ HA increased the root, stem and leaf biomasses by approximately 2.7–99.4%, 3.9–11.2% and 18.2–87.1%, respectively. MDA had a significant negative relationship with Pₙ. The MDA content of the HA-treated Hybrid Pennisetum plants decreased by approximately 4.4–12.2% compared with that of the Cd-only plants, indicating the high Cd tolerance of Hybrid Pennisetum. It is concluded that foliar application of HA (1.0 g L⁻¹) can alleviate Cd toxicity and increase Cd stress tolerance in Hybrid Pennisetum, thereby lowering the potential risk of soil Cd contamination.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017LZN009cState Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Mountain Bridge and Tunnel Engineering (CN) 3aPennisetum 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3afoliar application 3ahumic acids 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3arisk 3astress tolerance 3atoxicity1 aChen, Man1 aChen, Weifeng1 aJiang, Huixin1 aYue, Xian0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2020 Aug., v. 42, no. 8 p.129-129dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33879x0137-58817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-020-03118-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04178naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016000166300001400326520240200340592002802742650002002770650001702790650002002807650002302827650002502850650002102875650001002896650002802906650002602934650001802960650001602978650001202994650002403006650001303030650001503043650001403058650001703072650001303089650002403102650001803126653003403144653001603178653002503194653001303219653001003232700001603242700001603258700001403274700001603288700002903304700002003333700001603353700001603369773008503385856008503470852000903555655001203564IND60581741020221119003417.0190403e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058174102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, M.D.10aChanges of phosphorus fractions in saline soil amended with municipal solid waste compost and mineral fertilizers in a mustard-pearl millet cropping system  ap. 32-40.  aSalinity affects phosphorus (P) fractionation and its availability in soil and thereby crop growth as well as yields. Therefore understanding of P transformation and availability in soil with use of different sources of P is crucial to adopt appropriate P management practices for improving productivity of saline soils. A field experiment comprising of four treatments replicated thrice was conducted for three consecutive years during 2012–15. Treatments consisted of control (Ct), recommended dose of N-P-K fertilizers at 60-30-30kgha−1 (RDF-100%), municipal solid waste compost at 16Mgha−1 (MSWC-16) and MSWC at 8Mgha−1+RDF-50% (MSWC-8+RDF-50%) laid out in randomized complete block design. Among different phosphorous fractions across the years; saloid-P (S-P), iron-P (Fe-P), calcium-P (Ca-P) and occluded-P (Occ-P) increased markedly after 2012–13 with continuous increase in subsequent years in all treatments compared to Ct. However, MSWC-8+RDF-50% produced significant increase in all P fractions, including Olsen-P, total-P (Pt) and inorganic-P (Pi), except S-P as compared to RDF-100%. Whereas, all P fractions progressively declined in Ct from 2012–13 to 2015, indicating continuous removal by mustard (Brassica juncea) and pearl millet (Pennisetumglaucum). MSWC-8+RDF-50% also recorded 16 and 22% higher organic-P (Po) and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALPA), respectively during 2015 over 2012–13 in corresponding treatment. Soil organic carbon (SOC) increased with RDF-100% over Ct across the years as well as within year; however, the highest SOC (5.7gkg−1) was observed with MSWC-8+RDF-50%. Mean soil salinity (electrical conductivity; EC) decreased by 38 and 25% with MSWC-8+RDF-50% and MSWC-16, respectively relative to Ct (4.8dSm−1). Relatively better P availability and lower soil EC with MSWC-8+RDF-50% and resulted significantly higher mean (of three year) grain yield of mustard (2.38Mgha−1) and pearl millet (2.44Mgha−1) over RDF-100%. Nevertheless, RDF-100% produced 11 and 15% higher mean grain yield of mustard and pearl millet, respectively than Ct. MSWC-8+RDF-50% also resulted in higher P uptake by grain of both crops as compared to RDF-100%. Our results highlighted that integrated use of organic amendment (MSWC-8) and mineral fertilizers (RDF-50%) is beneficial option for improving P availability and crop yields under saline conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aMSW composts 3aNPK fertilizers 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aelectrical conductivity 3afield experimentation 3afractionation 3agrain yield 3amillets 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil salinity 0aMunicipal solid waste compost 0aP fractions 0aPhosphatase activity 0aSalinity 0aYield1 aNarjary, B.1 aSheoran, P.1 aJat, H.S.1 aJoshi, P.K.1 aChinchmalatpure, Anil.R.1 aYadav, Gajender1 aYadav, R.K.1 aMeena, M.K.0 tCatena.g2018 Jan., v. 160 p.32-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001300162245010800175300001600283520113700299592002801436650001301464650001901477650001801496650001501514650000901529650002201538650002001560650002001580650001201600650001101612650000901623650001301632650001501645650002801660650002001688650001901708650001801727650001701745650001801762650002601780650001201806650001101818650002101829650001101850650004101861650002101902650002101923650002301944700001701967700001801984773009702002856007702099852000902176655001202185IND60083379120221120182659.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008337912DNAL7 a222813502pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-48842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmer, S.10aShort communication: Effects of feeding sweet sorghum silage on milk production of lactating dairy cows  ap. 859-863.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the feeding value of sweet sorghum silage (SS) for dairy cows compared with alfalfa silage (AS). Two diets were formulated with a 50:50 forage:concentrate ratio. Sweet sorghum silage and AS constituted 70% of the forage in each diet (dry matter basis). Twelve lactating Holstein cows in early lactation were used in a crossover experiment. Relative to AS, SS contained 58% more neutral detergent fiber and 36.6 and 72.7% less acid detergent lignin and crude protein, respectively. Milk yield (33.0 vs. 36.7kg/d) was lower for cows fed SS than for those fed AS. However, dry matter intake, energy-corrected milk, and feed efficiency were similar for both dietary treatments. Replacing AS with SS increased concentrations of milk fat (4.44 vs. 3.80%) and total solids (13.31 vs. 12.88%) and reduced concentrations of milk lactose (4.55 vs. 4.61%), milk solids-not-fat (8.88 vs. 9.08%), and milk urea nitrogen (10.0 vs. 14.0mg/dL). We concluded that replacing AS with SS had negative effects on milk yield, whereas dry matter intake, energy-corrected milk, and milk efficiency were similar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aalfalfa silage 3acrude protein 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aearly lactation 3afeed conversion 3alactose 3alignin 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritive value 3asorghum silage 3asweet sorghum 3atotal solids 3aurea nitrogen 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aSilagexanalysis 2aSorghumxchemistry1 aSéguin, P.,1 aMustafa, A.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.859-863dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-48843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002200162245010500184300001600289520145700305592002801762650001301790650001001803650001601813650001701829650001001846650001801856650002401874650002801898650002401926650001401950650002001964650003501984650002702019650001202046650003402058650003502092650001102127650002102138650001302159650003702172650000902209650003202218650004602250650003402296700001602330700001402346700001702360700002002377700001702397700002102414700001902435700001802454773009702472856007702569852000902646655001202655IND60083379220221120203834.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008337922DNAL7 a222813512pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2010-37862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamberlain, A.J.10aValidation of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with milk production traits in dairy cattle  ap. 864-875.  aSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with milk production traits found to be significant in different screening experiments, including SNP in genes hypothesized to be in gene pathways affecting milk production, were tested in a validation population to confirm their association. In total, 423 SNP were genotyped across 411 Holstein bulls, and their association with 6 milk production traits—Australian Selection Index (indicating the profitability of an animal's milk production), protein, fat, and milk yields, and protein and fat composition—were tested using single SNP regressions. Seventy-two SNP were significantly associated with one or more of the traits; their effects were in the same direction as in the screening experiment and therefore their association was considered validated. An over-representation of SNP (43 of the 423) on chromosome 20 was observed, including a SNP in the growth hormone receptor gene previously published as having an association with protein composition and protein and milk yields. The association with protein composition was confirmed in this experiment, but not the association with protein and milk yields. A multiple SNP regression analysis for all SNP on chromosome 20 was performed for all 6 traits, which revealed that this mutation was not significantly associated with any of the milk production traits and that at least 2 other quantitative trait loci were present on chromosome 20.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abulls 3achromosomes 3adairy cattle 3agenes 3aprofitability 3aprotein composition 3aquantitative trait loci 3aregression analysis 3ascreening 3aselection index 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asomatotropin receptors 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aChromosome Mappingxveterinary 2aFemale 2aGenomexgenetics 2aGenotype 2aLactationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable1 aHayes, B.J.1 aSavin, K.1 aBolormaa, S.1 aMcPartlan, H.C.1 aBowman, P.J.1 aVan Der Jagt, C.1 aMacEachern, S.1 aGoddard, M.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.864-875dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-37863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245011700209300001400326520158300340592002801923650001901951650002701970650001201997650001102009650001702020650001702037650002602054650001502080650001202095650001202107650001902119650001902138650001902157650001402176650000902190650002602199650001502225653001402240653001402254653002602268653000902294653001902303653002602322700001602348773008502364856008502449852000902534655001202543IND60581741220221119003252.0190403e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058174122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6235-226110aCarbon cycling of biological soil crusts mirrors ecological maturity along a Central European inland dune catena  ap. 68-75.  aPhotosynthesis and respiration of biological soil crusts (BSCs) sampled along a mobile inland dune catena were determined to evaluate the applicability of Odum's P/R ratio, determined under controlled conditions, for estimation of ecosystem maturity. The theory is that in the early stages of ecological succession, the total photosynthesis (P) exceeds the rate of community respiration (R), so that the P/R ratio is >1, and that P/R approaches 1 as succession occurs. In the special case of organic pollution, the P/R ratio is typically <1. Samples were collected in the deflation zone of the dune near the crest (BSC1, thickness 2–3mm), at the lee side of grass tussocks at the slope (BSC2, thickness 2–4mm) and near the base (BSC3, thickness 4–6mm). Non-crusted sand was used as control (BSC0). Photosynthesis, respiration, crust biomass, as well as fossil and allochthonous pedogenic carbon entering the system with mineral substrate were determined. The respiration of the BSC1 was dominated by the degradation of allochthonous organic matter, leading to a diminished P/R ratio. The better developed BSC2 and BSC3 were less influenced by allochthonous organic matter, where BSC maturity increased downslope with biomass increase. No significant relation between the P/R ratio and soil water tension was found. Crust carbon pools increased and flows intensified, but mineralization constants decreased with system maturation. It was concluded that Odum's P/R ratio and accumulation of recalcitrant to biodegradation organic matter are indicative for biocrust maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abiological soil crusts 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon sinks 3aecological succession 3aecosystems 3afossils 3agrasses 3amineralization 3aorganic matter 3aphotosynthesis 3apollution 3asand 3asoil matric potential 3asoil water 0aBiocrusts 0aP/R ratio 0aSurface stabilization 0aNDVI 0aPhotosynthesis 0aEcosystem development1 aVeste, Maik0 tCatena.g2018 Jan., v. 160 p.68-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009600161300001600257520144000273592002801713653001701741653003301758653002801791653002501819700001401844700001601858700001701874700001701891773012701908856007802035852000902113655001202122IND60517098220221121024252.0160328e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051709822DNAL7 a10.1139/cjpp-2013-02922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jianpo10aAtorvastatin increases endothelial progenitor cells in balloon-injured mouse carotid artery  ap. 369-374.  aHere we aimed to investigate the effects of atorvastatin on accelerated reendothelialization after carotid balloon injury. A mouse model of carotid arterial injury was established, followed by intragastric administration of atorvastatin at a dose of 0.6 mg·(kg body mass)–¹·d–¹. Pathological sections of carotid artery stained with hematoxylin and eosin were observed under light microscopy. Expression levels of eNOS mRNA and protein were detected with real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Proliferation and differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were observed after treatment, in vitro. Reendothelialization appeared on the neovascular surface, while intimal hyperplasia was inhibited after treatment with atorvastatin. Numbers of CD31-positive cells increased after atorvastatin treatment, as did the number of leucocyte antigen positive cells. The expression of cell markers, such as CD34, eNOS, and VEGF-R, were higher in the atorvastatin-treated group of mononuclear cells. EPC numbers increased with the concentration of atorvastatin. The expression of eNOS mRNA was reduced in the mice with carotid artery injury that were treated with normal saline. The expression levels of eNOS protein were increased in atorvastatin treatment group. In conclusion, atorvastatin stimulates EPCs to differentiate into endothelial cells and promotes the repair of carotid arterial injury.  aPublisher supplied data 0aatorvastatin 0aendothelial progenitor cells 0acarotid arterial injury 0areendothelialization1 aChen, Lei1 aFan, Yiling1 aJiang, Jiyao1 aWan, Jieqing0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 92, no. 5 p.369-374dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2013-02923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245007600180300001600256500000900272520121600281592002801497650001501525650001501540650001501555650001901570650002101589650001501610650001501625650000701640650002301647650002201670650002301692650002601715651001501741700001501756773014701771856009601918852000902014655001202023IND60668337020221120025645.0191125e196705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066833702DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1967.03615995003100030021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBornemisza, E.10aSulfate Movement, Adsorption, and Desorption in Three Costa Rican Soils  ap. 356-360.  aepub  aThe movement, adsorption, and desorption of sulfate was studied, using samples from the A and B horizons of three soils from Costa Rica. Water, equivalent to 509 mm, was applied to small lysimeters and the distribution of radiosulfate in the columns was determined for untreated soils and samples previously incubated with one of the following substances: (NH₄)₂SO₄, K₂SO₄, simple, or triple superphosphate. Little sulfate movement was observed. This was enhanced slightly by phosphates. Sulfate adsorption from solutions containing 100 to 1,000 ppm sulfate fit Freundlich isotherms. Very concentration-dependent adsorption was indicated for alluvial soils but little concentration-dependent adsorption was noted for latosols. Sulfate desorption by water depended greatly on soil type but was less variable when phosphate solutions were used as desorbants. Higher phosphate concentration increased desorption but the latosols retained appreciable sulfate amounts even against extraction by a 1,000-ppm phosphate solution. Some hydroxyl displacement on sulfate adsorption occurs as shown by higher pH values for K₂SO₄, soil suspensions in comparison with soil suspensions in KCl of equal normality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3aB horizons 3aadsorption 3aalluvial soils 3aammonium sulfate 3adesorption 3alysimeters 3apH 3apotassium chloride 3apotassium sulfate 3asorption isotherms 3atriple superphosphate 3aCosta Rica1 aLlanos, R.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1967 May, v. 31, no. 3 p.356-360dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1967.03615995003100030021x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245014100180300001800321520109500339592002801434650001201462650002301474650001701497650003901514650001201553650002301565650002201588650000901610653001701619653004901636653001701685653001101702700001301713773008901726856008401815852000901899655001201908IND60524431320221117224701.0161019e20160803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052443132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.06.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbeywickrama, Chathura S.10aSynthesis of fused 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives: the impact of meta-/para-substitution on fluorescence and zinc binding  ap. 3518-3522.  aA fused bis[2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole] bis(HBO) 3 was synthesized via reaction of 4,6-dihydroxyisopthalic acid with 2-amnophenol in the presence polyphosphoric acid (PPA). In bis(HBO) 3, two benzoxazol-2-yl groups are connected via meta-phenylene, in comparison with para-phenylene in its isomer 5, in order to examine the effect of regiochemistry on optical properties. UV–vis and fluorescence spectra show that bis(HBO) 3 gave emission nearly exclusively from its keto tautomer, indicating more effective ‘excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)’ than mono HBO. Bis(HBO) 3 gave blue ESIPT fluorescence (λem≈480nm), while 5 gave orange-red emission at 597nm, showing a large effect of regiochemistry on emission. The effect was further evaluated through binding with Zn2+ cation, with 3 showing spectral blue shift upon zinc binding while 5 did not. In addition, 3 revealed ability to detect different stages of zinc binding, giving different spectral response to (3)2–Zn (with 2:1 ligand-to-metal ratio) and 3–Zn species (with 1:1 ligand-to-metal ratio).  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3achemical reactions 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aisomers 3aoptical properties 3aorganic compounds 3azinc 0aFluorescence 0aExcited-state intramolecular proton transfer 0aZinc binding 0aSensor1 aPang, Yi0 tTetrahedron letters.g2016 Aug. 03, v. 57 p.3518-3522dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.06.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245018700172300001600359500001900375520216400394592002802558596004802586596006002634596007502694650001502769650001302784650002102797650001202818650001002830650001202840650001402852650001402866651001502880700002102895700002402916700005702940773010702997856008303104852000903187655001203196IND60686227120221120132644.0200721e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068622712DNAL7 a10.1007/s13199-019-00652-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrillo, Joseph D.10aFungal symbionts of the polyphagous and Kuroshio shot hole borers (Coleoptera: Scolytinae, Euwallacea spp.) in California can support both ambrosia beetle systems on artificial media  ap. 155-168.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe specificity of ambrosia beetle-fungus relationships is unknown for the vast majority of ambrosia symbioses, yet has important implications for the success of these beetles and fungi in their surrounding environments. The polyphagous shot hole borer and the Kuroshio shot hole borer (Euwallacea spp.) are invasive ambrosia beetles that exist sympatrically in California, and together with their fungi cause Fusarium Dieback in a variety of hosts. The potential for the two beetle species to exchange symbionts is unknown, but has important ecological consequences. Here we perform symbiont switching experiments, to determine if the polyphagous and Kuroshio shot hole borers can survive and reproduce on each other’s symbiotic fungi in their invasive range in California. Aposymbiotic foundresses were assessed on their ability to reproduce on each of the beetles’ primary (Fusarium spp.) and auxiliary (Graphium spp., Paracremonium pembeum) fungal symbionts, grown on sawdust-based artificial media. Offspring were collected to confirm which fungi were present in the different sexes and life stages. Additionally, the ability of aposymbiotic and non-aposymbiotic foundresses to survive and reproduce on non-ambrosial Fusarium species was tested. We found that reproduction is maximized on the beetles’ primary Fusarium symbionts, regardless of whether a beetle was paired with its own Fusarium symbiont or its congener’s, indicating that there is potential for symbiont switching in natural populations of these beetles. The addition of auxiliary fungi to treatments containing Fusarium spp. had no effect on overall offspring production, and females that were fed solely on auxiliary fungi produced significantly fewer offspring. Females that were fed non-ambrosial Fusarium species produced significantly fewer offspring than when reared on symbiotic Fusarium, and this was especially pronounced in aposymbiotic females. From our experiments, the putative roles of the primary versus auxiliary fungal symbionts, as well as the implications of these roles for beetle reproduction and development in their surrounding environment, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aCAC-66013-85cCalifornia Avocado Commission  aSCB16051cCalifornia Department of Food and Agriculture  aUSDA-APHIS AP17PPQS&T00C01cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service 3aEuwallacea 3aFusarium 3aambrosia beetles 3adieback 3afungi 3aprogeny 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis 3aCalifornia1 aDodge, Christine1 aStouthamer, Richard1 aEskalen, Akif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8829-74130 tSymbiosis.g2020 Mar., v. 80, no. 2 p.155-168dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl39183x0334-51147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-019-00652-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245006500211300001800276506007600294520087700370592002801247506003701275650001301312650002501325650001901350650001101369650002201380650001401402650001101416650001701427650001901444650001201463700002601475700002201501700001801523773011901541856008501660852000901745655001201754IND60624705820221207131946.0181206e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062470582DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btv7272doi7 aPMC58605062pmcid7 a267334512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaliez, Clovis10aVIRALpro: a tool to identify viral capsid and tail sequences  ap. 1405-1407.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMotivation: Not only sequence data continue to outpace annotation information, but also the problem is further exacerbated when organisms are underrepresented in the annotation databases. This is the case with non-human-pathogenic viruses which occur frequently in metagenomic projects. Thus, there is a need for tools capable of detecting and classifying viral sequences.

Such composite wastewater is characterized by exceedingly high total dissolved solids, total hardness, chloride and heavy metals concentrations. These water born pollutants generate reactive oxygen species which are potentially toxic to the biological system. These reactive oxygen species are normally detoxified by some enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The present study was commenced to find out the SOD and CAT activities against the oxidative stress, if any, in four macrophytes namely, Eichhornia crassipes, Pistia stratiotes, Alternanthera sessilis and Sagittarria montevidensis of contaminated ponds (Site 1 and Site 2) of EKW and an uncontaminated site (Control site). During the course of sampling the physico-chemical factors were found significantly higher in the EKW ponds compared to the control site. In the EKW sites, higher rate of evaporation during summer months caused higher elemental concentration in the premonsoon than in other seasons. This led to high activity of both SOD and CAT enzymes. In contrast, heavy rain fall in monsoon lowers the elemental concentration - mainly due to dilution effect. Present experiment indicated that in a stressed ecosystem like EKW, the wetland plants overcome the stress by altering their stress enzyme activities, hence suggesting an evidence of adaptive mechanism to thrive in a stressful environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternanthera sessilis 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aPistia stratiotes 3acatalase 3achlorides 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3aevaporation 3afish culture 3aheavy metals 3amacrophytes 3amonsoon season 3amunicipal wastewater 3aoxidative stress 3aphysicochemical properties 3aponds 3arain 3areactive oxygen species 3asummer 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atannery effluents 3atoxicity 3awater hardness 3awetland plants 3awetlands 0aEast Kolkata Wetland Ecosystem 0atannery effluent 0aoxidative stress 0asuperoxide dismutase 0acatalase1 aMondal, Priyanka1 aBhar, Subhajit1 aChattopadhyay, Buddhadeb1 aMukhopadhyay, Subhra Kumar0 tLimnological review.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 14, no. 2 p.101-108dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:2196x2300-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/limre-2014-00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002000162245016300182300001600345500001900361500000900380520045000389592002800839650001700867650001300884650001300897650001900910650000900929650001900938650002000957650001900977650001500996773012301011856009701134852000901231655001201240IND60663590220221122072821.0191122e196012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066359022DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1960.00021962005200120009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemon, Edgar R.10aPhotosynthesis Under Field Conditions.

As scientific knowledge of the health benefits of probiotics increases, it is important to identify factors that may prevent their successful integration into patient care as well as to ensure effective translation of research findings. The aim of this study was to describe maternal perspectives on probiotics and their use in infants. METHODS: Mothers with a child aged two years or younger enrolled in the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study were invited by email to complete a 29 item self-administered web-based questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 413 mothers of the 1327 contacted completed the questionnaire. The majority (99.3%) of respondents had heard of probiotics and were aware that they contained live bacteria (87.0%); 89.3% had used a product containing probiotics themselves but only 50.8% had given one to their infant. Most mothers indicated they believed that probiotics were beneficial (73.1%) and none thought they were harmful. Over a third of mothers did not feel informed enough to make a decision on whether probiotics were safe to use in infants (36.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that awareness and understanding of probiotics is high among mothers in Alberta, Canada. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the benefit of probiotics as well as safety in infants which could be important factors determining therapeutic use in the future. Further studies that demonstrate beneficial effects and safety of probiotics in healthy infants as well as targeted knowledge translation should help to address these potential concerns.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aalternative medicine 3abacteria 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adecision making 3ae-mail 3ainfants 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amothers 3anutrition 3apatient care 3apregnancy outcome 3aprobiotics 3aquestionnaires 3auncertainty 3aAlberta1 aAzad, Meghan B1 aField, Catherine J.,1 aLetourneau, Nicole1 aJohnston, David W.,1 aKaplan, Bonnie J.,1 aKozyrskyj, Anita L0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.366-366dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-3663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015500167300002000322500001900342520119600361592002801557650001501585650001401600650001101614650002101625650001701646650001101663650002001674650001101694650001301705650002301718653002801741653001901769653002001788653001801808653001901826700001601845700002601861700002001887700005701907773014601964856008502110852000902195655001202204IND60710956620221116172607.0200914e20200806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071095662DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c045712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Donglin10aHigh-Voltage and Ultrastable Aqueous Zinc–Iodine Battery Enabled by N-Doped Carbon Materials: Revealing the Contributions of Nitrogen Configurations  ap. 13769-13776.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe rechargeable aqueous zinc–iodine (Zn–I₂) battery has emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology. However, poor cycling stability caused by the dissolution of iodine species into the electrolyte limited its practical application. Herein, we report a nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) material in gram scales. Performed as an iodine host in the Zn–I₂ battery, the NPC shows a high specific capacity (345.3 mAh g–¹ at 0.2 C), superior rate capability (53.2% capacity retention at 10 C), and remarkable cycling stability (10 000 cycles at 10 C with a capacity retention of 80.9%). More importantly, DFT computations reveal that the graphitic-N (N-Q) exhibits the strongest adsorption of iodine; however, pyridinic-N (N-6) shows the weakest adsorption of iodine. Moreover, the N-6/N-Q ratio is an essential parameter that significantly determined the electrochemical performance of Zn–I₂ batteries. Therefore, the improved long-term cycling stability and rate capability of the as-designed Zn–I₂ battery are attributable to the decrease of the N-6/N-Q ratio. This work is of great significance for devolving highly reversible Zn–I₂ batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abatteries 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3aiodine 3anitrogen 3astorage technology 0aZinc−iodine batteries 0aDFT simulation 0aNitrogen doping 0aPorous carbon 0aEnergy storage1 aKumar, Anuj1 aNguyễn, Tuấn Anh,1 aNazir, M.

A mixture-amount experiment was used to determine the effects of zeatin riboside (ZR), 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on two citrus types—citrange (Citrus sinensis ‘Washington’ L. Osbeck. × Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf var. Carrizo) and sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck var. ‘Ridge Pineapple’). A liquid culture system comprising a Petri dish, cellulose filter paper, and liquid culture medium was used. Shoot regeneration experiments were conducted over 6 wk that included 2 wk in the dark followed by 4 wk in the light. Three responses were measured: (1) number of explants forming buds and/or shoots, (2) number of explants with shoots > 2 mm, and (3) overall explant and shoot quality. The effects of paper disc number, liquid medium volume, and explant size on shoot regeneration were determined. High-quality shoots were produced from explants cultured in 5.25 to 12 mL medium volume and explant sizes ranging from 2 to 15 mm. The effects of the plant growth regulators were similar for the two citrus types and were as follows: (1) use of ZR or BA resulted in high-quality shoot production; (2) ZR and BA were not synergistic; (3) culture in 20 μM ZR resulted in the highest shoot production; (4) BA and IAA were strongly synergistic, with the greatest production with BA when IAA was included in the mixture; and (5) ZR and IAA were antagonistic, particularly with Ridge Pineapple.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3abenzyladenine 3abuds 3acellulose 3aculture media 3aexplants 3ain vitro studies 3aindole acetic acid 3aliquids 3aoranges 3ashoots 3azeatin 3aWashington (state)1 aMarutani-Hert, Mizuri0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2018 Dec., v. 54, no. 6 p.658-671dSpringer USwJournal:jnl47889x1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-018-9940-z3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245015100168300001600319520114900335592002801484650002101512650001201533650001001545650001601555650001501571650001801586650001601604650002601620650001301646650001701659653003201676653000901708653003301717653000901750653002601759653001901785700001701804700001601821700001101837700001701848700001401865700001401879700001501893700001601908700001601924773009201940856009002032852000902122655001202131IND60603491620221122201551.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060349162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Sai10aSingle-component self-assembled RNAi nanoparticles functionalized with tumor-targeting iNGR delivering abundant siRNA for efficient glioma therapy  ap. 330-340.  aExisting limitations of common RNA interference (RNAi) oncotherapy severely compromised their therapeutic effects. In this study, a novel glioma-targeting RNAi system was developed. Single-component RNAi nanospheres were tactfully self-assembled in vitro, combining the carrier and cargo as a whole. An artificially synthesized polycation (pOEI) with redox-sensitive disulfides in structure condensed the RNAi nanospheres into more compacted nanoparticles. Then a novelly designed tumor-homing and penetrating cyclopeptide iNGR was further modified on the surface. iNGR modified RNAi nanoparticles demonstrated significantly enhanced accumulation in glioma site, remaining stable in circulation until the release of naked RNAi nanospheres were triggered off by the paranormal concentration of glutathione within glioma cells. Naked RNAi nanospheres were digested into abudant siRNA afterwards. Remarkable luciferase gene down-regulations have confirmed their outstanding RNAi effects. With specific design of sequences, the iNGR modified RNAi nanoparticles were supposed to be of great potential in safe and efficient glioma therapy in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3acations 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aluciferase 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3asmall interfering RNA 3asulfides 3atherapeutics 0aSelf-assembled nanoparticle 0aRNAi 0aTumor-homing and penetrating 0aiNGR 0aGlutathione triggered 0aGlioma therapy1 aJiang, Xutao1 aShi, Jiashu1 aHe, Xi1 aLi, Jianfeng1 aGuo, Yubo1 aZhang, Yu1 aMa, Haojun1 aLü, Yifei,1 aJiang, Chen0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.330-340dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015900162300001800321520200500339592002802344650002802372650002002400650001102420650001102431650001702442650001302459650001002472650002602482650002602508650001302534650001502547650001602562650000902578650001802587650001402605650003002619650002202649651001002671700001102681700001502692700001702707700001802724700001302742700005502755700001602810773013102826856008202957852000903039655001203048IND60671433020221118212748.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067143302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-019-06426-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rui10aInfection patterns, clinical significance, and genetic characteristics of Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Giardia duodenalis in dairy cattle in Jiangsu, China  ap. 3053-3060.  aThe infection patterns and clinical significance of Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Giardia duodenalis in dairy cattle remain poorly investigated despite their common occurrence. Data on the genetic diversity are also needed to understand the transmission and human-infective potential of the two pathogens. In this study, fecal specimens from 1366 dairy cattle on a large farm were examined for the presence and genotype distribution of E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis by PCR and DNA sequencing. The overall infection rates of E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis were 13.0% and 20.6%, respectively. Pre-weaned calves had significantly higher infection rates of both pathogens than post-weaned and adult cattle (P < 0.001), with peak occurrence of the pathogens in animals of 7–12 weeks. In both pre- and post-weaned calves, animals with diarrhea were 2.1–3.0 times more likely to be infected with either pathogen than those without diarrhea (P < 0.01). The E. bieneusi identified belonged to five genotypes, including J (n = 138), I (n = 21), BEB4 (n = 10), Type IV (n = 1), and a novel genotype CHC17 (n = 1). Genotype J was the dominant one in all age groups, whereas genotype I was only identified in calves of 6–11 weeks. Genotyping of G. duodenalis at three genetic loci identified assemblage E (n = 278), assemblage A (n = 2), and concurrence of the two (n = 1). Altogether, 13, 7 and 10 subtypes of assemblage E were detected at the bg, gdh, and tpi loci, respectively, forming 65 multilocus genotypes. The formation of two major clusters of MLGs in eBURST analysis indicated that intra-assemblage genetic recombination of two dominant MLGs could have led to the high genetic heterogeneity within assemblage E on a single farm. Results of this study provide much needed data on the pathogenicity of E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis in pre- and post-weaned calves. The clinical significance of the two pathogens in dairy cattle warrants further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterocytozoon bieneusi 3aGiardia lamblia 3aadults 3acalves 3adairy cattle 3adiarrhea 3afeces 3agenetic heterogeneity 3agenetic recombination 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3alarge farms 3aloci 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aChina1 aLi, Na1 aJiang, Wen1 aGuo, Yaqiong1 aWang, Xiaolan1 aJin, Yue1 aFeng, Yaoyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8380-12461 aXiao, Lihua0 tParasitology research.g2019 Oct., v. 118, no. 10 p.3053-3060dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06426-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245012400161300001600285520160400301592002801905650002301933650001801956650002401974650001901998650001202017650002302029650001002052650001502062650001402077650000902091650001102100650002402111653002002135653001902155653001002174653001302184653001702197700001802214773011302232856008102345852000902426655001202435IND60623960320221119062142.0181204e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062396032DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772145658432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMietsch, M10aNon-invasive blood pressure measurement: values, problems and applicability in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)  ap. 241-250.  aThe common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, C. j.) is an established primate model in biomedical research and for human-related diseases. Monitoring of cardiovascular parameters including blood pressure (BP) is important for the health surveillance of these experimental animals and the quantification of diseases or pharmaceutical substances influencing BP. Measurement guidelines for C. j. do not exist yet; therefore, the present study was carried out to establish a practicable protocol based on recommendations of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM). Furthermore, BP data of 49 marmosets (13.8–202.4 months of age) were obtained via high-definition oscillometry to further knowledge of physiological parameters and gender-related differences in this primate. The thighs proved to be the most suitable measurement localization, since systolic values were less variable (left 4.03 ± 2.90%, right 5.96 ± 2.77%) compared with the tail (12.7 ± 6.96%). BP values were similar in the morning and in the afternoon (P > 0.05). Data were highly reproducible within and between several sessions on three consecutive days (P > 0.05) as well as over the course of 20 months (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the measurement time for females was significantly shorter than for males (5:14 ± 1:59 min versus 6:50 ± 1:58 min, P = 0.007). Measurement recommendations for the common marmoset were successfully established. Standardized values enabled a reliable comparison of BP parameters, e.g. for cardiovascular, toxicological or metabolic research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallithrix jacchus 3aanimal models 3abiomedical research 3ablood pressure 3afemales 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amonitoring 3aprotocols 3atail 3athighs 3aveterinary medicine 0acommon marmoset 0ablood pressure 0aACVIM 0aprotocol 0anon-invasive1 aEinspanier, A0 tLaboratory animals.g2015 July, v. 49, no. 3 p.241-250dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772145658433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009700166300001600263520143000279592002801709650003201737650001601769650001701785650002201802650001901824650001001843650001101853650002701864650002701891650001101918650001001929651001101939700002701950700002601977773009002003856008102093852000902174655001202183IND50090038320221117235316.0150215e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009003832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-013-1679-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlsson, Sten10aHost-dependent genetic variation in freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.)  ap. 179-190.  aThe endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) requires brown trout or Atlantic salmon as a host to complete its life cycle. In Norway, populations have been identified using almost exclusively either salmon or trout as hosts, even when both hosts are present. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the genetic variation in freshwater pearl mussel is host-dependent. A total of 587 specimens from 25 different localities were assayed for genetic variation at eight microsatellite loci. Within populations, the trout-mussel populations had significantly lower allelic richness and expected heterozygosity than the salmon-mussel populations. The genetic differentiation among trout-mussel populations was very large (FST = 0.332), and significantly larger than among salmon-mussel populations (FST = 0.023). Host affiliation explained more of the genetic differentiation among freshwater pearl mussel populations (FCT = 0.150) than geographical location (FCT = 0.013). Collectively these results suggest that there is strong reproductive isolation between freshwater pearl mussel populations. More importantly, our results indicate that trout- and salmon-mussel populations are differently genetically structured. Because of the mandatory parasitic larval stage on trout and salmon, the host-dependent genetic variation has implications for restoration and management plans for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMargaritifera margaritifera 3aSalmo salar 3aSalmo trutta 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahosts 3alarvae 3amicrosatellite repeats 3areproductive isolation 3asalmon 3atrout 3aNorway1 aLarsen, Bjørn Mejdell1 aHindar, K.q(Kjetil),0 tHydrobiologia.g2014 Sept., v. 735, no. 1 p.179-190dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1679-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01560naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013500174300001800309520051000327592002800837650002200865650002200887650001300909650001800922700001800940700002100958700002000979700002000999700002401019773009801043856008401141852000901225655001201234IND60085589520221120085406.0141101e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008558952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2011.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamitori, Shigehiro10aCrystal structures of rare disaccharides, α-d-glucopyranosyl β-d-psicofuranoside, and α-d-galactopyranosyl β-d-psicofuranoside  ap. 1182-1185.  aThe crystal structures of α-d-glucopyranosyl β-d-psicofuranoside and α-d-galactopyranosyl β-d-psicofuranoside were determined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, refined to R₁=0.0307 and 0.0438, respectively.

In this study, we investigated the effect of isoquercitrin on lipid accumulation and its molecular mechanisms in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. METHODS: To investigate the effect of isoquercitrin on lipid accumulation, H4IIE cells were induced by FFA and the total lipid levels were detected by Oil Red O staining. Furthermore, The protein levels of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the gene expressions of transcriptional factor, lipogenic genes, and adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) were analyzed by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. To further confirm the pathway of isoquercitrin-mediated hepatic lipid metabolism, H4IIE cells were treated with an AMPK inhibitor and AdipoR1 siRNA. RESULTS: Isoquercitrin significantly enhances AMPK phosphorylation, downregulates sterol regulatory element binding protein transcription factor 1 (SREBP-1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene expressions. Pretreatment with AMPK inhibitor, significantly decreased the AMPK phosphorylation and increased FAS expression stimulated by isoquercitrin. Isoquercitrin might also upregulate the expression of AdipoR1 dose-dependently via AMPK in the presence of an AMPK inhibitor and AdipoR1 siRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Isoquercitrin appears to regulate AMPK activation, thereby enhancing AdipoR1 expression, suppressing SREBP-1 and FAS expressions, and resulting in the regulation of lipid accumulation. These results suggest that isoquercitrin is a novel dietary compound that can be potentially be used to prevent lipid metabolic disorder and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aWestern blotting 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aadipocytes 3aadiponectin receptors 3aalternative medicine 3abinding proteins 3abioactive properties 3afatty liver 3afatty-acid synthase 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3aisoquercitrin 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolic diseases 3aphosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3astaining 3asterols 3atranscription factors1 aYoshitomi, Hisae1 aLiu, Tonghua1 aZhou, Boxin1 aSun, Wen1 aQin, Lingling1 aGuo, Xiangyu1 aHuang, Liansha1 aWu, Lili1 aGao, Ming0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.42-42dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014400166520162900310592002801939650003401967650002402001650001102025650001202036650002302048650001202071650001102083650001202094650002202106650002102128650001402149650001502163650001602178650001702194650002602211650001602237650001302253650001302266650001102279650001802290650001202308650001202320650001702332650001102349700001602360700001602376700001702392700001902409700001902428773012602447856008402573852000902657655001202666IND60745464520221118091724.0210723e20210702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074546452DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae70701752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jin 10aUntargeted GC-TOFMS Analysis Reveals Metabolomic Changes in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge Leaf and Root in Response to Long-Term Drought Stress  aSalvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen) is an important traditional Chinese medicine herb. This study aimed to investigate the drought-responsive metabolic profiling in S. miltiorrhiza using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) analysis. Fifty day-old S. miltiorrhiza seedlings were treated with two (moderate drought, MD) and four weeks (high drought, HD) of withholding water. The S. miltiorrhiza leaf and root samples were prepared for the GC-TOFMS analysis. Differential metabolites with substantial changes in content in S. miltiorrhiza leaf and root were identified using multivariate and univariate statistics. A total of 178 and 157 annotated metabolites were detected in S. miltiorrhiza leaf and root, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that significantly discriminant metabolites in S. miltiorrhiza leaf by drought were associated with “galactose metabolism” and “citrate cycle”. In addition, the significantly discriminant metabolites in S. miltiorrhiza root were associated with “starch and sucrose metabolism”. Univariate statistics showed that the content of succinic acid, d-glucose, and oxoglutaric acid in S. miltiorrhiza leaf was increased by drought (fold change, FC > 1.5). Allose, d-xylose, melibiose, mannose, sorbitol, quinic acid, sinigrin, and taurine in S. miltiorrhiza root were decreased by drought (FC < 0.67). There were different metabolic profiles between S. miltiorrhiza leaf and root. However, the influence of drought stress on the pharmacological value and accumulation of bioactive constituents in S. miltiorrhiza should be further investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3aallose 3adrought 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3aleaves 3amannose 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal plants 3amelibiose 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3aquinic acid 3asinigrin 3asorbitol 3astarch 3asuccinic acid 3asucrose 3ataurine 3awater stress 3axylose1 aSu, Yuekai 1 aLi, Jingyu 1 aRen, Zhenli 1 aTian, Guoqing 1 aWang, Jianhua 0 tHorticulturae.g2021 July 02, v. 7, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae70701753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245010200175300001600277500001900293520136200312592002801674650001001702650001101712650001901723650002701742650001301769650001201782650001501794650002901809650001501838650001601853650001301869650001101882653002301893653002501916653001601941653002701957653002801984700002602012700002402038773014002062856008802202852000902290655001202299IND60728130920221121043119.0210217e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072813092DNAL7 a10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-20-00002.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFomin, Valery V.10aTrees in the Upper Treeline Ecotone in the Polar Urals: Centuries-Old Change and Spatial Patterns  ap. R32-R40.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWoody vegetation at the upper limit of its growth is a sensitive indicator of climate change. The aim of this study is to provide an analysis of the centuries-old spatiotemporal dynamics of larch trees at the upper limit of their growth (mountain massif Rai-Iz, Polar Urals, Russia). We used a ground-based method of mapping the remnants of trees that grew in the study area and died during the Little Ice Age. Aerial photographs from the 1960s and high-spatial-resolution satellite images from 2015 were used as data sources to define the locations of trees. Maps of the forest–tundra phytocoenochoras (areas of the terrain that are relatively homogeneous for one or more components of vegetation and/or other indicators) were created using a modified method of boundary detection between forest parcels with different stand densities. The proposed method of boundary detection between the main types of phytocoenochoras allowed us to identify a 15% total increase in areas of closed and open forest and areas with sparse tree growth, as well as a decrease in areas of tundra with single trees over these last decades. Using our spatiotemporal analysis of forest–tundra demographics over the last 50 years, we found that the number of trees in the ecotone had doubled. However, modern trees have not yet reached the areas occupied by trees in the past.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix 3aRussia 3aclimate change 3ademographic statistics 3aecotones 3aforests 3alandscapes 3aresearch and development 3asatellites 3atree growth 3atreeline 3atundra 0aboundary detection 0aclimate-driven shift 0aPolar Urals 0aupper treeline ecotone 0aspatiotemporal dynamics1 aMikhailovich, Anna P.1 aShiyatov, Stepan G.0 tMountain research and development.g2020 Nov. 30, v. 40, no. 2 p.R32-R40dInternational Mountain SocietywJournal:2017x0276-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-20-00002.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245018400208300001200392506007600404520061200480592002801092506003701120650002501157650001101182650001701193650002101210650001501231650002301246650002001269650001001289650001101299650000901310650003001319650004501349650001001394650001301404651001201417700002201429700002001451700001901471700002201490773009701512856004601609852000901655655001201664IND50061384520221207064238.0130327e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006138452DNAL7 a10.1186/1746-6148-8-1372doi7 aPMC35143662pmcid7 a229018622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGherman, Călin M10aFirst report of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in two threatened carnivores: the Marbled polecat, Vormela peregusna and the European mink, Mustela lutreola (Mammalia: Mustelidae)  ap. 463.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Lyme disease is a widespread cosmopolitan zoonosis caused by species belonging to the genus Borrelia.

C.10aLayer-by-Layer Fabrication of Oriented Porous Thin Films Based on Porphyrin-Containing Metal–Organic Frameworks  ap. 15698-15701.  aWe report the synthesis and characterization of two thin films (DA-MOF and L2-MOF) of porphyrin-based MOFs on functionalized surfaces using a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach. Profilometry measurements confirm that the film thickness increases systematically with number of growth cycles. Polarization excitation and fluorescence measurements indicate that the porphyrin units are preferentially oriented, while X-ray reflectivity scans point to periodic ordering. Ellipsometry measurements show that the films are highly porous. Since there are currently few methods capable of yielding microporous MOFs containing accessible free-base porphyrins, it is noteworthy that the LbL growth permits direct MOF incorporation of unmetalated porphyrins. Long-range energy transfer is demonstrated for both MOF films. The findings offer useful insights for subsequent fabrication of MOF-based solar energy conversion devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aporous media 3aporphyrins 3asolar energy1 aJin, Shengye1 aSon, Ho-Jin1 aWiederrecht, Gary P.1 aFarha, Omar K.1 aHupp, Joseph T.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Oct. 23, v. 135, no. 42 p.15698-15701dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja40787053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006300169300001600232500001900248500000900267520148800276592002801764650001301792650002201805650001001827650001701837700001901854773012201873856008301995852000902078655001202087IND60663590820221122072804.0191226e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066359082DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2001.934918x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngram, Keith T.10aSoftware for Measuring Root Characters from Digital Images  ap. 918-922.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aRoot research methods are often tedious, labor intensive, and prone to large variability. Minirhizotron technology has the potential to greatly enhance root research capabilities, but quantifying minirhizotron data is very time consuming. This note presents new software that allows rapid, accurate measurement of root length from digital images—Root Measurement System (RMS). In addition to measuring root lengths and diameters, RMS records number of roots in an image and calculates their total volume, total surface area, and length density. Ten untrained RMS users averaged 654 ± 42 s to measure the length of a 24 mm s-shaped line 10 times. The standard error of the mean for repeated length measurements was <0.1 mm for all but one of the operators. In a subsequent test with 10 different operators having various levels of experience, operators averaged a total of 2324 ± 213 s to measure the lengths and diameters of 10 images of pseudo roots made from wires. There was no significant difference among operators for total length measured, but operators did differ in lengths apportioned among 0.1-mm-diam. classes. For minirhizotron images collected in a field study, an experienced operator could analyze from 17 to 38 images h⁻¹ depending on number and length of roots in the images. With its speed, accuracy, and versatility, RMS offers the possibility to analyze sufficient numbers of minirhizotron images to allow detection of treatment effects in field research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acomputer software 3alabor 3asurface area1 aLeers, Gary A.0 tAgronomy journal.g2001 July, v. 93, no. 4 p.918-922dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2001.934918x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245013400176300001400310500001900324520071200343592002801055650001101083650001801094650002901112650001201141700001601153700002101169773013801190856008801328852000901416655001201425IND60728131020221121043253.0210217e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072813102DNAL7 a10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-20-00051.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynard, Emmanuel14aThe Interdisciplinary Centre for Mountain Research (CIRM): Fostering Transdisciplinarity for Transformation Research in Mountains  ap.

They are strongly affected by global warming, and their main economic sectors (agriculture, energy production, and tourism) strive to adapt to this and other global changes. Moreover, in a context of economic globalization, the constraints inherent to mountain regions (slope, isolation, and marginalization) make them uncompetitive in comparison with lowland or coastal regions. To address these issues in an inter- and transdisciplinary manner, and from a perspective of transformation research, the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, has created the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mountain Research, which this article presents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aglobalization 3aresearch and development 3atourism1 aOtero, Iago1 aClivaz, Mélanie0 tMountain research and development.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 40, no. 2 p.P1-P3dInternational Mountain SocietywJournal:2017x0276-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-20-00051.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245022700207300001800434520106800452592002801520650002801548650001101576650001901587650002101606650001501627650001101642650001001653650002001663650001001683650001301693651001201706700001701718700002001735700003601755700004701791700002201838700001601860700001701876700002801893700001701921773013101938856008202069852000902151655001202160IND60671433320221118212957.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067143332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-019-06432-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmhang, Gérald1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6944-747410aMolecular identification of cystic echinococcosis in humans and pigs reveals the presence of both Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto and Echinococcus canadensis G6/G7 in the hyperendemic focus of the Republic of Moldova  ap. 2857-2861.  aCystic echinococcosis is caused by the parasitic species of the complex Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. This disease is hyperendemic in the Republic of Moldova. Recent molecular analyses have revealed the exclusive presence of E. granulosus sensu stricto in sheep and cattle. Previous reports of prevalence in pigs suggest the potential presence of Echinococcus canadensis G6/G7, as this species is also reported in neighboring countries. The presence of cystic echinococcosis in pigs was specifically monitored at the slaughterhouse. In the meantime, human cases were genotyped for the first time. E. canadensis G6/G7 was identified in all ten pigs infected by E. granulosus s.l. One human case of infection by E. canadensis G6/G7 was also identified, while E. granulosus sensu stricto was found to be the cause for the 13 others. The description of one human case of E. canadensis G6/G7 has confirmed its zoonotic impact in the country. Future studies will be needed to estimate the relative proportion and distribution of both parasitic species in Moldova.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3acattle 3aechinococcosis 3aendemic diseases 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3aswine 3azoonoses 3aMoldova1 aChihai, Oleg1 aBastid, Vanessa1 aGrenouillet, Florence Elisabeth1 aErkhan, D.

The acetonitrile gels showed a reversibly photochemical phase transition; they changed into the solution under ultraviolet light (365nm), and then it was re-formed by visible light irradiation (450nm). The gel-to-solution phase transition depended on the chemical structure of the l-amino acids.

Four protein concentrates (expeller-extracted soybean meal, ESBM; 2 solvent-extracted soybean meals, SSBM1 and SSBM2; and casein) were incubated in a ruminal in vitro system treated with hydrazine and chloramphenicol to inhibit microbial uptake of protein degradation products. Proteins were weighed to give a range of N concentrations (from 0.15 to 3mg of N/mL of inoculum) and incubated with 10mL of ruminal inoculum and 5mL of buffer; fermentations were stopped after 2h by adding trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Proteins were analyzed for buffer-soluble N and buffer extracts were treated with TCA to determine N degraded at t=0 (FD0). The TCA supernatants were analyzed for ammonia (phenol-hypochlorite assay), total AA (TAA; OPA-F), and TAA plus oligopeptides (OPA-C) by flow injection analysis. Velocity of protein degradation was computed from extent of release of 1) ammonia plus free TAA or 2) ammonia plus free TAA and peptides. Rate of degradation (kd) was quantified using nonlinear regression of the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation. The parameters Kₘ (Michaelis constant) and kd (Vmax/Kₘ), where Vmax=maximum velocity, were estimated directly; kd values were adjusted (Akd) for the fraction FD0 using the equation Akd=kd − FD0/2. The OPA-C assay yielded faster degradation rates due to the contribution of peptides to the fraction degraded (overall mean=0.280/h by OPA-C and 0.219/h by OPA-F). Degradation rates for SSBM samples (0.231/h and 0.181/h) and ESBM (0.086/h) obtained by the OPA-C assay were more rapid than rates reported by the National Research Council (NRC). Both assays indicated that the 2 SSBM differed in rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) content; the more slowly degraded SSBM had RUP content (35% by OPA-C) similar to that reported by the NRC. The RUP content of ESBM (42% by OPA-C) was lower than the NRC value. Preliminary studies with 4 additional protein concentrates confirmed that accounting for peptide formation increased degradation rate; however, a trend for an interaction between assay and protein source suggested that peptide release made a smaller contribution to rate for more slowly degraded proteins. The OPA-C assay is a simple and reliable method to quantify formation of small peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abuffers 3acasein 3achloramphenicol 3acolorimetry 3aequations 3afermentation 3aflow injection analysis 3afluorometry 3ahydrazine 3anitrogen content 3aoligopeptides 3aprotein concentrates 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein metabolism 3aquantitative analysis 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3asoybean meal 3atrichloroacetic acid 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aColorimetryxmethodsxveterinary. 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFluorometryxmethodsxveterinary. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aPeptidesxmetabolism 2aReproducibility of Results 2aRumenxmetabolism 2ao-Phthalaldehydexmetabolism1 aBroderick, G.A.1 aClayton, M.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Apr., v. 94, no. 4 p.1967-1977dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/538973Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-35233Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/111721_J_Dairy_Sci_Vol_94_p_1967_1977.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245006200158300001400220520148200234592002801716650001501744650001601759650001601775650001301791650001301804650001601817650001401833650002001847650001701867650002301884650001001907650002001917650001301937650000901950650001101959650001401970650000901984650001501993650001202008653002402020653002202044653001302066653001302079653001402092700001902106700001702125700001302142700001402155700001902169773011702188856008102305852000902386655001202395IND60623960720221119062241.0181204e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062396072DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772145677482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTag, CG10aInduction of experimental obstructive cholestasis in mice  ap. 70-80.  aThe induction of experimental obstructive cholestasis is a reliable model for cholestatic liver diseases in rodents. Bile duct ligation (BDL) in mice provokes typical time-dependent morphological and structural changes in the liver, ranging from liver cell injury and elevated serum enzyme levels after several days, to a severe inflammatory response in the liver after 5–7 days, up to an advanced hepatic fibrosis as soon as three to four weeks after surgical ligation of the common biliary duct. Upon BDL induction, hepatic stellate cells become activated and transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen. In principle, the periportal fibrosis induced by BDL in rat livers is reversible. After the relief of a biliary obstruction, the liver has the capacity to revert to a nearly normal histological architecture and a fully normal biochemical function. When BDL surgery is performed by an experienced scientist, this model has very high reproducibility among all fibrotic models. All these factors corroborate the outstanding value of this model for basic and translational research in biomedicine and hepatology. Nevertheless, this model can result in significant variations when surgery is carried out by untrained personnel or when unconscious modifications are implemented that affect the quality of the intervention. A detailed protocol is provided here for the provision of reliable and reproducible BDL in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile ducts 3ablood serum 3acholestasis 3acollagen 3afibrosis 3ahepatocytes 3ahistology 3ahuman resources 3ainflammation 3alaboratory animals 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amedicine 3amice 3amodels 3aprotocols 3arats 3ascientists 3asurgery 0abiliary obstruction 0acell infiltration 0ajaundice 0afibrosis 0acirrhosis1 aWeiskirchen, S1 aHittatiya, K1 aTacke, F1 aTolba, RH1 aWeiskirchen, R0 tLaboratory animals.g2015 Apr., v. 49, no. 1_suppl p.70-80dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772145677483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100006300189245012300252300001800375506007600393520157000469592002802039506003702067650001302104650000802117650001502125650001802140650001102158650002002169650003002189650001302219650001002232650002102242650003102263650002802294650001002322650003302332650001502365650001402380650001302394650003002407650002002437700002202457700002002479773013102499856008202630852000902712655001202721IND60671433520221207104703.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067143352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-019-06414-72doi7 aPMC67543492pmcid7 a313887872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaltrušis, Paulius1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7393-852410aMolecular detection of two major gastrointestinal parasite genera in cattle using a novel droplet digital PCR approach  ap. 2901-2907.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCooperia sp. and Ostertagia sp. are two cosmopolitan parasitic nematodes often found in mixed gastrointestinal infections in cattle across temperate regions. In light of the recent increase in the emergence of anthelmintic resistance in these and other nematodes derived from cattle around the globe, and their negative impact on animal health and productivity, novel molecular assays need to be put forth in order to facilitate the monitoring of parasite burden in infected herds, using pasture and/or fecal samples. Here, we describe a novel droplet digital PCR platform–based concept for precise identification and quantification of the two most abundant and important parasite genera in grazing western European cattle. By exploiting a single nucleotide difference in the two parasites’ ITS2 sequence regions, we have developed two specific hydrolysis probes labeled with FAM™ or HEX™ fluorophores, which can not only distinguish between the DNA sequences of the two, but also quantify them in mixed DNA samples. A third, newly developed universal probe was also tested along the genus-specific probes to provide a robust and accurate reference. It was evident that the universal probe displayed congruent results to those obtained by the genus-specific probes when used with DNA from both parasites in a single sample. All in all, the results of our assay suggest that this novel protocol could be used to distinguish and quantify cattle parasites belonging to the two most important genera (i.e., Cooperia and Ostertagia) in a single mixed DNA sample.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCooperia 3aDNA 3aOstertagia 3aanthelmintics 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3adigestive system diseases 3adroplets 3afeces 3afluorescent dyes 3agastrointestinal parasites 3agastrointestinal system 3aherds 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amonitoring 3aparasites 3apastures 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atemperate zones1 aHalvarsson, Peter1 aHöglund, Johan0 tParasitology research.g2019 Oct., v. 118, no. 10 p.2901-2907dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06414-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013200168300001800300520185600318592002802174650001502202650001902217650001402236650002002250650001602270650001102286650001502297650001302312700002702325700001902352773012002371856008502491852000902576655001202585IND60624706720221122235712.0181206e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062470672DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btv7362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShavit, Yoli10aHierarchical block matrices as efficient representations of chromosome topologies and their application for 3C data integration  ap. 1121-1129.  aMotivation: Recent advancements in molecular methods have made it possible to capture physical contacts between multiple chromatin fragments. The resulting association matrices provide a noisy estimate for average spatial proximity that can be used to gain insights into the genome organization inside the nucleus. However, extracting topological information from these data is challenging and their integration across resolutions is still poorly addressed. Recent findings suggest that a hierarchical approach could be advantageous for addressing these challenges. Results: We present an algorithmic framework, which is based on hierarchical block matrices (HBMs), for topological analysis and integration of chromosome conformation capture (3C) data. We first describe chromoHBM, an algorithm that compresses high-throughput 3C (HiT-3C) data into topological features that are efficiently summarized with an HBM representation. We suggest that instead of directly combining HiT-3C datasets across resolutions, which is a difficult task, we can integrate their HBM representations, and describe chromoHBM-3C, an algorithm which merges HBMs. Since three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction can also benefit from topological information, we further present chromoHBM-3D, an algorithm which exploits the HBM representation in order to gradually introduce topological constraints to the reconstruction process. We evaluate our approach in light of previous image microscopy findings and epigenetic data, and show that it can relate multiple spatial scales and provide a more complete view of the 3D genome architecture.

Plants of the cultivar ‘Silver and Gold’ were transplanted into pots either with added mycorrhizal inoculum or without inoculum and assigned to four phosphorus treatments. Mycorrhizal colonization was assessed by evaluating the frequency of colonization, intensity of colonization and density of fungal structures (arbuscules, vesicles, coils and microsclerotia) in the roots. During the growing season, the content of plant available phosphorus in the soil was analyzed, and shoot length, number of shoots, number of inflorescences, number of flowers and flowering time were evaluated. Inoculated Ajania plants were successfully colonized with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytic fungi. In the root segments, hyphae were mainly observed, as well as vesicles, coils, arbuscules and microsclerotia, but in lower density. The density of fungal structures did not differ among phosphorus treatments, but did differ between years, with a higher density of fungal structures in 2016. Mycorrhizal plants developed higher number of shoots in 2016, higher number of inflorescences, higher number of flowers, and they flowered longer compared to uninoculated plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum pacificum 3acultivars 3aendophytes 3ahyphae 3ainoculum 3aphosphorus 3asclerotia 3asoil 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aLikar, Matevz 1 aOsterc, Gregor 0 tHorticulturae.g2021 July 03, v. 7, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae70701783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245007100174300001600245520185200261592002802113650001802141650001002159650002002169650001602189650001702205650002002222650001902242650002502261650000902286650001802295650001402313650001702327653002002344653002102364653002002385653001802405700001902423700001902442700002002461700002102481700001902502700001702521700002002538700002002558700001602578773009202594856009002686852000902776655001202785IND60603492120221122054138.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060349212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ga Young10aHyaluronic acid nanoparticles for active targeting atherosclerosis  ap. 341-348.  aFor the effective diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis, there is a pressing need to develop the carrier which can specifically deliver the agents to the pathological site. Since the representative hallmark of atherosclerosis in its pathogenic process is the over-expression of the receptors for hyaluronic acid (HA) such as stabilin-2 and CD44, we herein investigated the potential of HA nanoparticles (HA-NPs) as the carrier for active targeting atherosclerosis. From in vitro cellular uptake tests, it was revealed that HA-NPs were selectively taken up by the cells over-expressing stabilin-2 or CD44. On the other hand, the cellular uptake of HA-NPs was drastically reduced when the cells were pre-treated with excess amount of free HA, implying that HA-NPs were taken up by the receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following systemic administration of Cy5.5-labeled NPs into the ApoE-deficient mice as the animal model, the atherosclerotic legion was assessed at 24 post-injection by using the optical imaging system. Interestingly, the fluorescent signal of the atherosclerotic lesion by HA-NPs was much stronger than that of the normal aorta. Three dimensional z-stack images of an atherosclerotic plaque indicated the even distribution of HA-NPs in the atherosclerotic legion. It was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that HA-NPs were co-localized with the HA receptors including stabilin-2 and CD44. In addition, the amount of HA-NPs, accumulated in the atherosclerotic lesion, was much higher than that of HGC-NPs, known to reach the atherosclerotic lesion by the passive targeting mechanism. Overall, it was evident that HA-NPs could effectively reach the atherosclerotic lesion via the active targeting mechanism after systemic administration, implying their high potential as the carrier for diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aaorta 3aatherosclerosis 3aendocytosis 3afluorescence 3ahyaluronic acid 3aimage analysis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amice 3ananoparticles 3areceptors 3atherapeutics 0aHyaluronic acid 0aActive targeting 0aAtherosclerosis 0aNanoparticles1 aKim, Chong-ho,1 aChoi, Ki Young1 aYoon, Hong Yeol1 aKim, Kwangmeyung1 aKwon, Ick Chan1 aChoi, Kuiwon1 aLee, Byung-Heon1 aPark, Jae Hyung1 aKim, In-San0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.341-348dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245005400207300001600261520063800277592002800915650001700943650002300960650001300983650002700996650001901023650001601042653001201058653002501070653002901095653001601124700002701140700001801167700001901185700001701204700002401221700006201245700006101307700001901368773010601387856008701493852000901580655001201589IND60611243920221119004233.0201202e20181020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061124392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Lizhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7094-330910aControl of local wetting by microscopic particles  ap. 615-620.  aWe perform experiments to investigate how particles of micro-meter size modify the wetting of a completely wettable solid surface. The motion of a macroscopic contact line (MCL) is observed to be altered in the region surrounding the particles. The MCL is accelerated locally by a single particle to advance approximately 10 times faster than that in the absence of the particle. Different geometrical arrangements of particles produce different wetting speeds and different MCL shapes through multiple MCL-particle interactions. These results suggest a method to control the wetting without surface patterning by chemical treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceleration 3achemical treatment 3acolloids 3aliquid-solid interface 3amicroparticles 3awettability 0aWetting 0aMicroscopic particle 0aMacroscopic contact line 0aInteraction1 aYoshikawa, Harunori N.1 aKondo, Daichi1 aOgawa, Tetsuya1 aKiriki, Mayu1 aZoueshtiagh, Farzam1 aMotosuke, Masahiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6961-03821 aKaneko, Toshihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6895-57221 aUeno, Ichirō,0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 20, v. 555 p.615-620dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245006000214300001600274506007600290520168400366592002802050506003702078650000802115650001502123650001502138650000802153650002602161650002702187650001302214650002202227650002202249650001102271650001502282650001302297653001902310653002302329653001402352700002502366773022902391856008202620852000902702655001202711IND60530635320221207055945.0180905e20160520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053063532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2016.04.0082doi7 aPMC57088522pmcid7 a272100422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaeussler, Maximilian10aGenome Editing with CRISPR-Cas9: Can It Get Any Better?  ap. 239-250.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe CRISPR-Cas revolution is taking place in virtually all fields of life sciences. Harnessing DNA cleavage with the CRISPR-Cas9 system of Streptococcus pyogenes has proven to be extraordinarily simple and efficient, relying only on the design of a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) and its co-expression with Cas9. Here, we review the progress in the design of sgRNA from the original dual RNA guide for S. pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SpCas9 and SaCas9). New assays for genome-wide identification of off-targets have provided important insights into the issue of cleavage specificity in vivo. At the same time, the on-target activity of thousands of guides has been determined. These data have led to numerous online tools that facilitate the selection of guide RNAs in target sequences. It appears that for most basic research applications, cleavage activity can be maximized and off-targets minimized by carefully choosing guide RNAs based on computational predictions. Moreover, recent studies of Cas proteins have further improved the flexibility and precision of the CRISPR-Cas toolkit for genome editing. Inspired by the crystal structure of the complex of sgRNA-SpCas9 bound to target DNA, several variants of SpCas9 have recently been engineered, either with novel protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) or with drastically reduced off-targets. Novel Cas9 and Cas9-like proteins called Cpf1 have also been characterized from other bacteria and will benefit from the insights obtained from SpCas9. Genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 may also progress with better understanding and control of cellular DNA repair pathways activated after Cas9-induced DNA cleavage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aRNA 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3abacteria 3acomputer software 3acrystal structure 3agenome 3aprediction 3aproteins 0aGenome editing 0aCRISPR-Cas9 system 0aGuide RNA1 aConcordet, Jean-Paul0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2016 May 20, v. 43, no. 5 p.239-250dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2016.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245015600169300001600325520169900341536004102040592002802081650001302109650002202122650003202144650001002176650002102186650001302207650002102220650001802241650001002259650002002269650001102289650001302300650002002313650003102333650003102364650001602395653004202411653002002453653001502473653001402488653002502502700002402527700002002551700001702571700001902588700002602607773011602633856008002749852000902829655001202838IND60624277920221120032357.0181202e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062427792DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336145228322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaga, Mradul Kumar10aStudy of Body Composition, Lung Function, and Quality of Life Following Use of Anabolic Steroids in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  ap. 238-245.  aBackground: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by irreversible airflow limitation and is associated with weight loss and decreased muscle strength and exercise capacity. Methods: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial of 32 male COPD patients (age, 54.94 ± 11.27 years) was carried out to assess effects of anabolic steroid in terms of a daily high-protein, high-calorie diet alone or one combined with anabolic steroids on body composition, lung function, and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Outcomes were assessed by anthropometric and spirometric measurements, peak expiratory flow rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), hand grip test, and HRQL index scores. Measurements were made at baseline and end of treatment (6 weeks). Results: All patients showed significant difference (P < .001) in pulmonary function parameters and anthropometric measurements after 6 weeks of intervention (within-group changes); however, no significant improvement occurred in the pulmonary function parameters between the groups. The difference in exercise capacity (6MWT) and HRQL scores in the treatment group were statistically significant (P < .001) compared with control group after 6 weeks of intervention. In the treatment group, the average 6MWT distance increased from 213.5 m to 268.5 m at 6-week follow-up, and HRQL scores increased from 101.25 to 118.45. Also, HRQL and 6MWT parameters were positively correlated in response to steroid supplementation at the end of the study. Conclusion: Weekly administration of anabolic steroids during 6 weeks increased exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with COPD.  aFinancial disclosure: None declared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aanabolic steroids 3aanthropometric measurements 3ablood 3abody composition 3aexercise 3ahigh energy diet 3alung function 3amales 3amuscle strength 3aoxygen 3apatients 3aquality of life 3arandomized clinical trials 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aweight loss 0achronic obstructive pulmonary disease 0aanabolic agents 0anandrolone 0anutrition 0anutrition assessment1 aKhan, Naushad Ahmad1 aMalhotra, Varun1 aSuman Kumar,1 aMawari, Govind1 aHira, Harmanjit Singh0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 29, no. 2 p.238-245dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336145228323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245008900171520164600260592002801906650002101934650002901955650001601984650001502000650001502015650001602030650001502046650001202061650002302073650001502096650001702111650001802128650001702146650001902163650001202182650001902194650001402213650001102227650001802238650001102256653001702267653001502284653001602299653003702315653003502352653002902387700002602416700001302442700001502455700001502470773007702485856008002562852000902642655001202651IND60519751320221118131237.0160701e20160211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051975132DNAL7 a10.1515/bioeth-2016-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-García, J.M.10aEthanol production from olive stone hydrolysates by xylose fermenting microorganisms  aOlive stones are the main solid byproducts obtained from olive oil production and from table olives production. As a lignocellulosic material, the use of olive stones for ethanol and other chemicals production has been proposed, particularly under the biorefinery concept. As part of such a process, this work deals with the fractionation of the lignocellulosic material by dilute acid autoclave pretreatment at 2% sulfuric acid, 130°C, 60 min and 1:1 liquid to solid ratio. Moreover, the work addresses the fermentation of the liquors obtained after pretreatment. The released sugars are composed mainly by xylose and other hemicellulosic sugars. The fermentation performance of three xylose-fermenting microorganisms, e.g. two Escherichia coli species and Scheffersomyces stipitis, are compared. The study analyzes in a first step the microorganism behavior on synthetic liquors, with a similar composition to that of the real liquors. Finally, and taken into account the results from the previous steps, the real liquor obtained from olive stones pretreatment is fermented. Results show that E. coli MM160 is the best ethanol producer out of the three microorganisms studied. Globally, the pretreatment produced a liquor containing 140 g hemicellulosic sugars/l and requiring firstly dilution by 50% and a detoxification step by overliming. The fermentation of this liquor by E. coli MM160 results in a 25 g ethanol/l solution equivalent to 50 g ethanol/kg olive stone, in spite of 20 g acetic acid/l also present. These results confirm both olive stones and E. coli MM160 as promising feedstock and microorganism for ethanol production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3aacetic acid 3aautoclaves 3abioethanol 3abiorefining 3abyproducts 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3afractionation 3ahydrolysates 3alignocellulose 3aliquids 3amicroorganisms 3aolive oil 3aolives 3asulfuric acid 3axylose 0aOlive stones 0abioethanol 0abiorefinery 0axylose fermenting microorganisms 0aethanologenic Escherichia coli 0aScheffersomyces stipitis1 aMartínez-Patiño, C.1 aRuiz, E.1 aRomero, I.1 aCastro, E.0 tBioethanol.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 2, no. 1dDe Gruyter Openx2299-67887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bioeth-2016-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01424naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001700187245007200204300001800276506007600294520018000370592002800550506003700578650001600615650001100631650002500642700001700667700002100684700003500705700002100740700001700761700002200778700002200800773012700822856008000949852000901029655001201038IND60120318920221207135349.0150202e20141224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012031892DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.01284-142doi7 aPMC42638372pmcid7 a255026752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Jamie10aFull Genome Sequence of a Reassortant Human G9P[4] Rotavirus Strain  ap. e01284-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis is a report of the complete genomic sequence of a reassortant rotavirus group A G9-P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E6-H2 strain designated RVA/Human-wt/USA/ LB1562/2010/G9P[4].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRotavirus A 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences1 aRoy, Sunando1 aEsona, Mathew D.1 aMijatovic-Rustempasic, Slavica1 aHardy, Christine1 aWang, Yuhuan1 aCortese, Margaret1 aBowen, Michael D.0 tGenome announcements.g2014 Dec. 24, v. 2, no. 6 p.e01284-14-e01284-14dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx2169-82877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/genomeA.01284-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009400169300001800263520081200281592002801093650001601121650001401137650002701151650001701178650000901195650001001204650002001214700002401234700001801258700002001276700002401296700002101320700002101341700002201362700001701384700001701401700002201418700001601440700003101456700002301487700002101510700002701531700002001558700002101578773011801599856008201717990002301799852000901822655001201831IND60091255320221119043828.0141103e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009125532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.10.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercer, Swati P.10aDiscovery of 2,5-diarylnicotinamides as selective orexin-2 receptor antagonists (2-SORAs)  ap. 6620-6624.  aThe orexin (or hypocretin) system has been identified as a novel target for the treatment of insomnia due to the wealth of biological and genetic data discovered over the past decade. Recently, clinical proof-of-concept was achieved for the treatment of primary insomnia using dual (OX₁R/OX₂R) orexin receptor antagonists. However, elucidation of the pharmacology associated with selective orexin-2 receptor antagonists (2-SORAs) has been hampered by the lack of orally bioavailable, highly selective small molecule probes. Herein, the discovery and optimization of a novel series of 2,5-diarylnicotinamides as potent and orally bioavailable orexin-2 receptor selective antagonists is described. A compound from this series demonstrated potent sleep promotion when dosed orally to EEG telemetrized rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3achemistry 3aelectroencephalography 3apharmacology 3arats 3asleep 3asleep disorders1 aRoecker, Anthony J.1 aGarson, Susan1 aReiss, Duane R.1 aMeacham Harrell, C.1 aMurphy, Kathy L.1 aBruno, Joseph G.1 aBednar, Rodney A.1 aLemaire, Wei1 aCui, Donghui1 aCabalu, Tamara D.1 aTang, Cuyue1 aPrueksaritanont, Thomayant1 aHartman, George D.1 aYoung, Steven D.1 aWinrow, Christopher J.1 aRenger, John J.1 aColeman, Paul J.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 23, no. 24 p.6620-6624dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.10.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010900165300001800274500001900292520249500311592002802806596005902834650001502893650001502908650001902923650002002942650001202962650002402974650000702998650001203005650002203017650002003039650000903059650001203068650001103080650001903091650001803110650002103128700001603149700001303165700001403178700001103192700001303203700001803216773013703234856008203371852000903453655001203462IND60690469520221120071758.0200426e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069046952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-020-02597-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yuting10aInfluence of silicon on cadmium availability and cadmium uptake by rice in acid and alkaline paddy soils  ap. 2343-2353.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: The aim of this research was to study the inhibiting effects of cadmium uptake into plants by exogenous silicon between acid and alkaline paddy soils, especially, the effects of silicon without the differentiation of pH and accompanying ions. Therefore, without the interference of pH and accompany ions (Na⁺), the mechanisms of soil chemistry on cadmium (Cd) transformation and accumulation by Si application in the soil-plant system were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The acid and alkaline soils for the experiment were collected from the upper soil layer (0~20 cm) from two paddy fields. The Cd solution as CdNO₃ and different levels of SiO₂ as Na₂SiO₃ solutions were applied in the potted soils. To eliminate differences of nitrate and sodium among the treatments, 6.8, 6.8, and 1.7 g sodium nitrate was added into the CK, Si0Cd5, and Si90Cd5 treatments, respectively. The soil redox potential and pH during the experiments were determined. After harvest, changes in Cd concentrations in rice grains, stems, and roots were measured. Soil samples in close proximity to the rice roots were collected at harvest. The sequential extraction was employed to estimate the chemical speciation of Cd in the treated soils. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The Si applications reduced Cd accumulation in rice plants, thereby increasing the rice yield. With increase of the dosages, the ratios of Cd contents in root, stem, and grain decreased significantly. The Eh and pH of the Si treatments were higher than application of Cd only. In the alkaline soil, Cd contents in the soil solutions of the Si treatments were higher than the Si0Cd5 treatment. In contrast, in the acid soil, the Cd contents in the soil solution of the Si treatments were lower than that Si0Cd5 treatment. In the acid soil, Si application improved the Cd adsorption by soil and alleviated Cd uptake by plants. Therefore, the alkaline soil reduced Cd phytoavailability by forming Si-Cd water-soluble complex, which could not be taken up by rice plants. CONCLUSIONS: The Si application significantly increased yield of rice and decreased Cd concentrations in the roots, stems, and grains of rice plants. In the alkaline soil, Cd and Si formed the Si-Cd water-soluble complex, which could not be taken up by the rice plants. In both soils, Si reduced the concentrations of acid extractable Cd and reducible Cd while promoting the formation of oxidable Cd and residual Cd, resulting in low soil Cd bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data  a41371306cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aacid soils 3aadsorption 3aalkaline soils 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3achemical speciation 3apH 3apaddies 3aphytoaccumulation 3aredox potential 3arice 3asilicon 3asodium 3asodium nitrate 3asoil solution 3awater solubility1 aLiu, Mingda1 aGuo, Lei1 aYang, Dan1 aHe, Na1 aYing, Bo1 aWang, Yaojing0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2020 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.2343-2353dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02597-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245009900159300001600258520140400274592002801678650001801706650001501724650001801739650001601757650001901773650002601792650002401818650002601842650002301868650001001891650002101901650001301922650002501935650001201960650001501972650002701987650001402014650002402028650001702052650002202069651001002091653001902101653004202120653001802162700002002180773012402200856007802324852000902402655001202411IND60758034420221117042116.0211125s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075803442DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2020-05902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Limin10aSoil microbial community composition in a paddy field with different fertilization managements  ap. 864-874.  aMicrobes play vital roles in soil quality; however, their response to N (nitrogen) and P (phosphorus) fertilization in acidic paddy soils of subtropical China remains poorly understood. Here, a 10-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different fertilization treatments on microbial communities by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The results showed that different fertilization treatments did not exert a significant effect on microbial alpha diversity, but altered soil properties, and thus affected microbial community composition. The microbial communities in the T₁ (optimized N and P fertilizer) and T₂ (excessive N fertilizer) treated soils differed from those in the T₀ (no N and P fertilizer) and T₃ (excessive P fertilizer) treated soils. In addition, the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria, and the fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota dominated all the fertilized treatments. Soil total potassium (TK) concentration was the most important factor driving the variation in bacterial community structure under different fertilization regimes, while the major factors shaping fungal community structure were soil TN and NO₃–-N (nitrate N). These findings indicate that optimization of N and P application rates might result in variations in soil properties, which changed the microbial community structure in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3aChloroflexi 3aProteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3afield experimentation 3afungal communities 3afungi 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apaddies 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apotassium 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil quality 3aspecies diversity 3aChina 0aillumina Miseq 0anitrogen and phosphorus fertilization 0asoil property1 aHuang, Dongfeng0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2021, v. 67, no. 12 p.864-874dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44722x1480-32757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2020-05903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01494naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245006300172300001600235520055400251592002800805650002700833650002000860650001700880650001100897650001700908650001000925650001000935650001400945651001500959700002200974773010300996856004801099852000901147655001201156IND4476690120221122060809.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447669012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-012-0222-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHathurusingha, Subhash10aCalophyllum inophyllum: recalcitrant or intermediate seed?  ap. 103-107.  aWe studied seed storage behaviour of a multipurpose tree Calophyllum inophyllum (Clusiaseae).

C. inophyllum seeds maintained their viability for an appreciable period (> 8 months) if stored in warmer environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalophyllum inophyllum 3achilling injury 3acold storage 3adrying 3aseed storage 3aseeds 3atrees 3aviability 3aQueensland1 aAshwath, Nanjappa0 tJournal of forestry research.g2012 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.103-107dSpringer-Verlagx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-012-0222-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008300174300001400257520196800271592002802239650001302267650001602280650001902296650002802315650001502343650001402358650002302372650001202395650002102407650002202428650002602450650001002476650002402486650002102510650003402531650001702565650000902582650002402591650003702615650001502652700002002667700003002687700002002717700002102737700002002758773011702778856008602895852000902981655001202990IND60561343120221122135746.0180831e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056134312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngeloni, Cristina10a17β-Estradiol enhances sulforaphane cardioprotection against oxidative stress  ap. 26-36.  aThe lower incidence of ischemic heart disease in female with respect to male gender suggests the possibility that female sex hormones could have specific effects in cardiovascular protection. 17β-Estradiol is the predominant premenopausal circulating form of estrogen and has a protective role on the cardiovascular system. Recent evidences suggest that gender can influence the response to cardiovascular medications; therefore, we hypothesized that sex hormones could also modulate the cardioprotective effects of nutraceutical compounds, such as the isothiocyanate sulforaphane, present in Brassica vegetables. This study was designed to explore the protective effects of sulforaphane in the presence of 17β-estradiol against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in primary cultures of rat cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, 17β-estradiol enhanced sulforaphane protective activity against H2O2-induced cell death with respect to sulforaphane or 17β-estradiol alone as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase assays. Moreover, 17β-estradiol boosted sulforaphane ability to counteract oxidative stress, reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine levels and increasing the expression of phase II enzymes. Using specific antagonists of estrogen receptor α and β, we observed that these effects are not mediated by estrogen receptors. Otherwise, ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways seem to be involved, as the presence of specific inhibitors of these kinases reduced the protective effect of sulforaphane in the presence of 17β-estradiol. Sulforaphane and 17β-estradiol co-treatment counteracted cell morphology alterations induced by H2O2 as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that estrogens could enhance sulforaphane protective effects, suggesting that nutraceutical efficacy might be modulated by sex hormones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica 3aantagonists 3acardiomyocytes 3acardioprotective effect 3acell death 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3afemales 3afunctional foods 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amales 3amyocardial ischemia 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3apremenopause 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avegetables1 aTeti, Gabriella1 aBarbalace, Maria Cristina1 aMalaguti, Marco1 aFalconi, Mirella1 aHrelia, Silvana0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2017 Apr., v. 42 p.26-36dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245011000162300001600272520073900288592002801027650001001055650001801065650002001083650002101103650001301124650000701137650002001144653001801164653001801182653002001200653000901220653003801229700001901267700001401286700001901300773011401319856008601433852000901519655001201528IND60088048120221118000431.0190318e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008804812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.01.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Lu10aReversible pH-responsive aggregates based on the self-assembly of functionalized POSS and hyaluronic acid  ap. 444-448.  aWe report here the self-assembly of reversible pH intelligent aggregate from natural polysaccharide hyaluronic acid and functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with tertiary amines and hydroxyls (POSS-AH).

It was found that an optimal lipophilicity for the formation of methemoglobin (metHb) in vitro existed for alkyl analogues of PAPP (aminophenones 1–20; compound 6 metHb%=74.1±2). Besides lipophilicity, this structural sub-class suggested there were certain structural requirements for activity, with both branched (10–16) and cyclic (17–20) alkyl analogues exhibiting inferior in vitro metHb induction. Of the four candidates (compounds 4, 6, 13 and 23) evaluated in vivo, 4 exhibited the greatest toxicity. In parallel, aminophenone bioisosteres, including oximes 30–32, sulfoxide 33, sulfone 34 and sulfonamides 35–36, were found to be inferior metHb inducers to lead ketone 4. Closer examination of Hammett substituent constants suggests that a particular combination of the field and resonance parameters may be significant with respect to the redox mechanisms behind PAPPs metHb toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrophobicity 3aoximes 3arodenticides 3asulfonamides 3atoxicity1 aConole, Daniel1 aTingle, Malcolm D.1 aYang, Junpeng1 aEason, C.

Functioning primarily as a transcriptional factor, MYC interacts with a large number of proteins, and identification and characterization of MYC-interacting proteins are important for understanding how MYC functions. In this study, we used different systems to demonstrate that a novel zinc finger transcription factor, ZNF121, physically interacted with MYC, and the interaction involved their N-terminal regions. Overexpression of ZNF121 increased, while its knockdown decreased, the expression of MYC in multiple epithelial cell lines, and MYC had similar effects on ZNF121 expression. An expression correlation was also detectable in a panel of epithelial cell lines and a cohort of human breast cancer tissues. Functionally, knockdown of ZNF121 in several breast epithelial cell lines attenuated the expressions of MYC and its target genes (e.g., EGR1, CDC2, and nucleolin) and slowed cell proliferation, accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and expression alteration of cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1, p14 and p21). Analysis of publically available databases showed that ZNF121 expression is up-regulated in human breast cancer, and the up-regulation significantly associates with worse patient survival in the luminal A subtype of breast cancer. These findings establish ZNF121 as a MYC-interacting protein with functional effects on MYC and cell proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3adatabases 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3aoncogene proteins 3apatients 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif 0aZNF121 0aMYC 0aCell proliferation1 aZhang, Xuan1 aFu, Liya1 aZhu, Zhengmao1 aDong, Jin-Tang0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2016 Dec. 20, v. 43, no. 12 p.677-685dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2016.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007900167300001600246520147800262592002801740596004201768650002401810650002601834650001101860650001501871650002501886650001101911650000901922650002501931650002401956650002401980650001902004650001102023700003102034700002302065700002202088700001702110700005902127773012802186856008202314852000902396655001202405IND60690469920221120092717.0200426e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069046992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-020-09740-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValoy, Mariana10aLeaf herbivory modulates fruit trait correlations within individual plants  ap. 373-385.  aPlant performance is based on the relationship between resource acquisition and allocation to complete essential functions. Herbivory causes compromises in resource allocation that impact at the plant and within-plant (sub-individual) levels. This impacts fruit display traits which in turn affect reproductive success and seed dispersal. Because leaf damage affects resource allocation, herbivory should modulate the relationship between fruit display traits. We explore the relation between the level of leaf herbivory (mean damage and coefficient of variation) and fruit display traits in Vassobia breviflora (Solanaceae). According to trait function, we explore relationships between reproductive traits (seed number and weight), reward traits (sugar concentration, pulp weight), and relationships between reproductive and reward traits. We found no effect of herbivory on the correlation between reproductive traits, but an effect was found on the correlation between rewards traits. In conclusion, herbivory affects the correlation between fruit traits, and the magnitude and direction of the association between traits vary according to the magnitude and variation of the damage at the within-plant level. In evolutionary terms, our results suggest that within-plant variation in leaf traits would constitute a strategy to resolve allocation conflicts derived from damage and to maintain fruit display characteristics that favor the interaction with seed dispersers.  aPublisher supplied data  aPIP11420110100395cCONICET, Argentina 3aVassobia breviflora 3afruit characteristics 3afruits 3aherbivores 3aleaf characteristics 3aleaves 3apulp 3areproductive success 3areproductive traits 3aresource allocation 3aseed dispersal 3asugars1 aLópez-Acosta, Juan Carlos1 aLomáscolo, Silvia1 aBernacki, Facundo1 aVarela, Omar1 aOrdano, Mariano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0962-973X0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2020 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.373-385dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4130426x1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-020-09740-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013100171520102100302592002801323650002401351650003201375650001501407650003101422650001101453650001301464653003101477653002401508653002201532653002501554653001401579700001901593700001901612700001601631700002301647700002601670700002401696773010601720856008701826852000901913655001201922IND60730767420221122234503.0211106e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073076742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1249712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Mostafa10aAnaerobic degradation of digestate based hydrothermal carbonization products in a continuous hybrid fixed bed anaerobic filter  aThis study investigates the suitability of continuous hybrid fixed bed anaerobic filter reactor for treating sewage and agro-industrial digestate hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) products; hydrochar and HTC liquor (HTCL).

As new data and quality improvement initiatives highlight the importance of nutrition and a generation of nutrition experts retire, there is a need for new physician educators and leaders in clinical nutrition. Traditional nutrition fellowships and increased didactic lecture time in school and postgraduate training are not feasible strategies to develop the next generation of physician nutrition specialists in the current environment. One strategy is the development of short immersion courses for advanced trainees and junior attendings. The most promising courses include a combination of close mentorship and adult learning techniques such as lectures, clinical experiences, literature review, curricular development, research and writing, multidisciplinary interactions, and extensive group discussion. These courses also allow the opportunity for advanced discourse, development of long-term collaborative relationships, and continued longitudinal career development for alumni after the course ends. Despite these curricular developments, ultimately the field of nutrition will not mature until the American Board of Medical Specialties recognizes nutrition medicine with specialty board certification.  aFinancial disclosure: None declared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult learning 3acareer development 3acertification 3aclinical nutrition 3aexperts 3amedicine 3anutrition education 3anutritionists 3aphysicians 3aUnited States 0aprofessional education 0amedical education 0agraduate medical education 0acertification 0anutritional support1 aMcClave, Stephen,1 aNeel, Dustin1 aEvans, David C.1 aMartindale, Robert G.1 aHurt, Ryan T.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 29, no. 3 p.332-337dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336145252123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010200162300001600264520150300280592002801783650001201811650001501823650001301838650001901851650004201870650001701912650002701929650002101956650001201977650003001989650003502019653003802054653002802092653003102120653007902151700001202230700001702242700001502259700001502274700001302289700001702302700001502319700001802334700001502352700001402367700001702381700001902398700001402417700001402431700001602445773023102461856008202692852000902774655001202783IND60530636020221120230725.0180905e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053063602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2016.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Yixin10aClinical applications of MARSALA for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy  ap. 541-547.  aConventional PCR methods combined with linkage analysis based on short tandem repeats (STRs) or Karyomapping with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, have been applied to preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosome recessive disorder. However, it has limitations in SMA diagnosis by Karyomapping, and these methods are unable to distinguish wild-type embryos with carriers effectively. Mutated allele revealed by sequencing with aneuploidy and linkage analyses (MARSALA) is a new method allowing embryo selection by a one-step next-generation sequencing (NGS) procedure, which has been applied in PGD for both autosome dominant and X-linked diseases in our group previously. In this study, we carried out PGD based on MARSALA for two carrier families with SMA affected children. As a result, one of the couples has given birth to a healthy baby free of mutations in SMA-causing gene. It is the first time that MARSALA was applied to PGD for SMA, and we can distinguish the embryos with heterozygous deletion (carriers) from the wild-type (normal) ones accurately through this NGS-based method. In addition, direct mutation detection allows us to identify the affected embryos (homozygous deletion), which can be regarded as probands for linkage analysis, in case that the affected family member is absent. In the future, the NGS-based MARSALA method is expected to be used in PGD for all monogenetic disorders with known pathogenic gene mutation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aaneuploidy 3achildren 3aheterozygosity 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahomozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amuscular atrophy 3aparents 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aPreimplantation genetic diagnosis 0aSpinal muscular atrophy 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aMutated allele revealed by sequencing with aneuploidy and linkage analyses1 aZhi, Xu1 aZhu, Xiaohui1 aHuang, Jin1 aLian, Ying1 aLi, Rong1 aJin, Hongyan1 aZhang, Yan1 aZhang, Wenxin1 aNie, Yanli1 aWei, Yuan1 aLiu, Zhaohui1 aSong, Donghong1 aLiu, Ping1 aQiao, Jie1 aYan, Liying0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 43, no. 9 p.541-547dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2016.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012500165300001600290520119500306592002801501650002801529650002901557650001601586650001401602650001801616650002301634650001801657650001201675650001801687650001601705650001201721650002501733650001201758650001301770650001601783650001301799650000701812650001301819650000901832650001601841650001101857650001001868650001801878700001501896700001701911700001801928700001801946700001901964773011101983856004802094852000902142655001202151IND50065944020221121102415.0130426e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006594402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-012-0810-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Se-Kwon10aCharacterization of ethanol fermentation waste and its application to lactic acid production by Lactobacillus paracasei   ap. 547-554.  aIn this study, an ethanol fermentation waste (EFW) was characterized for use as an alternative to yeast extract for bulk fermentation processes. EFW generated from a commercial plant in which ethanol is produced from cassava/rice/wheat/barley starch mixtures using Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for lactic acid production by Lactobacillus paracasei. The effects of temperature, pH, and duration on the autolysis of an ethanol fermentation broth (EFB) were also investigated. The distilled EFW (DEFW) contained significant amounts of soluble proteins (2.91 g/l), nitrogen (0.47 g/l), and amino acids (24.1 mg/l). The autolysis of the EFB under optimum conditions released twice as much amino acids than in the DEFW. Batch fermentation in the DEFW increased the final lactic acid concentration, overall lactic acid productivity, and lactic acid yield on glucose by 17, 41, and 14 %, respectively, in comparison with those from comparable fermentation in a lactobacillus growth medium (LGM) that contained 2 g/l yeast extract. Furthermore, the overall lactic acid productivity in the autolyzed then distilled EFW (ADEFW) was 80 and 27 % higher than in the LGM and DEFW, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acids 3aautolysis 3abarley starch 3abatch fermentation 3abioprocessing 3acassava 3aculture media 3aengineering 3aethanol 3aethanol fermentation 3aglucose 3aindustry 3alactic acid 3anitrogen 3apH 3aproteins 3arice 3atemperature 3awastes 3awheat 3ayeast extract1 aLee, Julia1 aSong, Hyohak1 aCho, Jung-Hee1 aChoi, Gi-Wook1 aSeung, Doyoung0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2013 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.547-554dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-012-0810-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015000163300001600313520162700329592002801956650002001984650002202004650002002026650002702046650004202073650001302115650002002128650001802148650001102166650001102177650001602188650002602204650001302230650001802243650001202261650001502273650001302288650001202301700002202313700002002335773012802355856008202483852000902565655001202574IND60690470020221122001757.0200426e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069047002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-020-09751-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Po-An10aInduction of defensive proteins in Solanaceae by salivary glucose oxidase of Helicoverpa zea caterpillars and consequences for larval performance  ap. 317-325.  aSalivary glucose oxidase (GOX) is one of the most abundant salivary proteins in generalist caterpillar Helicoverpa zea. GOX has been hypothesized to benefit H. zea by modulating direct defense responses of plants. Although the function of this protein has been studied, its role remains unclear. The study aims to test the hypothesis that GOX induces similar defensive responses among Solanaceous plants, and has similar consequences for larval performance of H. zea. Using six different plants in Solanaceae, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Better Boy and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme), bell pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. Revolution), habanero pepper (Capsicum chinense), tomatillo (Physalis philadelphica cv. Tamayo), and tobacco (N. benthamiana), we tested the impact of GOX on induction of two common defense proteins, trypsin protease inhibitors (TPI) and polyphenol oxidases (PPO), and on relative growth rate of H. zea larvae. We found that GOX specifically induced TPI activity in tomato and habanero pepper, and the level of defense protein depended on leaf location. In addition, prior application of GOX did not increase the performance of H. zea in any plant tested. Changes in performance in tomato and habanero pepper matched the induction of TPI. In summary, our findings indicate that GOX induces similar defense responses in some Solanacean plants, but largely depends on species/genotype of plant, and that the presence of GOX did not benefit larval H. zea by modulating direct defense responses of plants. Other mechanisms must be involved in driving the evolution of this salivary protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aCapsicum chinense 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aPhysalis philadelphica 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme 3agenotype 3aglucose oxidase 3ainsect larvae 3aleaves 3apepper 3apolyphenols 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteins 3asweet peppers 3atobacco 3atomatillos 3atomatoes 3atrypsin1 aPeiffer, Michelle1 aFelton, Gary W.0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2020 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.317-325dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4130426x1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-020-09751-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007400168300001600242520135000258592002801608596009801636596009901734596009701833650001901930650002901949650001101978650002001989650002602009650002002035650001002055650001202065650001502077650001102092650001102103650002202114650001702136650002202153650002802175650002202203650002802225700001602253773013402269856008502403852000902488655001202497IND60693448120221119115612.0200506e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069344812DNAL7 a10.1080/09542299.2016.12126752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bairen10aEffects of pentachlorophenol on the bacterial denitrification process  ap. 163-169.  aThe use of pentachlorophenol (PCP) was banned or restricted in many countries worldwide because of its adverse influences on the ecological environment and humans. However, the potential disrupting effects of PCP on denitrifying microorganisms have warranted more analysis. In this study, the impacts of PCP on denitrification were investigated by using Paracoccus denitrificans as a model denitrifying bacterium. Compared with the control, the presences of 10 and 50 μM of PCP were found to significantly decrease the denitrification efficiencies from 98.5 to 87.2% and 68.7%, respectively. The mechanism studies showed that PCP induced the generation of reactive oxygen species, which decreased the vital enzymes activities related to glycolysis process, causing the disturbance of the metabolism of P. denitrificans utilizing carbon source (glucose) and the growth of the cell, and subsequently the generation of electron donor (NADH) for denitrification via NAD⁺ reduction was severely depressed. Further studies indicated that PCP also decreased the genes expression of several key enzymes responsible for denitrification, such as napA of nitrate reductase (NAR), nirS of nitrite reductase, norB of nitric oxide reductase, and nosZ of nitrous oxide reductase; however, there was only the enzyme activity of NAR was remarkably inhibited.  aPublisher supplied data  a21277115cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBY2014108-03cProject of Industry-School - – Research Institution of Jiangsu Province, China  aBY2014108-03cProject of Industry-School – Research Institution of Jiangsu Province, China 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aParacoccus denitrificans 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3amodels 3anitrate reductase 3anitric oxide 3anitrite reductase 3anitrous-oxide reductase 3apentachlorophenol 3areactive oxygen species1 aChen, Aihui0 tChemical speciation and bioavailability.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 28, no. 1-4 p.163-169dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21328x0954-22997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09542299.2016.12126753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014500168300001800313520054500331592002800876650001300904650001600917650002900933650002100962700002000983700002001003700001601023700002001039700002401059700002001083700002301103700001901126700002001145773011801165856008201283990002301365852000901388655001201397IND60091255920221119044108.0141103e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009125592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.10.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiSalvo, Darren10aSubstituted phenyl as a steroid A-ring mimetic: Providing agonist activity to a class of arylsulfonamide nonsteroidal glucocorticoid ligands  ap. 6645-6649.  aA class of arylsulfonamide glucocorticoid receptor agonists that contains a substituted phenyl group as a steroid A-ring mimetic is reported.

Moreover, it paves the way to mastering the skills required for lifelong learning in a constantly changing world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult learning 3aadults 3achildren 3aliteracy 3ayouth 0amedia 0aliteracy 0amedia literacy 0amedia education 0apedagogy1 aJolls, Tessa0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g2004 Sept., v. 48, no. 1 p.18-29dSage PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642042672463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012600167300001800293520090700311592002801218650001701246650001401263650001401277650001501291650001601306650001701322650004301339650001901382650002401401700001701425700001701442700001801459700001501477700001701492773011801509856008201627990002301709852000901732655001201741IND60091256020221119043855.0141103e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009125602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.10.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSang, Chun-Yan10aDPMA, a deoxypodophyllotoxin derivative, induces apoptosis and anti-angiogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells  ap. 6650-6655.  aWe found that the deoxypodophyllotoxin derivative, 2,6-dimethoxy-4-(6-oxo-(5R,5aR,6,8,8aR,9-hexahydrofuro[3′,4′:6,7]naphtho[2,3-d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)phenyl ((R)-1-amino-4-(methylthio)-1-oxobutan-2-yl)carbamate (DPMA), exhibited superior cytotoxicity compared with etoposide. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of DPMA. DPMA exhibited anti-proliferative activity and induced apoptosis in A549 cells in a dose- and time-dependant manner. DPMA inhibited microtubule formation and induced expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, p53 and ROS, and inhibited Bcl-2 expression. DPMA also affected cyclinB1, cdc2 and p-cdc2 expression, inducing cell cycle arrest. DPMA also inhibited tube formation of VEGF-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These studies demonstrate that DPMA inhibits p53/cdc2/Bax signaling, thereby inhibiting cell growth/angiogenesis and inducing apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acytotoxicity 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3alung neoplasms 3amechanism of action1 aXu, Xiao-Hui1 aQin, Wen-Wen1 aLiu, Jian-Fei1 aKuai, Lin,1 aChen, Shi-Wu0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 23, no. 24 p.6650-6655dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.10.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245017300216520149100389592002801880650002301908650001901931650002801950650002001978650001401998650000902012650002502021650001502046650002102061650001302082650001102095650001402106650002702120651001902147653001502166653002202181653002202203653001202225653004102237653001202278653001402290700006102304700002202365773011002387856008802497852000902585655001202594IND60730767820221121064923.0210506e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073076782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruchet, Daniela M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7351-186X12aA “new normality” for small-scale artisanal Fishers? The case of unregulated fisheries during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bahía Blanca estuary (SW Atlantic Ocean)  aThe current COVID-19 pandemic is causing health and economic crises worldwide, but consequences are worse for those emerging countries with poor sanitary conditions struggling against economic recessions. Small-scale artisanal fishers (SSAF) should be considered among the “essential workers” since they provide food services; however, the COVID-19 might have altered the normal livelihood and reduced people economic incomes in an already marginalized sector. This situation highlights the fishers' vulnerability, derived from changes in fish stocks caused by climate change, pollution, overharvesting, and informal work (illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing). Therefore, the so-called “new normality” raises big questions about the management of coastal areas and fisheries in developing countries. As a study case, we proposed exploring SSAF from an Argentinian estuary, the Bahía Blanca estuary (SW Atlantic Ocean). Most of them are unregulated after a reconversion program carried out by the local government in 2012. After reviewing the current COVID-19 legislation for coastal fisheries and having virtual encounters with SSAF, we observed they are struggling against the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. According to our observations, imperative measures must be taken to prevent fisheries collapse in the area. In this work, we present a reference point for the post-pandemic management of fisheries that could be considered for emerging public policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aclimate change 3acoastal zone management 3aeconomic crises 3aestuaries 3afish 3alaws and regulations 3alivelihood 3alocal government 3apandemic 3apeople 3apollution 3atraditional technology 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aCOVID-19 pandemic 0aLockdown measures 0aIllegal 0aUnreported and unregulated fisheries 0aSeafood 0aArgentina1 aBuzzi, Natalia S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5179-06341 aNoceti, M.

Feasibility of this process for wastewater treatment were investigated in detail by comparing the removal performance of three inorganic chemical coagulants (polyaluminium chloride, polyaluminium ferric chloride [PAFC] and poly ferric sulfate) individual or couple with poly acrylamide, optimizing the conditions during CEPT by both single factor analysis and orthogonal test designs. The results of this study demonstrated that CEPT turned out to be an effective method for wastewater treatment, with PAFC as the optimal coagulant, which showed preeminent removal capacity for chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus and SS. The optimal working condition could be at pH 7.0, settling time 15 min, and velocity gradient of 174.80 and 15.56 s⁻¹ for mixing and reaction phase respectively. While the coagulant dosage depends on raw water attributes, which had a decisive effect on CEPT treatment performances. However, the three coagulants behaved poorly in nitrogen removal.  aPublisher supplied data  a51378400cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aacrylamides 3acarbon 3acase studies 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulants 3afactor analysis 3aferric chloride 3aferric sulfate 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3apH 3atotal phosphorus 3atotal suspended solids 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aCEPT 0acoagulation 0asingle factor analysis 0aorthogonal test design1 aWang, Hongyu1 aXu, Congyuan1 aZhang, Jing1 aZhang, Wei1 aZou, Zhuocheng1 aYang, Kai0 tChemical speciation and bioavailability.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 28, no. 1-4 p.209-215dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21328x0954-22997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09542299.2016.12476573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012200168300001600290520086700306536004101173592002801214650001401242650002501256650002101281650001001302650003001312650002601342650001301368651001801381653002801399653002001427653002701447653001601474653002001490653002601510700001801536773011601554856008001670852000901750655001201759IND60624278920221123041617.0181202e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062427892DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336145280072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorey, Rebecca L.10aComplementary and Alternative MedicinebRisks and Special Considerations in Pretransplant and Posttransplant Patients  ap. 322-331.  aAlthough herbs and botanicals have been available for thousands of years, detailed scientific research regarding the potential health benefits and risks of dietary supplements has been conducted only for the past 15–20 years.

The activity has vastly expanded in the past three decades, but in some cases, an opposite trend is now emerging. Spaceborne images were used to monitor the recent collapse of seaweed farming around the small island of Nusa Lembongan, Bali, Indonesia. A simple semi-quantitative Seaweed Farming Index highlighted the different dynamics for four different sectors around the island, with abrupt or gradual changes starting in 2012. By 2017, seaweed farming had eventually vanished from the island, after sustaining local livelihoods for more than 30 years and influencing the zoning plan of the local Marine Conservation Area since 2010. Interviews of 50 ex-farmers in 2018 identified the reasons of the changes: failed crop, low selling prices, shrinking space to dry algae against coastal development, and easy alternative jobs in tourism, although not necessarily providing better salary incomes. Tourism attracted half of these farmers, while another 25% went into building construction, itself largely driven by tourism development. The vulnerability of a complete shift to tourism was highlighted when tourism temporarily collapsed for several months due to threat of a Bali volcano eruption in late 2017. This prompted ex-farmers to consider returning to farming. This integrated case study based on remote sensing and household surveys highlights the fast-changing dynamics of Indonesia coastal socio-ecosystem due to largely to tourism development and natural hazards. The consequences for local management are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoastal zone management 3aconservation areas 3acosmetics 3amacroalgae 3atourism 3aIndonesia 0aBali 0aGoogle earth 0aChange detection 0aRemote sensing 0aAquaculture 0aMount agung1 aDewantama, I.Made Iwan1 aAmpou, Eghbert Elvan0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 June 15, v. 207 p.105586-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245007700165300001600242500000900258520155000267592002801817650001101845650001601856650002301872650001801895650002001913650001001933650002101943650002201964650002001986650001002006650002202016651001402038700003702052700002102089773012202110852000902232856007902241655001202320IND4406699520221118052753.0191226e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440669952DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2007.02402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwathmey, C.

We conducted factorial experiments for 3 yr in adjacent irrigated and nonirrigated fields at Milan, TN, of cotton grown in 25-, 76- and 102-cm rows, each planted in a solid and 2 × 1 skip-row pattern. Narrower rows and solid plantings tended to close canopy earlier and more completely, to suppress weed growth, and to mature earlier than in wider rows and skip-row patterns. Incomplete canopy closure in wider skip-row spacings resulted in less weed suppression, but weed growth in skipped rows diminished with narrower row spacing. Skip-row cotton matured later than solid planting, but this effect also diminished with narrower rows. Without irrigation, row spacing and configuration for maximum lint yield depended on growing conditions of the particular year. Under irrigation, however, solid planted 76-cm rows consistently yielded more than either 25- or 102-cm solid or skip-row cotton. With or without irrigation, lint yields were 13 to 15% lower in 102-cm skip-row cotton than in 102-cm solid planting, but yields did not differ between solid and skip-row in narrower rows. Across years and treatments, plant density was the most influential yield component in nonirrigated cotton, but plant density and bolls plant⁻¹ had similar influence under irrigation. Cotton producers interested in skip-row planting should consider rows spaced 76-cm or less to minimize weed problems and yield loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3arow spacing 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aplant density 3adryland farming 3aweeds 3ayield components 3airrigated farming 3acrop management 3abolls 3avegetative growth 3aTennessee1 aSteckel, Lawrence Edward,d1965-1 aLarson, James A.0 tAgronomy journal.g2008 May, v. 100, no. 3 p.672-680dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2007.02403Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02335naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011800171300001800289520108800307592002801395650001701423650001401440650001601454650001801470650002101488650001501509650001101524650001301535650001101548650001201559650002001571650001601591650002201607700001701629700001901646700002201665700002001687700002001707773008101727856008401808852000901892655001201901IND60092283320221120120505.0141103e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009228332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2012.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Cheng-Meng10aStructural evolution during annealing of thermally reduced graphene nanosheets for application in supercapacitors  ap. 3572-3584.  aThe surface functional groups of thermally reduced graphene nanosheets (TRG) prepared by vacuum promoted thermal expansion of graphene oxide are tailored by progressive carbonization. The residual carbon ratios after annealing at various temperatures from 250 to 1000°C increase progressively from 44.3 to 84.8%. The oxygen containing functional groups are intensively removed at higher annealing temperature. The thermally stable phenols, ethers, and carbonyls become the major components in 1000°C annealed TRG. Though the starting material G250 owns a high specific capacitance of 170.5F/g, the value decreases to only 47.5F/g when the annealing temperature is increased to 1000°C. The oxygen containing functional groups can enhance the capacitance performance of TRGs by introducing abundant pseudocapacitance active sites through reversible Faradic redox reactions. The correlation between the structural evolution and electrochemical performance of TRGs provides new insight for designing graphene based electrodes with controllable properties for advanced supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aannealing 3acapacitance 3acarbonization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aethers 3agraphene 3aoxygen 3aphenols 3aredox reactions 3atemperature 3athermal expansion1 aZhang, Qiang1 aYang, Mang-Guo1 aHuang, Chun-Hsien1 aYang, Yong-Gang1 aWang, Mao-Zhang0 tCarbon.g2012 Aug., v. 50, no. 10 p.3572-3584dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2012.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011300164300001600277520114900293592002801442650001601470650001601486650001201502650002101514650001001535650002201545650001301567650002201580650003001602650001801632650001801650650000901668651000901677700002001686773009701706856008101803852000901884655001201893IND60081960420221118012701.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008196042DNAL7 a10.3103/S00954527140500412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazinani, Z.10aGenetic diversity of Azotobacter strains isolated from soils by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis  ap. 293-301.  aStrains of Azotobacter mediate in the nitrogen fixation process by reducing of N₂to ammonia. In this study, 50 strains were isolated from different rhizospheric soil in central Iran, by using soil paste-plate method. These strains were biochemically identified and characterized on differential LG medium based on morphological and physiological properties. Results obtained showed that identified strains were belonging to three species, namely A. chroococcum, A. vinelandii and A. beijernckii. In order to molecular analysis, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using 27f and 1495r primers and PCR products were subsequently restricted with RsaI, HpaII and HhaI. Cluster analysis based on amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis were revealed intraspecific polymorphism and differentiated strains into two mains clusters, clusters A and B. Cluster A strains were related to the A. vinelandii, whereas cluster B strains were related to the A. chroococcum and A. beijerinckii. The results show that amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis is a powerful and discriminatory tool for the identification of members of the genus Azotobacter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzotobacter 3aDNA primers 3aammonia 3acluster analysis 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3aIran1 aAsgharzadeh, A.0 tCytology and genetics.g2014 Sept., v. 48, no. 5 p.293-301dSpringer-Verlagx0095-45277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3103/S00954527140500413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016200171300001400333520164000347592002801987653002502015653001102040653002902051653004902080653001802129700002302147700002202170773016402192856008402356852000902440655001202449IND60530636720221120220458.0160721e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053063672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pharep.2015.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawaura, Kazuaki10aStimulation of the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 2 receptor attenuates the MK-801-induced increase in the immobility time in the forced swimming test in rats  ap. 80-84.  aNegative symptoms of schizophrenia are poorly managed using the currently available antipsychotics. Previous studies indicate that agonists of the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 2/3 receptors may provide a novel approach for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, the effects of mGlu2/3 receptor agonists or mGlu2 receptor positive allosteric modulators have not yet been clearly elucidated in animal models of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Recently, we reported that the forced swimming test in rats treated with subchronic MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, may be regarded as a useful test to evaluate the activities of drugs against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.We evaluated the effects of LY379268, an mGlu2/3 receptor agonist, and BINA, an mGlu2 receptor positive allosteric modulator, on the hyperlocomotion induced by acute administration of MK-801 (0.15mg/kg, sc) and on the increase in the immobility time in the forced swimming test induced by subchronic treatment with MK-801 (0.5mg/kg, sc, twice a day for 7 days) in rats.Both LY379268 (3mg/kg, sc) and BINA (100mg/kg, ip) attenuated the increase in the immobility time induced by subchronic treatment with MK-801 at the same doses at which they attenuated the MK-801-induced increase in locomotor activity, but had no effect on the immobility time in saline-treated rats.The present results suggest that stimulation of the mGlu2 receptor attenuates the increase in the immobility time in the forced swimming test elicited by subchronic administration of MK-801, and may be potentially useful for treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  aPublisher supplied data 0aForced swimming test 0aMK-801 0amGlu2/3 receptor agonist 0amGlu2 receptor positive allosteric modulator 0aSchizophrenia1 aKarasawa, Jun-ichi1 aHikichi, Hirohiko0 tPharmacological Reports.g2016 Feb., v. 68 p.80-84dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aInstitute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciencesx1734-11407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharep.2015.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014700170520211800317592002802435650001302463650001302476650002602489650001202515650000902527650001602536650001702552650002802569650002302597650001102620650001502631650001502646650001502661650001902676650002002695650002302715650001802738651001002756653002602766653002002792653001302812653001502825653001602840700001902856700001802875700002202893700001602915700001402931700001802945700001502963700001902978700001502997773011003012856008803122852000903210655001203219IND60730768020221121064945.0210708e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073076802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnan, P.10aBalancing livelihood enhancement and ecosystem conservation in seaweed farmed areas: A case study from Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve, India  aKappaphycus alvarezii, a red seaweed cultured in tropical waters for extraction of carrageenan, is widely considered a bioinvader of coral reefs. In India, this seaweed is cultivated in Palk Bay, South India by the coastal community amidst the concern of its invasion in the sub-tidal reef regions of adjoining Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park (GoMMNP). The current study was undertaken to assess the extent of coral reefs in Pak Bay and Gulf of Mannar (GoM) affected by this red alga and evaluate the possible causes for its spread in GoM including the long-term commercial seaweed cultivation in Palk Bay. The study was carried out in Palk Bay and 19 emergent and two submerged Islands of GoM. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images were used to map the spatial cover of the alga over the reef. The reef zones with K. alvarezii were mapped using GIS. The study showed that K. alvarezii has not spread over the coral reefs in Palk Bay, a region where the cultivation is underway for over ten years. Nevertheless, the algae had spread in some of the islands in Gulf of Mannar region viz., Shingle (1.1 ha; 2.12% of reef area), Krusadai (0.572 ha; 0.35% of reef area) and Mulli Islands (0.00025 ha; 0.00022% of reef area). The temporal change in the extent of live corals (between 2002 and 2014) in Palk Bay and GoM corroborated a possible phase shift i.e., from a coral dominated reef to an algal dominated reef, with Halimeda spp., Caulerpa spp. and Ulva reticulata being the dominant macro-algae. Based on a critical analysis of the sources of fragments for the spread of the alga in GoM and the factors that aid in their dispersion, we conclude that K. alvarezii farming activities in Palk Bay are not the primary source for the broken fragments, responsible for the spread of the alga in GoM. However, considering the potential risks of unintended transfer of farmed algae into the sensitive ecosystems, the study calls for evolving codes for cultivation of seaweeds so as to leave least ecological footprints over the coastal ecologically sensitive ecosystems like coral reefs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaulerpa 3aHalimeda 3aKappaphycus alvarezii 3aLandsat 3aUlva 3acarrageenan 3acase studies 3acoastal zone management 3aconservation areas 3acorals 3aecosystems 3alivelihood 3amacroalgae 3anational parks 3aseaweed culture 3atemporal variation 3athematic maps 3aIndia 0aKappaphycus alvarezii 0aSeaweed farming 0aInvasion 0aCoral reef 0aPhase shift1 aAbhilash, K.R.1 aSreeraj, C.R.1 aSamuel, V.

Failure to thrive (FTT) as a consequence of TBSD has been reported in neonates with ileostomies; however, this has not been well described in older children. The records of all children beyond the age of infancy with a small bowel ostomy cared for in our Children’s Intestinal Rehabilitation Program from 2010–2012 were reviewed. Four patients between the ages of 18 months and 19 years were identified as having TBSD. All 4 patients experienced unintentional weight loss, despite adequate energy intake based on calculated needs, which was associated with a urine sodium level ≤10 mmol/L. With the supplementation of sodium, either enteral or intravenous, all patients demonstrated improved weight gain and correction of TBSD. The following cases suggest that the relationship between TBSD and FTT may extend well beyond the neonatal period and possibly into adulthood. We advise that patients of all ages with high stoma output have routine urine sodium levels checked, particularly in the setting of weight loss or poor gain. Furthermore, instances of TBSD should be treated with sodium supplementation. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between TBSD and FTT and to establish intervention guidelines.  aFinancial disclosure: None declared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3achildren 3achildren at risk 3aenergy intake 3afailure to thrive 3aguidelines 3ainfancy 3aintravenous injection 3aneonates 3apatients 3apostpartum period 3asmall intestine 3asodium 3astomach 3aurine 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 3ayoung adults 0apediatrics 0aostomy 0aacid-base equilibrium 0awater-electrolyte balance 0ahyponatremia 0anutritional support 0aparenteral nutrition 0aenteral nutrition1 aTeitelbaum, Daniel H.1 aHarris, Mary Beth0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 29, no. 3 p.397-401dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336145285433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04628naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245010900215520237800324592002802702650001202730650001602742650002802758650000902786650001602795650002002811650001802831650001102849650001302860650002102873650001102894650001902905650001702924650001802941650001902959650001502978650001702993650003003010650002703040651001303067653001803080653002203098653001903120653001803139653002603157653002803183653002303211653002503234700005603259700006003315700006503375700005803440700005803498700006303556700002203619700006903641700006103710773011003771856008803881852000903969655001203978IND60730768120221121064728.0210708e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073076812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKizenga, Hellen J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7795-412310aVariability of mackerel fish catch and remotely-sensed biophysical controls in the eastern Pemba Channel  aAdvances in satellite remote sensing of environmental perturbations have become important in understanding variations of ocean productivity and small pelagic fish catches. This marine resource is vital for coastal populations dependent on artisanal fishing for their income and food security, such as in coastal East Africa. In this region, the eastern Pemba Channel (Tanzania) represents a hotspot area, for a variety of marine species including small pelagics and coral reef associated species. This study examines the links between mackerel fish catch, one of the important small pelagic fish for direct consumption in the region, and changes in environmental oceanographic parameters over the period 2012–2018. The fisheries catch data is a rare local dataset, consisting of daily mackerel landings (from 2012 onwards) and supplemented by qualitative information on the mackerel fishery obtained through interviews with local stakeholders. The physical factors influencing phytoplankton biomass, and in turn, mackerel fisheries yield is investigated, using remotely-sensed chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST), together with Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) data from the high-resolution ocean model NEMO. We show that seasonal variations in mackerel landings are positively (negatively) correlated with Chl-a (SST) with a 1-month time lag (i.e., biophysical factors change first, mackerel stocks follow one month later). On the eastern side of the Pemba Channel, cooler SST and higher Chl-a are observed during the Southeast monsoon accompanied by increased mackerel landings, suggestive of enhanced productivity. Interannually, these relationships remain valid both for monthly and annual means, which confirms the close link between the variations of mackerel and biophysical conditions. Analysis of the Chl-a and MLD anomalies, relative to the mean, reveals that the phytoplankton blooms observed on the eastern side of the Pemba Channel, during the Southeast monsoon, are likely due to the deepening of the mixed layer, which tends to entrain cold and nutrient rich waters from greater depths to the surface. We conclude that upper ocean mixing contributes to the observed enhanced productivity along with other environmental factors. Additionally, we show how our results can be applied in the management of the mackerel resource in the Pemba Channel.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acoastal zone management 3acold 3acoral reefs 3adata collection 3afood security 3aincome 3amackerel 3amarine resources 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3apelagic fish 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3astakeholders 3asurface water temperature 3atraditional technology 3aTanzania 0aPemba channel 0aMackerel landings 0aRemote sensing 0aChlorophyll-a 0aPhytoplankton biomass 0aSea surface temperature 0aUpper ocean mixing 0aFisheries management1 aJebri, Fatma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7048-00681 aShaghude, Yohana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8040-07061 aRaitsos, Dionysios E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6714-21801 aSrokosz, Meric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7347-74111 aJacobs, Zoe L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7348-06991 aNencioli, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6107-24791 aShalli, Mwanahija1 aKyewalyanga, Margareth S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6429-68061 aPopova, Ekaterina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2012-708X0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 June 15, v. 207 p.105593-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245014000214300001800354506007600372520172400448592002802172506003702200650000802237650001502245650001702260650002502277650002102302650001202323650001502335650001502350650001602365650002202381650001602403650002302419650002002442650001102462650001702473650001902490650004402509650001902553650002202572650001702594650002102611650001502632700002002647700002302667700002002690700002302710700006202733773013802795856008102933852000903014655001203023IND60656304620221207133913.0190812e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065630462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-018-1789-82doi7 aPMC66892872pmcid7 a300661772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiallourou, Natasa S.10aMetabolic targets of watercress and PEITC in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells explain differential sensitisation responses to ionising radiation  ap. 2377-2391.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE: Watercress is a rich source of phytochemicals with anticancer potential, including phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). We examined the potential for watercress extracts and PEITC to increase the DNA damage caused by ionising radiation (IR) in breast cancer cells and to be protective against radiation-induced collateral damage in healthy breast cells. The metabolic events that mediate such responses were explored using metabolic profiling. METHODS: ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling was coupled with DNA damage-related assays (cell cycle, Comet assay, viability assays) to profile the comparative effects of watercress and PEITC in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and MCF-10A non-tumorigenic breast cells with and without exposure to IR. RESULTS: Both the watercress extract and PEITC-modulated biosynthetic pathways of lipid and protein synthesis and resulted in changes in cellular bioenergetics. Disruptions to the redox balance occurred with both treatments in the two cell lines, characterised by shifts in the abundance of glutathione. PEITC enhanced the sensitivity of the breast cancer cells to IR increasing the effectiveness of the cancer-killing process. In contrast, watercress-protected non-tumorigenic breast cells from radiation-induced damage. These effects were driven by changes in the cellular content of the antioxidant glutathione following exposure to PEITC and other phytochemicals in watercress. CONCLUSION: These findings support the potential prophylactic impact of watercress during radiotherapy. Extracted compounds from watercress and PEITC differentially modulate cellular metabolism collectively enhancing the therapeutic outcomes of radiotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical pathways 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acell cycle 3acell lines 3acomet assay 3aenergy metabolism 3aglutathione 3aionizing radiation 3aisothiocyanates 3alipids 3ametabolomics 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphytochemicals 3aprotein synthesis 3aradiotherapy 3aviability assays 3awatercress1 aRowland, Ian R.1 aRothwell, Steve D.1 aPackham, Graham1 aCommane, Daniel M.1 aSwann, Jonathan R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6485-45290 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2019 Sept., v. 58, no. 6 p.2377-2391dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-018-1789-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245010900209520143500318592002801753650002301781650001701804650001201821650002801833650000901861650002101870650001701891650002701908651001401935653001901949653002201968653003001990653001902020653002502039653002102064773011002085856008802195852000902283655001202292IND60730768220221121064706.0210708e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073076822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSultan, Riad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2927-128810aFisheries benefits of a marine protected area with endogenous fishing efforts – A bioeconomic analysis  aThe study assesses the conservation and fisheries benefits of the Blue Bay Marine Park in Mauritius. It addresses the question - are the higher catch rates near the Park a result of population spillovers or of reduced fishing effort in those waters due to site-specific attributes? There is no data on catches and fishing effort prior to the reserve's establishment; a bioeconomic model is used to separate the effects of spillover and effort redistribution on catch rates in waters next to the Marine Park. The area's fish populations are replicated using a dynamic age-structured model with a Beverton-Holt recruitment function, while fishing effort is predicted using a random utility model and Random Parameter Logit estimation. The bioeconomic model is characterised by two-way feedback loops between fish stocks and the geographic redistribution of fishing effort. A comparison of fish population, biomass, and catch rates in the fisheries with and without effort redistribution, suggests that the reduced fishing effort in waters near the Park, rather than spillover, is driving the increase in observed catch rates. Travel distance, variation in catch rates, depth of water and area status (lagoon vs. off-lagoon) explain the relocation of fishing effort away from the adjacent of the marine park. The study shows how site-specific characteristics affecting fisher behaviour are important in the design of marine reserves.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomic models 3abioeconomics 3abiomass 3acoastal zone management 3afish 3afish communities 3amarine parks 3amarine protected areas 3aMauritius 0aMarine reserve 0aBioeconomic model 0aAge-structured population 0aSpatial effort 0aRandom utility model 0aSpillover effect0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 June 15, v. 207 p.105594-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245006400167300001600231520083100247536004101078592002801119650002001147650001201167650001301179650001301192650001701205650002301222650001301245653002401258653001701282653002401299653002201323773011601345856008001461852000901541655001201550IND60624279320221123013319.0181202e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062427932DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336145289862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrov, Maxim S.10aGastric Feeding and “Gut Rousing” in Acute Pancreatitis  ap. 287-290.  aThe “pancreatic rest” concept is entrenched in the management of acute pancreatitis. As a result, “nonstimulatory” feeding has been widely advocated in patients with this disease, being parenteral nutrition 2–3 decades ago and jejunal tube feeding in the past decade. However, accumulating clinical evidence from the fields of acute pancreatitis and critical care medicine suggests that gastric feeding is as safe and effective as jejunal feeding in most patients. This has paved the way for a new conceptual framework called “gut rousing.” Acute pancreatitis management now requires consideration of gut function. Enteral nutrition is a gut-directed therapy, and avoiding stimulation of the pancreas in patients with acute pancreatitis need not overshadow the main goal of maintaining or restoring gut function.  aFinancial disclosure: None declared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenteral feeding 3ajejunum 3amedicine 3apancreas 3apancreatitis 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 0apancreatic diseases 0apancreatitis 0anutritional support 0aenteral nutrition0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 29, no. 3 p.287-290dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336145289863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245009500212300001800307500001900325520184700344592002802191650002102219650001202240650001102252650002102263650001702284650001602301700006702317700006302384773012202447856008202569852000902651655001202660IND60710954220221116172918.0200914e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071095422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.0c009622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckhart, Karoline E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0123-127910aOne-Shot Synthesis of Peptide Amphiphiles with Applications in Directed Graphenic Assembly  ap. 3878-3886.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh molecular weight, synthetic block copolypeptides that self-assemble are in high demand for biomedical applications. The current standard method for synthesis of block copolypeptides is the controlled ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of α-amino acid N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers, where block architectures can be created by sequential NCA monomer addition. Recently, researchers have focused on developing reaction conditions and initiation systems that make NCA ROP more convenient, particularly for interdisciplinary labs without designated polypeptide facilities. In an effort to further simplify and increase the convenience of polypeptide synthesis, we developed a one-shot copolymerization strategy that allows access to block copolypeptides by capitalizing on the inherently faster reactivity of NCA monomers, compared to NTA (N-thiocarboxyanhydride) monomers. For the first time, we combine an NCA and NTA monomer in one reaction to kinetically promote block copolypeptide formation, providing a convenient alternative to sequential monomer addition. The controlled nature of this copolymerization technique is supported by a molecular weight that is modulated by the concentration of the initiator and low dispersities. We used this one-shot copolymerization to synthesize p(lysine)-b-p(leucine), a known peptide amphiphile (PA). Our one-shot PAs are antimicrobial and can spontaneously form ordered, micron-scale assemblies. Covalent conjugation of one-shot PAs to a graphenic backbone results in a functional graphenic material (FGM) with a self-assembled morphology, paving the way for creation of sophisticated FGM scaffolds with polypeptide-templated, hierarchical order. Overall, we demonstrate that this novel, one-shot copolymerization strategy produces functional copolypeptides with macroscopic sequence control.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopolymerization 3aleucine 3alysine 3amolecular weight 3apolypeptides 3asurfactants1 aStarvaggi, Francesca A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7384-82511 aSydlik, Stefanie A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9375-23560 tBiomacromolecules.g2020 July 20, v. 21, no. 9 p.3878-3886dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c009623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245008600208300001600294520167500310592002801985650001502013650002102028650001302049650001302062650001402075650001702089650001302106650002102119650000702140650001302147650001102160650001902171653001302190653001102203653001802214653001502232653001402247700001702261700005602278773010602334856008702440852000902527655001202536IND60611240820221119005314.0180911e20181005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061124082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.06.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatusiak, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0797-173710aStability, adsorption and electrokinetic properties of the chitosan/silica system  ap. 245-252.  aThe aim of this paper was to analyze stability, adsorption and the electrokinetic properties of suspensions containing chitosan and silica. Chitosan (Ch), the second most abundant natural polysaccharide, biodegradable and relatively cheap can be very good alternative for artificial polymers used in the stabilization of metal oxide suspensions. The results obtained from spectrophotometric and turbidimetric stability measurements proved that the higher concentrations of chitosan the more stabile the silica suspensions. The mechanism of the stabilization is the electrosteric one because the studied polymer not only adsorb on the silica surface but also possesses amino groups creating additional charge barrier preventing from flocculation. The adsorption of chitosan increases also with the increase of pH of the solution. However, the protonation of this polymer is the highest in pH = 5–6.3 and as the consequence in the above mentioned pH stabilization of the silica suspensions is the best. There is no significant influence of chitosan molecular weight on stability of studied suspensions when concentration of the polymer is relatively low (60 ppm–120 ppm). However, for higher concentrations of chitosan (200 ppm–800 ppm) stability increases with the increase of its molecular weight as well as the adsorption of this polymer on the silica surface. The additional information about stability and the structure of the adsorption layer was obtained from the zeta potential measurements. The presented results can find practical applications connected with functionalized materials especially in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics and agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiodegradability 3achitosan 3acolloids 3acosmetics 3aflocculation 3amedicine 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolymers 3asilica 3azeta potential 0aChitosan 0aSilica 0aStabilization 0aAdsorption 0aInterface1 aGrządka, E.1 aBastrzyk, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5091-98140 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 554 p.245-252dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.06.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011700165520160000282592002801882650002501910650000901935650002001944650001301964650003001977650001402007650001702021650001702038650000902055700001702064700002502081700001902106700002002125700002202145700001902167700002102186700002202207773011902229856007702348852000902425655001202434IND60745461620221118092249.0210723e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074546162DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120710282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerstens, Merijn 10aNature and Nurture: Genotype-Dependent Differential Responses of Root Architecture to Agar and Soil Environments  aRoot development is crucial for plant growth and therefore a key factor in plant performance and food production. Arabidopsis thaliana is the most commonly used system to study root system architecture (RSA). Growing plants on agar-based media has always been routine practice, but this approach poorly reflects the natural situation, which fact in recent years has led to a dramatic shift toward studying RSA in soil. Here, we directly compare RSA responses to agar-based medium (plates) and potting soil (rhizotrons) for a set of redundant loss-of-function plethora (plt) CRISPR mutants with variable degrees of secondary root defects. We demonstrate that plt3plt7 and plt3plt5plt7 plants, which produce only a handful of emerged secondary roots, can be distinguished from other genotypes based on both RSA shape and individual traits on plates and rhizotrons. However, in rhizotrons the secondary root density and the total contribution of the side root system to the RSA is increased in these two mutants, effectively rendering their phenotypes less distinct compared to WT. On the other hand, plt3, plt3plt5, and plt5plt7 mutants showed an opposite effect by having reduced secondary root density in rhizotrons. This leads us to believe that plate versus rhizotron responses are genotype dependent, and these differential responses were also observed in unrelated mutants short-root and scarecrow. Our study demonstrates that the type of growth system affects the RSA differently across genotypes, hence the optimal choice of growth conditions to analyze RSA phenotype is not predetermined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aagar 3afood production 3agenotype 3aloss-of-function mutation 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3aroot systems 3asoil1 aHesen, Vera 1 aYalamanchili, Kavya 1 aBimbo, Andrea 1 aGrigg, Stephen 1 aOpdenacker, Davy 1 aBeeckman, Tom,1 aHeidstra, Renze 1 aWillemsen, Viola 0 tGenes.g2021 July 01, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120710283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245013500172300001600307520135000323592002801673650001201701650002201713650003001735650002301765650002501788650001001813650001201823650002001835650002501855650001801880650001201898650001301910650001501923650001401938650001101952650002001963650002001983653002702003653002702030653002702057653002302084653002402107700001902131700001802150700001802168700001902186773009202205856009002297852000902387655001202396IND60603489420221119020422.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060348942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jae Ho10aElectrical stimulation by enzymatic biofuel cell to promote proliferation, migration and differentiation of muscle precursor cells  ap. 358-369.  aElectrical stimulation is a very important biophysical cue for skeletal muscle maintenance and myotube formation. The absence of electrical signals from motor neurons causes denervated muscles to atrophy. Herein, we investigate for the first time the utility of an enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) as a promising means for mimicking native electrical stimulation. EBFC was set up using two different enzymes: one was glucose oxidase (GOX) used for the generation of anodic current followed by the oxidation of glucose; the other was Bilirubin oxidase (BOD) for the generation of cathodic current followed by the reduction of oxygen. We studied the behaviors of muscle precursor cells (MPCs) in terms of proliferation, migration and differentiation under different electrical conditions. The EBFC electrical stimulations significantly increased cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, the electrical stimulations promoted the differentiation of cells into myotube formation based on expressions at the gene and protein levels. The EBFC set up, with its free forms adjustable to any implant design, was subsequently applied to the nanofiber scaffolding system. The MPCs were demonstrated to be stimulated in a similar manner as the 2D culture conditions, suggesting potential applications of the EBFC system for muscle repair and regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrophy 3abilirubin oxidase 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acell proliferation 3aelectrical treatment 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amotor neurons 3amuscles 3amyotubes 3ananofibers 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprotein content 3askeletal muscle 0aElectrical stimulation 0aEnzymatic biofuel cell 0aMuscle precursor cells 0aImplantable device 0aMuscle regeneration1 aJeon, Won-Yong1 aKim, Hyug-Han1 aLee, Eun-Jung1 aKim, Hae-wŏn,0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.358-369dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245008600173300001800259520185900277592002802136596005902164596005902223596006002282650001902342650002302361650001702384650001702401650001802418650003802436650001602474650002202490650001002512650002102522650002102543650001802564650001802582650001102600650001202611650002902623650001802652650001902670650001402689650002002703650001002723650001202733650001502745650002202760700002002782700001502802700001802817700002002835700001602855700002402871700005802895773011302953856008203066852000903148655001203157IND60671430420221118213309.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067143042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-019-03215-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakanishi, Katsuhiro10aLettuce-derived secretory IgA specifically neutralizes the Shiga toxin 1 activity  ap. 1255-1264.  aMAIN CONCLUSION: An edible plant was tested as a host for the production of secretory monoclonal IgA against Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1). The lettuce-derived IgA completely protected Vero cells from Stx1. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is thought to control mucosal infections and thus it may be applicable to oral passive immunotherapy. Edible plants are candidate hosts for producing oral formulations with SIgA against pathogenic agents. We previously established a recombinant IgA specific for the B subunit of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1B) consisting of the Fab fragment of Stx1B-specific monoclonal IgG and the Fc region of IgA (hyIgA). Here, we developed transgenic lettuce (Lactuca sativa) that produces hyIgA in a secretory form (S-hyIgA). An Arabidopsis-derived light-harvesting complex II (LHCB) promoter was used for the expression of all four transgenes (hyIgA heavy, light and j chains, and secretory component). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was carried out to introduce genes into lettuce leaf discs by means of a single vector harboring all four transgenes. Consistent with the tissue specificity of the LHCB promoter, the expression of hyIgA transgenes was observed in leaf and stem tissues, which contain chloroplasts, at the mRNA and protein levels. The leaves produced hyIgA in a more than tenfold higher yield as compared with stems. The lettuce-derived S-hyIgA was found to bind to Stx1B in a dose-dependent manner by means of ELISA. A leaf extract of the transgenic lettuce completely neutralized the cytotoxicity of Stx1 against Vero cells, which are highly susceptible to Stx1. In conclusion, we established a transgenic lettuce producing a secretory form of hyIgA that can bind bacterial toxin. The results indicate that edible practical plants containing S-hyIgA will provide a possible means for immunotherapy for food poisoning.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP15H04660cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP25670063cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP25·10915cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aLactuca sativa 3aShiga-like toxin 1 3achloroplasts 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood plants 3afoodborne illness 3ahosts 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunotherapy 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alettuce 3alight harvesting complex 3amessenger RNA 3aneutralization 3apathogens 3aprotein content 3astems 3atissues 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants1 aMatsuda, Minami1 aIda, Ryota1 aHosokawa, Nao1 aKurohane, Kohta1 aNiwa, Yasuo1 aKobayashi, Hirokazu1 aImai, Yasuyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8937-02210 tPlanta.g2019 Oct., v. 250, no. 4 p.1255-1264dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03215-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009000165300001200255520171100267592002801978650001802006650001202024650003502036650001802071650001902089650002302108650001102131650001802142650002402160650001102184650001502195650001402210650001702224650001202241650001902253650002002272653001402292653000802306653001202314653001902326653002902345700001802374700001502392773010902407856008102516852000902597655001202606IND60623958220221120194551.0181204e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062395822DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772145474062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervantes, M P10aIn vivo imaging in the rabbit as a model for the study of ovulation-inducing factors  ap. 1-9.  aThe study of factors responsible for eliciting ovulation in rabbits has been hampered by the lack of a suitable method of monitoring the ovaries in vivo. Ovarian imaging by ultrasound biomicroscopy was used in two experiments designed to determine the effects of seminal plasma on the ovulatory response in rabbits. In Experiment 1, female rabbits were group-housed and treated intramuscularly with saline, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), or seminal plasma of llamas or rabbits (n = 4 to 6 per group). Rabbits were euthanized eight days later to evaluate the ovarian response by ultrasound biomicroscopy ex situ. No differences among groups were detected in the proportion of rabbits that ovulated or in the number and size of corpora lutea. The high incidence of ovulation in the negative control group was unexpected, and confounded determination of an ovulation-inducing effect of seminal plasma. In Experiment 2, female rabbits were caged individually, and treated as in Experiment 1 (n = 5 to 7 per group). The ovarian response was evaluated in vivo by transcutaneous ultrasound biomicroscopy. Ovulation and formation of corpora lutea were detected only in rabbits given GnRH. A preovulatory surge in plasma luteinizing hormone concentration and a post-ovulatory rise in plasma progesterone concentration were detected only in rabbits treated with GnRH. Surgical translocation of the ovaries to a subcutaneous position enabled longitudinal assessment of the ovulatory response by ultrasound biomicroscopy. Results clearly documented the effect of physical/social interaction on ovulation in rabbits, and did not support the hypothesis that seminal plasma elicits ovulation in rabbits.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorpus luteum 3afemales 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3agroup housing 3aimage analysis 3alaboratory animals 3allamas 3aluteinization 3aluteinizing hormone 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3arabbits 3aseminal plasma 3asocial behavior 0aovulation 0aNGF 0arabbits 0aseminal plasma 0aultrasound biomicroscopy1 aPalomino, J M1 aAdams, G P0 tLaboratory animals.g2015 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.1-9dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772145474063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245012200169520129300291592002801584650001001612650001301622650001001635650001801645650001501663700002001678700002301698700002601721700001901747700002301766700002301789700001801812700002201830700003001852700002401882700001901906773011901925856007702044852000902121655001202130IND60745461720221118092258.0210723e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074546172DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120710302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOluwafemi, Omobola O.10aGenome-Wide Association Studies of Conotruncal Heart Defects with Normally Related Great Vessels in the United States  aConotruncal defects with normally related great vessels (CTD-NRGVs) occur in both patients with and without 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), but it is unclear to what extent the genetically complex etiologies of these heart defects may overlap across these two groups, potentially involving variation within and/or outside of the 22q11.2 region. To explore this potential overlap, we conducted genome-wide SNP-level, gene-level, and gene set analyses using common variants, separately in each of five cohorts, including two with 22q11.2DS (N = 1472 total cases) and three without 22q11.2DS (N = 935 total cases). Results from the SNP-level analyses were combined in meta-analyses, and summary statistics from these analyses were also used in gene and gene set analyses. Across all these analyses, no association was significant after correction for multiple comparisons. However, several SNPs, genes, and gene sets with suggestive evidence of association were identified. For common inherited variants, we did not identify strong evidence for shared genomic mechanisms for CTD-NRGVs across individuals with and without 22q11.2 deletions. Nevertheless, several of our top gene-level and gene set results have been linked to cardiogenesis and may represent candidates for future work.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheart 3ameta-analysis 3astatistics1 aMusfee, Fadi I.1 aMitchell, Laura E.1 aGoldmuntz, Elizabeth 1 aXie, Hongbo M.1 aHakonarson, Hakon 1 aMorrow, Bernice E.1 aGuo, Tingwei 1 aTaylor, Deanne M.1 aMcDonald-McGinn, Donna M.1 aEmanuel, Beverly S.1 aAgopian, A.

The present study investigated the protective effects of Carissa opaca against CCl₄-induced oxidative stress in rat lungs. METHODS: To assess the protective effects of Carissa opaca, 42 Sprague–Dawley male rats (170–180 g) were randomly divided into 7 groups. Group I was untreated and group II received olive oil intraperitoneally (i.p.) and dimethyl sulfoxide orally. Groups III, IV, V, VI and VII were administered CCl₄, 3 ml/kg bodyweight (30% in olive oil i.p.). Group IV was administered 50 mg/kg bodyweight silymarin whereas groups V, VI and VII were treated with 200 mg/kg of various fractions of Carissa opaca after 48 h of CCl₄ treatment for eight weeks. Antioxidant profiles in lungs were evaluated by estimating the activities of antioxidant enzymes: catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, quinone reductase and reduced glutathione. CCl₄-induced lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) with conjugation of DNA damage and histopathology. RESULTS: Administration of CCl₄ for 8 weeks significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the activities of antioxidant enzymes and GSH concentration while increasing TBARS content and DNA damage. Co-treatment of various fractions of Carissa opaca and silymarin restored the activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione content. Changes in TBARS concentration and DNA fragmentation was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) following Carissa opaca and silymarin treatment in lung. CONCLUSIONS: Histopathological changes in rat lungs induced by CCl₄ were significantly restored by co-treatment with Carissa opaca and silymarin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCarissa spinarum 3aDNA damage 3aDNA fragmentation 3aNAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aalternative medicine 3aantioxidants 3aasthma 3abody weight 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acatalase 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenzyme activity 3afibrosis 3afruit extracts 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3alipid peroxidation 3alungs 3amales 3aolive oil 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aprotective effect 3arats 3asilymarin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aKhan, Muhammad Rashid1 aAli Khan, Rahmat,0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.40-40dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001800284520041200302592002800714650000800742650002400750650002300774650002300797650001600820650001300836650001200849650000900861653002300870653001500893653001400908653002400922653002800946700001800974700001900992700001801011700001701029700002001046773008201066856008101148852000901229655001201238IND60524429220221118173358.0161019e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052442922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasui, Kōji,10aGuanidinium iodide/urea hydrogen peroxide-catalyzed azidation of β-dicarbonyl compounds with trimethylsilyl azide  ap. 5350-5354.  aWe present an efficient synthesis of α-azido-β-dicarbonyl compounds from β-dicarbonyl compounds and trimethylsilyl azide, catalyzed by guanidinium hypoiodite.

However, this attempt often fails due to the tight control of the sugar metabolic pathways. Recently, activation of the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway in Escherichia coli has been shown to enhance glucose consumption, though the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of a functional ED pathway in metabolically engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum that metabolizes glucose via the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway to produce ethanol under oxygen deprivation. This study aims to provide further information on metabolic engineering strategies that allow the Entner–Doudoroff and Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathways to coexist. RESULTS: Three genes (zwf, edd, and eda) encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase from Zymomonas mobilis were expressed in a genetically modified strain, C. glutamicum CRZ2e, which produces pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from Z. mobilis. A ¹³C-labeling experiment using [1-¹³C] glucose indicated a distinctive ¹³C distribution of ethanol between the parental and the ED-introduced strains, which suggested an alteration of carbon flux as a consequence of ED pathway introduction. The ED-introduced strain, CRZ2e-ED, consumed glucose 1.5-fold faster than the parental strain. A pfkA deletion mutant of CRZ2e-ED (CRZ2e-EDΔpfkA) was also constructed to evaluate the effects of EMP pathway inactivation, which showed an almost identical rate of glucose consumption compared to that of the parental CRZ2e strain. The introduction of the ED pathway did not alter the intracellular NADH/NAD⁺ ratio, whereas it resulted in a slight increase in the ATP/ADP ratio. The recombinant strains with simultaneous overexpression of the genes for the EMP and ED pathways exhibited the highest ethanol productivity among all C. glutamicum strains ever constructed. CONCLUSIONS: The increased sugar consumption observed in ED-introduced strains was not a consequence of cofactor balance alterations, but rather the crucial coexistence of two active glycolytic pathways for enhanced glucose consumption. Coexistence of the ED and EMP pathways is a good strategy for improving biocatalyst productivity even when NADPH supply is not a limiting factor for fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aEscherichia coli 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aZymomonas mobilis 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiocatalysts 3abiofuels 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahypoxia 3amutants 3apyruvate decarboxylase 3avalue added1 aIgari, Takafumi1 aNoburyu, Ryoji1 aWatanabe, Akira1 aSuda, Masako1 aInui, Masayuki0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-021-01876-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245011100161300001800272500001900290520188000309592002802189650002102217650001502238650001902253650001502272650001702287650001402304650001202318650001502330650001402345650001302359650003202372650001302404650001602417650002602433650002502459700001602484700001902500700001702519700001502536700001902551773013502570856004802705852000902753655001202762IND6036614420221122055914.0210726e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603661442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-011-0693-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgado, R.10aAssessing the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in a full-scale activated sludge plant  ap. 1818-1827.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the removal mechanisms of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) and musks in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Biological removal and adsorption in the activated sludge tank as well as the effect of UV radiation used for disinfection purposes were considered when performing a mass balance on the WWTP throughout a 2-week sampling campaign. METHODS: Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was carried out to analyse the PhACs in the influent and effluent samples. Ultrasonic solvent extraction was used before SPE for PhACs analysis in sludge samples. PhAC extracts were analysed by LC-MS. Solid-phase microextraction of liquid and sludge samples was used for the analysis of musks, which were detected by GC-MS. The fluxes of the most abundant compounds (13 PhACs and 5 musks) out of 79 compounds studied were used to perform the mass balance on the WWTP. RESULTS: Results show that incomplete removal of diclofenac, the compound that was found in the highest abundance, was observed via biodegradation and adsorption, and that UV photolysis was the main removal mechanism for this compound. The effect of adsorption to the secondary sludge was often negligible for the PhACs, with the exceptions of diclofenac, etofenamate, hydroxyzine and indapamide. However, the musks showed a high level of adsorption to the sludge. UV radiation had an important role in reducing the concentration of some of the target compounds (e.g. diclofenac, ibuprofen, clorazepate, indapamide, enalapril and atenolol) not removed in the activated sludge tank. CONCLUSIONS: The main removal mechanism of PhACs and musks studied in the WWTP was most often biological (45%), followed by adsorption (33%) and by UV radiation (22%). In the majority of the cases, the WWTP achieved >75% removal of the most detected PhACs and musks, with the exception of diclofenac.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aadsorption 3abiodegradation 3adiclofenac 3adisinfection 3aibuprofen 3aliquids 3aphotolysis 3apollution 3aresearch 3asolid phase microextraction 3asolvents 3aultrasonics 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater treatment1 aMarques, R.1 aNoronha, J.

Alfaxalone gives less respiratory depression than propofol in some species. The aim of the investigation was to compare respiratory effects of propofol–ketamine–dexmedetomidine and alfaxalone–ketamine–dexmedetomidine in pigs. Sixteen pigs premedicated with ketamine 15 mg/kg and midazolam 1 mg/kg intramuscularly were anaesthetised with propofol or alfaxalone to allow endotracheal intubation, followed by propofol 8 mg/kg/h or alfaxalone 5 mg/kg/h in combination with ketamine 5 mg/kg/h and dexmedetomidine 4 µg/kg/h given as a continuous infusion for 60 min. The pigs breathed spontaneously with an FIO₂ of 0.21. Oxygen saturation (SpO₂), end-tidal CO₂ concentration (PE′CO₂), respiratory rate (fR) and inspired tidal volume (VT) were measured, and statistically compared between treatments. If the SpO₂ dropped below 80% or if PE′CO₂ increased above 10.0 kPa, the pigs were recorded as failing to complete the study, and time to failure was statistically compared between treatments. RESULTS: Alfaxalone treated pigs had significantly higher respiratory rates and lower PE′CO₂ than propofol treated pigs, with a fR being 7.3 /min higher (P = 0.01) and PE′CO₂ 0.8 kPa lower (P = 0.05). SpO₂ decreased by 0.6% and fR by 1.0 /min per kg increase in body weight in both treatment groups. Three of eight propofol treated and two of eight alfaxalone treated pigs failed to complete the study, and times to failure were not significantly different between treatments (P = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: No major differences in respiratory variables were found when comparing treatments. Respiratory supportive measures must be available when using both protocols.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalfaxalone 3aanesthesia 3abody weight 3acarbon dioxide 3adexmedetomidine 3aintravenous injection 3aketamine 3alung function 3aoxygen 3arespiratory rate 3aswine 3atidal volume1 aToverud, Simen Forr1 aKrontveit, Randi1 aHaga, Henning Andreas0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2020 Dec., v. 62, no. 1 p.14-14dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-020-0512-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015200167300001800319500001900337520164700356592002802003650001402031650001002045650001502055650001002070650001702080650001202097650001602109650001702125650001702142700001602159700001802175700002002193700006302213700002002276700006902296773012202365856008202487852000902569655001202578IND60710954520221116172546.0200914e20200806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071095452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.0c010332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Anjali10aTargeting Mitochondria in Tumor-Associated Macrophages using a Dendrimer-Conjugated TSPO Ligand that Stimulates Antitumor Signaling in Glioblastoma  ap. 3909-3922.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMitochondria mediate critical cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses; as such, their dysfunction is pathogenic in many neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In glioblastoma, targeted delivery of mitochondria-focused anticancer therapies has failed to translate into clinical success due to the nonspecific cellular localization, heterogeneity of receptor expression across patients, poor transport across biological barriers to reach the brain, tumor, and mitochondria, and systemic side effects. Strategies that can overcome brain and solid tumor barriers and selectively target mitochondria within specific cell types may lead to improvements in glioblastoma treatment. Developments in dendrimer-mediated nanomedicines have shown promise targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in glioblastoma, following systemic administration. Here, we present a novel dendrimer conjugated to the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) ligand 5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-α]pyrimidin-3-ylacetamide (DPA). We developed a clickable DPA for conjugation on the dendrimer surface and demonstrated in vitro that the dendrimer-DPA conjugate (D-DPA) significantly increases dendrimer colocalization with mitochondria. Compared to free TSPO ligand PK11195, D-DPA stimulates greater antitumor immune signaling. In vivo, we show that D-DPA targets mitochondria specifically within TAMs following systemic administration. Our results demonstrate that dendrimers can achieve TAM-specific targeting in glioblastoma and can be further modified to target specific intracellular compartments for organelle-specific drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3adendrimers 3adrugs 3aglioblastoma 3aligands 3amacrophages 3amitochondria 3ananomedicine1 aLiaw, Kevin1 aSharma, Rishi1 aThomas, Ajit G.1 aSlusher, Barbara S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9814-41571 aKannan, Sujatha1 aKannan, Rangaramanujam M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3712-78360 tBiomacromolecules.g2020 Aug. 06, v. 21, no. 9 p.3909-3922dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c010333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001800292520072200310592002801032650002301060650002301083650000901106650001401115650002101129650001201150650003301162650001601195653001501211653002601226653001501252653001901267653002301286653002101309700001901330700001301349700001501362700001701377700001501394700001201409773008201421856008101503852000901584655001201593IND60524429620221118173003.0161019e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052442962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Binglian10aStimuli-responsive organogels based on a gelator of hydrazide and azobenzene units connected via a flexible central spacer  ap. 5363-5368.  aAn organogelator named 1-[4-(4′-dodecyloxyphenylazo)phenoxy]-5- [(N-(4-nitrobenzoyl) -N′-(benzoyl-4′-oxy)hydrazine)] pentane (EN) formed stable organogel in THF.

In order to investigate the mechanism of neurotoxicity, rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons on the fourth day of culture were exposed to 5, 15, and 30 μg/mL nano-TiO2 for 24 h, and nano-TiO2 internalization, dendritic growth, glutamate metabolism, expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B), calcium homeostasis, sodium current (INa) and potassium current (IK) were examined. Our findings demonstrated that nano-TiO2 crossed the membrane into the cytoplasm or nucleus, and significantly suppressed dendritic growth of primary cultured hippocampal neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, nano-TiO2 induced a marked release of glutamate to the extracellular region, decreased glutamine synthetase activity and increased phosphate-activated glutaminase activity, elevated intracellular calcium ([Ca²⁺]i), down-regulated protein expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B, and increased the amplitudes of the INa and IK. In addition, nano-TiO2 increased nitric oxide and nitrice synthase, attenuated the activities of Ca²⁺-ATPase and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, and increased the ADP/ATP ratio in the primary neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate that nano-TiO2 inhibits neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons by interfering with glutamate metabolism and impairing NMDA receptor function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acalcium 3acytoplasm 3aenzyme activity 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutaminase 3ahomeostasis 3aneurites 3aneurotoxicity 3anitric oxide 3apotassium 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asodium 3atitanium dioxide 0aPrimary hippocampal neurons 0aNeurite outgrowth 0aTitanium dioxide nanoparticles 0aGlutamate metabolism 0aNMDA receptor function1 aSheng, Lei1 aZe, Yuguan1 aHong, Jie1 aZhou, Yingjun1 aWang, Ling1 aLiu, Dong1 aYu, Xiaohong1 aXu, Bingqing1 aZhao, Xiaoyang1 aZe, Xiao0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.76-85dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245010500209300001600314506007600330520107800406592002801484506003701512650001701549650001201566650001201578650001201590650001301602650001501615650002201630650001301652650001501665650001201680650001401692650001901706650001101725650001801736650001901754651001001773700002301783700001701806700002001823700002101843700001801864700001301882700001701895700001901912700002001931773008801951856008102039852000902120655001202129IND50090036020221207101911.0141211e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009003602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-014-9650-z2doi7 aPMC44741632pmcid7 a260972672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrgenson, Lauren10aTraditional Livelihoods, Conservation and Meadow Ecology in Jiuzhaigou National Park, Sichuan, China  ap. 481-491.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJiuzhaigou National Park (JNP) is a site of global conservation significance. Conservation policies in JNP include the implementation of two national reforestation programs to increase forest cover and the exclusion of local land-use. We use archaeological excavation, ethnographic interviews, remote sensing and vegetation surveys to examine the implications of these policies for non-forest, montane meadows. We find that Amdo Tibetan people cultivated the valley for >2,000 years, creating and maintaining meadows through land clearing, burning and grazing. Meadows served as sites for gathering plants and mushrooms and over 40 % of contemporary species are ethnobotanically useful. Remote sensing analyses indicate a substantial (69.6 %) decline in meadow area between 1974 and 2004. Respondents report a loss of their “true history” and connections to the past associated with loss of meadows. Conservation policies intended to preserve biodiversity are unintentionally contributing to the loss of these ecologically and culturally significant meadow habitats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3aburning 3aforests 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alivelihood 3ameadows 3amushrooms 3anational parks 3apeople 3areforestation 3aremote sensing 3aChina1 aSchmidt, Amanda H.1 aCombs, Julie1 aHarrell, Stevan1 aHinckley, Thomas1 aYang, Qingxia1 aMa, Ziyu1 aYongxian, Li1 aHongliang, Lü1 aMacIver, Andrew0 tHuman ecology.g2014 June, v. 42, no. 3 p.481-491dSpringer-Verlagx0300-78397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-014-9650-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009100170300001600261520104900277592002801326650002301354650002101377650001601398650001601414650001301430650002101443650001501464650001901479650001701498650000901515650001501524653002101539653001501560653002301575653001501598653001901613700001901632700005701651773010601708856008701814852000901901655001201910IND60611241320221119003935.0201202e20181020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061124132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.06.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kwang Se10aSynthesis of ZnO/activated carbon with high surface area for supercapacitor electrodes  ap. 482-490.  aThis research demonstrated that zinc oxide (ZnO) and activated carbon with specific surface area were prepared and applied as supercapacitor electrodes.

Zinc precursor solution was mixed with activated carbon by precipitation method depending on the concentration and type of precursor. These composites were well grown on the surface of activated carbon which not only exhibited diverse morphology but also affected the specific surface area. The specific capacitance of ZnO/activated carbon composites reached a maximum value of 155 F/g at 0.5 A/g within a potential window of −1.0 to 0 V in Na₂SO₄, and both activated carbon derived from Chlorella vulgaris and asphaltene exhibited excellent cycle retention during 1000 charging/discharging cycles.

This article describes the reproductive biology of Sabellaria wilsoni on a beach of the Amazon coast. Each month between May 2008 and April 2009, specimens were collected for morphometric and histological analyses for sexing and determination of gonadal maturity. In females, the number and diameter of the oocytes at different stages of vitellogenesis were also recorded. The results showed that the species is dioecious, with sexual reproduction, females larger than males, and a female-biased sex ratio (overall, 1.6♀: 1♂). Four distinct stages of gonadal maturation were identified in the males and females – (i) initial development, (ii) maturing, (iii) mature and (iv) spawning. Sexual maturity is attained rapidly, and reproduction is continuous, with two breeding peaks, one in the dry season, related to the increased intensity of hydrodynamic conditions and reef erosion; and the other in the rainy season, when the availability of space and nutrients increases. The reproductive strategy of the species reinforces the classification of the sabellariids as r-strategists, adapted to colonize habitats with unstable environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aReproduction 0abiogenic reef-forming worm 0asabellariids 0aAmazon beach 0aBrazil1 aPinto, A.J.A.1 aFerreira, M.A.P.1 aRocha, R.M.1 aRosa Filho, J.S.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2018 June, v. 98, no. 4 p.743-754dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154160017763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011100164300001100275520145700286592002801743596008101771650002001852650001401872650001201886650001301898650001601911650001101927650001401938650001801952650001701970650002301987650001102010650003002021650002102051650004402072650000702116650001502123650001902138650002102157700001302178700001802191700001602209700001502225700001802240700001702258700001202275700001502287700001302302700001602315700001602331700001802347700001502365700001502380700001702395700001402412773015602426856008302582852000902665655001202674IND60728128920221121024118.0211229e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072812892DNAL7 a10.1186/s40538-021-00212-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Chenxi10aStructure of β-glucan from Tibetan hull-less barley and its in vitro fermentation by human gut microbiota  ap. 12.  aBACKGROUND: The influence of β-glucan on the human gut microbiota is closely related to the physicochemical structure of β-glucan. We purified a homogeneous water-soluble polysaccharide from Tibetan hull-less barley 25 and studied its structure and the in vitro fermentation profile. RESULTS: Analysis by gas chromatography (GC), Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force micrograph (AFM) helped determine the hull-less barley polysaccharide to be a β-glucan (molecular weight: 3.45 × 10⁴ Da), which was further characterized as mixed-linkage (1 → 3)(1 → 4)-linked β-D-glucans. SEM images demonstrated an intricate web structure of the hull-less barley polysaccharide, while the AFM images revealed the presence of small spherical particles in its structure. In addition, the microbiota composition of the hull-less barley polysaccharide group was found to be altered, wherein the abundance of Pantoea, Megamonas, Bifidobacterium, and Prevotella-9 were increased. On the other hand, in vitro fermentation revealed that hull-less barley polysaccharide significantly decreased the pH value and increased the production of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. CONCLUSIONS: Hull-less barley polysaccharide is a type of dietary fiber, and its analysis suggested that it may serve as a prebiotic food supplement for the regulation of the gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018JM3008cNatural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China 3aBifidobacterium 3aMegamonas 3aPantoea 3aacetates 3aagriculture 3abarley 3abutyrates 3adietary fiber 3afermentation 3agas chromatography 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aprebiotics 3apropionic acid 3awater solubility1 aYan, Xin1 aXie, Xiaoqing1 aZhang, Ziqi1 aZhu, Jiang1 aWang, Yangfan1 aWang, Xinlei1 aXu, Nan1 aLuo, Yiwen1 aSa, Zhen1 aLi, Xinyang1 aLiu, Huicui1 aTian, Baoming1 aMa, Qingyu1 aZhang, Min1 aChen, Zhifei1 aLi, Juxiu0 tChemical and biological technologies in agriculture.g2021 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.12-12dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:27327x2196-56417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40538-021-00212-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245015600162300001600318520151000334592002801844650001501872650001501887650002301902650001001925650001401935653001701949653001501966653001601981653001501997700001602012700002002028700001402048773011302062856008102175852000902256655001202265IND60623958820221120234459.0181204e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062395882DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772145566682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleine, S A14aThe effect of midazolam on the recovery quality, recovery time and the minimum alveolar concentration for extubation in the isoflurane-anesthetized pig  ap. 111-116.  aThere are no reported studies evaluating the effect of midazolam on recovery quality, recovery time or minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) at which extubation occurs (MACₑₓₜᵤbₐₜᵢₒₙ). Our hypotheses were that midazolam administered prior to recovery would decrease MACₑₓₜᵤbₐₜᵢₒₙ, prolong recovery time but provide a smoother recovery. Sixteen Yorkshire pigs were anesthetized with isoflurane for approximately 5 h. The end-tidal isoflurane concentration was then stabilized at 1.4% for 20 min. Pigs were randomly assigned to receive midazolam or saline. The vaporizer was decreased by 10% every 10 min until extubation. Pigs were declared awake by a blinded observer and were assigned a recovery score by the same observer. Mean MACₑₓₜᵤbₐₜᵢₒₙ was not significantly different for pigs receiving saline prior to recovery compared with those pigs receiving midazolam. The overall mean MACₑₓₜᵤbₐₜᵢₒₙ for both groups was 0.6 ± 0.4 vol%. Time to extubation was not significantly longer with midazolam (124 ± 36 min) compared with the saline group (96 ± 61 min; P = 0.09). Recovery score was not significantly different between groups (midazolam, 0.86 ± 1.1; saline 0.5 ± 0.5; P = 0.26). In conclusion, midazolam did not affect MACₑₓₜᵤbₐₜᵢₒₙ. There was no advantage of administering midazolam in the recovery period when performing step-down titration of isoflurane anesthesia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3aisoflurane 3alaboratory animals 3aswine 3atitration 0apharmacology 0aphysiology 0aanaesthesia 0atechniques1 aQuandt, J E1 aHofmeister, E H1 aPeroni, J0 tLaboratory animals.g2015 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.111-116dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772145566683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002700132024001100159040001800170100002200188245015200210300001300362506017300375520146500548650001402013650001602027650002202043650002202065650002302087650001402110650002602124650001302150650003302163650001802196650001702214650002202231650001602253650002102269650002302290700002702313773011202340856011202452856007302564956009402637961000902731852000902740655001202749IND60006034820221214225550.0150219e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000603482DNAL7 a2968292aris7 a10113/603482hdl7 a10.1002/APP.406092doi8 ans6581  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshby, Richard D.10aSophorolipid-induced dimpling and increased porosity in solvent-cast short-chain polyhydroxyalkanoate films: impact on thermo-mechanical properties  ap. 1-11.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSophorolipids (SL; microbial glycolipids) were used as additives in solvent-cast short-chain polyhydroxyalkanoate (sc-PHA) films to enhance surface roughness and porosity. Poly-3- hydroxybutyrate (PHB), poly-(6%)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(94%)-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHB/V), and poly-(90%)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(10%)-3-hydroxyhexanoate (PHB/HHx) films were evaluated with up to 43 wt% of SL. Sophorolipid addition caused surface dimples with maximum diameters of 131.8 micrometers (PHB), 25.2 micrometers (PHB/V), and 102.8 micrometers (PHB/HHx). A rise in the size and number of pores in the polymer matrix also occurred in PHB and PHB/V films. Surface roughness and film porosity were visualized by scanning electron microscopy and quantitated using confocal microscopy by correlating the surface area (A’) to the scanned area (A) of the films. The phenotypic alterations of the films caused a gradual decline in tensile strength and modulus and increased the elongation to break. Reductions in the enthalpies of fusion (Delta Hf) in both the PHB (41% reduction) and PHB/HHx (36% reduction) films indicated diminished crystallinity as SL concentrations increased. Over the same SL concentrations the Tan Delta maxima shifted from 4 degrees C to 30 degrees C and from 2 degrees C to 20 degrees C in these respective films. These results provide a potential new use for SL and a novel means by which sc-PHA properties can be controlled for new/improved applications. 3aadditives 3acorrelation 3acrystal structure 3afilms (materials) 3amodulus of rupture 3aphenotype 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asophorolipids 3asurface area 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3athermal properties1 aSolaiman, Daniel K.

(Cordiaceae, Boraginales) with phylogenetic implications  ap. 9-24.  aDespite their ecological importance and wide distribution, Cordiaceae have not been subject to detailed anatomical study yet. We examined flower and fruit anatomies of Cordia nodosa and Varronia bonplandii (using paraffin sectioning and light microscopy) in comparison with other woody members of Boraginales. The internal architecture of the superior bicarpellate ovary resulted from the development of secondary septa including apical, basal and false septa, as reported also from other Boraginales. Novel characters of Cordiaceae were identified such as an extensive tissue surrounding the gynoecium of C. nodosa and a lignified cap on top of the endocarp in V. bonplandii. Fruits containing a single seed may have originated several times independently in Cordiaceae deriving from the four-seeded condition present today in most other non-capsular Boraginales. Distyly of V. bonplandii does not appear genetically fixed but may result from different ecological conditions. Hemianatropous ovules are now considered the derived character state in Cordiaceae, originating from anatropous ovules present in other Boraginales. Studies like this improve the knowledge about generative organs in general and identify phylogenetically informative characters. However, better knowledge of functional morphology and ecological importance regarding many traits identified require further investigations on the diversity of Cordiaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordia 3aCordiaceae 3aendocarp 3aflowers 3aovules 3aphylogeny1 aKretschmann, Juliane1 aHilger, Hartmut H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1409-172X1 aGottschling, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4381-80510 tOrganisms, diversity, & evolution.g2020 Mar., v. 20, no. 1 p.9-24dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001769x1439-60927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13127-019-00420-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012400164300001000288520184900298592002802147596005902175596008202234650001402316650002002330650001002350650001502360650001302375650001702388650001402405650003302419650001702452700001202469700001602481700001802497700001802515700001502533700001402548700001602562700001302578700001802591773009402609856008302703852000902786655001202795IND60728129020221121024258.0211219e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072812902DNAL7 a10.1186/s41065-021-00174-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yucheng10aDevelopment and analysis of long non-coding RNA-associated competing endogenous RNA network for osteosarcoma metastasis  ap. 9.  aBACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the primary bone malignant neoplasm that often develops metastasis. Increasing evidences have shown that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) relate to the progression of osteosarcoma. However, the ncRNAs’ roles in osteosarcoma metastasis are still unknown. METHODS: Differentially expressed (DE) RNAs were identified from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) of DE messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) was built through STRING database. The target mRNAs and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) of microRNAs (miRNA) were predicted through miRDB, Targetscan and Genecode databases, which then cross-checked with previously obtained DERNAs to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. All networks were visualized via Cytoscape and the hub RNAs were screened out through Cytoscape plug-in Cytohubba. The gene functional and pathway analyses were performed through DAVID and MirPath databases. The survival analyses of hub RNAs were obtained through Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves. RESULTS: Five hundred sixty-four DEmRNAs, 16 DElncRNAs and 22 DEmiRNAs were screened out. GO functional and KEGG pathway analyses showed that DERNAs were significantly associated with tumor metastasis. The ceRNA network including 6 lncRNAs, 55 mRNAs and 20 miRNAs were constructed and the top 10 hub RNAs were obtained. Above all, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was identified as the most important osteosarcoma metastasis-associated pathway and its hub ceRNA module was constructed. The survival analyses showed that the RNAs in hub ceRNA module closely related to osteosarcoma patients’ prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provided a new perspective on osteosarcoma metastasis. More importantly, the RNAs in hub ceRNA module might act as the novel therapeutic targets and prognostic factors for osteosarcoma patients.  aPublisher supplied data  a81702661cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016Y0143cYouth Foundation of Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission 3adatabases 3agene expression 3agenes 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3aosteosarcoma 3aprognosis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atherapeutics1 aLiu, Qi1 aBao, Qiyuan1 aWen, Junxiang1 aLiu, Zhuochao1 aHu, Yuehao1 aHe, Guoyu1 aPeng, Cheng1 aXu, Yiqi1 aZhang, Weibin0 tHereditas.g2021 Dec., v. 158, no. 1 p.9-9dBioMed CentralwJournal:6164x1601-52237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41065-021-00174-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245012700181300001600308520138300324592002801707653001601735653001901751653002001770653001201790653001801802653002301820700002901843700003001872700002801902700003101930773016701961856008102128852000902209655001202218IND60651131620221119173346.0190711e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065113162DNAL7 a10.1017/S002531541600179X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstupiñán-Montaño, Colombo10aDiet of three shark species in the Ecuadorian Pacific, Carcharhinus falciformis, Carcharhinus limbatus and Nasolamia velox  ap. 927-935.  aWe analysed the stomach contents of 69 silky sharks Carcharhinus falciformis, 44 blacktip sharks Carcharhinus limbatus and 24 whitenose sharks Nasolamia velox caught in the Ecuadorian Pacific from August 2003 to December 2004. Prey included bony fishes, elasmobranchs, molluscs, crustaceans and turtles, with bony fishes being the most important to the diets of all three sharks, suggesting they are piscivorous predators. Based on the index of relative importance, the C. falciformis diet includes Thunnus albacares, Thunnus sp. and Auxis thazard, as well as some squid, fish and turtles. Similarly, the C. limbatus diet was dominated by T. albacares, Exocoetus monocirrhus, A. thazard, Katsuwonus pelamis, members of the Ophichthidae family and other elasmobranchs. Meanwhile, N. velox consumed mainly Dosidicus gigas, Larimus argenteus, Cynoscion sp. and Lophiodes spilurus. There is little competition for food between these tertiary carnivores: C. limbatus prefers prey from coastal-oceanic habitats; C. falciformis consumes mostly oceanic prey and N. velox focuses on prey from coastal habitats. The lack of information on the biology of sharks in Ecuador hinders the development of appropriate management and conservation plans to protect shark resources. This study increases our knowledge and understanding of sharks in Ecuador, thus contributing to their conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSilky shark 0ablacktip shark 0awhitenose shark 0afeeding 0atrophic level 0aEcuadorian Pacific1 aPacheco-Triviño, Fabian1 aCedeño-Figueroa, Luis G.1 aGalván-Magaña, Felipe1 aEstupiñán-Ortiz, Jose F.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2018 June, v. 98, no. 4 p.927-935dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002531541600179X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04097naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001600187245011300203300001200316506007600328520205400404592002802458506003702486650001802523650001702541650001702558650002802575650001902603650001702622650001702639650002002656650002502676650001802701650001702719650001602736650001602752650001602768650001902784650002902803650001802832650004202850650003002892650002802922650001502950650001502965650000902980650002102989700001903010700001403029700001703043700001603060700001803076700001803094700001803112700001603130700001703146700001203163700001503175773013103190856008103321852000903402655001203411IND60574950120221207083536.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057495012DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-3862doi7 aPMC41973442pmcid7 a253008182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dawei14aThe effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 on the intestinal microbiota of a hyperlipidemic rat model  ap. 386.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that intestinal microbiota regulate our metabolism. Probiotics confer health benefits that may depend on their ability to affect the gut microbiota. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of supplementation with the probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus hsryfm 1301, on the gut microbiota in a hyperlipidemic rat model, and to explore the associations between the gut microbiota and the serum lipids. METHODS: The hyperlipidemic rat model was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet for 28 d. The rats’ gut microbiota were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing before and after L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 supplementation or its fermented milk for 28 d. The serum lipids level was also tested. RESULTS: The rats’ primary gut microbiota were composed of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Verrucomicrobia. The abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota generally decreased after feeding with a high-fat diet, with a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, but with an increase in that of Firmicutes (P < 0.05). Administration of L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 or its fermented milk for 28 d, could recover the Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia abundance and could decrease the Firmicutes abundance, which was associated with a significant reduction in the serum lipids’ level in the hyperlipidemic rats with high-fat diet induced. The abundance of 22 genera of gut bacteria was changed significantly after probiotic intervention for 28 d (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between Ruminococcus spp. and serum triglycerides, Dorea spp. and serum cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and Enterococcus spp. and high-density lipoprotein. The Butyrivibrio spp. negatively correlated with TC and LDL-C. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the lipid metabolism of hyperlipidemic rats was improved by regulating the gut microbiota with supplementation of L.rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 or its fermented milk for 28 d.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroidetes 3aButyrivibrio 3aEnterococcus 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aProteobacteria 3aRuminococcus 3aSpirochaetes 3aVerrucomicrobia 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal models 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acorrelation 3afermented milk 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh fat diet 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alow density lipoprotein 3ametabolism 3aprobiotics 3arats 3atriacylglycerols1 aYang, Zhenquan1 aChen, Xia1 aHuang, Yujun1 aYin, Boxing1 aGuo, Feixiang1 aZhao, Haiqing1 aZhao, Tangyan1 aQu, Henxian1 aHuang, Jiadi1 aWu, Yun1 aGu, Ruixia0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.386-386dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-3863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008400175300001800259520084800277592002801125650002301153650002301176650001901199650002201218653001401240653001801254653001801272653002401290653002901314653001501343700002501358700002801383700002101411773008901432856008401521852000901605655001201614IND60524430020221117225604.0161019e20160803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052443002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.06.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSravanthi, Kadavergu10aSynthesis of carbazole analogs via Grob fragmentation of norbornyl α-diketones  ap. 3449-3452.  aA regioselective synthesis of carbazole analogs belonging to both the categories of natural origin, viz., microorganisms and higher plant source is reported. The synthesis of carbazole derivatives possessing a methylester group at C-1 position has been achieved by Cadogan cyclization of nitro bi-phenyl derivatives, whereas, the carbazole analog possessing a methylester group at C-3 position was synthesized by Buchwald–Hartwig Pd-catalyzed cyclization of amino bi-phenyl derivatives. Suitably substituted bi-phenyl precursors were accessed from norbornyl α-diketones via Grob fragmentation, O-methylation and DBU aromatization reaction sequence. The reported carbazole derivatives possess structural features that are common with many carbazole natural products: mukonine, clausine-L, murrayafoline-A, and their sibling natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic compounds 0aDiketones 0aFragmentation 0aAromatization 0aCadogan cyclization 0aPd-catalyzed cyclization 0aCarbazoles1 aAgrawal, Sumit Kumar1 aRao, Chintada Nageswara1 aKhan, Faiz Ahmed0 tTetrahedron letters.g2016 Aug. 03, v. 57 p.3449-3452dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.06.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04583naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013600166300001800302520227500320592002802595596007502623596005002698596005102748596005602799596004702855596004702902650002102949650001302970650001302983650001302996650001203009650001103021650001303032650001103045650001303056650001103069650004103080650002003121650001503141650001203156650001603168650001503184650001403199650002803213650004303241650001403284650005203298650001603350650001503366650001103381650000903392650001203401650002003413650001703433650001103450700001803461700001803479700001703497700001803514700001503532700002403547700001603571700005803587773011303645856008203758852000903840655001203849IND60671431320221118213912.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067143132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-019-03228-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tie-Yuan10aComparative metabolite profiling of two switchgrass ecotypes reveals differences in drought stress responses and rhizosheath weight  ap. 1355-1369.  aMAIN CONCLUSION: Rhizosheath comprises soil that adheres firmly to roots. In this study, two ecotypes of switchgrass with different rhizosheath sizes after drought stress were analyzed which showed metabolic differences under drought conditions. The rhizosheath comprises soil that adheres firmly to roots by a combination of root hairs and mucilage and may aid in root growth under soil drying. The aim of this work is to reveal the potential metabolites involved in rhizosheath formation under drought stress conditions. Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass), which belongs to the Poaceae family, is an important biofuel and fodder crop in drought areas. Five switchgrass ecotypes (cv. Alamo, cv. Blackwake, cv. Summer, cv. Cave-in-Rock and cv. Kanlow) have a broad range of rhizosheath weight under drought conditions. For two selected ecotypes with contrast rhizosheath weight (cv. Alamo and cv. Kanlow), root hair length and density, lateral root number, root morphological parameters were measured, and real-time qRT-PCR was performed. Gas chromatography mass spectrophotometry (GC–MS) was used to determine the primary metabolites in the shoots and roots of selected ecotypes under drought stress conditions. The change trends of root hair length and density, lateral root number and related gene expression were consistent with rhizosheath weight in Alamo and Kanlow under drought and watered conditions. For root morphological parameters, Alamo grew deeper than Kanlow, while Kanlow exhibited higher values for other parameters. In this study, the levels of amino acids, sugars and organic acids were significantly changed in response to drought stress in two switchgrass ecotypes. Several metabolites including amino acids (arginine, isoleucine, methionine and cysteine) and sugars (kestose, raffinose, fructose, fucose, sorbose and xylose) in the large soil-sheathed roots of Alamo and Kanlow were significantly increased compared to small or no soil-sheathed roots of Alamo and Kanlow. Difference in rhizosheath size is reflected in the plant internal metabolites under drought stress conditions. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of using metabolite profiling and provide a better understanding of rhizosheath formation at the cellular level.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0301502cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aAoE/M-05/12cHong Kong Research Grant Council  aAoE/M-403/16cHong Kong Research Grant Council  aGRF CUHK 14160516cHong Kong Research Grant Council  a14177617cHong Kong Research Grant Council  a12100318cHong Kong Research Grant Council 3aPanicum virgatum 3aarginine 3abiofuels 3acysteine 3adrought 3adrying 3aecotypes 3aforage 3afructose 3afucose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agene expression 3aisoleucine 3akestose 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3amucilages 3aorganic acids and salts 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araffinose 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroot growth 3aroot hairs 3ashoots 3asoil 3asorbose 3astress response 3awater stress 3axylose1 aChen, Mo-Xian1 aZhang, Youjun1 aZhu, Fu-Yuan1 aLiu, Ying-Gao1 aTian, Yuan1 aFernie, Alisdair R.1 aYe, Nenghui1 aZhang, Jianhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3942-57970 tPlanta.g2019 Oct., v. 250, no. 4 p.1355-1369dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03228-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04072naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245012300179300001400302500001500316520236900331592002802700650002902728650002002757650001602777650001202793650001202805650001902817650001002836650001102846650002402857650001202881650001002893650001302903650001102916650001602927650001102943650001102954651001102965653001202976653002902988653001203017653001503029653001603044653002103060653001103081700002703092700002303119700002003142700002303162700002103185700002503206700002803231773011503259856008703374852000903461655001203470IND60563242320221119130750.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056324232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2017.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrantsæter, Margrethe10aAccess to litter during rearing and environmental enrichment during production reduce fearfulness in adult laying hens  ap. 49-56.  a2019-12-06  aExaggerated fear-reactions are associated with injurious flying, smothering, feather pecking and other events that compromise animal welfare in laying hens. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that chicks with access to litter during the first five weeks of life would be less fearful as adult hens compared to birds reared without access to litter. The hypothesis was tested in a national on-farm study in commercial aviary flocks in Norway. Five rearing farmers divided the pullets into two groups within their rearing houses. While the chicks were enclosed inside the aviary rows during the first five weeks of life, paper substrate where food and other particles could accumulate, covered the wire mesh floor in the treatment group, whereas the control group was reared on bare wire mesh. At 30 weeks of age, 23 aviary flocks (11 control flocks reared without paper and 12 treatment flocks reared with paper) were visited. During the visit, the fearfulness of the adult birds was tested in a stationary person test and a novel object test. The data was analysed by ANOVA or logistic regression as appropriate. The access to litter during rearing did not influence the number of birds that approached within 25cm of the stationary person (p=0.51). All flocks, regardless of rearing treatment, had birds which came within 2m of the stationary person. The latency to approach within 2m of the stationary person tended to be influenced by provision of environmental enrichment as adults (p=0.08) and by the interaction between treatment×rearing farm (p=0.08). The number of birds that approached within 2m of the stationary person was influenced by the interaction between treatment during rearing and provision of enrichment as adults (p=0.03), however, the post hoc test showed no pairwise differences. All flocks, regardless of rearing treatment, had birds that approached the novel object. The access to litter during rearing did not influence the birds’ latency to approach the novel object. The number of birds approaching the novel object was affected by the interaction between access to substrate during rearing and provision of environmental enrichment as adults (p=0.05). The results indicate that both adding paper substrate to chicks from the first day of life and environmental enrichment as adults, reduce fearfulness in laying hens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental enrichment 3afeather pecking 3alaying hens 3arearing 3afarmers 3aanimal welfare 3afarms 3aflocks 3aregression analysis 3apullets 3apaper 3aaviaries 3aflight 3afearfulness 3achicks 3aadults 3aNorway 0aRearing 0aEnvironmental enrichment 0aWelfare 0aLaying hen 0aFearfulness 0alitter (bedding) 0aLitter1 aTahamtani, Fernanda M.1 aNordgreen, Janicke1 aSandberg, Ellen1 aHansen, Tone Beate1 aRodenburg, T.Bas1 aMoe, Randi Oppermann1 aJanczak, Andrew Michael0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2017 Apr., v. 189 p.49-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2017.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002100197245007200218300001600290506007600306520169300382592002802075506003702103650002002140650001802160650001002178650001602188650001802204650001402222650002702236650002402263650001102287650001102298650001202309650001302321653001502334653001802349653001802367653001102385700002802396700002502424700002402449700002602473773009202499856009002591852000902681655001202690IND60603490220221207082936.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060349022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0702doi7 aPMC44056672pmcid7 a258907532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerd, Heather L.10aMacrophage silica nanoparticle response is phenotypically dependent  ap. 574-582.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhagocytes are important players in host exposure to nanomaterials. Macrophages in particular are believed to be among the “first responders” and primary cell types that uptake and process nanoparticles, mediating host biological responses by subsequent interactions with inflammatory signaling pathways and immune cells. However, variations in local microenvironmental cues can significantly change the functional and phenotype of these cells, impacting nanoparticle uptake and overall physiological response. Herein we focus on describing the response of specific RAW 264.7 macrophage phenotypes (M1, INF-gamma/LPS induced and M2, IL-4 induced) to Stöber silica nanoparticle exposure in vitro and how this response might correlate with macrophage response to nanoparticles in vivo. It was observed that variations in macrophage phenotype produce significant differences in macrophage morphology, silica nanoparticle uptake and toxicity. High uptake was observed in M1, versus low uptake in M2 cells. M2 cells also displayed more susceptibility to concentration dependent proliferative effects, suggesting potential M1 involvement in in vivo uptake. Nanoparticles accumulated within liver and spleen tissues, with high association with macrophages within these tissues and an overall Th1 response in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo studies are consistent in demonstrating that silica nanoparticles exhibit high macrophage sequestration, particularly those with Th1/M1 phenotype and in clearance organs. This sequestration and phenotypic response should be a primary consideration when designing new Stöber silica nanoparticle systems, as it might affect the overall efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ain vivo studies 3ainterleukin-4 3aliver 3amacrophages 3ananoparticles 3aphenotype 3aphysiological response 3asignal transduction 3asilica 3aspleen 3atissues 3atoxicity 0aMacrophage 0aNanoparticles 0aDrug delivery 0aSilica1 aBartlett, Kristopher T.1 aGustafson, Joshua A.1 aMcGill, Lawrence D.1 aGhandehari, Hamidreza0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.574-582dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013800177300001600315520171300331592002802044650001302072650001502085650002602100650002802126650001602154650001902170650001102189650001802200650001602218650001202234653002802246653002602274653001702300653001702317653001402334653003202348700001902380773010602399856008702505852000902592655001202601IND60611241820221119003900.0201202e20181020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061124182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChattopadhyay, Ankur10aDeterministic role of frequency, amplitude and concentration regimes on the complex dielectric relaxation of colloidal complex fluids  ap. 304-313.  aThe present article explores the governing roles played by concentration regimes, frequency and amplitude of the forcing electric field on the dynamic dielectric responses of nanocolloidal non-polar suspensions. Frequency dependent complex dielectric constants were determined in the band of 1 to 10⁷ Hz at constant temperature via dielectric spectroscopy. In addition to prevalant literature measurements, influence of field amplitude has also been performed to investigate the role of electric field intensity upon the relaxation behaviors. The experimental observations reveal that variation of frequency, as well as choice of particle material significantly influences the dielectric responses of nanocolloids. Further, the amplitude of field is found to induce differences in the dielectric response. It is also observed that the relaxation responses are grossly different for concentrated dispersions than the dilute counterparts. The concentration regimes are observed to bring about overlapping relaxation responses in the colloids. Good degree of quantitative agreement has been found between the experimental observations and the generic Havriliak-Negami relaxation model. It has been shown that for a given nanomaterial, reduction of relaxation timescale is a direct consequence of enhancement in concentration and the colloids transit from predominantly storage to leaky systems with concentration regimes. Additionally, the reported volume diffusion mechanism (VDM) is found to be in compliance with the experimental findings. The occurrence and shift of peaks and valleys in the dielectric spectra has been explained based on dielectric response theories for electrically heterogeneous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3acompliance 3adielectric properties 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adispersions 3aelectric field 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3atemperature 3avalleys 0aDielectric spectroscopy 0aDielectric relaxation 0aNanocolloils 0aPolarization 0aNanofluid 0aHavriliak-Negami relaxation1 aDhar, Purbarun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 20, v. 555 p.304-313dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009600162300001700258520164600275592002801921650004401949650003701993650001102030650001202041650002402053650001302077650002402090650003402114650001602148700001202164700001702176773009702193856008402290852000902374655001202383IND60085587920221120075055.0141101e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008558792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2011.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Min10aHydrothermal synthesis, characterization, and KOH activation of carbon spheres from glucose  ap. 999-1004.  aCarbon spheres (CSs) with controllable sizes and rich in oxygen-containing groups were fabricated using a simple hydrothermal treatment of glucose.

The results revealed that the morphologies and size distribution of the CSs can be controlled by adjusting the experimental parameters. A hydrothermal temperature between 180 and 190°C over 4–5h was suitable for CS formation. Under these conditions, the size of the CS increased with the concentration of glucose. Mono-dispersed CSs with good morphologies and large numbers of oxygen-containing functional groups (primarily –OH and CO) can be obtained using a 0.3mol/L glucose solution that is hydrothermally treated at 190°C for 4h. The resulting CSs sizes were about 350nm in diameter. After a second hydrothermal treatment, the sizes of CSs grew nearly 250nm without damage to its morphology or broadening of their size distribution. Porous CSs with perfectly spherical shapes and fully developed structures (SBET=1282.8m²/g, Vₘᵢcᵣₒ=0.44cm³/g) could then be obtained via KOH activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3aglucose 3ahot water treatment 3anitrogen 3apotassium hydroxide 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atemperature1 aLi, Wei1 aLiu, Shouxin0 tCarbohydrate research.g2011 June 1, v. 346, no. 8 p.999-1004dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2011.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001600257520120300273592002801476650002401504650001301528650001501541650002001556650001301576650001601589650001101605650001001616650002201626650002101648650001101669650001101680650001501691650002201706650002001728650001001748650001501758650001101773650001201784650001501796700001401811700001701825700001401842700002101856700002201877700003001899700001901929773013101948856008202079961001302161852000902174655001202183IND60620752720221120144516.0201112e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062075272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-018-0300-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongwei10aCharacterization of cell lines derived from the southern armyworm, Spodoptera eridania  ap. 749-755.  aSpodoptera eridania (southern armyworm) is a polyphagous pest of many plants, including field crops, vegetables, fruits, and ornamentals. Larvae are leaf feeders, defoliating many crops in the tropics and subtropics of the western hemisphere. In this study, cell lines from S. eridania were established to support research focused on the development of advanced pest management technologies. We generated seven cell lines from larval tissues: three from nervous tissues, two from testes, and two from fat bodies. These cell lines have been passaged 18–57 times, indicating they are established lines. They are maintained in EX-CELL 420 or a combination of L15 + EX-CELL 420 media. The identities of the cell lines were confirmed by DAF-PCR and their doubling times ranged from 42 to 110 h. Microscopy indicated the presence of one or more morphologically distinct cell types in each cell line. We identified a catalase gene in all seven cell lines. H₂O₂ treatment suppressed the expression of catalase and led to a reduction in catalase activity. This is the first report of cell lines established from S. eridania, and these cell lines are now available to researchers worldwide on request.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera eridania 3acatalase 3acell lines 3aenzyme activity 3afat body 3afield crops 3afruits 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro studies 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amicroscopy 3aornamental plants 3apest management 3apests 3asubtropics 3atestes 3atropics 3avegetables1 aLi, Yaofa1 aReall, Tamra1 aXu, Yiyun1 aGoodman, Cynthia1 aSaathoff, Stephen1 aRingbauer, Joseph, JrcJr1 aStanley, David0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2018 Dec., v. 54, no. 10 p.749-755dSpringer USwJournal:jnl50084x1071-26907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-018-0300-43Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245013500171300001600306520157800322592002801900650002501928650001901953650002001972650001301992650002402005650001002029650001102039650001202050650001902062650001802081650001302099650001502112653003302127653001702160653001802177653002502195653001502220653001702235700001302252700001802265700002002283700001202303700001602315700001602331700001402347700001302361700001402374700002102388700001702409700001802426773009202444856009002536852000902626655001202635IND60603490320221122222320.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060349032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao10aNanoparticle delivery of stable miR-199a-5p agomir improves the osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells via the HIF1a pathway  ap. 239-250.  aElucidating the regulatory mechanisms of osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) is important for the development of cell therapies for bone loss and regeneration. Here we showed that hsa-miR-199a-5p modulated osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs at both early and late stages through HIF1a pathway. hsa-miR-199a expression was up-regulated during osteogenesis for both of two mature forms, miR-199a-5p and -3p. Over-expression of miR-199a-5p but not -3p enhanced differentiation of hMSCs in vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-199a-5p reduced the expression of osteoblast-specific genes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and mineralization. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-199a enhanced ectopic bone formation in vivo. Chitosan nanoparticles were used for delivery of stable modified hsa-miR-199a-5p (agomir) both in vitro and in vivo, as a proof-of-concept for stable agomir delivery on bone regeneration. The hsa-mir199a-5p agomir were mixed with Chitosan nanoparticles to form nanoparticle/hsa-mir199a-5p agomir plasmid (nanoparticle/agomir) complexes, and nanoparticle/agomir complexes could improve the in vivo regeneration of bone. Further mechanism studies revealed that hypoxia enhanced osteogenesis at early stage and inhibited osteogenesis maturation at late stage through HIF1a-Twist1 pathway. At early stage of differentiation, hypoxia induced HIF1a-Twist1 pathway to enhance osteogenesis by up-regulating miR-199a-5p, while at late stage of differentiation, miR-199a-5p enhanced osteogenesis maturation by inhibiting HIF1α-Twist1 pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3achitosan 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3amineralization 3ananoparticles 3aplasmids 3astem cells 0aHuman mesenchymal stem cells 0ahsa-mir-199a 0aDrug delivery 0aBone differentiation 0aMaturation 0aRegeneration1 aGu, Shen1 aChen, Bi-Feng1 aShen, Wei-Liang1 aYin, Zi1 aXu, Guo-Wei1 aHu, Jia-Jie1 aZhu, Ting1 aLi, Gang1 aWan, Chao1 aOuyang, Hong-Wei1 aLee, Tin-Lap1 aChan, Wai-Yee0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.239-250dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014700170300001800317520136300335592002801698650002401726650001501750650001901765650001601784650002301800650001501823650002401838650001001862650001001872650002601882650002201908650001401930650001501944650001801959650002001977650001601997653002402013653001902037700002102056700002502077700002402102773012102126856008502247852000902332655001202341IND60648905920221119104607.0190702e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064890592DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.14440982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStenholm, Åke10aRemoval of diclofenac from a non-sterile aqueous system using Trametes versicolor with an emphasis on adsorption and biodegradation mechanisms  ap. 2460-2472.  aThis paper describes the search for procedures through which the xenobiotic pollutant diclofenac can be removed from non-sterile aquatic systems. Specifically, adsorption to solid supports (carriers) in combination with biodegradation by non-immobilized and immobilized white rot fungus Trametes versicolor were investigated. Batch experiments using polyurethane foam (PUF)-carriers resulted in 99.9% diclofenac removal after 4 h, with monolayer adsorption of diclofenac to carrier and glass surfaces accounting for most of the diclofenac decrease. Enzymatic reactions contributed less, accounting for approximately < 0.5% of this decrease. In bioreactor experiments using PUF-carriers, an initial 100% removal was achieved with biodegradation contributing approximately 7%. In batch experiments that utilized polyethylene-carriers with negligible immobilization of Trametes versicolor, a 98% total diclofenac removal was achieved after one week, with a biodegradation contribution of approximately 14%. Five novel enzyme-catalyzed biodegradation products were tentatively identified in the batch-wise and bioreactor experiments using full scan ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time of flight mass spectrometry. Both reduction and oxidation products were found, with the contents estimated to be at µg L⁻¹ concentration levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aadsorption 3abiodegradation 3abioreactors 3acatalytic activity 3adiclofenac 3aenzymatic reactions 3afoams 3aglass 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3apolyurethanes 3awhite-rot fungi 3axenobiotics 0aTrametes versicolor 0aUHPLC-Q-TOF MS1 aHedeland, Mikael1 aArvidsson, Torbjörn1 aPettersson, Curt E.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2019 Aug. 24, v. 40, no. 19 p.2460-2472dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.14440983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245015300204300001600357520185000373592002802223650001202251650001902263650001602282650002002298650002302318650002402341650001102365650002402376650002202400650001102422650001102433650001802444650001602462650002502478700006102503700005802564700006102622700005902683773013302742856008302875852000902958655001202967IND60741980820221117073830.0210731e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074198082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-021-03615-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1567-905810aCan we replace observed forcing with weather generator in land surface modeling? Insights from long-term simulations at two contrasting boreal sites  ap. 215-244.  aThis study evaluates the simulation of water balance components at half-hourly time steps from the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) when driven by a 500-year stochastic meteorological data set produced by the Advanced WEather GENerator (AWE-GEN) at two boreal sites with contrasting water availability. The CLASS was driven by ERA5 reanalysis data (CLASS-CTL) over 39 years and its output was used as a surrogate for land surface observations. At both sites, the mean monthly and annual values of all meteorological variables used to drive CLASS, including precipitation, are well captured by AWE-GEN, but their variability is, sometimes, biased. In general, CLASS driven by stochastic data (CLASS-WG) tends to produce higher evapotranspiration compared to values simulated by CLASS-CTL, especially during spring and summer at the wet site. The interannual evapotranspiration-precipitation and runoff-precipitation relationships derived from CLASS-WG and those derived from CLASS-CTL were very similar to each other at the dry site; they both indicate that evapotranspiration and runoff are limited by water availability. At the wet site, however, CLASS-WG only captured well the interannual runoff-precipitation relationship. The sensitivity analysis shows that CLASS water fluxes are particularly affected by the replacement of physically consistent input time series of incoming short-wave radiation, precipitation, temperature, and specific humidity. In conclusion, the results show that even though a weather generator can produce coherent climate time series, the use of this synthetic data as meteorological forcing in a physically based land surface model does not necessarily reproduce the complex surface processes, such as the surface water fluxes. More studies are encouraged to further analyze the constraints of this framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3ameteorological data 3arunoff 3ashortwave radiation 3aspecific humidity 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3atemperature 3atime series analysis1 aNadeau, Daniel F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4006-26231 aMusic, Biljana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8760-89961 aAnctil, François1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4568-48831 aFatichi, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1361-66590 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2021 July, v. 145, no. 1-2 p.215-244dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-021-03615-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014900155300001800304500002000322520097700342592002801319596008501347596008501432596006901517596006801586596005901654650001501713650002001728650002201748650002801770650002601798650001401824650002001838650002801858650001501886650001801901700001701919700001401936700001601950700001201966700001701978700001301995700001802008700001202026700001302038700005802051773015002109856007302259852000902332655001202341IND60653112320221119115108.0190713e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065311232DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.60872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Limin10aMicrobial community‐assisted water quality control and nutrients recovery: emerging technologies for the sustainable development of aquaponics  ap. 2405-2411.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAquaponics is considered as a possible method to produce aquatic animals and plants in an environmentally‐friendly way, but its commercialization is seriously hindered owing to some technical and economic problems. Recently, the integration of microbial community with aquaponics is on the way to becoming the next‐generation technology for the sustainable development and commercialization of the aquaponics industry. This article provides an authoritative discussion on the novel microbial community‐assisted aquaponics, which will be emerging from the research environment to industrial application in the coming future. Principles and key technologies of this novel aquaponics, as well as the potential challenges to its commercialization, are discussed. It is expected that the emerging technologies discussed in this work could address the existed technical problems and further promote the commercialization of aquaponics. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a20171BBG70036cKey Research Development Program of the Jiangxi Province of China  a20181BBH80004cKey Research Development Program of the Jiangxi Province of China  a201807010056cGuangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project  a2018A03031342cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  a51668044cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aaquaponics 3aaquatic animals 3acommercialization 3aindustrial applications 3amicrobial communities 3anutrients 3aquality control 3asustainable development 3atechnology 3awater quality1 aChen, Fufeng1 aXiao, Yan1 aLi, Huankai1 aLi, Jun1 aLeng, Lijian1 aLiu, Hui1 aZhong, Yuming1 aLi, Kun1 aLu, Qian1 aZhou, Wenguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5997-24940 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2019 Aug., v. 94, no. 8 p.2405-2411dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.60873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245013900207300001800346520114800364592002801512596010501540596006801645596009801713650001001811650001301821650003601834650001201870650001101882650001801893650003001911650002201941650001101963650001201974650002101986650002002007650001402027650001002041650001302051651001002064700002402074700002302098700002802121700002302149700002102172773013602193856008102329852000902410655001202419IND60602031720221122064429.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060203172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-018-0657-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmdale, Suraj D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9319-589210aVigna khandalensis (Santapau) Raghavan et Wadhwa: a promising underutilized, wild, endemic legume of the Northern Western Ghats, India  ap. 1795-1807.  aVigna khandalensis (Santapau) Raghavan et Wadhwa, is an endemic legume belonging to subgenus Ceratotropis (Asian Vigna), genus Vigna of the family Fabaceae. It is commonly known as ‘Ranmung’, ‘Jungli mung’ or ‘Badamung’. V. khandalensis is sporadically distributed at high altitude areas in the Northern Western Ghats, India. It is an annual, erect, tall herb growing along roadsides, hilly slopes, pond sides and near human settlements. The legume seeds are utilized by human beings at the time of famine. Surprisingly, the plant remains neglected and underutilized although its high nutritional value. The scant information on V. khandalensis leads us to investigate this underexploited and underutilized legume as a food source for human. The present paper deals with geographical distribution, taxonomy, ecology, agro-morphological characterization, nutritional content and phytochemical analysis. The results obtained in the present investigation provide information on agro-morphological traits and nutritional potential of V. khandalensis. Furthermore, it is promoted as a legume ‘Crop for the Future’ for food security.  aPublisher supplied data  aNational Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) Component-4cIndian Council of Agricultural Research  asub-project Code: 4143cIndian Council of Agricultural Research  aRSS/YCIS/RAC/5cResearch Advisory Committee, Yashavantrao Chavan Institute of Science, Satara 3aVigna 3aaltitude 3achemical constituents of plants 3aecology 3afamine 3afood security 3ageographical distribution 3ahuman settlements 3ahumans 3alegumes 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aroadsides 3aseeds 3ataxonomy 3aIndia1 aChavan, Jaykumar J.1 aAhire, Mahendra L.1 aKshirsagar, Parthraj R.1 aGaikwad, Nikhil B.1 aBhat, Kangila V.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2018 Aug., v. 65, no. 6 p.1795-1807dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-018-0657-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245007100158300001600229520124700245592002801492650001901520650002601539650001701565650001201582650001201594650002001606650001601626651001901642651001301661653002701674653001901701653002001720653001201740653003201752653003101784653001901815700001501834700001601849700001801865773011501883856007701998852000902075655001202084IND60597786220221120194828.0180627e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059778622DNAL7 a10.2478/sab-2018-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotyza, P.10aSupporting Producer Groups – Increasing Producer’s Value Aded?  ap. 142-152.  aCooperation between entities can be the basis for improved competitiveness. The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were able to draw on EU funds to support the formation of producer groups. Main objective was to investigate whether the funds have led to an increase of value added of products placed on the market. In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic during the reporting period the sum of 44 million EUR was provided to support the establishment of marketing organizations, 305 producer groups were supported. Many of the supported entities are no longer active. In the Czech Republic, only 15 entities are still operating, but they do not have a significant impact on the increase of value added of the agricultural sector. In the Slovak Republic, entities supported in the first programming period (2004–2006) have a higher share of the generated value added. During the second funding period (2007–2013), the supported groups showed a negative value added. Given the characteristics of supported groups, the number of successfully supported groups, the reported features and the total value of generated value added, it can be suggested that most of the entities were established due to the relative ease of fundraising.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aagricultural industry 3afund raising 3afunding 3amarkets 3aproducer groups 3avalue added 3aCzech Republic 3aSlovakia 0aMarketing cooperatives 0aCzech Republic 0aSlovak Republic 0asupport 0aRural Development Programme 0acommon agricultural policy 0aEuropean Union1 aTomsik, K.1 aElisova, K.1 aHornowski, A.0 tScientia Agriculturae Bohemica.g2018 June 01, v. 49, no. 2 p.142-152dSciendowJournal:23174x1805-94307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sab-2018-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013100160300001800291520110800309592002801417650002301445650002301468650001601491650001501507650001101522650003501533700001901568700001901587773012901606856008101735852000901816655001201825IND60548413820221120034742.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054841382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7644-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu10aSystematic development and optimization of chemically defined medium supporting high cell density growth of Bacillus coagulans  ap. 8121-8134.  aWith determined components and experimental reducibility, the chemically defined medium (CDM) and the minimal chemically defined medium (MCDM) are used in many metabolism and regulation studies. This research aimed to develop the chemically defined medium supporting high cell density growth of Bacillus coagulans, which is a promising producer of lactic acid and other bio-chemicals. In this study, a systematic methodology combining the experimental technique with flux balance analysis (FBA) was proposed to design and simplify a CDM. The single omission technique and single addition technique were employed to determine the essential and stimulatory compounds, before the optimization of their concentrations by the statistical method. In addition, to improve the growth rationally, in silico omission and addition were performed by FBA based on the construction of a medium-size metabolic model of B. coagulans 36D1. Thus, CDMs were developed to obtain considerable biomass production of at least five B. coagulans strains, in which two model strains B. coagulans 36D1 and ATCC 7050 were involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus coagulans 3abiomass production 3alactic acid 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making1 aDong, Fengqing1 aWang, Yonghong0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Sept., v. 100, no. 18 p.8121-8134dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7644-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012200166300001800288520133600306592002801642650002501670650001201695650001201707650001301719650001701732650001501749700002101764700002001785773009901805856008101904852000901985655001201994IND4403995320221120232234.0151024e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440399532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-008-0929-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Kanjaksha10aBackground noise of infection for using ANCA as a diagnostic tool for vasculitis in tropical and developing countries  ap. 1093-1095.  aAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) is often used in the laboratory to confirm paucicellular vasculitis like Wegener’s granulomatosis, Churg Strauss syndrome or polyarteritis nodosa in the presence of suggestive clinical features. In tropical countries, tuberculosis, leprosy and, occasionally, malaria can produce clinical features similar to a vasculitic illness and all the three infections are known to be associated with auto antibodies. We tested 318 patients suffering from malaria, tuberculosis or leprosy for ANCA positivity. ANCA positivity was found in 19%, 32% and 30% of malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy patients (Pradhan V, Badakere S, Shankarkumar V, Iyer Y, Ghosh K, Karnad D, Indian J Malariol, 39:51–59, 2002; Pradhan V, Badakere S, Ghosh K, Pawar A, Indian J Med Sci, 58:283–288, 2004a; Pradhan V, Badakere S, Shankarkumar V, Lepr Rev, 75:50–56, 2004b), respectively, raising the possibility that ANCA positivity with clinical features suggestive of vasculitis in tropical countries may even be related to the background noise of this seropositivity caused by one of these three infections rather than confirming the diagnosis of paucicellular vasculitis. Hence, one should be careful about the background noise of ANCA positivity caused by these infections while diagnosing a vasculitic illness.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aleprosy 3amalaria 3apatients 3atuberculosis 3avasculitis1 aPradhan, Vandana1 aGhosh, Kinjalka0 tParasitology research.g2008 Apr., v. 102, no. 5 p.1093-1095dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-0929-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245006800173300001400241520141700255592002801672650000801700650001401708650001701722650001701739650001301756650001901769650001501788650001501803650002301818650002301841650001601864650001201880650001801892650002001910650001001930650001801940650001201958650002501970650001101995650002102006650000902027650003702036650002602073650002202099650001602121653001902137653002202156653002602178653002002204653002002224653002302244653002702267653002102294653002202315700002002337773009302357856008802450852000902538655001202547IND60552691720221121103806.0161021e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055269172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMate, Diana M.10aLaccase engineering: From rational design to directed evolution  ap. 25-40.  aLaccases are multicopper oxidoreductases considered by many in the biotechonology field as the ultimate “green catalysts”. This is mainly due to their broad substrate specificity and relative autonomy (they use molecular oxygen from air as an electron acceptor and they only produce water as by-product), making them suitable for a wide array of applications: biofuel production, bioremediation, organic synthesis, pulp biobleaching, textiles, the beverage and food industries, biosensor and biofuel cell development. Since the beginning of the 21st century, specific features of bacterial and fungal laccases have been exhaustively adapted in order to reach the industrial demands for high catalytic activity and stability in conjunction with reduced production cost. Among the goals established for laccase engineering, heterologous functional expression, improved activity and thermostability, tolerance to non-natural media (organic solvents, ionic liquids, physiological fluids) and resistance to different types of inhibitors are all challenges that have been met, while obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of laccase structure–function relationships. In this review we examine the most significant advances in this exciting research area in which rational, semi-rational and directed evolution approaches have been employed to ultimately convert laccases into high value-added biocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abeverages 3abiobleaching 3abiocatalysts 3abiofuels 3abioremediation 3abiosensors 3abyproducts 3acatalytic activity 3adirected evolution 3aengineering 3afabrics 3afood industry 3afuel production 3afungi 3aionic liquids 3alaccase 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aoxygen 3aproduction costs 3apulp 3astructure-activity relationships 3asubstrate specificity 3athermal stability 3avalue added 0aFungal laccase 0aBacterial laccase 0aFunctional expression 0aRedox potential 0aRational design 0aDirected evolution 0aSaturation mutagenesis 0aLaccase chimeras 0aDNA recombination1 aAlcalde, Miguel0 tBiotechnology Advances.g2015 Jan.,  Feb., v. 33 p.25-40dElsevier Inc.x0734-97507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245005100169300001400220520153500234592002801769650001701797650002301814650001201837650001201849650001101861650001901872650002101891650001301912650001401925650001101939650001501950650001901965650001601984650002002000650001302020653001902033653001702052653001402069653001402083700002002097700002502117700006602142700005802208773009302266856008802359852000902447655001202456IND60552691820221121103842.0161021e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055269182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunk, Line10aCan laccases catalyze bond cleavage in lignin?  ap. 13-24.  aModification of lignin is recognized as an important aspect of the successful refining of lignocellulosic biomass, and enzyme-assisted processing and upcycling of lignin is receiving significant attention in the literature. Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are taking the centerstage of this attention, since these enzymes may help degrading lignin, using oxygen as the oxidant. Laccases can catalyze polymerization of lignin, but the question is whether and how laccases can directly catalyze modification of lignin via catalytic bond cleavage. Via a thorough review of the available literature and detailed illustrations of the putative laccase catalyzed reactions, including the possible reactions of the reactive radical intermediates taking place after the initial oxidation of the phenol-hydroxyl groups, we show that i) Laccase activity is able to catalyze bond cleavage in low molecular weight phenolic lignin model compounds; ii) For laccases to catalyze inter-unit bond cleavage in lignin substrates, the presence of a mediator system is required. Clearly, the higher the redox potential of the laccase enzyme, the broader the range of substrates, including o- and p-diphenols, aminophenols, methoxy-substituted phenols, benzenethiols, polyphenols, and polyamines, which may be oxidized. In addition, the currently available analytical methods that can be used to detect enzyme catalyzed changes in lignin are summarized, and an improved nomenclature for unequivocal interpretation of the action of laccases on lignin is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminophenols 3aanalytical methods 3abiomass 3alaccase 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amolecular weight 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolyamines 3apolymerization 3apolyphenols 3aredox potential 3arefining 0aLignocellulose 0aBiocatalysis 0aMediators 0aOxidation1 aSitarz, Anna K.1 aKalyani, Dayanand C.1 aMikkelsen, J.

We studied the adaptation of freshwater cyanobacteria and microalgae to resist lindane using an experimental model to distinguish if lindane-resistant cells had their origin in random spontaneous pre-selective mutations (which occur prior to the lindane exposure), or if lindane-resistant cells arose by a mechanism of physiological acclimation during the exposure to the selective agent. Although further research is needed to determine the different mechanisms contributing to the bio-elimination of lindane, this study, however, provides an approach to the bioremediation abilities of the lindane-resistant cells. Wild type strains of the experimental organisms were exposed to increasing lindane levels to estimate lethal concentrations. Growth of wild-type cells was completely inhibited at 5mg/L concentration of lindane. However, after further incubation in lindane for several weeks, occasionally the growth of rare lindane-resistant cells was found. A fluctuation analysis demonstrated that lindane-resistant cells arise only by rare spontaneous mutations that occur randomly prior to exposure to lindane (lindane-resistance did not occur as a result of physiological mechanisms). The rate of mutation from lindane sensitivity to resistance was between 1.48×10⁻⁵ and 2.35×10⁻⁷ mutations per cell per generation. Lindane-resistant mutants exhibited a diminished fitness in the absence of lindane, but only these variants were able to grow at lindane concentrations higher than 5mg/L (until concentrations as high as 40mg/L). Lindane-resistant mutants may be maintained in uncontaminated waters as the result of a balance between new resistant mutants arising from spontaneous mutation and resistant cells eliminated by natural selection waters via clone selection. The lindane-resistant cells were also used to test the potential of microalgae to remove lindane. Three concentrations (4, 15 and 40mg/L) were chosen as a model. In these exposures the lindane-resistant cells showed a great capacity to remove lindane (until 99% lindane was eliminated). Apparently, bioremediation based on lindane-resistant cells could be a great opportunity for cleaning up of lindane- and other chlorinated organics-polluted habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aacclimation 3abioaccumulation 3abioremediation 3acleaning 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3alindane 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3anatural selection 3atoxicity 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCyanobacteriaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aHexachlorocyclohexanexanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aMicroalgaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity.1 aGarcía-Balboa, Camino1 aRouco, Mónica1 aLopez-Rodas, Victoria1 aCostas Costas, Eduardo,0 tAquatic toxicology.g2012 Mar., v. 109 p.25-32dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012900176300001800305520101400323592002801337650001401365650001301379650002101392650001301413650001901426650001101445650001101456650001201467650002001479650002501499650001501524650002201539650002701561650002001588650000901608650001601617650001901633651001101652700003601663700003101699700002901730700003801759773013601797856008101933852000902014655001202023IND60602032020221120202403.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060203202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-018-0637-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Edson Ferreira14aThe occurrence of wild cotton Gossypium mustelinum Miers ex Watt populations in the coast of Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil  ap. 1551-1557.  aIn this study, we describe three populations of the wild cotton Gossypium mustelinum Miers ex Watt in the coastal plain to the north of the State of Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. These populations occur in urban areas in current expansion and under imminent risks of extinction, due to land use changes for house constructions. Distances between these new occurrences and the populations already mapped in the Northeast semiarid Caatinga (Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, and Bahia) range from approximately 270–950 km. Besides distant, the populations on the coastal plain of Pernambuco also occur in very distinct climatic and edaphic conditions. Aiming at allowing the ex situ conservation of these genetic resources, branches of 66 plants were collected, propagated by the asexual breeding method cutting to regenerate an accession of each plant. These now constitute a germplasm collection in the Department of Agronomy of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE), in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium 3abranches 3abreeding methods 3acaatinga 3acoastal plains 3acoasts 3acotton 3acutting 3aedaphic factors 3aex situ conservation 3aextinction 3agenetic resources 3agermplasm conservation 3aland use change 3arisk 3aurban areas 3awild relatives 3aBrazil1 aDuarte Filho, Luiz Sergio Costa1 ados Santos Maia, Ana Kelly1 ada Silva, Allison Vieira1 aLins e Silva, Ana Carolina Borges0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2018 Aug., v. 65, no. 6 p.1551-1557dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-018-0637-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245009500174300001800269520131500287592002801602650001501630650001101645650001001656650001201666650001101678650001101689650001501700650001801715650001601733650001201749650001001761650001601771650001501787650003201802650001001834650002001844650001801864650001101882650001501893650001801908650001401926650001001940650001001950650001301960650002101973700002101994700001902015700001902034700002202053773013502075856004002210852000902250655001202259IND4468408820221119185532.0120612e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446840882DNAL7 a223118512pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.55812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorsuk, Yulia10aIncorporation of pulse flours of different particle size in relation to pita bread quality  ap. 2055-2061.  aBACKGROUND: To increase pulse consumption, pita bread was fortified with pulse flours milled from green lentils, navy beans and pinto beans, which were ground to produce fine and coarse flours. Pita breads were prepared using composite flours containing pulse flours (25, 50, 75%) and wheat flour or 100% pulse flours and adjusting the amount of water required for mixing based on farinograph water absorption. Pita bread quality was evaluated according to diameter, pocket height, specific loaf volume, texture and crust colour. RESULTS: Blends made from pulse flours with coarse particle size showed higher rates of water absorption. All composite flours and 100% pulse flours produced pitas with pockets, confirming their suitability for this product. Crust colour of pitas was affected less by navy bean flour than by lentil flour. Pita breads made with pinto bean flour were superior in texture. Overall, navy and pinto bean flours appeared more suitable for pita bread. Flours with coarse particle sizes produced pitas with better colour and texture. Sensory parameters of pitas containing 25% coarse pinto or navy bean flour were as good as or better than those from the wheat control. CONCLUSION: Acceptable pita breads can be made using pulse flours, although the substitution level is limited to 25%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abreads 3acolor 3alentils 3aloaves 3amixing 3anavy beans 3aparticle size 3apinto beans 3atexture 3awheat 3awheat flour 2aAbsorption 2aBreadxanalysisxstandards. 2aColor 2aFlourxanalysis 2aFood Handling 2aHumans 2aLens Plant 2aParticle Size 2aPhaseolus 2aSeeds 2aTaste 2aTriticum 2aWaterxchemistry1 aArntfield, Susan1 aLukow, Odean M1 aSwallow, Kevin1 aMalcolmson, Linda0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 92, no. 10 p.2055-2061dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5581  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012400167300001400291520123400305592002801539650002001567650001401587650000901601650001601610650001301626650000901639650002501648653002701673653002501700653002201725653002401747653001501771700002701786773013201813856007801945852000902023655001202032IND60597786720221120192333.0180627e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059778672DNAL7 a10.2478/sggw-2018-00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabarijoely, Simon10aStrength and deformation parameters of boulder clay to design of buildings at the margin of a moraine plateau in Warsaw  ap. 55-67.  aThe selection of soil parameters suitable to the geotechnical design calculations is regarded widely as one of the most important and simultaneously difficult engineering task, which according to the Eurocode 7 standards should be undertaken into distinct three steps. The second of these steps, namely obtaining the characteristic values requires a careful and a cautions estimation with application of the statistical methods even by using a Bayesian approach as shown in this paper. This paper presents the process of selecting a characteristic strength and deformation parameters from CPT and DMT investigation for boulder clays discovered at the margin of a moraine plateau in Warsaw. This layer was chosen for foundations of design academic buildings. In the selection of the characteristic parameters with application of the numerical program BAYANAL the spatial distribution of strength and deformation properties was taken into account. Particular attention was focused to the affect resulting from in situ test locations at different distances from the design facilities. Finally, the remark conclusions were presented including opinion on the role of aims and spacing of investigation points in geotechnical designing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abuildings 3aclay 3adeformation 3aplateaus 3asoil 3astatistical analysis 0adesign clay parameters 0astatistical analysis 0aBayesian approach 0ageotechnical design 0aEurocode 71 aGarbulewski, Kazimierz0 tAnnals of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 50, no. 1 p.55-67dSciendowJournal:2240x2081-96177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sggw-2018-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010700183300001600290520138100306592002801687650002801715650002301743650001501766650001601781650001201797650002101809650002401830650001601854650001101870650001401881650003101895650002001926650001601946650001301962650002301975650001201998650003202010650002402042650003102066650005302097650002402150650003902174650002202213650004402235650005502279650004602334650009102380700002202471700002102493700002002514773009702534856008102631852000902712655001202721IND4403995720221121061409.0151024e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440399572DNAL7 a181932842pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-007-0817-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Candace10aProtein phosphatase 5 is required for Hsp90 function during proteotoxic stresses in Trypanosoma brucei  ap. 835-844.  aTrypanosoma brucei, a parasitic protozoan that causes African trypanosomiasis in human and domestic animals, adapt in various environments during their digenetic life cycle. In this study, we found that Hsp90 is crucial for the survival of this parasite. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity by geldanamycin (GA) reduced cell growth and increased the level of Hsp90. Both the bloodstream and procyclic forms of T. brucei showed a several-fold greater sensitivity than the mammalian cells to GA and also to 17-AAG, a less toxic derivative of GA, suggesting that Hsp90 could be a potential chemotherapeuric target for African trypanosomiasis. T. brucei Hsp90 interacts with the protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) in vivo. Under normal growth conditions, T. brucei PP5 (TbPP5) and Hsp90 are primarily localized in the cytosol. However, with increase in growth temperature and GA treatment, these proteins translocate to the nucleus. Overproduction of TbPP5 by genetic manipulation reduced the growth inhibitory effect of GA, while knockdown of TbPP5 reduced cell growth more in the presence of GA, as compared to parental control. Depletion of TbPP5, however, did not prevent the induction of Hsp90 protein level during GA treatment. Together, these results suggest that TbPP5 positively regulates the function of Hsp90 to maintain cellular homeostasis during proteotoxic stresses in T. brucei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican trypanosomiasis 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3ablood flow 3acell growth 3acytosol 3adomestic animals 3agenetic engineering 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aparasites 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aprocyclic forms 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3atransport proteins 2aAnimals 2aBenzoquinonesxpharmacology 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHSP90 Heat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aLactams, Macrocyclicxpharmacology 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrypanosoma brucei bruceixdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology.1 aAnderson, Sedrick1 aSingha, Ujjal K.1 aChaudhuri, Minu0 tParasitology research.g2008 Apr., v. 102, no. 5 p.835-844dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-007-0817-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008900167300001800256520200000274592002802274596006202302650001902364650001102383650001602394650001202410650002202422650001502444650001102459651001202470700002402482700002102506773011302527856008102640852000902721655001202730IND60617134520221116191239.0181024e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061713452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-018-0426-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSankar, Ravi D.10aMapping Shoreline Variability of Two Barrier Island Segments Along the Florida Coast  ap. 2191-2211.  aRecent projections of global climate change necessitate improved methodologies that quantify shoreline variability. Updated analyses of shoreline movement provide important information that can aid and inform likely intervention policies. This paper uses the Analyzing Moving Boundaries Using R (AMBUR) technique to evaluate shoreline change trends over the time period 1856 to 2015. Special emphasis was placed on recent rates of change, during the 1994 to 2015 period of active storm conditions. Small segments, on the order of tens of kilometers, along two sandy barrier island regions on Florida’s Gulf and Atlantic coasts were chosen for this study. The overall average rate of change over the 159-year period along Little St. George Island was − 0.62 ± 0.12 m/year, with approximately 65% of shoreline segments eroding and 35% advancing. During periods of storm clustering (1994–2015), retreat rates along portions of this Gulf coast barrier accelerated to − 5.49 ± 1.4 m/year. Along the northern portion of Merritt Island on Florida’s Atlantic coast, the overall mean rate of change was 0.22 ± 0.08 m/year, indicative of a shoreline in a state of relative dynamic equilibrium. In direct contrast with the Gulf coast shoreline segment, the majority of transects (65%) evaluated along the oceanfront of Merritt Island over the long term displayed a seaward advance. Results indicate that episodes of clustered storm activity with fairly quick return intervals generally produce dramatic morphological alteration of the coast and can delay natural beach recovery. Additionally, the data show that tidal inlet dynamics, shoreline orientation, along with engineering projects, act over a variety of spatial and temporal scales to influence shoreline evolution. Further, the trends of shoreline movement observed in this study indicate that nearshore bathymetry—the presence of shoals—wields some influence on the behavior of local segments of the shoreline.  aPublisher supplied data  aDoctoral Graduate AssistantshipcFlorida State University 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3aengineering 3aislands 3aissues and policy 3ashorelines 3astorms 3aFlorida1 aDonoghue, Joseph F.1 aKish, Stephen A.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2018 Dec., v. 41, no. 8 p.2191-2211dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4000572x1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-018-0426-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245010700211300001400318500001900332520197000351592002802321596006302349650002302412650001802435650001902453650001702472650000902489650004102498650001202539650002302551650001402574650001102588650002502599650001002624650001602634650001302650650003002663650003202693650002502725650001002750651001202760700001702772700003102789700002002820700001802840773010102858856008202959852000903041655001203050IND60723938020221120075310.0210118e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072393802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10201-020-00630-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhạm, Thanh Lưu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3276-111410aFirst report of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) in Dolichospermum and Oscillatoria from Vietnam  ap. 43-56.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCyanobacteria are the major producers of the taste and odour compounds geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) in drinking water and fish worldwide. In recent years, the outbreaks of cyanobacteria blooms in Tri An and Dau Tieng Reservoirs, Vietnam have led to an increase attention in taste and odour problems. In the present study, the two off-flavour compounds geosmin and 2-MIB were found in field samples and 50 isolated strains of planktonic cyanobacteria from Dau Tieng and Tri An Reservoirs. They were screened for the first time using headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPME GC–MS). The ability to produce off-flavour compounds was determined by the presence of two molecular markers: geoA and mib. Results showed that mean geosmin and 2-MIB concentrations ranged from 13.3 to 9.6 ng/L and 4.9 to 101.7 ng/L in field samples, respectively. A total of five geosmin-producing strains [with the highest concentration: 272.9 ng/g wet weight (ww)] and nine 2-MIB-producing strains (with the highest concentration: 362.1 ng/g ww) belonging to two cyanobacteria genera Dolichospermum and Oscillatoria were identified. Four of the geosmin producers also produced 2-MIB. The 16S rRNA maximum likelihood (ML) tree showed a high diversity of the isolated strains that represented different morphotypes and genotypes. The BLAST searches revealed that the 16S rRNA gene sequence obtained in this study shared the similarity values ranging between 96.46 and 99.37% compared to the available sequences from GenBank. This is the first report of off-flavour compound producing cyanobacteria in Vietnamese waters. The combination of HPME GC–MS and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a robust tool for reliably characterizing the off-flavour compound. Our results highlight that taste and odour-producing cyanobacteria belonging to Chroococcales in Vietnamese waters are unexplored and require further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  aKHCBSS.02/19-21cVietnam Academy of Science and Technology 3a2-methylisoborneol 3aChroococcales 3aDolichospermum 3aOscillatoria 3afish 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ageosmin 3aheadspace analysis 3alimnology 3amorphs 3anucleotide sequences 3aodors 3aoff flavors 3aplankton 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asolid phase microextraction 3astatistical analysis 3ataste 3aVietnam1 aBui, Manh Ha1 aDriscoll, Markq(Mark W.),1 aShimizu, Kazuya1 aMotoo, Utsumi0 tLimnology.g2021 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.43-56dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3949861x1439-86217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-020-00630-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007500156300001600231520164300247592002801890650002201918650001801940650001101958650000901969650001801978650001601996650001002012650001102022650000902033650001802042650000902060650002002069650002702089650001002116650002202126773013102148856007402279852000902353655001202362IND60765136720221120074228.0220419e20111210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076513672DNAL7 a10.17221/4105-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuchová, Z.10aChanges in technological quality of food wheat in a four crop rotation  ap. 146-150.  aThe evaluation of technological characteristics of food wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), grown in a&nbsp;four crop rotation (corn, barley, pea, wheat) since 1994, is presented. Samples of grain, whole grain meals, and flours of the varieties Vlada and Samanta were analyzed. The samples originated from field trials at a&nbsp;research base nearNitra. All important methods of the assessment of the raw material technological quality (intended use for milling and baking) were applied. A&nbsp;total of 22&nbsp;characteristics were evaluated (15 of them are shown in Table 1). The highest abundance of highly significant (significance levels being results of both parametric and nonparametric methods) changes (a&nbsp;&pound; 0.01) in quantity (grain and flour yield) and quality (gluten and its properties, water-binding capacity of flour, a-amylase activity) was observed between different years (7). The soil management methods (3; 2 + 1) had a&nbsp;significant (a&nbsp;&pound; 0.05) influence on the test weight (grain volume mass) and gluten content. In interaction with the year (as a&nbsp;factor), they significantly influenced gluten swelling number (Q-number) and highly significantly the activity of a-amylases. Highly significant differences were also found between varieties (2; 1/1), significant ones in interaction with soil management. Fertilization (3) and other interactions of factors were not statistically significant. Parameter means for factor levels (along with statistical significance of the influence of particular factors) and simple quality coefficients (used for the ranking of factor levels) are shown in Table 1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalpha-amylase 3abarley 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3aenvironment 3aflour 3agluten 3apeas 3araw materials 3asoil 3asoil management 3awater binding capacity 3awheat 3awhole grain foods0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 49, no. 4 p.146-150dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4105-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002900154245010400183300001600287520072500303592002801028650001701056650001101073650001601084650001701100650001901117650002001136650002401156650001801180653000701198653000801205653001001213653001001223653000901233653000801242653001201250653000901262653000901271653000801280653000801288653001001296653000901306653001001315653000901325653001001334653001101344653000801355653000901363653000901372653001301381653001001394653001001404653000801414653000801422653000801430653000801438653001001446653000701456653000801463653002101471653001501492653002601507653001901533653001701552653002101569653001701590700001901607700001801626700001701644700002001661700002001681700001901701700002301720700006101743700005701804700006101861700002401922773009601946856008802042852000902130655001202139IND60552692220221121103859.0170710e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055269222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteffen-Munsberg, Fabian10aBioinformatic analysis of a PLP-dependent enzyme superfamily suitable for biocatalytic applications  ap. 566-604.  aIn this review we analyse structure/sequence–function relationships for the superfamily of PLP-dependent enzymes with special emphasis on class III transaminases. Amine transaminases are highly important for applications in biocatalysis in the synthesis of chiral amines. In addition, other enzyme activities such as racemases or decarboxylases are also discussed. The substrate scope and the ability to accept chemically different types of substrates are shown to be reflected in conserved patterns of amino acids around the active site. These findings are condensed in a sequence–function matrix, which facilitates annotation and identification of biocatalytically relevant enzymes and protein engineering thereof.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aamines 3aamino acids 3abiocatalysis 3abioinformatics 3aenzyme activity 3aprotein engineering 3atransaminases 0aAA 0aAAA 0a3AcOc 0aAcOrn 0adAIB 0aATA 0aCoAβAA 0aDABA 0aDAPA 0aDGD 0aDTS 0afumB1 0aGABA 0aglyox 0aGSAM 0aLysε 0aHfumB1 0aOrn 0aKAPA 0aαKG 0aOrnTL DB 0aβAla 0aβPhe 0aPLP 0aPUT 0apyr 0aSAM 0aSuOrn 0aTA 0atau 0aProtein function 0aAnnotation 0aPLP-dependent enzymes 0aBioinformatics 0aBiocatalysis 0aEnzyme discovery 0aTransaminase1 aVickers, Clare1 aKohls, Hannes1 aLand, Henrik1 aMallin, Hendrik1 aNobili, Alberto1 aSkalden, Lilly1 avan den Bergh, Tom1 aJoosten, Henk-Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3138-103X1 aBerglund, Per1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9577-832X1 aHöhne, Matthias,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2542-725X1 aBornscheuer, Uwe T.0 tBiotechnology Advances.g2015 Sept.,  Oct., v. 33 p.566-604dElsevier Inc.x0734-97507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01064naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001300293500002200306520012300328592002800451650001100479650001400490650001400504700003200518700002100550773011300571856008100684852000900765655001200774IND60617134820221116191149.0181024e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061713482DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-018-0462-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChant, Robert J.10aCorrection to: Impact of Channel Deepening on Tidal and Gravitational Circulation in a Highly Engineered Estuarine Basin  ap. 2447.  aPublished Erratum  aIn the original article on page 1589, right column, second paragraph, seventh line, there is an error in the equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aequations 3aestuaries1 aSommerfield, Christopher K.1 aTalke, Stefan A.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2018 Dec., v. 41, no. 8 p.2447-2447dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4000572x1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-018-0462-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245009500180300001800275520182300293592002802116650001702144650002202161650001402183650001302197650002702210650001102237650001602248650002702264653002802291653001902319653002502338653001302363653002302376700004102399773012102440856008502561852000902646655001202655IND60648906920221120215826.0190702e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064890692DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.14470222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva Rabêlo, Olivan10aDrivers of multidimensional eco-innovation: empirical evidence from the Brazilian industry  ap. 2556-2566.  aThe study analyses the relationships between the main drivers of eco-innovation introduced by innovative industries, focused on cooperation strategy. Eco-innovation is analysed by means of a multidimensional identification strategy, showing the relationships between the independent variables and the variable of interest. The literature discussing environmental innovation is different from the one discussing other types of innovation inasmuch as it seeks to grasp its determinants and to mostly highlight the relevance of environmental regulation. The key feature of this paper is that it ascribes special relevance to cooperation strategy with external partners and to the propensity of innovative industry introducing eco-innovation. A sample of 35,060 Brazilian industries were analysed, between 2003 and 2011, by means of Binomial, Multinomial and Ordinal logistic regressions with microdata collected with the research and innovation department (PINTEC) from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística). The econometric results estimated by the Logit Multinomial method suggest that the cooperation with external partners practiced by innovative industries facilitates the adoption of eco-innovation in dimension 01 with probability of 64.59%, 57.63% in dimension 02 and 81.02% in dimension 03. The data reveal that the higher the degree of eco-innovation complexity, the harder industries seek to obtain cooperation with external partners. When calculating with the Logit Ordinal and Binomial models, cooperation increases the probability that the industry is eco-innovative in 65.09% and 89.34%, respectively. Environmental regulation and innovation in product and information management were also positively correlated as drivers of eco-innovation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3aenvironmental law 3ageography 3aindustry 3ainformation management 3amodels 3aprobability 3asustainable technology 0aIndustrial organization 0aeco-innovation 0acooperation networks 0astrategy 0aBrazilian industry1 ade Azevedo Melo, Andrea Sales Soares0 tEnvironmental technology.g2019 Aug. 24, v. 40, no. 19 p.2556-2566dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.14470223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245013800171300001400309520121700323592002801540653003101568653002201599653001401621653002301635653002101658700002201679700002001701773011801721856008801839852000901927655001201936IND60594243220221119081345.0180510e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059424322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jorganchem.2018.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRani, Varsha10aProtic and substituted NCN palladium(II) pincer complexes with 1,3-bis(benzimidazol-2′-yl)-2-bromobenzenes: Structure and catalysis  ap. 33-43.  aA new class of sparingly soluble NCN palladium(II) pincer complexes of the type (NˆCˆN)PdBr: [ᴹᵉᵗʰʸˡ(NˆCˆN)PdBr], C26H25N4PdBr (14), [ᵀᵒˢʸˡ(NˆCˆN)PdBr], C38H33N4O4S2PdBr (15), [ᴮᵉⁿᶻʸˡ(NˆCˆN)PdBr], C38H33N4PdBr (16) and [ᴾᵉⁿᵗʸˡ(NˆCˆN)PdBr], C34H41N4PdBr (17) [(NˆCˆN) = 5-tert-butyl-1,3-bis-(N-substituted-benzimidazol-2′-yl)phenyl] were synthesized by the treatment of palladium(0) precursor, Pd2(dba)3 with 5-tert-butyl-1,3-bis-(N-substituted-benzimidazol-2′-yl)-2-bromobenzenes (10–13)via oxidative addition with chemical yield of 46–70%.

The Global Atmospheric Model (GAME) radiative transfer model is used to estimate the shortwave and longwave radiative forcing using an aerosol parameterization based on AERONET data and vertical profiles from a Lufft CHM-15k Nimbus ceilometer. First, eight cases confirmed as dusty days are analyzed to check the feasibility of using ceilometer profiles to feed GAME. The obtained radiative forcing estimates are in good agreement with the literature showing negative values in the short wave (SW) (cooling effect) and positive values in the long wave (LW) (heating effect), both at all levels. As in the literature, radiative forcing estimates show a strong dependence on variations in the aerosol optical depth (AOD), solar zenith angle (θz), surface temperature (ST), and single scattering albedo at 440 nm (SSA₄₄₀). Thus, GAME can be fed using ceilometer measurements obtaining reliable results. Then, as the temporal evolution of the AOD₄₄₀ between 27 January and 15 June compared to the 6-year weekly AERONET AOD₄₄₀ average (from 2014 to 2019) shows a decrease because of the lockdown imposed in Spain due to the COVID-19, a total of 37 radiative forcing calculations without African dust, divided into 8 scenarios, are performed in order to check the effect of the lockdown measures in the radiative forcing. It is shown that the decrease in the AOD, during the lockdown, caused a decrease in the cooling effect in the SW spectral range at all levels. Besides, the increase in the ST increased the heating effect of the aerosols in the LW at the top of the atmosphere and the presence of pollution and absorbing particles (SSA₄₄₀ < 0.90) caused an increase of the heating effect in the LW at the surface. Therefore, the observed variations in the radiative forcing estimates before and during the lockdown are directly related with the decrease in emissions of aerosols related to human activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aaerosols 3adepth 3adust 3aemissions 3aexhibitions 3agovernmental programs and projects 3ahumans 3aliterature 3amodels 3aparticles 3apollution 3aradiative forcing 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3asurface temperature 3atemporal variation 3aSpain1 aMolero, Francisco 1 aGranados-Muñoz, María  José1 aSalvador, Pedro 1 aPujadas, Manuel 1 aArtíñano, Begoña 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Nov. 11, v. 12, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122236993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245006100153300001600214520087600230592002801106650001601134650002001150650001101170650002101181650001501202650001601217650001501233650001501248650001601263650001601279650002101295650002001316650000901336700001601345773013101361856007401492852000901566655001201575IND60765136920221120074023.0220509e20111210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076513692DNAL7 a10.17221/4107-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, R.M.10aResponse of salt stressed barley seedlings to phenylurea  ap. 158-162.  aThe effect of phenylurea with reported cytokinin-like activities on seed germination, seedling growth, activities of antioxidant enzymes, polyphenol, peroxidase, indoleacetic acid oxidase, and total phenolic compounds, flavonoids was investigated in stressed barley seedlings.

This knowledge has been the underpinning of both the commercial development of the fluid milk processing industry and regulations and marketing policies for the benefit of dairy farmers, processors, and consumers. During the first 50 years, most of the focus was on producing and delivering high-quality raw milk to factories and improving the shelf life of pasteurized fluid milk. During the second 50 years, raw milk quality was further improved through the use of milk quality payment incentives. Due to changing demographics and lifestyle, whole fluid milk consumption declined and processing technologies were developed to increase the range of fluid milk products (skim and low-fat milks, flavored milks, lactose-reduced milk, long-shelf-life milks, and milks with higher protein and calcium contents) offered to the consumer. In addition, technology to produce specialty high-protein sports beverages was developed, which expanded the milk-based beverage offerings to the consumer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3ademographic statistics 3afactories 3afarmers 3afluid milk 3afood processing 3alifestyle 3alow fat milk 3amarketing policy 3amarkets 3amilk consumption 3amilk production 3amilk quality 3apasteurization 3araw milk 3ascientists 3ashelf life 3asports drinks 0afluid milk 0apasteurization 0aflavor 0ashelf life0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Dec., v. 100, no. 12 p.9894-9902dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-135613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245013100186300001600317520123800333592002801571650001801599650002701617650002001644650002401664650002001688650002301708650001301731650001201744650001101756650001101767650002801778650001401806650001401820650001901834650004701853650001201900650004701912650003701959650002501996650004602021650003102067650002402098650004702122650001902169650003002188650002702218650003302245650002802278650002702306700002702333700001902360700002202379773009702401856008102498852000902579655001202588IND4403996120221121044835.0151024e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440399612DNAL7 a181631892pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-007-0839-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahuman, A.

The larval mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed low larvicidal effects; however, the highest larval mortality was found in petroleum ether extract. The LC₅₀ value of petroleum ether extracts of J. curcas, P. tithymaloides, P. amarus, E. hirta, and E. tirucalli were 8.79, 55.26, 90.92, 272.36, and 4.25 ppm, respectively, against A. aegypti and 11.34, 76.61, 113.40, 424.94, and 5.52 ppm, respectively, against C quinquefasciatus. Of the various ratios tested, the petroleum ether extracts of J. curcas and E. tirucalli were observed to be more efficient than the other plant extracts. It is, therefore, suggested that E. tirucalli can be applied as an ideal potential larvicide against A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus. This is an ideal ecofriendly approach for the control of the dengue vector, A. aegypti, and the lymphatic filariasis vector, C. quinquefasciatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aEuphorbia hirta 3aEuphorbia tirucalli 3aJatropha curcas 3aPhyllanthus amarus 3aacetates 3abutanol 3adengue 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3apetroleum 3aplant extracts 2aAedesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aAnimals 2aCulexxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEuphorbiaxchemistry 2aEuphorbiaceaexchemistryxclassification. 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aJatrophaxchemistry 2aLarvaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMosquito Controlxmethods 2aPhyllanthusxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlant Stemsxchemistry1 aGopalakrishnan, Geetha1 aVenkatesan, P.1 aGeetha, Kannappan0 tParasitology research.g2008 Apr., v. 102, no. 5 p.867-873dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-007-0839-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245015100174300001400325520088700339592002801226653002201254653002501276653001401301653001901315653001701334700001701351700002001368700006401388700002301452700005801475773011801533856008801651852000901739655001201748IND60594243320221119081249.0180510e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059424332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jorganchem.2018.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Mansur10aEfficient N-heterocyclic carbene palladium(II) catalysts for carbonylative Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions leading to aryl ketones and diketones  ap. 44-51.  aNew N, N′-substituted imidazolium salts (L1 and L2) and their corresponding diiodopyridinepalladium(II) complexes (C1 and C2) were successfully synthesized and characterized.

NPQ is a process that protects photosystem II (PSII) from possible highlight-induced photo-damage. Although significant advancement has been made in understanding the NPQ, there are still some missing details. This critical review focuses on how the orange carotenoid protein (OCP) and its partner fluorescence recovery protein (FRP) control the extent of quenching. What is and what is not known about the NPQ is discussed under four subtitles; where does exactly the site of quenching lie? (site), how is the quenching being triggered? (trigger), molecular mechanism of quenching (quenching) and recovery from quenching. Finally, a recent working model of NPQ, consistent with recent findings, is been described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3acarotenoids 3amodels 3aphotosystem II 3aphycobilisome1 aGardiner, Alastair1 aRastogi, Rajesh P.1 aCogdell, Richard1 aRobert, Bruno1 aMadamwar, Datta0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2018 Aug., v. 137, no. 2 p.171-180dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-018-0498-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008700161300001800248500001100266520146500277592002801742650002401770650002801794650001701822650002001839650001001859650003301869650001501902650002601917650001601943650002101959650001501980650002501995650001602020700001702036700002002053700001602073700002002089773012902109856008102238852000902319655001202328IND60548414720221120044457.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054841472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7733-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Ying10aPolyketides in Aspergillus terreus: biosynthesis pathway discovery and application  ap. 7787-7798.  aReview  aThe knowledge of biosynthesis gene clusters, production improving methods, and bioactivity mechanisms is very important for the development of filamentous fungi metabolites. Metabolic engineering and heterologous expression methods can be applied to improve desired metabolite production, when their biosynthesis pathways have been revealed. And, stable supplement is a necessary basis of bioactivity mechanism discovery and following clinical trial. Aspergillus terreus is an outstanding producer of many bioactive agents, and a large part of them are polyketides. In this review, we took polyketides from A. terreus as examples, focusing on 13 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes in A. terreus NIH 2624 genome. The biosynthesis pathways of nine PKS genes have been reported, and their downstream metabolites are lovastatin, terreic acid, terrein, geodin, terretonin, citreoviridin, and asperfuranone, respectively. Among them, lovastatin is a well-known hypolipidemic agent. Terreic acid, terrein, citreoviridin, and asperfuranone show good bioactivities, especially anticancer activities. On the other hand, geodin and terretonin are mycotoxins. So, biosynthesis gene cluster information is important for the production or elimination of them. We also predicted three possible gene clusters that contain four PKS genes by homologous gene alignment with other Aspergillus strains. We think that this is an effective way to mine secondary metabolic gene clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus terreus 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiosynthesis 3aclinical trials 3afungi 3aheterologous gene expression 3alovastatin 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolites 3amultigene family 3amycotoxins 3apolyketide synthases 3apolyketides1 aCai, Menghao1 aZhou, Xiangshan1 aLi, Zhiyong1 aZhang, Yuanxing0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Sept., v. 100, no. 18 p.7787-7798dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7733-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01870naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245006300176300001600239520088100255592002801136650001101164650002501175650001601200700002501216700001801241700001701259700002301276700002601299773010601325856008101431990002301512852000901535655001201544IND60092969020221117230208.0141103e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009296902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelville, Mariëlle M.E.10aContinuous flow azide formation: Optimization and scale-up  ap. 556-559.  aThe intrinsically small volumes and highly controlled reaction conditions render continuous flow microreactors ideal systems for the synthesis of potentially explosive compounds such as organic azides.

In a small scale (semi-automated) continuous flow setup the diazotransfer reaction was optimized using minimal amounts of reagents; less than 400mg of benzylamine was required to perform 60 optimization reactions. The optimal reaction conditions were indentified to be room temperature, 600s of residence time and an imidazole-1-sulfonyl hydrochloride to benzylamine stoichiometric ratio of 3 to 4. Furthermore, we successfully scaled up the reaction with a factor of 200 to gram scale using one single continuous flow reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazides 3achemical engineering 3atemperature1 aNieuwland, Pieter J.1 aJanssen, Paul1 aKoch, Kaspar1 avan Hest, Jan C.M.1 aRutjes, Floris P.J.T.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 167, no. 2-3 p.556-559dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.0873Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03984naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245016500183300001600348520162900364592002801993650002002021650000902041650002802050650002302078650000902101650001402110650001502124650002102139650001102160650000902171650002402180650001702204650001502221650001002236650000902246650002202255650001202277650002202289650005702311650000902368650001002377650002102387650002802408650005002436650007902486650000902565650009302574650002702667650001102694650001102705650001102716650000902727650001602736650001502752650001702767650002102784650002902805651001102834651002602845700002602871700002202897700001502919700002002934700002002954700001802974700002302992773009703015856008103112852000903193655001203202IND4403996220221121045030.0151024e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440399622DNAL7 a181726882pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-007-0840-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPilger, Daniel10aInvestigations on the biology, epidemiology, pathology, and control of Tunga penetrans in Brazil: VII. The importance of animal reservoirs for human infestation  ap. 875-880.  aIn Brazil tungiasis is endemic in many resource-poor communities, where various domestic and sylvatic animals act as reservoirs for this zoonosis. To determine the role of animal reservoirs in human tungiasis, a cross-sectional study was performed in a traditional fishing community in northeast Brazil. The human and the animal populations were examined for the presence of embedded sand fleas and the prevalence and the intensity of infestation were correlated. The overall prevalence of tungiasis in humans was 39% (95% CI 34–43%). Of six mammal species present in the village, only cats and dogs were found infested. The prevalence in these animals was 59% (95% CI 50–68%). In households, where infested pet animals were present, a higher percentage of household members had tungiasis (42% [95% CI 30–53%] versus 27% [20–33%], p = 0.02), and the intensity of the infestation was higher (six lesions versus two lesions, p = 0.01). The intensity of infestation in animals correlated with the intensity of infestation in humans (rho = 0.3, p = 0.02). Living in a household with an infested dog or cat led to a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.1–2.3, p = 0.015) increase in the odds for the presence of tungiasis in household members in the bivariate analysis and remained a significant risk factor in the multivariate regression analysis. The study shows that in this impoverished community tungiasis is highly prevalent in humans and domestic animals. In particular, it underlines the importance to include animals in control operation aiming at the reduction of disease occurrence in the human population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTunga penetrans 3acats 3across-sectional studies 3adisease occurrence 3adogs 3afisheries 3ahouseholds 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3apets 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aCat Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitologyxpathology. 2aCats 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDisease Reservoirsxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitologyxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aDogs 2aEctoparasitic Infestationsxepidemiologyxparasitologyxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aFamily Characteristics 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aRural Population 2aSiphonapteraxphysiology 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aSchwalfenberg, Stefan1 aHeukelbach, Jörg1 aWitt, Lars1 aMehlhorn, Heinz1 aMencke, Norbert1 aKhakban, Adak1 aFeldmeier, Hermann0 tParasitology research.g2008 Apr., v. 102, no. 5 p.875-880dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-007-0840-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018400160500001400344520109600358592002801454650001201482650001701494650003001511650000901541650001601550650001701566650002101583650001101604650001901615650001501634650001901649651001401668700002101682700002201703700002301725700002101748700002701769773012901796856007401925852000901999655001202008IND60719051620221123004514.0201126e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071905162DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122237002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarmawan, Soni 10aIdentification before-after Forest Fire and Prediction of Mangrove Forest Based on Markov-Cellular Automata in Part of Sembilang National Park, Banyuasin, South Sumatra, Indonesia  aNAL-light  aIn 1997, the worst forest fire in Indonesia occurred and hit mangrove forest areas including in Sembilang National Park Banyuasin Regency, South Sumatra. Therefore, the Indonesian government keeps in trying to rehabilitate the mangrove forest in Sembilang National Park. This study aimed to identify the mangrove forest changing and to predict on the future year. The situations before and after forest fire were analyzed. This study applied an integrated Markov Chain and Cellular Automata model to identify mangrove forest change in the interval years of 1989–2015 and predict it in 2028. Remote sensing technology is used based on Landsat satellite imagery (1989, 1998, 2002, and 2015). The results showed mangrove forest has decreased around 9.6% from 1989 to 1998 due to forest fire, and has increased by 8.4% between 1998 and 2002, and 2.3% in 2002–2015. Other results show that mangroves area has continued to increase from 2015 to 2028 by 27.4% to 31% (7974.8 ha). It shows that the mangrove ecosystem is periodically changing due to good management by the Indonesian government.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aMarkov chain 3aadministrative management 3aarea 3aexhibitions 3aforest fires 3amangrove forests 3amodels 3anational parks 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3aIndonesia1 aSari, Dewi Kania1 aWikantika, Ketut 1 aTridawati, Anggun 1 aHernawati, Rika 1 aSedu, Maria Kurniawati0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Nov. 11, v. 12, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122237003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169300001800273520058500291592002800876650002100904650001200925650003100937650001700968650003200985650001601017650000901033650001101042650001701053650004401070650002201114700001301136700002001149700001701169700001601186700001201202700001401214700002001228700001801248700001901266700001201285700001801297773015501315856008601470852000901556655001201565IND60549855220221117231031.0160909e20160624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054985522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b002062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Luo-Sheng10aPepluane and Paraliane Diterpenoids from Euphorbia peplus with Potential Anti-inflammatory Activity  ap. 1628-1634.  aTwelve new diterpenoids based on two rare skeletal types, namely, paralianones A–D (1–4) and pepluanols A–H (5–12), along with five known compounds, were isolated from an acetone extract of Euphorbia peplus.

In our recent publication in Plant Journal we characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor, belonging to the R2R3-MYB family, specifically expressed in response to water deficit, involved in the regulation of these two processes. The over-expression of this gene causes both the reduction of mRNA level of some genes involved in cell expansion and the accumulation of transcript of genes with a putative role in cuticle synthesis and deposition. In this addendum we propose a model for the function of this transcription factor as an integrator of the pathway that induces cuticle components synthesis and deposition and the process that blocks cell expansion in response to water stress.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agene overexpression 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3awater stress1 aGalbiati, Massimo1 aTonelli, Chiara0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2008 Aug. 1, v. 3, no. 8 p.556-557dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.3.8.56993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300002000243520143600263592002801699650001801727650002501745650001601770650002301786650001201809650001101821650002301832700001801855700001501873700001701888700001901905700001601924773012401940856007402064852000902138655001202147IND60648031920221117031038.0190625e20190611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064803192DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra03121a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Dongryul10aHigh-energy proton irradiation damage on two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride  ap. 18326-18332.  aThe dielectric layer, which is an essential building block in electronic device circuitry, is subject to intrinsic or induced defects that limit its performance. Nano-layers of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) represent a promising dielectric layer in nano-electronics owing to its excellent electronic and thermal properties. In order to further analyze this technology, two-dimensional (2D) h-BN dielectric layers were exposed to high-energy proton irradiation at various proton energies and doses to intentionally introduce defective sites. A pristine h-BN capacitor showed typical degradation stages with a hard breakdown field of 10.3 MV cm⁻¹, while h-BN capacitors irradiated at proton energies of 5 and 10 MeV at a dose of 1 × 10¹³ cm⁻² showed lower hard breakdown fields of 1.6 and 8.3 MV cm⁻¹, respectively. Higher leakage currents were observed under higher proton doses at 5 × 10¹³ cm⁻², resulting in lower breakdown fields. The degradation stages of proton-irradiated h-BN are similar to those of defective silicon dioxide. The degradation of the h-BN dielectric after proton irradiation is attributed to Frenkel defects created by the high-energy protons, as indicated by the molecular dynamics simulation. Understanding the defect-induced degradation mechanism of h-BN nano-layers can improve their reliability, paving the way to the implementation of 2D h-BN in advanced micro- and nano-electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3aelectronic equipment 3airradiation 3amolecular dynamics 3aprotons 3asilica 3athermal properties1 aYoo, Sanghyuk1 aBae, Jinho1 aPark, Hyunik1 aKang, Keonwook1 aKim, Jihyun0 tRSC advances.g2019 June 11, v. 9, no. 32 p.18326-18332dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra03121a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245018400170300001600354520191400370592002802284650002302312650002102335650002002356650003102376650001502407650001302422650001102435650001102446650001002457653002802467653002102495653003002516653002702546700002502573700002002598773011002618856008102728852000902809655001202818IND60131158720221121072300.0151127e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013115872DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-12.00041.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBangarwa, Sanjeev K.10aEffects of Shoot Clipping–Soil Disturbance Frequency and Tuber Size on Aboveground and Belowground Growth of Purple and Yellow Nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus and Cyperus esculentus)  ap. 813-817.  aPurple and yellow nutsedges are two of the world's worst weeds, reproducing asexually by rhizomes that can develop into new shoots or tubers. These tubers are the storage organs for carbohydrate reserves that are replenished by growing shoots and exhausted by new shoot, root plus rhizome, and basal bulb production. Based on the biology of both species, we hypothesized that the regenerative potential of purple and yellow nutsedge would decrease, with increasing shoot clipping–soil disturbance (SCSD) frequency and decreasing tuber size. To test this hypothesis, greenhouse experiments were conducted in pots to determine the effect of SCSD frequency and tuber size on aboveground and belowground growth of purple and yellow nutsedges. Five viable tubers of two tuber category sizes (small, 0.40 ± 0.05; and large, 0.80 ± 0.05 g of tuber fresh weight) were subjected to four SCSD frequencies (weekly, biweekly, monthly, and none) for 12 wk. SCSD was performed by clipping the emerged nutsedge shoots followed by manually disturbing the soil. SCSD at biweekly or weekly intervals reduced purple nutsedge proliferation, regardless of initial tuber size. However, monthly SCSD did not suppress purple nutsedge as effectively as weekly or biweekly SCSD, and less proliferation occurred with small tubers than with large tubers. In contrast, yellow nutsedge proliferation was equally reduced with monthly or more-frequent SCSD, regardless of initial tuber size. Even weekly soil disturbance for 12 wk failed to eradicate all small or large tubers in either species. Thus, yellow nutsedge is managed more easily than purple nutsedge with less-frequent tillage or cultivation.

Mechanisms that drive P limitation, and their interactions with the N cycle, have received less attention than mechanisms causing N limitation. We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. The best known of these is depletion‐driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long‐term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a “terminal steady state” of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P‐containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low‐P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low‐P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P. Similarly, demand‐independent losses and constraints to N fixation can control the ecosystem‐level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asoil nutrient balance 3aphosphorus 2aClimate Change 2aEcosystem 2aNitrogenxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aPhosphorusxchemistryxmetabolism. 0abiogeochemistry 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aPorder, Stephen1 aHoulton, Benjamin Z.1 aChadwick, Oliver A.0 tEcological applications.g2010 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.5-15dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0127.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01777naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002200183245004200205300001600247506007600263520052200339592002800861506003700889650002000926650002000946650002100966650002200987650002801009650002401037700001301061700002401074700001601098700001501114700001701129700001901146773011701165856007601282852000901358655001201367IND60690103220221207095121.0200425e20080801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069010322DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.3.8.57032doi7 aPMC26344962pmcid7 a197044682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, Andrew G.14aThe molecular language of semagenesis  ap. 560-561.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSemagenesis, the process of signal generation, is a novel signaling strategy first uncovered within the parasitic plants.

The presence of endophytic fungi in blueberry roots has been studied mainly in the area of origin of each species. The aims of the present study were to determine the occurrence of endophytic fungi in the roots of southern highbush blueberry (SHB) cultivars, in the three most important blueberry production areas of Argentina, and identify them. Soil samples with blueberry rootlets were obtained and endophytic fungi were isolated from them. Some of them by classical taxonomy identification, and, when this was not possible, PCR amplified material were sequenced (Macrogen laboratory), DNA fragments were analyzed with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and identified, through GenBank. Blueberry roots were found to be colonized by a large number of fungal genera, which varied greatly among locations and cultivars. Some of the endophytic fungi identified have pathogenic function, others are only plant hosts, and some of them have mycorrhizal function as is the case of genus Oidiodendron where we found O. maius and O. echinulatum. We may conclude that SHB is associated with local ericoid fungi, some of which are mycorrhizal and some dark septate endophytes, which, in most cases, do not match with those found in production regions of their native area, but same of them are important to promote blueberry growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3ablueberries 3acultivars 3aendophytes 3afibrous roots 3aplant pathology 3asoil 3ataxonomy 3aArgentina 0aMycorrhizal fungi 0aDSE fungi 0aVaccinium corymbosum 0aModified soil 0aPathogenic fungi1 aFradkin, Maia1 aLavado, Raúl S.1 aChiocchio, Viviana M.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2021 Aug., v. 115 p.101662-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2021.1016623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04618naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245010200173300001800275500002000293520309300313592002803406650002203434650002203456650001003478650001303488650002103501650002103522650001703543650001203560650001603572650001603588650002203604650001503626650001103641650001203652650001803664650002403682650002403706650001403730650002903744650002503773650001103798650001803809650001003827650001203837650001003849700001903859773011003878856007903988852000904067655001204076IND60571298120221118005339.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057129812DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.127042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetchfield, Rosemary P.14aThe influence of crop tiller density on the breeding performance of a cereal‐nesting specialist  ap. 1430-1439.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the pursuit of maximizing agricultural yields and profits, crop management under intensive agriculture has reduced the heterogeneity of crop sward structure within fields. Several farmland bird specialists that nest within arable crops have undergone marked population declines during recent periods of agricultural intensification. Understanding the mechanisms that link crop sward structure to demographic fitness and population change may be important for developing effective conservation solutions. We studied whole‐season breeding performance of a declining cereal crop specialist, the corn bunting Emberiza calandra, to test the relationships between crop sward structure and both nest site selection and reproductive output within intensively farmed landscapes. Experimental double‐drilling of cereal seed was used to manipulate crop sward structure and explain the observed within‐field nest distribution. The density of crop tillers (reproductive cereal stems) was a strong predictor of nest site selection and a disproportionate number of nests occurred close to (15–30 m) crop edges where regular seed sowing overlaps (operational double‐drilling) occurred during crop establishment. Nest survival was subject to a strong crop edge effect and re‐nesting rate increased with mean tiller density in the surrounding crop. Experimental double‐drilling that simulated seed sowing overlaps increased crop tiller density (by 25%) and corn bunting nest density (by 406%) compared to adjacent areas of operational double‐drilling. Corn buntings breeding in intensively managed cereal crops therefore place their nests in areas of high tiller density which under normal sowing practice tend to occur close to crop edges where nest survival is low. A simple population model indicated that productivity under conventional, intensive cereal management may be too low to sustain local populations in the absence of immigration. Modern cereal husbandry therefore creates an ecological trap for nesting corn buntings. Synthesis and applications. This study highlights a novel mechanism by which modern cereal crop management lowers the potential reproductive success of a conservation priority species nesting in intensively managed cereal crops. Unavoidable overlapping of cereal seed along crop headlands, close to crop edges, systematically produces patches of dense sward that attract nesting corn buntings. This creates an ecological trap because nests close to crop edges are subject to high predation rates, and this may be linked to the loss of arable weeds elsewhere within crops. When double‐drilled strips are intentionally provided adjacent to these areas, nesting preference switches to these strips, suggesting a potential conservation solution. Provision of mid‐field double‐drilled strips at least 100 m from crop edges, if similarly selected by nesting females, should raise nest survival rates and improve population trends. Such interventions are simple and cheap to implement, unlike most conservation measures in high‐value cropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmberiza calandra 3aagricultural land 3abirds 3abreeding 3acropping systems 3aecological traps 3aedge effects 3afemales 3agrain crops 3aimmigration 3aintensive farming 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anesting 3anesting sites 3aplant establishment 3apopulation dynamics 3apredation 3areproductive performance 3areproductive success 3asowing 3asurvival rate 3asward 3atillers 3aweeds1 aPeach, Will J.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2016 Oct., v. 53, no. 5 p.1430-1439dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.127043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009600170300001800266520126600284592002801550650002401578650002101602650002301623650001601646650001501662650002301677650003701700650001101737650001301748650000901761650002401770650001801794650002101812700001801833700002401851700001901875700001901894700001901913700001801932773015501950856008602105852000902191655001202200IND60549855420221117230937.0160909e20160624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054985542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b002172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Yun-Lung10aMethyl Protodioscin, a Steroidal Saponin, Inhibits Neointima Formation in Vitro and in Vivo  ap. 1635-1644.  aRestenosis (or neointimal hyperplasia) remains a clinical limitation of percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are known to be involved in the development of restenosis. The present study aimed to investigate the ability and molecular mechanisms of methyl protodioscin (1), a steroidal saponin isolated from the root of Dioscorea nipponica, to inhibit neointimal formation. Our study demonstrated that 1 markedly inhibited the growth and migration of VSMCs (A7r5 cells). A cytometric analysis suggested that 1 induced growth inhibition by arresting VSMCs at the G₁ phase of the cell cycle. A rat carotid artery balloon injury model indicated that neointima formation of the balloon-injured vessel was markedly reduced after extravascular administration of 1. Compound 1 decreased the expression levels of ADAM15 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 15) and its downstream signaling pathways in the VSMCs. Moreover, the expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were also suppressed by 1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms appear to be mediated, in part, through the downregulation of ADAM15, FAK, ERK, and PI3K/Akt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea nipponica 3acarotid arteries 3agrowth retardation 3ahyperplasia 3ainterphase 3ametalloproteinases 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3amyocytes 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asmooth muscle 3asteroid saponins1 aPan, Chun-Hsu1 aWang, Charles

It can serve as key co-activators of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. Studies have found that white and brown adipocytes both originate from the mesoderm. However, it remains unclear whether lncRNAs function during adipogenesis or in energy metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, we used lncRNA microarray technology to evaluate differences in the lncRNA expression profiles of WAT and BAT. We observed 735 up-regulated and 877 down-regulated lncRNAs (fold change >4.0). To reveal the potential functions of these lncRNAs, we applied GO and pathway analyses to study the differentially expressed lncRNAs. We found that AK142386 and AK133540 may affect adipogenesis and metabolism. Our data indicate that AK142386 and AK133540 may be involved in BAT and WAT development through their target genes Hoxa3 and Acad10. Together, we have identified numerous lncRNAs and these lncRNAs can potentially serve as a required component for proper adipogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3abrown adipose tissue 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3anon-coding RNA 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3awhite adipose tissue1 aCui, Xianwei1 aShi, Chunmei1 aChen, Ling1 aYang, Lei1 aPang, Lingxia1 aZhang, Jun1 aGuo, Xirong1 aWang, Jiaqin1 aJi, Chenbo0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 Apr., v. 290, no. 2 p.699-707dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-014-0954-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009500165300001400260520161100274592002801885650000801913650001501921650002101936650002301957650002601980650000902006650001202015650001902027650001602046650001902062650003102081650001502112650001102127650002602138650002302164650001502187650001402202650001702216650001202233650001202245650001802257653001502275653000902290653001802299653003802317653001702355700001902372700001702391700002202408700001602430700001702446773010402463856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60615153920221120170010.0181009e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061515392DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985893030001032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellmén, E.10aPrognostic Factors in Canine Mammary Tumors: A Multivariate Study of 202 Consecutive Cases  ap. 20-27.  aThe prognostic variables of 223 consecutively sampled spontaneous mammary tumors from female dogs were studied. These variables included flow cytometric DNA analysis and cell proliferation measured as cells in S-phase rate evaluated from DNA histograms. The dogs were surgically treated, in most cases with unilateral mastectomy (all mammary glands), and 202 of the 223 dogs were studied temporally following surgery. Univariate analysis with correction for age indicated that the variables of lymph node metastasis, elevated S-phase rate, presence of a sarcoma, DNA aneuploidy, and ulceration and infiltrative growth into underlying tissue had a statistically significant negative influence on the survival rates of dogs with a diagnosed malignant tumor. Similar results were obtained from tests on all dogs, but tumor size and its relative hazard increased with increasing size of the tumors, regardless of whether total or disease-specific mortality was considered. Using multivariate-analysisconducted Cox's proportional hazards model, elevated S-phase rate, increased age, and presence of a sarcoma remained statistically significant risk factors. The prognostic value of DNA ploidy and lymph node status varied depending on choice of end point. The study of tumor growth pattern and tumor size provided no prognostic information in the multivariate analysis. Flow cytometric cell analysis, including S-phase rate and DNA ploidy, is of value in predicting the prognosis of canine mammary tumors and can be used as a new prognostic tool to improve the preoperative diagnostics of canine mammary tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaneuploidy 3aanimal pathology 3acell proliferation 3adiagnostic techniques 3adogs 3afemales 3aflow cytometry 3alymph nodes 3amammary glands 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3ametastasis 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3anutritional status 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3arisk factors 3asarcoma 3asurgery 3asurvival rate 0aDNA ploidy 0adogs 0amammary tumor 0amultivariate statistical analysis 0aS-phase rate1 aBergström, R.1 aHolmberg, L.1 aSpångberg, I.-B.1 aHansson, K.1 aLindgren, A.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.20-27dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985893030001033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04464naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002200092024001900114024002700133040001800160100002600178245009100204300001400295500002000309500001500329506007600344520253500420592002802955506003702983650001903020650001703039650001303056650002303069650002203092650002203114650001903136650001503155650001803170650001503188650001203203650001803215650006303233650001403296650001603310650003103326650001103357650002303368650001303391650001503404650001303419653002403432700002203456700002303478700002503501700002303526700002503549700002303574700001803597773012803615852000903743856007403752655001203826IND4437212020221207064357.0180321e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443721202DNAL7 aPMC28483862pmcid7 a203498282pmid7 a10.1890/08-0633.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Pieter T.

One of the most profound changes to Earth's ecosystems is the alteration of global nutrient cycles, including those of phosphorus (P) and especially nitrogen (N). Along with the obvious direct benefits of nutrient application for food production, anthropogenic inputs of N and P can indirectly affect the abundance of infectious and noninfectious pathogens. The mechanisms underpinning observed correlations, however, and how such patterns vary with disease type, have long remained conjectural. Here, we highlight recent experimental advances to critically evaluate the relationship between environmental nutrient enrichment and disease. Given the interrelated nature of human and wildlife disease emergence, we include a broad range of human and wildlife examples from terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. We examine the consequences of nutrient pollution on directly transmitted, vector‐borne, complex life cycle, and noninfectious pathogens, including West Nile virus, malaria, harmful algal blooms, coral reef diseases, and amphibian malformations. Our synthetic examination suggests that the effects of environmental nutrient enrichment on disease are complex and multifaceted, varying with the type of pathogen, host species and condition, attributes of the ecosystem, and the degree of enrichment; some pathogens increase in abundance whereas others decline or disappear. Nevertheless, available evidence indicates that ecological changes associated with nutrient enrichment often exacerbate infection and disease caused by generalist parasites with direct or simple life cycles. Observed mechanisms include changes in host/vector density, host distribution, infection resistance, pathogen virulence or toxicity, and the direct supplementation of pathogens. Collectively, these pathogens may be particularly dangerous because they can continue to cause mortality even as their hosts decline, potentially leading to sustained epidemics or chronic pathology. We suggest that interactions between nutrient enrichment and disease will become increasingly important in tropical and subtropical regions, where forecasted increases in nutrient application will occur in an environment rich with infectious pathogens. We emphasize the importance of careful disease management in conjunction with continued intensification of global nutrient cycles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahuman diseases 3aalgal blooms 3anitrogen 3amarine environment 3aemerging diseases 3awildlife diseases 3aeutrophication 3aecosystems 3asurface water 3aphosphorus 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wild 2aCommunicable Diseases, Emergingxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aEcosystem 2aFertilizers 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogen 2aPhosphorus 2aZoonoses 0aaquatic environment1 aTownsend, Alan R.1 aCleveland, Cory C.1 aGlibert, Patricia M.1 aHowarth, Robert W.1 aMcKenzie, Valerie J.1 aRejmankova, Eliska1 aWard, Mary H.0 tEcological applications.g2010 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.16-29dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0633.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02840naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010400179300001800283520141300301592002801714650002001742650001701762650001101779650001301790650001501803650002901818650001101847650002501858650001201883650000901895650001201904650001401916650001201930650001601942700002601958700002601984700002702010700004502037700003702082700004302119773013002162856008102292852000902373655001202382IND60596476820221120234905.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059647682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-018-5853-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavanelli, MarianaFelgueira10aAssemblages A and B of Giardia duodenalis reduce enteric glial cells in the small intestine in mice  ap. 2025-2033.  aInfection of Giardia duodenalis is one of the most common human parasitic disease worldwide. This infection may be related to important changes in the enteric nervous system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, the intestinal muscle layer, and gastrointestinal transit in mice infected with assemblages A and B of G. duodenalis. Swiss albino mice (Mus musculus) were infected with assemblages A and B of G. duodenalis for 15 days. Gastrointestinal transit time was evaluated before euthanasia. Duodenum and jejunum were removed for histological and immunohistochemical analyses. It was observed a reduction in the enteric glial cell count and a decrease in the ratio of enteric glial cells to neurons. The number of neurons did not change, but morphological changes were observed in the duodenum and jejunum in both plexuses, including an increase in the nuclear area and a reduction of cell bodies in the myenteric plexus and a decrease in the nuclear area in the submucosal plexus. A reduction of the thickness of the muscle layer was observed in the duodenum, with no significant differences in the gastrointestinal transit times. Assemblages A and B of G. duodenalis decrease the number of enteric glial cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, decrease the thickness of the muscle layer, and change the morphology of neurons.

Here, we present detailed data on breeding biology and life history for an Australasian tropical granivore, the Crimson Finch (Neochmia phaeton), emphasising aspects of their life history that are atypical of southern passerines. We collected data over three breeding seasons at Mornington Wildlife Sanctuary in north-western Australia. Apparent annual survival of adults was high, at 70–96%. Crimson Finches were multi-brooded and laid 5.08 ± 0.07 eggs per clutch. The rate of nest predation was high, with 59.7% of clutches lost to predation. Thus, Crimson Finch life history contradicts the leading explanation of the clutch-size gradient—that higher rates of nest predation and higher adult survival in southern species select for smaller clutch-sizes. Our findings are more consistent with other explanations of the clutch-size gradient, specifically those involving post-fledging parental care, diet, seasonality and phylogeny. Exploring life histories that differ from the norm may be particularly helpful in understanding latitudinal differences in these strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeochmia phaeton 3aadults 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3aclutch size 3aconservation areas 3adiet 3aeggs 3agranivores 3alife history 3anests 3aphylogeny 3apredation 3aAustralia1 aLegge, Sarah1 aWalters, Jeffrey R.0 tEmu.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 111, no. 4 p.312-320dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU100883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008500164300001600249520106300265592002801328650001101356650001901367650001901386650001801405650001101423650000901434650003001443700001901473700001901492700001801511700001401529700001601543700001301559700001901572700001801591700001501609700001201624700001501636773010701651856008101758852000901839655001201848IND60123646320221120181316.0150328e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012364632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-014-0956-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Wen-Xia10aAssociation between the CYP1A2 polymorphisms and risk of cancer: a meta-analysis  ap. 709-725.  aThe previously published data on the association between CYP1A2*1C (rs2069514) and CYP1A2*1F (rs762551) polymorphisms and cancer risk have remained controversial. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between CYP1A2*1F and CYP1A2*1C polymorphisms and cancer risk under different inheritance models. Overall, significant association was observed between CYP1A2*1F and cancer risk when all the eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (dominant model: OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.02–1.15; heterozygous model: OR 1.06, 95 % CI 1.01–1.12; additive model: OR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.02–1.13). In the further stratified and sensitivity analyses, for CYP1A2*1F polymorphism, significantly increased lung cancer risk and significantly decreased bladder cancer risk were observed in Caucasians. For CYP1A2*1C polymorphism, no significant association was found in overall and all subgroup analyses. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that CYP1A2*1F polymorphism is associated with lung cancer and bladder cancer risk in Caucasians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhites 3aheterozygosity 3alung neoplasms 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3arisk 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aChen, Ying-Hua1 aLiu, Zhi-Zhong1 aXie, Jian-Jun1 aWang, Wei1 aDu, Ya-Ping1 aChen, Yu1 aShen, Xu-Liang1 aHe, Xiao-Feng1 aWu, Li-Xia1 aWei, Wu1 aZhang, Lin0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 Apr., v. 290, no. 2 p.709-725dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-014-0956-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010100169300001600270500000900286520211900295592002802414650002302442650001802465650002302483650002602506650002502532650002202557650004302579650003702622650002102659650001502680650001102695650002202706650001402728650002302742650000902765650002402774650001502798650001602813650001502829650001502844651001302859700002302872700002402895700002302919773012002942856008103062852000903143655001203152IND60665344720221118222453.0191228e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066534472DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.04532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayles, Melanie B.10aTrends over Time among Cotton Cultivars Released by the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station  ap. 966-980.  aepub  aTwelve cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars, released by the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station (OAES) between 1918 and 1982 inclusive, were evaluated in multiple environments to estimate selection progress over time for lint yield, six fiber properties, eight agronomic characters, and three diseases. Lint yield increased 1.2 to 3.0 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ on dryland and 3.7 to 5.6 kg under irrigation. Five of six experiments indicated that a selection plateau had not yet been reached for lint yield. Increases in fiber length of 0.04 to 0.06 mm yr⁻¹ and of 0.02 mm yr⁻¹ were observed for 2.5 and 50% span lengths, respectively. Uniformity index and micronaire displayed significant differences among cultivars, but no significant trends over time. T₀ fiber strength increased by 0.5 kN m kg⁻¹ yr⁻¹ Initially, T₁ fiber strength declined; but since the mid-1940s, its trend was upward by 0.6 kN m kg⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in a generally linear fashion. Picked and pulled lint percentages increased rapidly at first but reached a plateau in the mid-1940s. Boll size increased over time, and bur size increased slightly. Weight of lint per boll increased through 1955, but has since remained essentially constant. Relatively large improvements were made in lint index through 1964; but since then, the trait has remained stable. Seed index increased by 0.02 g (100 seed)⁻¹ yr⁻¹ on dryland and by 0.03 g under irrigation. Lock tenacity increased by 1.7 g force yr⁻¹ Positive trends over time were also noted for resistance to bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum (Smith) Dye] and to the Fusarium wilt [caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlect. f. sp. vasinfectum (Atk.)

It has been shown to enhance nutrient uptake including phosphate, nitrogen, potassium and calcium. In the experiment, the droughtinduced root hairs were collected. By transcriptome sequence and analysis, the molecular mechanisms and differentially expressed genes related to root hairs growth and development were studied. As a result, by using the HiSeq 2500 platform, 61,872,790 clean reads with 96.23% Q20 bases and 9.28 Gb clean bases with 58.88% GC ratio were obtained for normal root. In contrast with Control group, 67,650,572 clean reads with 96.43% Q20 bases and 10.15 Gb clean bases with 58.3% GC content were obtained for drought-induced root hairs. Totally, 323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Among these DEGs, 109 genes were upregulated and 214 genes were downregulated in drought-induced root hairs. Moreover, metabolic pathway enrichment analysises on the 323 DEGs revealed that totally 10 metabolic pathways were distinctly regulated. In details, alanine, aspartate and alutamate metabolism, galactose metabolism and nitrogen metabolism were significantly upregulated. 7 metabolic pathways such as phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and flavonoid biosynthesis were significantly downregulated. Furthermore, functional genes and transcription factors were both found to be involved in drought-induced root hair proliferation. These results will help us understand better the molecular mechanism of maize root hair growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aaspartic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3acorn 3aflavonoids 3agalactose 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3aphenylalanine 3aphosphates 3apotassium 3aroot hairs 3asecondary metabolites 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3atransporters1 aYang, Huaying1 aZhang, Wei1 aXu, Dafeng1 aDong, Qing1 aWang, Fang1 aLei, Yanli1 aLiu, Guihu1 aZhou, Yingbing1 aChen, Hongjian1 aLi, Cheng0 tJournal of plant biology =.g2017 Feb., v. 60, no. 1 p.26-34dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1226-92397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-016-0412-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245007900167300001600246520145500262592002801717650002001745650001501765650001701780650001301797650001001810650002001820650001901840650001001859653002301869653001601892653001901908653000901927700002001936700002701956700002801983773011002011856008102121852000902202655001202211IND60131159120221121072251.0151127e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013115912DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-11-00175.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDittmar, Peter J.10aEffects of Halosulfuron POST on Sweetpotato Yield and Storage Root Quality  ap. 113-116.  aField studies were conducted to determine the effect of halosulfuron at 0, 13, 26, 39 or 52 g ha⁻¹ applied 10, 22, and 31 d after planting (DAP) on ‘Beauregard' and ‘Covington' sweetpotato. Storage roots were harvested, graded, cured, and stored in controlled environment for 2 mo. Where injury on storage roots was observed, external injury occurred on the surface of the storage root as a blackened area with blistering and internal injury consisted of small red-brown spots inside the sweetpotato storage root. Total yield of sweetpotato with 13 g ha⁻¹ halosulfuron treatment (155,157 kg ha⁻¹) was similar to the nontreated check (162,002 kg ha⁻¹). However, halosulfuron rates above 13 g ha⁻¹ resulted in a reduction of marketable grade roots and total yield of sweetpotato. Regardless of rate and timing of halosulfuron, external and internal injury to Beauregard storage roots was less than 6 and 9%, respectively. No external injury to Covington was observed from all rates of halosulfuron applied POST at 10 DAP. Halosulfuron at 22 DAP to Covington caused greater external injury to storage roots than was observed on the nontreated. Thus, Beauregard appears more tolerant to halosulfuron POST than Covington. To minimize internal or external injury to storage roots of Covington, halosulfuron must be applied within 10 DAP.Nomenclature: Halosulfuron; sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas (L.)

The current report details the use of an electrical impedance assay (xCELLigence, ACEA Biosciences) for its utility in virucidal efficacy testing. In this study, the xCELLigence system was used in a procedure developed from guidelines given by the Deutsche Vereiniging zur Bekämpfung der Viruskrankheiten (DVV) (German Association for the Control of Virus Diseases) in order to demonstrate the inactivation of infectious bursal disease virus using a commercial virucide. Although the modified DVV assay using the xCELLigence system yielded identical results (i.e. a 5-log10 reduction in viral infectivity) as the traditional DVV assay, the system allows virucidal efficacy and cytotoxicity to be measured in a more precise and reproducible fashion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotocols 3adisinfectants 3acytotoxicity 3adisease control 3alight microscopy 3acytopathogenicity 3aviruses 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 0aVirucide efficacy 0aElectrical impedance assay 0aCytopathic effect 0aimpedance1 aCoetzee, Peter1 aVenter, E.H.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2014 Apr., v. 199 p.25-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245010200155300001400257520122700271592002801498650001501526650001001541650001101551650001301562650001301575650002301588650002201611650001101633651001801644651001801662653002201680653001901702653001601721653001501737700002101752700002201773700002201795700002301817773010001840856007101940852000902011655001202020IND60694230420221119003411.0200510e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069423042DNAL7 a10.1071/MU100912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahn, Alex E.10aPatterns of partial avian migration in northern and southern temperate latitudes of the New World  ap. 17-22.  aWe describe partial migration of passerine birds across temperate latitudes in the New World. Owing to lower climatic seasonality near the coast of North America, the proportion of partial migrants at high latitudes in North America should be lower when excluding coastal records. We detected a 10% decrease in the proportion of partially migratory species at high latitudes when excluding species recorded only coastally at those latitudes. We also expected a smaller proportion of partial migrants in inland North America compared with South America. However, at high latitudes (i.e. >39°) we found a similar proportion of partially migratory species but a different taxonomic makeup between continents. Within the Tyrannidae (New World flycatchers), we evaluated the latitude at which species winter in North and South America. The mean latitude at which partially migratory New World flycatchers winter in temperate South America (30.3°S.s.d.5.6)is not significantly different from the mean latitude in inland North America (30.4°N, s.d. 2.8). Partial migration of birds in the New World may be under different constraints, depending on factors such as habitat occupancy and distance of a population from the coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTyrannidae 3abirds 3acoasts 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3awinter 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aaustral migration 0acontinentality 0aseasonality 0aoverwinter1 aBravo, Susana P.1 aCueto, Víctor R.1 aLevey, Douglas J.1 aMorales, Marvin V.0 tEmu.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 112, no. 1 p.17-22dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU100913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04127naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003300130024004000163040001800203100002000221245009300241300001800334500002000352506002800372506003000400520223000430592002802660596008202688596006402770596004502834506003702879650002702916650001202943650001502955650002302970650001502993650001803008650001003026650001503036650001503051650001503066650001403081650002303095650002403118650001903142650001503161651002403176651001803200700002303218700002303241700003303264700002003297773011003317856007903427903002203506852000903528655001203537IND60571298420221207115458.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057129842DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.126742chorus7 a10.1111/1365-2664.126742doi7 a10.1111/1365-2664.126742chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTwidwell, Dirac10aExtreme prescribed fire during drought reduces survival and density of woody resprouters  ap. 1585-1596.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aManagement intervention in ecosystems with degraded environmental services requires innovative resource management strategies that go beyond conventional restoration and conservation practices. We established a unique study that experimentally targeted extreme fire conditions during drought in humid subtropical and semi‐arid ecoregions. In the southern Great Plains of North America, conventional restoration and conservation practices have been either historically ineffective or economically cost‐prohibitive at restoring grass‐dominated ecosystems following conversion to resprouting shrublands. Our aim was to assess the potential for extreme fire during drought to force the system along an alternate ecological trajectory from its current progression towards closed‐canopy resprouting shrubland, something that conventional fire prescriptions have been unable to accomplish. We first tested the potential for high‐intensity fires exhibiting extreme behaviour to disrupt the progression from grassland to shrubland. In both ecoregions, significant levels of mortality were observed for mature woody resprouters. As a result, densities were either maintained or reduced 3 years following extreme fire treatments, whereas resprouter densities continued to increase in areas that were not burned. A second interventionist approach involving extreme fire and herbicide treatment combinations was not supported. Interactions between prescribed extreme fire and herbicide did not significantly reduce resprouter densities more than using herbicide alone at either site. Synthesis and applications. Extreme fires during drought resulted in exceptionally high levels of mortality across all sizes of woody resprouters and limited recruitment, resulting in 35–55% lower densities of resprouters than in areas not burned. These findings counter prevailing scientific and management expectations, which are based largely on studies that impose tight controls over prescribed fire conditions and avoid extreme fire behaviour. Future interventions for controlling woody resprouters with fire may require rethinking the present ideology that extreme fire behaviour has no place in modern social–ecological landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data  cRob and Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006004  cTexas AgriLife Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004913  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconservation practices 3adrought 3aecoregions 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afire behavior 3afires 3agrasslands 3aherbicides 3alandscapes 3amortality 3aprescribed burning 3aresource management 3asemiarid zones 3ashrublands 3aGreat Plains region 3aNorth America1 aRogers, William E.1 aWonkka, Carissa L.1 aTaylor, Charles A., Jr.cJr.1 aKreuter, Urs P.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2016 Oct., v. 53, no. 5 p.1585-1596dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.126743Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013600160300001600296520189000312592002802202650002202230650001102252650001202263650001202275650002502287650002802312650002402340650002202364650000902386650001802395650001102413650001502424650001302439650000902452700001502461773010702476856008102583852000902664655001202673IND60123646420221120181318.0150328e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012364642DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-014-0928-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ming10aQuantitative assessment of the influence of common variation rs16892766 at 8q23.3 with colorectal adenoma and cancer susceptibility  ap. 461-469.  aEpidemiological studies indicate a genetic contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal adenoma (CRA) risk, but specific genetic variants remain unknown. Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified 8q23.3-rs16892766 as a new CRC susceptibility locus in populations of European descent. Since then, the relationship between 8q23.3-rs16892766 and CRC/CRA has been reported in various ethnic groups; however, these studies have yielded inconsistent results. To investigate this inconsistency and derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, we conducted a meta-analysis of 13 studies, including 41,728 patients and 44,393 controls for CRC, and 3,767 patients and 11,607 controls for CRA. An overall random-effects per-allele odds ratio of 1.19 (95 % CI: 1.13–1.25, P < 10⁻⁵) was found for the rs16892766 polymorphism and CRC/CRA risk. When stratified by outcome, the rs16892766 polymorphism was significantly associated with increased CRC risk with per-allele OR of 1.22 (95 % CI: 1.18–1.27, P < 10⁻⁵), while no associations were found for CRA (OR = 1.05, 95 % CI: 0.91–1.25, P = 0.49). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased CRC risks were found among Caucasians (OR = 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.17–1.29, P < 10⁻⁵) and African American (OR = 1.18, 95 % CI: 1.07–1.29, P = 0.001); while no significant associations were found among other ethnic populations. Similar results were also observed under dominant and recessive genetic models. Ethnicity was identified as a potential source of between-study heterogeneity for rs16892766. When stratified by sample size and study design, significantly increased CRC risks were found for the polymorphism in all genetic models. Our findings demonstrated that rs16892766-C allele might be risk-conferring factors for the development of CRC, but not for CRA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aWhites 3aadenoma 3aalleles 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aepidemiological studies 3aexperimental design 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3arisk1 aGu, Yahong0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 Apr., v. 290, no. 2 p.461-469dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-014-0928-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245013100181300001600312520123400328592002801562653001101590653001701601653003801618653003801656653003101694653001901725700002301744700002401767700002301791773010301814856008701917852000902004655001202013IND60594175120221118005115.0180510e20180410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059417512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOshchepkov, Alexandr G.10aOn the effect of temperature and surface oxidation on the kinetics of hydrogen electrode reactions on nickel in alkaline media  ap. 111-118.  aThe influence of the temperature on the kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and evolution reactions (HER) on Ni electrodes has been explored in the range from 298 to 338 K. By combining an expexrimental cyclic voltammetry study and microkinetic modeling, the rate constants and the activation energies of the individual Volmer-Tafel-Heyrovsky steps have been extracted for two surface states of Ni electrode, namely metallic Ni and partially oxidized one. The kinetic model suggests that the HOR/HER on metallic Ni follows the Heyrovsky-Volmer mechanism characterized by strong adsorption of the hydrogen intermediate and low reaction rate. Partial coverage of the electrode surface with Ni oxide species results in a decrease of the strength of adsorption of hydrogen atoms and an increase of the rate of the Volmer step thus leading to a significant enhancement of the HOR/HER kinetics. Furthermore, the kinetic model provides evidence for a contribution of the Tafel step in the reaction mechanism for a partially oxidized electrode. The apparent activation energy is shown to be slightly dependent on the surface state, decreasing from 30 ± 1 for metallic to 26 ± 1 kJ mol⁻¹ for partially oxidized Ni.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNickel 0aNickel oxide 0aHydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) 0aHydrogen evolution reaction (HER) 0aMeanfield kinetic modeling 0aAlkaline media1 aBonnefont, Antoine1 aParmon, Valentin N.1 aSavinova, Elena R.0 tElectrochimica acta.g2018 Apr. 10, v. 269 p.111-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006500171300001800236500000900254520147000263592002801733650001801761650002801779650001201807650002201819650001401841650001101855650001801866650001701884650001001901773013301911856008402044852000902128655001202137IND60665344920221118222713.0191122e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066534492DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2014.09.06692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoward, Philip H.10aIntellectual Property and Consolidation in the Seed Industry  ap. 2489-2495.  aepub  aIntellectual property protections on seeds have increased dramatically in recent decades, from the granting of patent-like protections on certain types of seeds in 1970 to the enforcement of contract provisions for seeds beyond the first sale in 2013. During this same period, the seed industry has experienced rapid consolidation. Although as recently as the 1970s, it was characterized by thousands of small, mostly family-owned business, by 2011, just three agrochemical firms controlled more than half of the global proprietary seed market. These trends have resulted in rapidly increasing prices for commodity seeds and reduced farmers’ ability to save seeds. Given these important negative impacts, why do these trends continue? Expanding intellectual property protections and reducing the number of competitors are strategies that the largest firms understandably employ to increase their power but government support has also been essential to their success. Policy changes have reduced the enforcement of antitrust laws and increased the enforcement of alleged intellectual property infringements. In addition, synergies between stronger intellectual property protections and consolidation have further reinforced the dominance of top firms at the expense of a freely competitive industry. A better understanding of these trends is unlikely to reverse them in the near term but may increase the effectiveness of creating alternatives to a seed oligopoly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3afamily-owned businesses 3afarmers 3aissues and policy 3aoligopoly 3aprices 3aseed industry 3aseed markets 3aseeds0 tCrop science.g2015 Nov., v. 55, no. 6 p.2489-2495dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2014.09.06693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245005800170300001200228520151000240592002801750650001301778650001501791650000901806650001201815650001101827650001101838650001601849650002701865650001101892650001401903650001301917650001901930650001801949650002001967651001301987700003002000700002002030700002802050700002002078773011402098856008102212852000902293655001202302IND60574334720221116204841.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057433472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-017-6440-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArétouyap, Zakari10aAquifer porosity in the Pan-African semi-arid context  ap. 134.  aWater scarcity is one of the major concerns that people are facing worldwide. Although the liquid is absolutely abundant through the globe, its availability poses too much problems specifically to each region. Those problems can result in one or a combination of three basic situations: declining water (drought), overabundance of surface water (floods) or degradation of the quality of water (pollution). All these situations are reflected in the scarcity of good quality water. Arid regions are particularly concerned. In such areas where groundwater contained in aquifers is usually perceived as providence, any project of groundwater exploration and exploitation must be preceded by prior careful and meticulous investigation, in order to avoid early and premature drying. This investigation is likely to predict the future behaviour of aquifers and to improve the groundwater resources management. Beside fundamental properties as hydraulic conductivity, the present paper that addresses the water sector in the semi-arid region of northern Cameroon emphasizes the importance of porosity on aquifer productivity and consequently on the groundwater resources management. The porosity of the local aquifer has then been determined using the Waxman and Smits model which establishes a reliable relationship between the apparent and corrected formation factors, F ₐ and F c , taking the clay effects into consideration. This approach can be applied in other similar semi-arid regions through the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aarid zones 3aclay 3adrought 3adrying 3afloods 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodels 3apollution 3aporosity 3asemiarid zones 3asurface water 3awater shortages 3aCameroon1 aPhilippe, Njandjock Nouck1 aNouayou, Robert1 aAssatse, William Teikeu1 aAsfahani, Jamal0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2017 Feb., v. 76, no. 3 p.134-134dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6440-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03675naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245012700166300001400293520217300307592002802480650001002508650004302518650002302561650001802584650002502602650001202627650001302639650002602652650001702678650000802695650001602703650002002719650001302739650002602752650001302778650001102791650001102802650001002813653002302823653002302846653001902869653001302888653001402901700002202915700002202937773010802959856008103067852000903148655001203157IND60131159320221121060600.0151127e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013115932DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-12-00043.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSather, Bryan C.10aInfluence of Metsulfuron-Containing Herbicides and Application Timings on Tall Fescue Seedhead Production and Forage Yield  ap. 34-40.  aField trials were conducted in 2009 and 2010 to investigate the effects of metsulfuron-containing herbicides on tall fescue growth, seedhead production, yield, and forage nutritive value. Several rates of metsulfuron-containing products and picloram plus 2,4-D were applied to a weed-free tall fescue hay field in the early spring vegetative, late spring boot, and late summer dormancy stages of growth. Compared to the nontreated control, applying metsulfuron-containing herbicides to vegetative tall fescue reduced plant height by 13 to 40% whereas boot-stage applications of these same herbicides reduced height by 28 to 45%. Metsulfuron-containing herbicides reduced seedhead density from 14 to 61% when applied to vegetative tall fescue, and from 53 to 88% when applied at the boot stage. Metsulfuron plus 2,4-D plus dicamba (0.01 + 0.40 + 0.14 kg ai ha⁻¹) was the only metsulfuron-containing treatment applied at the vegetative application timing that did not reduce tall fescue seedheads or yield when compared to the nontreated control. Vegetative-stage applications of metsulfuron-containing herbicides reduced tall fescue yields by 33 to 63%, whereas boot-stage applications reduced yields by 15 to 35%. Picloram plus 2,4-D did not reduce tall fescue height, seedhead density, or yield when applied at either timing. Tall fescue crude protein (CP) concentration was greater in response to the vegetative compared to boot-stage herbicide applications, and vegetative-stage applications of metsulfuron-containing herbicides increased CP concentration of tall fescue by 1.5 to 3.4% compared to the nontreated control. Results from these experiments indicate that spring applications of metsulfuron-containing herbicides can be utilized to reduce tall fescue seedhead production and increase CP content of tall fescue pastures and hay fields, but summer applications of these same herbicide treatments will have only limited effects on yield, nutritive values, or seedhead density of tall fescue harvested in the fall or the spring following treatment.Nomenclature: 2,4-D, dicamba, metsulfuron, picloram; tall fescue, Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.)

The present study evaluates the automated performance of the Virion\Serion (Würzburg, Germany) and Orgentec (Mainz, Germany) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the determination of HSV type-common and type-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. Two hundred sixty-three sera from HSV-negative children, healthy blood donors as well as patients without and with acute HSV infections were included. The Serion ELISAs classic HSV 1+2, HSV 1 and HSV 2 IgG showed sensitivities between 89.1% and 98.0% and specificities from 82.8% to 100%. Sensitivities of the Orgentec ELISAs Anti-HSV-1 and Anti-HSV-2 IgG were calculated as 91.0–96.0% and 88.5–95.4% accompanied by specificities between 93.1% and 100%. The HSV type-common Serion IgM ELISA revealed also a high sensitivity and specificity. However, the single-type HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgM ELISAs from both companies did not detect reliably HSV-1- and HSV-2-specific IgM antibodies. In conclusion, the automated performance of Serion ELISAs classic HSV 1+2, HSV 1 and HSV 2 IgG as well Orgentec ELISAs Anti-HSV-1 and Anti-HSV-2 IgG provide highly dependable results for identifying HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG-positive or -negative individuals. While HSV type-common IgM ELISAs can be useful to confirm acute newly acquired HSV infections, the use of single-type IgM ELISAs on the basis of whole-virus antigen is dispensable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aautomation 3ablood donors 3achildren 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherpes simplex 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3apatients 3aviruses 0aLaboratory diagnostic reagents 0aHSV-1 0aHSV-2 0aGenital herpes 0aELISA 0aGlycoprotein G1 aSchäfler, Anna1 aHenke, Andreas1 aSauerbrei, Andreas0 tJournal of virological methods.g2014 Apr., v. 199 p.29-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008200164300001600246520074300262592002801005650001701033650002001050650001701070650001601087650002101103650001701124650001301141651001801154700002201172773011701194856007601311852000901387655001201396IND60690103820221122093134.0200425e20080801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069010382DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.3.8.57312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaoumkina, Marina10aSubcellular localization of flavonoid natural products: A signaling function?  ap. 573-575.  aIn a recent paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, we described genetic mechanisms for the mobilization of pre-formed vacuolar glycoconjugates of isoflavone intermediates for phytoalexin biosynthesis in response to the wound signal methyl jasmonate.

In total, 6.24 Gb data from ICC 4958, 5.65 Gb data from ICC 1882 and 59.03 Gb data from RILs were generated, which identified 828 novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for genetic mapping.

In addition, 49 SNPs integrated in the “QTL-hotspot” region were converted into cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) and derived CAPS (dCAPS) markers which can be used in marker-assisted breeding.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCicer arietinum 3achickpeas 3achromosome mapping 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3ainbred lines 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aThudi, Mahendar1 aKale, Sandip1 aAzam, Sarwar1 aRoorkiwal, Manish1 aGaur, Pooran M.1 aKishor, P.

Their lower sensitivity compared to enzyme immunoassay (EIA) suggests that newer HCV Antigen/Antibody (Ag/Ab) combination assays might have a role in such countries. To test this idea, 1998 blood donors were tested at the University Teaching Hospital blood bank in Yaoundé, Cameroon simultaneously with a RT (HCV rapid test, Human Diagnostics, Berlin, Germany) according to standard practice (S1) and with an Ag/Ab assay (Monolisa HCV Ag/Ab Ultra, Biorad, France) (S2). All discordant, borderline and reactive samples were submitted to confirmatory testing by immunoblot and/or HCV-RNA. Of the 86 (4.3%) samples positive with one or both strategies, 29 were confirmed negative, 37 positive and 20 were false positive or resolved infection. There was a significant difference in test sensitivity (p=0.01) between S1 (70.3%) and S2 (91.9%) but not in test specificity (99.4% and 98.6%, respectively). The benefit of the Ag/Ab assay in the detection of recent HCV seronegative infections could not be evaluated since no Antigen-only donations were identified. However, better Ag/Ab test sensitivity compared to RT supports the implementation of these newer immunoassays for HCV screening in the African blood bank setting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood banks 3ablood donors 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme immunoassays 3ahepatitis C 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3ascreening 3asilver 3aCameroon 3aFrance 3aGermany 0aHCV 0aRapid tests 0aAg/Ab combination assay 0aBlood donors 0aAfrica1 aMbanya, Dora1 aMurphy, Edward L.1 aLefrère, Jean-Jacques,1 aLaperche, Syria0 tJournal of virological methods.g2014 Apr., v. 199 p.119-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015600167300001000323520198600333592002802319650001202347650002002359650001802379650001202397650001502409650001502424650001202439650001302451650002202464650001702486650001002503650001302513650001002526700002402536773010802560856008202668852000902750655001202759IND60574334920221116205244.0180619e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057433492DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-016-0598-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVauhkonen, Jari10aReconstructing forest canopy from the 3D triangulations of airborne laser scanning point data for the visualization and planning of forested landscapes  ap. 9.  aKEY MESSAGE : We present a data-driven technique to visualize forest landscapes and simulate their future development according to alternative management scenarios. Gentle harvesting intensities were preferred for maintaining scenic values in a test of eliciting public’s preferences based on the simulated landscapes. CONTEXT: Visualizations of future forest landscapes according to alternative management scenarios are useful for eliciting stakeholders’ preferences on the alternatives. However, conventional computer visualizations require laborious tree-wise measurements or simulators to generate these observations. AIMS: We describe and evaluate an alternative approach, in which the visualization is based on reconstructing forest canopy from sparse density, leaf-off airborne laser scanning data. METHODS: Computational geometry was employed to generate filtrations, i.e., ordered sets of simplices belonging to the three-dimensional triangulations of the point data. An appropriate degree of filtering was determined by analyzing the topological persistence of the filtrations. The topology was further utilized to simulate changes to canopy biomass, resembling harvests with varying retention levels. Relative priorities of recreational and scenic values of the harvests were estimated based on pairwise comparisons and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). RESULTS: The canopy elements were co-located with the tree stems measured in the field, and the visualizations derived from the entire landscape showed reasonably realistic, despite a low numerical correspondence with plot-level forest attributes. The potential and limitations to improve the proposed parameterization are discussed. CONCLUSION: Although the criteria to evaluate the landscape visualization and simulation models were not conclusive, the results suggest that forest scenes may be feasibly reconstructed based on data already covering broad areas and readily available for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acomputer vision 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3aharvesting 3alandscapes 3alogging 3aplanning 3asimulation models 3astakeholders 3astems 3atopology 3atrees1 aRuotsalainen, Roope0 tAnnals of forest science.g2017 Mar., v. 74, no. 1 p.9-9dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-016-0598-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245009300177300001800270500000900288520157300297592002801870650001301898650001501911650000901926650001301935650001301948650002101961650001401982650001301996650001402009650001802023650001002041650002302051650002302074700002502097700002202122700002002144773013302164856008402297852000902381655001202390IND60665345120221118222612.0191122e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066534512DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2013.12.08512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelchinger, Albrecht E.10aIn Vivo Haploid Induction in Maize: Identification of Haploid Seeds by Their Oil Content  ap. 1497-1504.  aepub  aIn vivo haploid induction has become a routine tool for rapid line development in maize (Zea mays L.). However, distinguishing haploid (H) from diploid crossing (C) seeds is problematic for many germplasms due to poor expression or suppression of the currently-used R1-nj embryo marker. We examined a new approach for sorting H and C seeds on the basis of their oil content (OC). Ten source germplasms, including single crosses, synthetics, and landraces, were pollinated by high-oil (HO) inducer UH600 with OC = 10.8%. Identification of embryoless seeds based on seed OC < 2.1% was very reliable. The average difference (1.79%) between the mean OC of C and H seeds was more than twice the standard deviation (SD) within each fraction. Thus, sorting H and C seeds based on OC smaller or greater than an a priori chosen threshold t was generally more reliable than based on the R1-nj embryo marker. Another ten source germplasms were pollinated with normal-oil inducer UH400 with OC = 3.0%. Since the difference (0.65%) between OC of C and H seeds was approximately of the same magnitude as the SD, both fractions overlapped too much for reliable sorting. The discrimination of H and C seeds based on their OC looks very promising, even for heterogeneous source materials such as landraces, provided an HO inducer and a stringent threshold t are used. In combination with high-throughput platforms for automated sorting of single seeds for OC, this opens new avenues for extending the application and increasing the efficiency of the double haploid technology in maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aautomation 3acorn 3acrossing 3adiploidy 3adoubled haploids 3agermplasm 3ahaploidy 3alandraces 3alipid content 3aseeds 3astandard deviation 3asynthetic products1 aSchipprack, Wolfgang1 aFriedrich Utz, H.1 aMirdita, Vilson0 tCrop science.g2014 July, v. 54, no. 4 p.1497-1504dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2013.12.08513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003700145245011700182300001600299520100800315592002801323650000801351650001701359650001801376650002501394650001001419650001101429650002301440650001301463650002401476650001601500650001601516650001301532650001001545700002801555700003301583700002801616700002601644773012801670856008101798852000901879655001201888IND4469489320221123015801.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446948932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2011.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos-Sánchez, Norma Francenia10aEffect of rotating tray drying on antioxidant components, color and rehydration ratio of tomato saladette slices  ap. 298-304.  aA rotating tray drier was built and controlled for drying of tomato slices at different temperatures (45, 50 and 60 °C) and air velocities (0.6 and 1.2 m s⁻¹) with and without tray rotation. Drying curves were fitted using the Page mathematical model. Effective diffusivities for the different drying conditions correlated well with the chemical composition variables; lycopene, ascorbic acid and total polyphenols (TPP). The effect of drying conditions over quality of dried tomato slices was evaluated by quantifying their contents of lycopene, ascorbic acid and TPP, and measuring their color and rehydration ratio. The best drying conditions were 60 °C drying temperature and 0.6 m s⁻¹ air velocity with the use of tray rotation. These conditions minimized the degradation of lycopene (2.9%), ascorbic acid (17.3%) and TPP (2.1%) during drying. Tray rotation has a contribution on the a* color value, as well as on the lycopene and ascorbic acid concentrations (5% significance level).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3achemical composition 3acolor 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3alycopene 3amathematical models 3apolyphenols 3arehydration 3atomatoes 3atrays1 aValadez-Blanco, Rogelio1 aGómez-Gómez, Mayra Soledad1 aPérez Herrera, Aleyda,1 aSalas-Coronado, Raúl0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 Apr., v. 46, no. 1 p.298-304dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2011.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008800163300001600251520188000267592002802147650002102175650002102196650002202217650001502239650001102254650001402265650001802279650001502297650002602312650002302338650002002361650001402381650002802395650001102423653001002434653001302444653001302457653002002470653001902490653002802509700001802537700001902555700001902574773010602593856008202699852000902781655001202790IND60615154620221120182414.0181009e199305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061515462DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985893030003072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafner, S.10aAvian Keratoacanthoma (Dermal Squamous Cell Carcinoma) in Broiler Chicken Carcasses  ap. 265-270.  aMultiple lesions of dermal squamous cell carcinoma are found at a low frequency (0.04%) in the carcasses of young meat-type chickens at slaughter. For this study, affected carcasses (n = 308) were removed from the processing line, and lesions were characterized by size, distribution, and morphology. Carcasses were also sexed and examined for evidence of metastasis. Nodular (n = 297) and ulcerative (n = 1,707) lesions were counted and examined. Most lesions were present in the pectoral, dorsopelvic, and femoral feather tracts. Few lesions (n = 11) were found in wing tracts. Mean diameter was 5.4 mm for ulcerative lesions and 3.1 mm for nodular lesions. Histologic sections of ulcerative (n = 579) and nodular (n = 113) lesions were examined. Small nodular lesions originated from hyperplastic feather follicle epithelium. Nodules contained keratin-filled cysts lined by squamous epithelium that were associated with isolated islands and infiltrating cords of dermal keratinocytes. Loss of surface epithelium resulted in noduloulcerative and ulcerative lesions. Invasion of underlying skeletal muscle and evidence of visceral metastasis were not present, but invasion through elastic laminae and into the subcutis was present in 20.5% (134/654) of the lesions examined. The nodular lesions in these carcasses were morphologically similar to early nodular lesions previously described in live chickens as avian keratoacanthomas. A retrospective study compared selected production parameters and disease condemnations to the prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma in 665 flocks of broiler chickens. There was a positive correlation (P < 0.0001) with the occurrence of airsacculitis but a negative correlation with increased age and condemnations for leukosis (P < 0.0001). Tumor frequency followed a pronounced seasonal pattern, with decreased prevalence in summer months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3abroiler chickens 3achicken carcasses 3aepithelium 3aflocks 3ahistology 3akeratinocytes 3ametastasis 3aretrospective studies 3aseasonal variation 3askeletal muscle 3aslaughter 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3asummer 0aAvian 0abroilers 0achickens 0akeratoacanthoma 0askin neoplasms 0asquamous cell carcinoma1 aHarmon, B.

A better understanding of the ecology of many species is fundamental to identifying and addressing threatening processes and developing effective mitigation measures. The Swift Parrot (Lathamus discolor) is listed as endangered and is an obligate migrant that breeds only in Tasmania, wintering in mainland Australia. The species nests in tree-hollows and forages primarily on flowers of the Tasmanian Blue Gum (Eucalyptus globulus) and Black Gum (Eucalyptus ovata) during the breeding season. Surveys for Swift Parrot nests conducted over three consecutive breeding seasons identified 130 Swift Parrot nests in 117 trees. Sites were between 12 and 130 ha in area with up to 49 nests found at an individual site. Swift Parrot nest-trees were characterised as being large eucalypts (mean diameter at breast height = 105 cm) with five or more potential hollows (mean = 8.6) and showing clear signs of senescence. Reuse of nests was uncommon over the 3 years and the infrequency of reuse was most likely related to poor flowering of Tasmanian Blue Gums around nesting sites in years following recorded nesting. To protect the species, conservation actions need to account for the spatiotemporal variation in the availability of Swift Parrot breeding habitat and recognise there may be several years between the use of a particular site. Given the number of nests found at individual sites this will require the management or reservation of suitable forest stands with old-growth characteristics across the landscape, rather than focussing on individual trees or historical nesting sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aEucalyptus ovata 3aNyssa sylvatica 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aforaging 3aforest stands 3alandscapes 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3aold-growth forests 3aspatial variation 3asurveys 3atemporal variation 3atree and stand measurements 3atree cavities 3atrees 3aTasmania 0ahollow-nesting 0anectarivore 0anest-tree 0aparrot conservation1 aHoldsworth, Mark C.1 aWebb, Janneke0 tEmu.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 112, no. 3 p.181-188dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU110143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245010200173300001600275500002000291520166900311592002801980650001902008650001602027650001502043650001902058650002102077650002602098650003702124650001902161650001102180650001902191650001402210650003302224651002102257651001202278651002102290651002502311700002402336700002102360773013002381852000902511856007402520655001202594IND4437213420221119092314.0180321e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443721342DNAL7 a203498372pmid7 a10.1890/08-2257.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tongli10aIntegrating environmental and genetic effects to predict responses of tree populations to climate  ap. 153-163.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate is a major environmental factor affecting the phenotype of trees and is also a critical agent of natural selection that has molded among‐population genetic variation. Population response functions describe the environmental effect of planting site climates on the performance of a single population, whereas transfer functions describe among‐population genetic variation molded by natural selection for climate. Although these approaches are widely used to predict the responses of trees to climate change, both have limitations. We present a novel approach that integrates both genetic and environmental effects into a single “universal response function” (URF) to better predict the influence of climate on phenotypes. Using a large lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) field transplant experiment composed of 140 populations planted on 62 sites to demonstrate the methodology, we show that the URF makes full use of data from provenance trials to: (1) improve predictions of climate change impacts on phenotypes; (2) reduce the size and cost of future provenance trials without compromising predictive power; (3) more fully exploit existing, less comprehensive provenance tests; (4) quantify and compare environmental and genetic effects of climate on population performance; and (5) predict the performance of any population growing in any climate. Finally, we discuss how the last attribute allows the URF to be used as a mechanistic model to predict population and species ranges for the future and to guide assisted migration of seed for reforestation, restoration, or afforestation and genetic conservation in a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus contorta 3atree growth 3aprovenance 3aclimate change 3aplant adaptation 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aforest ecology 3aheight 2aClimate Change 2aEcosystem 2aTreesxgeneticsxphysiology. 3aBritish Columbia 0aAlberta 0aBritish Columbia 0aNorthwestern States.1 aO'Neill, Gregory A.1 aAitken, Sally N.0 tEcological applications.g2010 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.153-163dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-2257.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02717naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245004800166300001600214520148300230592002801713650001801741650002101759650002001780650001401800650001101814650002401825650001201849650001201861650001401873650001001887650001201897650001301909650001901922650000901941650001501950653002401965653001101989653001302000653000902013653000902022700001902031773010602050856008202156852000902238655001202247IND60615154720221120182312.0181009e199305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061515472DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985893030003092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshitomi, K.10aPalpebral Amelanotic Melanomas in F344 Rats  ap. 280-286.  aSpontaneous amelanotic melanomas in the eyelids of F344 rats were found in one of 1/926 (0.11 %) male and 5/925 (0.54%) female F344 rats that were used as control and treated animals in five different carcinogenicity studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program (Research Triangle Park, NC). These melanomas were grossly recognized as single, tan or white, well-circumscribed masses of the right or left eyelid. These melanomas primarily occurred in the dermis of the skin of the eyelids and consisted of poorly differentiated spindle cells characteristically arranged in interlacing fascicles. Rarely, epithelioid tumor cells were also observed, and these tumor cells showed a negative histochemical reaction for melanin. The epidermis and dermal–epidermal junction were usually uninvolved. The diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma could only be established by electron microscopic examination. The most striking ultrastructural feature of the tumor cells was a large number of intracytoplasmic premelanosomes (stage II melanosomes without melanin), which nearly filled the cytoplasm of most tumor cells. Giant premelanosomes and melanophagosomes were also seen. The tumor cells did not possess the ultrastructural features characteristic of Schwann cells (thin, long cell processes and pericytoplasmic basal laminae). The histologic and ultrastructural features of these palpebral tumors were similar to those of cutaneous amelanotic melanomas of the pinna in F344 rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchwann cells 3aanimal pathology 3acarcinogenicity 3acytoplasm 3adermis 3aelectron microscopy 3aeyelids 3afemales 3ahistology 3amales 3amelanin 3amelanoma 3aneoplasm cells 3arats 3atoxicology 0aAmelanotic melanoma 0aeyelid 0amelanoma 0arats 0askin1 aBoorman, G.

Koch) Thell. (hereafter, Hsp) to drought stress. Three separate experiments were conducted to assess these traits at germination, vegetative, and reproductive stages. Drought stress significantly reduced germination percentage and rate, primary root number, and shoot and root length of seedlings. Using pot experiment, drought stress reduced shoot dry weight (SDW) and root dry weight (RDW) at vegetative stage but the ratio of RDW/SDW (RSR) increased under this condition. At reproductive stage, SDW, plant height, number of fertile tiller, and relative water content decreased under drought stress, but root length, root volume, RDW, and RSR increased as the intensity of drought increased. For most of the traits the genotype × moisture environment interaction was significant. The effect of drought stress on genotypes was highly dependent to developmental stages and the intensity of water limitation. The wild barley genotypes had more drought tolerance than the cultivated ones. The results of vegetative and reproductive stages poorly matched with the ones from seed germination stage. Two wild barley genotypes from Iran were tolerant to drought stress at both vegetative and reproductive stages and may be used for genetic studies and possible breeding of barley for root-related traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aplant breeding 3aplant height 3aroots 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3avegetative growth 3awater content 3awater stress 3awild relatives 3aIran1 aMajidi, Mohammad Mahdi1 aMirlohi, Aghafakhr1 aPirnajmodini, Fateme1 aSharif-Moghaddam, Negar0 tCrop science.g2015 Nov., v. 55, no. 6 p.2668-2681dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2015.04.02293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007300168500001900241520159300260592002801853650001701881650001501898650002401913650002501937650002001962650001501982650002001997650002402017650001702041653001702058653003402075653002102109653001102130653001902141653001802160653002202178653002002200700002102220773012502241856008202366852000902448655001202457IND60700219920221119115729.0200907e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070021992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2020.1084632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBardon, Kevin M.14aThe impact of altered mechanobiology on aortic valve pathophysiology  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCalcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most prevalent valvulopathy worldwide. Until recently, CAVD was viewed as a passive, degenerative process and an inevitable consequence of aging. Recent improvements in disease modeling, imaging, and analysis have greatly enhanced our understanding of CAVD. The aortic valve and its constituent cells are subjected to extreme changes in mechanical forces, so it follows that any changes in the underlying mechanobiology of the valve and its cells would have dire effects on function. Further, the mechanobiology of the aortic valve is intimately intertwined with numerous molecular pathways, with signal transduction between these aspects afforded by the dynamic plasma membrane. Changes to the plasma membrane itself, its regulation of the extracellular matrix, or the relay of signals into or out of the cell would negatively impact cell and tissue function.This review seeks to detail past and current published reports related to the mechanobiology of the aortic valve with a special emphasis on the implications of altered mechanobiology in the context of calcific aortic valve disease.Investigations characterizing membrane composition and dynamics have provided new insights into the earliest stages of calcific aortic valve disease. Recent studies have suggested that the activation or suppression of key pathways contribute to disease progression but may also offer therapeutic targets.This review highlights the critical involvement of mechanobiology and membrane dynamics in normal aortic valve physiology as well as valve pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3abiophysics 3adisease progression 3aextracellular matrix 3apathophysiology 3aphysiology 3aplasma membrane 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 0aAortic valve 0aCalcific aortic valve disease 0aOxidative stress 0aLipids 0aMechanobiology 0aCalcification 0aMembrane dynamics 0aAtherosclerosis1 aGarelnabi, Mahdi0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2020 Sept. 30, v. 691 p.108463-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.1084633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245012000181300001600301520143400317592002801751650001501779650001801794650001501812650005301827650002001880650004101900650001601941650000901957650001301966650001301979650001501992650001702007653003602024653003002060653002502090653002202115653002802137653001302165653001802178700002102196700001502217700001902232700002302251700002202274700002202296700001202318700002202330700005902352700002902411700002302440700005702463773013102520856008502651852000902736655001202745IND60683207620221121054346.0200207e20191230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068320762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b005832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiacomantonio, Michael A.10aQuantitative Proteome Responses to Oncolytic Reovirus in GM-CSF- and M-CSF-Differentiated Bone Marrow-Derived Cells  ap. 708-718.  aThe efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs), such as reovirus, is dictated by host immune responses, including those mediated by the pro- versus anti-inflammatory macrophages. As such, a detailed understanding of the interaction between reovirus and different macrophage types is critical for therapeutic efficacy. To explore reovirus–macrophage interactions, we performed tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative temporal proteomics on mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) generated with two cytokines, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocytic–macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), representing anti- and proinflammatory macrophages, respectively. We quantified 6863 proteins across five time points in duplicate, comparing M-CSF (M-BMM) and GM-CSF (GM-BMM) in response to OV. We find that GM-BMMs have lower expression of key intrinsic proteins that facilitate an antiviral immune response, express higher levels of reovirus receptor protein JAM-A, and are more susceptible to oncolytic reovirus infection compared to M-BMMs. Interestingly, although M-BMMs are less susceptible to reovirus infection and subsequent cell death, they initiate an antireovirus adaptive T cell immune response comparable to that of GM-BMMs. Taken together, these data describe distinct proteome differences between these two macrophage populations in terms of their ability to mount antiviral immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReoviridae 3aT-lymphocytes 3acell death 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3aimmune response 3amacrophage colony-stimulating factor 3amacrophages 3amice 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atherapeutics 0aantigen presentation/processing 0aantiviral immune response 0acell differentiation 0aoncolytic viruses 0aquantitative proteomics 0areovirus 0aviral defense1 aSterea, Andra M.1 aKim, Youra1 aPaulo, Joao A.1 aClements, Derek R.1 aKennedy, Barry E.1 aBydoun, Moamen J.1 aShi, Ge1 aWaisman, David M.1 aGygi, Steven P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7626-00341 aGiacomantonio, Carman A.1 aMurphy, J.

These chemicals include calcium (Ca²⁺), cyclic nucleotides, polyphosphoinositides, nitric oxide (NO), sugars, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonates (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and polyamines. Ca²⁺ is one of the very important ubiquitous second messengers in signal transduction pathways and usually its concentration increases in response to the stimuli including stress signals. Many Ca²⁺ sensors detect the Ca²⁺ signals and direct them to downstream signaling pathways by binding and activating diverse targets. cAMP or cGMP protects the cell with ion toxicity. Phosphoinositides are known to be involved both in transmission of signal across the plasma membrane and in intracellular signaling. NO activates various defense genes and acts as a developmental regulator in plants. Sugars affect the expression of many genes involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis, nitrogen metabolism, sucrose and starch metabolism, defense mechanisms and cell cycle regulation. ABA, JA, SA and polyamines are also involved in many stress responses. Cross-talk between these chemical signaling pathways is very common in plant responses to abiotic and bitotic factors. In this article we have described the role of these chemicals in initiating signaling under stress conditions mainly the abiotic stress.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3acell cycle 3achemical reactions 3acyclic AMP 3acyclic GMP 3adefense mechanisms 3agene expression 3aglycolysis 3agrowth and development 3ajasmonic acid 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen metabolism 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3aplant stress 3aplasma membrane 3apolyamines 3asalicylic acid 3astarch 3astress response 3asucrose 3atoxicity 3atransporters1 aSopory, Sudhir K.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2008 Aug. 1, v. 3, no. 8 p.525-536dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.3.8.61863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245013400163300001800297500002000315520241400335592002802749650001102777650002302788650001402811650001002825650001502835650001802850650001502868650001302883650001302896650001302909650002202922650002402944650000902968650002302977650002303000650002103023651001003044700001903054700002003073700002503093773011003118856007903228852000903307655001203316IND60571299220221118005236.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057129922DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.126842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrisco, Irene10aTemporal changes in the vegetation of Italian coastal dunes: identifying winners and losers through the lens of functional traits  ap. 1533-1542.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant communities of coastal dunes are highly biodiverse and greatly valued for the services they provide, yet they are also threatened by global change and are often neglected in conservation planning. To determine the long‐term effectiveness of conservation actions on Mediterranean coastal dunes, here we focus on Italy's coastline and (i) assess how the vegetation cover of the major psammophilous habitats and species has changed since the 1960s, (ii) identify which ecological strategies have been most successful in the face of global change and (iii) evaluate the efficacy of the protected areas network for safeguarding plant communities of coastal dunes. We compiled 2583 geo‐located vegetation relevés spanning over half a century and covering the entire length of Italy's sandy coastline. Using this data base, we developed statistical models to test whether the vegetation cover of both individual species and habitats has changed over time. We then tested whether species‐level changes in vegetation cover through time could be explained by species’ functional traits and ecological strategy. Finally, we assessed the efficacy of current conservation measures by exploring how vegetation cover responded following the expansion of the protected areas network. Our results indicate that, where protected, plant communities have generally increased in vegetation cover in recent years. The strongest increase in cover occurred in the wooded dune habitats, where late‐successional, tall‐growing and large‐seeded species show the clearest signs of recovery. However, this has come in part at the expense of dune grasslands, which thrive under natural disturbance and have declined since the 1960s. The Natura 2000 network seems to have played a central role in this recovery process, as the cumulative coastal land area under protection has tripled since the network was first established. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that protected areas can play an important role in safeguarding coastal dune plant communities against land‐use transformations. In this context, functional traits can be a powerful tool in guiding conservation planning, helping to identify groups of species most at risk of population declines. Nonetheless, future conservation interventions need to be mindful to ensure that the natural disturbance regime of dune ecosystems is not disrupted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3adatabases 3adunes 3aecosystems 3aglobal change 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aland use 3aplanning 3aplant communities 3apopulation dynamics 3arisk 3astatistical models 3atemporal variation 3avegetation cover 3aItaly1 aCarboni, Marta1 aJucker, Tommaso1 aAcosta, Alicia T.

Its pathogenesis is still unknown. The most widespread hypothesis claims that ectopic endometrium appears as a result of retrograde menstruation and its insufficient elimination by immunocytes. Some reports have shown expression of non-classical HLA-G molecules on ectopic endometrium. HLA-G is recognized by KIR2DL4, LILRB1 and LILRB2 receptors on natural killer (NK) and other cells. These receptors are polymorphic, which may affect their activity. In this study we investigated whether HLA-G, KIR2DL4, LILRB1 and LILRB2 polymorphisms may influence susceptibility to endometriosis and disease progression. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and allelic discrimination methods with TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays for typing of 276 patients with endometriosis and 314 healthy fertile women. The HLA-G rs1632947:GG genotype was associated with protection against the disease and its severe stages; HLA-G rs1233334:CT protected against progression; LILRB1 rs41308748:AA and LILRB2 rs383369:AG predisposed to the disease and its progression. No effect of KIR2DL4 polymorphism was observed. These results support the role of polymorphisms of HLA-G and its receptors LILRB1 and LILRB2 in susceptibility to endometriosis and its progression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisease course 3aendometrium 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aimmunocytes 3amenstruation 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3awomen1 aWilczyńska, Karolina1 aMalejczyk, Jacek1 aMilewski, Łukasz1 aWagner, Marta1 aJasek, Monika1 aNiepiekło-Miniewska, Wanda1 aWiśniewski, Andrzej,1 aPłoski, Rafał1 aBarcz, Ewa1 aRoszkowski, Piotr1 aKamiński, Paweł,1 aMalinowski, Andrzej1 aWilczyński, JacekR.1 aRadwan, Paweł1 aRadwan, Michał1 aKuśnierczyk, Piotr1 aNowak, Izabela0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2018 June, v. 293, no. 3 p.601-613dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl69781x1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-017-1404-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245007400174300001600248500002000264520171900284592002802003650002402031650001602055650001802071650002302089650001002112650001902122650002302141650003002164650001702194650003202211650004002243650001202283650002502295650003102320650003802351650003302389700001502422700002402437700002402461700002502485773013002510852000902640856007402649655001202723IND4437214020221119091837.0180321e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443721402DNAL7 a203498442pmid7 a10.1890/08-1869.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenry, Lee M.10aHost‐adapted parasitoids in biological control: Does source matter?  ap. 242-250.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIt has been hypothesized that the success of a biological control introduction is, in part, dependent on the ability of the control agent to become established in its new environment or to its new population of hosts through local adaptation. Despite this, few studies have investigated the influence of the recent coevolutionary history of pest species and natural enemies on the efficacy of biological control agents, especially for agents that are mass‐reared for release in agriculture. We investigate the evolutionary potential of a biological control agent Aphidius ervi to adapt to a key pest species, the foxglove aphid Aulacorthum solani, through components essential to the evolution of parasitoid virulence. We explored (1) the influence of genetic variation from natural source populations on the ability to parasitize natal and non‐natal host species; (2) the heritability of key traits related to parasitoid fitness; and (3) the efficacy of parasitoid host‐selection lines in a greenhouse system. Source populations maintained genetic variation in the ability to utilize natal and non‐natal host species; however, only some of the traits sampled suggested local adaptation of parasitoid populations. The ability to parasitize a host was found to be genetically determined and strongly heritable, irrespective of host species. The greenhouse study demonstrated the potential of parasitoid selection lines to substantially increase performance of parasitoids for target pest species. This research provides insight into novel techniques that can be used to increase the quality of biological control agents through the development of lines of natural enemies adapted to particular pest species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aparasitoids 3aAphidius ervi 3aAulacorthum solani 3ahosts 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aheritability 3ahost-parasite relationships 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxparasitology 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aWaspsxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aMay, Nigel1 aAcheampong, Susanna1 aGillespie, David R.1 aRoitberg, Bernard D.0 tEcological applications.g2010 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.242-250dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1869.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02183naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001600290520078700306536015201093592002801245596009901273650002601372650002601398650001701424650001601441650001101457650001101468653001601479653002601495653002601521653001601547700002001563773013101583856008601714852000901800655001201809IND60648904120221119104602.0201217e20190704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064890412DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2019.16144002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNeil, Paige10aCustomer satisfaction in gourmet food trucks: Exploring attributes and their relationship with customer satisfaction  ap. 326-350.  aGourmet food trucks (GFTs) have emerged as a new and unique restaurant segment with attributes of service similar to quick service restaurants and attributes of food quality similar to fine dining restaurants.

Leaf gas-exchange parameters (photosynthesis, transpiration rates, water-use efficiency, stomatal conductance, and dark respiration rates) were measured monthly on more than 1000 two-year-old seedlings grown in greenhouses for 1 year. In addition, stomatal density and light curve responses were determined at the end of the experiment. Under elevated CO₂ concentrations (800 ppm), the net photosynthetic rates were enhanced by more than 37% for A. marina and 45% for R. stylosa. This effect was more pronounced during the warm season, suggesting that an increase in global temperatures would further enhance the photosynthetic response of the considered species. Transpiration rates decreased by more than 15 and 8% for A. marina and R. stylosa, respectively. Consequently, water-use efficiency increased by 76% and 98% for A. marina and R. stylosa, respectively, for both species, which will improve drought resistance. These responses to elevated CO₂ were minimized (by 5%) with longer flooding duration. Consequently, future increases of atmospheric CO₂ may have a strong and positive effect on juveniles of A. marina and R. stylosa during the next century, which may not be suppressed by the augmentation of tidal flooding duration induced by sea-level rise. It is possible that this effect will enhance seedling dynamic by increasing photosynthesis, and therefore will facilitate their settlements in new area, extending the role of mangrove ecosystems in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3acarbon dioxide 3astomatal conductance 3asea level 3ajuveniles 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3agas exchange 3adrought tolerance 3aseedlings 3awater use efficiency 3awarm season 3aRhizophora stylosa 3acell respiration 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aAvicennia marina 3aecosystems 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3agreenhouses 0amangroves1 aMarchand, Cyril1 aGensous, Simon1 aAllenbach, Michel0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2018 Nov., v. 138, no. 2 p.249-260dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-018-0570-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245027900169300001400448500001500462520219100477592002802668650001502696650001002711650001102721650001102732650001202743650001402755650001402769650001702783650001802800650001002818650001602828650002102844650001302865650001502878650001102893650001302904650001202917650001402929650001202943650001002955651001402965651001002979653002602989653003003015653001103045653002603056653001103082653001503093700002003108700002703128700003003155700002403185773009803209856008403307852000903391655001203400IND60122561920221121012259.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012256192DNAL7 a10.1080/03071375.2014.9292912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Anwar N.10aBiological management of the invasive Vachellia nilotica ssp. indica (Benth.)

Its dense populations induce undesirable changes in the vast areas of northern Australia. Because chemical and mechanical management options appear unviable for various reasons, biological management of this tree is considered a better option. Among the many trialled arthropods in Australian context, Anomalococcus indicus , a lecanodiaspid native to India, has been identified as a potent-candidate, since in India, its native terrain, it is the most widespread and occurs throughout the year. Severe infestations of A. indicus cause defoliation, wilting and death of branches, and occasionally the tree. Populations of A. indicus have been brought into Australia and are being tested for its host specificity under quarantine conditions. This article reports the physiological damage and stress it inflicts in the shoots of V. n. indica . Younger-nymphal instars of A. indicus feed on cortical-parenchyma cells of young stems, whereas the older instars and adults feed from the phloem of old stems. Two conspicuous responses of V. n. indica arising in response to the feeding action of A. indicus are changes in the cell-wall dynamics and irregular cell divisions. The feeding action of A. indicus elicits a sequence of reactions in the stem tissues of V. n. indica such as differentiation of thick-walled elements in the outer cortical parenchyma, differential thickening of cells with supernumerary layers of either suberin or lignin, proliferations of parenchyma and phloem, wall thickening and obliteration of inner lumen of phloem cells, and the sieve plates plugged with callosic deposits. The responses are the culminations of interaction between the virulence factor (one or more of the salivary proteins?) from A. indicus and the resistance factor in V. n. indica . We have analysed structural changes in the context of their functions, by comparing the feeding action of A. indicus with that of other hemipteroids. From the level of stress it induces, this study confirms that A. indicus has the potential to be an effective biological management of V. n. indica in Australia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthropods 3atrees 3aadults 3ashoots 3asuberin 3aVachellia 3avirulence 3asieve plates 3aarboriculture 3aweeds 3adefoliation 3ahost specificity 3abranches 3aquarantine 3alignin 3aproteins 3awilting 3aHemiptera 3ainstars 3adeath 3aAustralia 3aIndia 0aAnomalococcus indicus 0aVachellia nilotica indica 0astress 0asap-sucking behaviour 0aphloem 0aparenchyma1 aSharma, Anamika1 aRaman, Anantanarayanan1 aDhileepan, Kunjithapatham1 aHodgkins, Dennis S.0 tArboricultural journal.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 36, no. 2 p.63-75dTaylor & Francisx2168-10747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03071375.2014.9292913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04066naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245009000171500001400261520227800275592002802553650001202581650000902593650001202602650001902614650001602633650001302649650002002662650001802682650001602700650001502716650001802731650001702749650001602766650001202782650002902794650001902823650003302842650005002875650001002925650001802935650001602953650001902969650001002988650000902998650002303007651001303030651001103043651001303054700003003067700001803097700002103115700003603136700002203172700003403194773012903228856007403357852000903431655001203440IND60719048320221119045637.0201126e20201121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071904832DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122238272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimabukuro, Yosio Edemir,10aMapping Burned Areas of Mato Grosso State Brazilian Amazon Using Multisensor Datasets  aNAL-light  aQuantifying forest fires remain a challenging task for the implementation of public policies aimed to mitigate climate change. In this paper, we propose a new method to provide an annual burned area map of Mato Grosso State located in the Brazilian Amazon region, taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution sensors. The method consists of generating the vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images by applying the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) to the Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), PROBA-V (Project for On-Board Autonomy–Vegetation), and Suomi NPP-VIIRS (National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) datasets. The shade fraction images highlight the burned areas, in which values are represented by low reflectance of ground targets, and the mapping was performed using an unsupervised classifier. Burned areas were evaluated in terms of land use and land cover classes over the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes in the Mato Grosso State. Our results showed that most of the burned areas occurred in non-forested areas (66.57%) and old deforestation (21.54%). However, burned areas over forestlands (11.03%), causing forest degradation, reached more than double compared with burned areas identified in consolidated croplands (5.32%). The results obtained were validated using the Sentinel-2 data and compared with active fire data and existing global burned areas products, such as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer product) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1, and Fire CCI (ESA Climate Change Initiative) products. Although there is a good visual agreement among the analyzed products, the areas estimated were quite different. Our results presented correlation of 51% with Sentinel-2 and agreement of r² = 0.31, r² = 0.29, and r² = 0.43 with MCD64A1, MCD45A1, and Fire CCI products, respectively. However, considering the active fire data, it was achieved the better performance between active fire presence and burn mapping (92%). The proposed method provided a general perspective about the patterns of fire in various biomes of Mato Grosso State, Brazil, that are important for the environmental studies, specially related to fire severity, regeneration, and greenhouse gas emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aarea 3acerrado 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3acropland 3adata collection 3adeforestation 3adegradation 3aecosystems 3afire severity 3aforest fires 3aforest land 3aforests 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aimage analysis 3aland use and land cover maps 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3apaper 3apublic policy 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3ashade 3asoil 3astatistical models 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 3aPantanal1 aDutra, Andeise  Cerqueira1 aArai, Egidio 1 aDuarte, Valdete 1 aCassol, Henrique  Luís Godinho1 aPereira, Gabriel 1 aCardozo, Francielle  da Silva0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Nov. 21, v. 12, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122238273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011500169300001800284500001900302520139700321536018301718592002801901596007901929650001502008650002602023650001202049650003302061650001302094650003102107653003202138653001702170653002402187653001902211653003202230700002002262700001502282773014602297856008502443852000902528655001202537IND60720851820221119043821.0201220e20201211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072085182DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2019.16725552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dachuan14aThe Five Trolls Under the Bridge: Principal Component Analysis With Asynchronous and Noisy High Frequency Data  ap. 1960-1977.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe develop a principal component analysis (PCA) for high frequency data. As in Northern fairy tales, there are trolls waiting for the explorer. The first three trolls are market microstructure noise, asynchronous sampling times, and edge effects in estimators. To get around these, a robust estimator of the spot covariance matrix is developed based on the smoothed two-scale realized variance (S-TSRV). The fourth troll is how to pass from estimated time-varying covariance matrix to PCA. Under finite dimensionality, we develop this methodology through the estimation of realized spectral functions. Rates of convergence and central limit theory, as well as an estimator of standard error, are established. The fifth troll is high dimension on top of high frequency, where we also develop PCA. With the help of a new identity concerning the spot principal orthogonal complement, the high-dimensional rates of convergence have been studied after eliminating several strong assumptions in classical PCA. As an application, we show that our first principal component (PC) closely matches but potentially outperforms the S&P 100 market index. From a statistical standpoint, the close match between the first PC and the market index also corroborates this PCA procedure and the underlying S-TSRV matrix, in the sense of Karl Popper.

A low oxygen atmosphere itself causes the death of wood boring insects after a relatively long period of application. Thus, attempts were made to use p-dichlorobenzene to accelerate the effects of a low oxygen atmosphere in the control of wood boring insects. The experiments were performed as a continuation of preliminary research on the effect of p-dichlorobenzene on Anobiidae in an aerobic atmosphere. The paper present the results of gassing Anobium punctatum and Ptilinus pectinicornis (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) larvae with 1,4-dichlorobenzene in a low oxygen atmosphere of nitrogen and argon. The experiments were performed in laboratory conditions at a temperature of 20°C on larvae extracted from wood. The results do not show a faster elimination of larvae of either species using p-dichlorobenzene in a low oxygen atmosphere as compared to using p-dichlorobenzene in an aerobic atmosphere. Complete eradication of larvae in the test groups was obtained after 48 hours when using p-dichlorobenzene in nitrogen. The results obtained when using p-dichlorobenzene in argon appear to be worse at fumigation times shorter than 48 hours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnobium punctatum 3aargon (noble gases) 3aboring insects 3adeath 3afumigation 3alarvae 3amortality 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3awood 0afumigation of wood 0ap-dichlorobenzene 0aanoxia 0awood boring insects 0aAnobiidae1 aKrajewski, Adam0 tPolskie pismo entomologiczne.g2018 June 01, v. 87, no. 2 p.141-151dSciendowJournal:jnl24265x2299-98847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/pjen-2018-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245007500180300001600255520140300271592002801674650002301702650002001725650002001745650001101765650001901776650001601795653002201811653002601833653002601859653002601885653002001911700001801931700001901949773013101968856008602099852000902185655001202194IND60648904320221119104641.0201217e20190704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064890432DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2019.16262082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrasekhar, Natarajan10aFood Delivery Services and Customer Preference: A Comparative Analysis  ap. 375-386.  aThis paper has revealed that the consumer perception plays a crucial role in understanding the decision-making process of the consumers. The purpose of the study was to determine the impact of online food delivery services like Swiggy, Foodpanda, Zomato, etc., on consumers. The research was entirely on primary data. A structured questionnaire was prepared, which had four parts, in other words, preference, reliability, consistency, and preference decision. The sample size was 169. The response rate was 84.5%. The data analysis technique used was grey analysis technique, which was used to interpret the result of the data collected. The result showed that the consumers mostly prefer uniqueness in terms of price, quality, and delivery. None of the online food delivery services like Zomato, Swiggy or Foodpanda was given the highest rank. This study has given an overall view about what the consumers think, what are the uncertainties that they are facing, whether the service is reliable or not. It has given complete information about the problems that the consumers are facing and how it can be improved. From a managerial perspective, the paper contributes to understanding the consumers in a broader way. Based on the study of consumer perception, it has helped in examining various factors like preference, reliability, liking, etc. related to consumers adding novelty to this research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer attitudes 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3auncertainty 0aConsumer behavior 0acustomer satisfaction 0acompetitive advantage 0aneeds and preferences 0abrand awareness1 aGupta, Saloni1 aNanda, Namrata0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2019 July 4, v. 22, no. 4 p.375-386dRoutledgewJournal:J000000105x1537-80397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2019.16262083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011200184300001800296500001500314520154100329592002801870650001401898650001601912650000801928650001301936650001301949650003001962650003001992650001302022650001202035650001902047650001502066650001302081650001102094650001402105650001702119650001802136650001802154650004202172650004902214650003602263650003202299650006002331650002602391653003002417700001702447700002402464773011602488856004802604852000902652655001202661IND50068222920221118010031.0130731e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006822292DNAL7 a237127922pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0286-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Nitish12aL-Glutamine and L-Glutamic Acid Facilitate Successful Agrobacterium Infection of Recalcitrant Tea Cultivars  ap. 1649-1664.  a2019-12-06  aThe first step in Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection of plants is the establishment of cell–cell contact between the two partners. However, failure to establish such contact makes many plants and explants recalcitrant to A. tumefaciens infection. Tea is one such example where even the popular inducer, acetosyringone failed to facilitate A. tumefaciens infection due to the presence of high amounts of bactericidal/bacteriostatic polyphenols. Quinones are formed as a result of polyphenols oxidation. They cause tissue browning and necrosis during the process of transformation, and in turn prevent A. tumefaciens infection. Compounds such as polyphenol adsorbents, i.e., polyvinylpyrrolidone and charcoal, and antioxidants like cysteine and ascorbic acid were screened to overcome tissue browning. Although these compounds enhanced the growth of A. tumefaciens, these failed to facilitate the infection of the leaves of either Kangra Jat, Tocklai Variety-1, UPASI-9, UPASI-10, and Stock-449 cultivars of tea. On the contrary, the presence of filter sterilized L-glutamine and L-glutamic acid in the co-cultivation medium facilitated successful A. tumefaciens infection of recalcitrant tea leaves. L-Glutamine and glutamic acid form harmless adducts by binding to quinones. Therefore, their presence in the co-cultivation medium allowed the tea leaves to remain living and appealing to the infecting A. tumefaciens. Successful A. tumefaciens infection of tea leaves was confirmed by positive signals in GUS assay, PCR, and Dot blot.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3apolyphenols 3atea 3aquinones 3anecrosis 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acysteine 3afilters 3aacetosyringone 3aadsorbents 3acharcoal 3aleaves 3aoxidation 3aantioxidants 3aglutamic acid 3aascorbic acid 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxphysiology 2aCamellia sinensisxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aGlutamic Acidxpharmacokinetics 2aGlutaminexpharmacokinetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aTransfectionxmethods 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aGulati, Ashu1 aBhattacharya, Amita0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2013 Aug., v. 170, no. 7 p.1649-1664dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0286-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007600161500001400237520194600251592002802197650001802225650001302243650001102256650002002267650001402287650001402301650001802315650002102333650001202354650001102366650001802377650001902395650001502414650001902429650001002448650002002458650002002478650001002498650002902508700002102537700002202558700002502580700002002605773012902625856007402754852000902828655001202837IND60719048520221119045501.0201126e20201121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071904852DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122238292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlavík, Martin 10aUAV Laser Scans Allow Detection of Morphological Changes in Tree Canopy  aNAL-light  aHigh-resolution laser scans from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provide a highly detailed description of tree structure at the level of fine branches. Apart from ultrahigh spatial resolution, unmanned aerial laser scanning (ULS) can also provide high temporal resolution due to its operability and flexibility during data acquisition. We examined the phenomenon of bending branches of dead trees during one year from ULS multi-temporal data. In a multi-temporal series of three ULS datasets, we detected a synchronized reversible change in the inclination angles of the branches of 43 dead trees in a stand of blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.). The observed phenomenon has important consequences for both tree physiology and forest remote sensing (RS). First, the inclination angle of branches plays a crucial role in solar radiation interception and thus influences the total photosynthetic gain. The ability of a tree to change the branch position has important ecophysiological consequences, including better competitiveness across the site. Branch shifting in dead trees could be regarded as evidence of functional mycorrhizal interconnections via roots between live and dead trees. Second, we show that the detected movement results in a significant change in several point cloud metrics often utilized for deriving forest inventory parameters, both in the area-based approach (ABA) and individual tree detection approaches, which can affect the prediction of forest variables. To help quantify its impact, we used point cloud metrics of automatically segmented individual trees to build a generalized linear model to classify trees with and without the observed morphological changes. The model was applied to a validation set and correctly identified 86% of trees that displayed branch movement, as recorded by a human observer. The ULS allows for the study of this phenomenon across large areas, not only at individual tree levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea pungens 3abranches 3acanopy 3adata collection 3adead wood 3adetection 3aecophysiology 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3ahumans 3alinear models 3aphotosynthesis 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3aroots 3asolar radiation 3atree physiology 3atrees 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aKuželka, Karel 1 aModlinger, Roman 1 aTomášková, Ivana,1 aSurový, Peter 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Nov. 21, v. 12, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122238293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015900165300001800324520127500342592002801617650002801645650002901673650001801702650004101720650001501761650001501776650002801791650001001819650001601829650002301845650001401868650001301882650001801895650001001913650001501923650001001938700001901948700002101967773012901988856008102117852000902198655001202207IND60548412120221117174605.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054841212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7509-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sae-Byuk10aEffects of protectant and rehydration conditions on the survival rate and malolactic fermentation efficiency of freeze-dried Lactobacillus plantarum JH287  ap. 7853-7863.  aIn this study, Lactobacillus plantarum JH287 was used as a malolactic fermentation starter in Campbell Early wine production. L. plantarum JH287 was first lyophilized, and the malolactic fermentation potential of freeze-dried L. plantarum JH287 was investigated. Different protective media and rehydration conditions were tested to improve the survival rate of freeze-dried L. plantarum JH287. Optimal protective medium contained 10 % sorbitol and 10 % skim milk. The optimal rehydration condition was a 1-h rehydration time conducted in the same protective media, and the combination of these two methods produced a survival rate of 86.37 %. In addition, a 77.71 % survival rate was achieved using freeze-dried samples that were stored at 4 °C for 2 months. Freeze-dried L. plantarum JH287 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fermivin were used to inoculate the Campbell Early grape must to decrease its malic acid content. Using this mixed-fermentation method, wine showed a decrease in malic acid content after 9 days of fermentation. GC-MS analysis detected 15 volatile ester compounds in the wine. A sensory evaluation showed that the taste and aroma of mix-fermented wine were better than those of the control that had not been inoculated with L. plantarum JH287.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afreeze drying 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrape must 3amalic acid 3amalolactic fermentation 3aodors 3arehydration 3asensory evaluation 3askim milk 3asorbitol 3asurvival rate 3ataste 3awinemaking 3awines1 aKim, Dong-Hwan1 aPark, Heui-dong,0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Sept., v. 100, no. 18 p.7853-7863dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7509-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011600171300001800287520179700305592002802102650001402130650003102144650002402175650001302199650001102212650001502223650002202238650001602260650001302276650001502289650001802304650002002322650001302342650001502355650001102370653003002381653002802411653002202439653002502461700002102486700001602507700002302523700006002546773013302606856008502739852000902824655001202833IND60612713020221118085628.0180907e20180731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061271302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b002052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanshin, Evgeny10aCombined Enrichment/Enzymatic Approach To Study Tightly Clustered Multisite Phosphorylation on Ser-Rich Domains  ap. 3050-3060.  aThe regulation of protein function through phosphorylation is often dominated by allosteric interactions and conformational changes. However, alternative mechanisms involving electrostatic interactions also regulate protein function. In particular, phosphorylation of clusters of Ser/Thr residues can affect protein-plasma membrane/chromatin interactions by electrostatic interactions between phosphosites and phospholipids or histones. Currently, only a few examples of such mechanisms are reported, primarily because of the difficulties of detecting highly phosphorylated proteins and peptides, due in part to the low ionization efficiency and fragmentation yield of multiphosphorylated peptides in mass spectrometry when using positive ion mode detection. This difficulty in detection has resulted in under-reporting of such modified regions, which can be thought of as phosphoproteomic dark matter. Here, we present a novel approach that enriches for multisite-phosphorylated peptides that until now remained inaccessible by conventional phosphoproteomics. Our technique enables the identification of multisite-phosphorylated regions on more than 300 proteins in both yeast and human cells and can be used to profile changes in multisite phosphorylation upon cell stimulation. We further characterize the role of multisite phosphorylation for Ste20 in the yeast mating pheromone response. Mutagenesis experiments confirmed that multisite phosphorylation of Ser/Thr-rich regions plays an important role in the regulation of Ste20 activity during mating pheromone signaling. The ability to detect protein multisite phosphorylation opens new avenues to explore phosphoproteomic dark matter and to study Ser-rich proteins that interact with binding partners through charge pairing mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenzymatic treatment 3ahistones 3ahumans 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amutagenesis 3apeptides 3apheromones 3aphospholipids 3aphosphorylation 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3ayeasts 0amultisite phosphorylation 0aquantitative proteomics 0aphosphoproteomics 0aalkaline phosphatase1 aPascariu, Mirela1 aTyers, Mike1 aD’Amours, Damien1 aThibault, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5993-03310 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 July 31, v. 17, no. 9 p.3050-3060dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b002053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014000206300001100346520181700357592002802174596004502202650001502247650001402262650001802276650001402294650001302308650001602321700001702337773011602354856008302470852000902553655001202562IND60741979320221117073055.0210711e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074197932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-021-03902-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalogh, Regina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2357-075410aDeveloping in the intertidal: effects of salinity and temperature on development to the pentameral juvenile seastar, Parvulastra exigua  ap. 99.  aFor intertidal marine species, salinity and temperature are important environmental factors with conditions ranging from oceanic salinity and temperature at high tide to almost freshwater conditions due to rain accompanied by aerial temperature exposure at low tide. The interactive effects of these stressors across development to the juvenile is not known. We investigated the impacts of salinity (29–41 ppt) and temperature (20°–24 ℃) on holobenthic intertidal development to the five-armed juvenile asterinid seastar Parvulastra exigua. There was an interaction between the stressors with highest mortality in the high salinity and temperature (38 ppt, 41 ppt, 24 ℃) treatments. Developmental stage progression was enhanced by increased temperature. On day 1, there was an interaction between salinity and temperature on developmental stage progression, where high salinity (41 ppt) retarded development at the control temperature (20 ℃). The juveniles reared at 24 ℃ were smaller than those at cooler temperatures, suggesting application of the temperature size rule. The low (29 ppt) and high (38 ppt, 41 ppt) salinity treatments produced the smallest and largest juveniles, respectively. In the 35 ppt and 38 ppt salinity conditions at 20 ℃, most juveniles had the normal five-armed profile. Body plan development was perturbed with deviations from pentamery at 29 ppt, 32 ppt and 41 ppt and at 22 ℃ and 24 ℃ in formation of no armed juveniles and ones with abnormal arm number (4, 6, 7 arms). Normal development at 35–38 ppt and 20–22 ℃ reflects breeding period conditions. Prolonged exposure to low and high salinity and increased temperature is deleterious to development in P. exigua and alters body morphology with implications for function and survival.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP150102771cAustralian Research Council 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3alittoral zone 3amortality 3asalinity 3atemperature1 aByrne, Maria0 tMarine biology.g2021 July, v. 168, no. 7 p.99-99dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-021-03902-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01724naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245009000169300001600259520069500275592002800970653000900998653001501007653001901022653002001041653002101061700001501082700001901097700001401116700002101130700001801151773012001169856008801289852000901377655001201386IND60594240220221119081414.0180510e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059424022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jorganchem.2017.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnju, R.S.10aDetection of an unusual intermediate in the photolysis of an iron tricarbonyl complex  ap. 189-193.  aUV photoexcitation of trans-(η⁴-BDA)Fe(CO)3 (1) in alkane solvent generated a short-lived isomeric species whose identity was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and supported by DFT calculations.

The M. oryzae population causing wheat blast has not been officially reported outside South America. Wheat production in the United States is at risk to this pathogen if it is introduced and established. Proactive testing of U.S. wheat cultivars for their reaction to blast and identification of resistance resources is crucial due to the national and global importance of the U.S. wheat industry. In this preliminary study, the phenotypic reaction of 85 U.S. wheat cultivars to M. oryzae (Triticum pathotype) was determined. Although there was a significant correlation in the reaction to blast at the seedling and adult plant stages, only 57% of the head reaction was explained by the seedling reaction. Because of the importance of disease development at the head stage in the field, assessment of all 85 cultivars occurred at the head stage. Among cultivars tested, a continuum in severity to head blast was observed; cultivars Everest and Karl 92 were highly susceptible with more than 90% disease severity, while cultivars Postrock, JackPot, Overley, Jagalene, Jagger, and Santa Fe showed less than 3% infection. No evidence of the presence of physiological races among isolates T-7, T-12, T-22, and T-25 was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe 3aTriticum 3ablast disease 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3adisease severity 3ahead 3amature plants 3apathotypes 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aseedlings 3awheat 3aSouth America 3aUnited States1 aBockus, William W.1 aStack, James P.1 aTang, Xiaoyan1 aValent, Barbara1 aPedley, Kerry F.1 aPeterson, Gary L.0 tPlant disease.g2012 Oct., v. 96, no. 10 p.1501-1505dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/552683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPDIS-11-11-0944-RE3Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/115271_115269.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02328naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013400163500001400297520118800311592002801499650001801527650001501545650001601560650002701576650001501603650001001618650001901628650001301647650001501660650001301675651001201688700002201700700002001722773012901742856007401871852000901945655001201954IND60719048720221119045749.0201126e20201122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071904872DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122238192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a Peters, Daniel L.10aRemote Sensing of Ecosystem Structure: Fusing Passive and Active Remotely Sensed Data to Characterize a Deltaic Wetland Landscape  aNAL-light  aA project was constructed to integrate remotely sensed data from multiple sensors and platforms to characterize range of ecosystem characteristics in the Peace–Athabasca Delta in Northern Alberta, Canada. The objective of this project was to provide a framework for the processing of multisensor data to extract ecosystem information describing complex deltaic wetland environments. The data used in this study was based on a passive satellite-based earth observation multispectral sensor (Sentinel-2) and airborne discrete light detection and ranging (LiDAR). The data processing strategy adopted here allowed us to employ a data mining approach to grouping of the input variables into ecologically meaningful clusters. Using this approach, we described not only the reflective characteristics of the cover, but also ascribe vertical and horizontal structure, thereby differentiating spectrally similar, but ecologically distinct, ground features. This methodology provides a framework for assessing the impact of ecosystems on radiance, as measured by Earth observing systems, where it forms the basis for sampling and analysis.

They were plastic adherent, spindle-shaped cells that expressed CD73, CD90, and CD44 but lacked CD45, CD14, HLA-DR, and CD34. cASCs differentiated toward adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages, although adipogenic differentiation capacity was low. Blast transformation reaction demonstrated that these cells significantly suppress T-cell proliferation, and this ability is dose-dependent. Intravenous administration of a cell freezing medium, therapeutic dose of cASCs (2 × 10⁶ live cells/kg), and five times higher dose of cASCs showed no significant side effects in two dogs. Microscopic tissue lesions were limited to only mild, non-specific changes. There were no signs of malignancy. The results of the study indicate that cASCs are similar to hASCs and are safe for therapeutic applications in a canine model. The proposed methodology for ASC preparation on a non-routine basis, which includes individually optimised cell culture conditions and offers risk-adapted treatment, could be used for future personalised off-the-shelf therapies, for example, in myocardial infarction or stroke.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreezing 3aanaerobic conditions 3adose response 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3aT-lymphocytes 3aintravenous injection 3acell culture 3adogs 3amyocardial infarction 3astem cells 3aanimal models 3astroke 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aadipogenesis 3aadverse effects 0aadvanced therapy medicinal products 0apulmonary first-pass effect 0ahospital exemption 0astem cell safety 0aautologous adipose-derived stem cells 0atherapeutics1 aMatise-VanHoutana, Ilze1 aPētersone, Ilze1 aDūrītis, Ilmārs1 aŅikuļšins, Sergejs1 aBogdanova-Jātniece, Ance1 aKālis, Mārtiņš,1 aSvirskis, Šimons1 aSkrastiņa, Dace1 aEzerta, Agnese1 aKozlovska, Tatjana0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2018 June 01, v. 72, no. 3 p.160-171dSciendowJournal:21686x1407-009X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2018-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010100155300001800256500002000274520144800294592002801742596005501770596008201825596005901907650002101966650001401987650001602001650001202017650001402029650002302043650001302066650001702079650002102096650001302117650001302130650002702143700001702170700001702187700001702204700001902221773015002240856007302390852000902463655001202472IND60653111120221119114932.0190713e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065311112DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.60512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Ling10aMechanochemical enzymatic synthesis of 1,4‐dihydropyridine calcium antagonists and derivatives  ap. 2555-2560.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Enzyme promiscuity has attracted significant attention from chemists and biochemists in recent years. However, long reaction time and use of toxic organic solvents limit its applications for industrial processes. 1,4‐Dihydropyridine (1,4‐DHP) calcium antagonists are recommended for the first line treatment of hypertension. Although some chemical protocols for the preparation of 1,4‐DHP calcium antagonists have been developed, enzymatic synthesis of these compounds still remains uncovered. RESULTS: Solvent‐free quick synthesis of 1,4‐DHP calcium antagonists felodipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine and nemadipine B and their derivatives was achieved by Lipozyme® RM IM (triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, EC3.1.1.3)‐catalyzed multicomponent reactions of aromatic aldehyde, alkyl acetoacetate and alkyl 3‐aminocrotonate under ball‐milling conditions. The products were obtained in moderate yields (up to 86.8%) and the influence of reaction conditions including catalyst loading, grinding auxiliary and grinding frequency was investigated. CONCLUSION: The protocol successfully overcame some longstanding problems in the field of enzymatic promiscuity research, such as long reaction time and use of harmful organic solvents, and demonstrated the potential application value of promiscuous enzyme‐catalyzed reactions under ball‐milling conditions for pharmaceutical synthesis. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2016M592012cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aBSH1502150cFoundation for Selected Postdoctoral Project of Zhejiang province  a21706236cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aacetoacetic acid 3aaldehydes 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agrinding 3ahypertension 3amechanochemistry 3asolvents 3atoxicity 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aYe, Li‐dan1 aGu, Jia‐li1 aSu, Wei‐ke1 aYe, Wen‐ting0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2019 Aug., v. 94, no. 8 p.2555-2560dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.60513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03954naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245008100176300001600257520209100273592002802364650003202392650002202424650001202446650001502458650001402473650002202487650002002509650001802529650001102547650001202558650001402570650001002584650001802594650002002612650002002632650001802652650002002670650001602690650001102706650001902717650002102736650002002757650002302777650001402800650002102814650002002835653002002855653002802875653002802903653002302931653002402954653002002978700002302998700005703021700001903078700001503097773009503112856008803207852000903295655001203304IND60552690120221118190812.0161021e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055269012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Kuijk, S.J.A.10aFungal treated lignocellulosic biomass as ruminant feed ingredient: A review  ap. 191-202.  aIn ruminant nutrition, there is an increasing interest for ingredients that do not compete with human nutrition. Ruminants are specialists in digesting carbohydrates in plant cell walls; therefore lignocellulosic biomass has potential in ruminant nutrition. The presence of lignin in biomass, however, limits the effective utilization of cellulose and hemicellulose. Currently, most often chemical and/or physical treatments are used to degrade lignin. White rot fungi are selective lignin degraders and can be a potential alternative to current methods which involve potentially toxic chemicals and expensive equipment. This review provides an overview of research conducted to date on fungal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for ruminant feeds. White rot fungi colonize lignocellulosic biomass, and during colonization produce enzymes, radicals and other small compounds to breakdown lignin. The mechanisms on how these fungi degrade lignin are not fully understood, but fungal strain, the origin of lignocellulose and culture conditions have a major effect on the process. Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Pleurotus eryngii are the most effective fungi to improve the nutritional value of biomass for ruminant nutrition. However, conclusions on the effectiveness of fungal delignification are difficult to draw due to a lack of standardized culture conditions and information on fungal strains used. Methods of analysis between studies are not uniform for both chemical analysis and in vitro degradation measurements. In vivo studies are limited in number and mostly describing digestibility after mushroom production, when the fungus has degraded cellulose to derive energy for fruit body development.Optimization of fungal pretreatment is required to shorten the process of delignification and make it more selective for lignin. In this respect, future research should focus on optimization of culture conditions and gene expression to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved and allow the development of superior fungal strains to degrade lignin in biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeriporiopsis subvermispora 3aPleurotus eryngii 3abiomass 3acell walls 3acellulose 3achemical analysis 3adelignification 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aequipment 3afeeds 3afree radicals 3afruiting bodies 3agene expression 3ahemicellulose 3ain vivo studies 3aingredients 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amushroom growing 3anutritive value 3aruminant nutrition 3aruminants 3atoxic substances 3awhite-rot fungi 0aWhite rot fungi 0aBiological pretreatment 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aLignin degradation 0aRumen digestibility 0aFeed ingredient1 aSonnenberg, A.S.M.1 aBaars, J.J.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0692-73711 aHendriks, W.H.1 aCone, J.W.0 tBiotechnology Advances.g2015 Jan.,  Feb., v. 33 p.191-202dElsevier Inc.x0734-97507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245018400154520156300338592002801901650002101929650002401950650002801974650001702002650001202019650002502031650002302056650002602079650001502105650001702120650002402137650000902161650002002170650001602190650001302206700002102219700001802240700001802258700001802276700001802294773012202312856007402434852000902508655001202517IND60748635920221119232644.0210827e20210729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074863592DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130826292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jie 10aAssociation of Patient-Reported Outcomes and Nutrition with Body Composition in Women with Gynecologic Cancer Undergoing Post-Operative Pelvic Radiotherapy: An Observational Study  aPelvic radiotherapy is associated with gastrointestinal toxicities and deterioration of nutritional status. This study aimed to investigate the association of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and nutritional status with body composition changes in women who underwent hysterectomy and post-operative radiotherapy for gynecologic cancer. We analyzed data of 210 patients treated with post-operative pelvic radiotherapy for gynecologic cancer between 2013 and 2018. The PRO version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) was used for gastrointestinal toxicity assessment. The Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) was used for nutritional assessment. Skeletal muscle index was measured from computed tomography scans at the L3 vertebral level. A reduction in skeletal muscle index ≥ 5% was classified as muscle loss. Odds ratios were calculated through logistic regression models. The PG-SGA score increased from the beginning to the end of radiotherapy (1.4 vs. 3.7, p < 0.001). Patients with PRO-CTCAE scores ≥ 3 had significantly higher PG-SGA scores at the end of radiotherapy than those with PRO-CTCAE scores ≤ 2 (8.1 vs. 2.3, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, PRO-CTCAE scores ≥ 3 and PG-SGA scores ≥ 4 at the end of radiotherapy were independently associated with increased risk of muscle loss (odds ratio: 8.81, p < 0.001; odds ratio: 72.96, p < 0.001, respectively). PROs and PG-SGA may be considered as markers of muscle loss after post-operative pelvic radiotherapy for gynecologic cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody composition 3acomputed tomography 3agastrointestinal system 3ahysterectomy 3amuscles 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3aradiotherapy 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3askeletal muscle 3aterminology 3atoxicity1 aChen, Tze-Chien 1 aJan, Ya-Ting 1 aLi, Chi-Jung 1 aChen, Yu-Jen 1 aWu, Meng-Hao 0 tNutrients.g2021 July 29, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130826293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245011900177300001600296520206700312592002802379653001802407653003002425653001302455653002202468653002202490700003002512773012002542856008802662852000902750655001202759IND60594240620221119081535.0180510e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059424062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jorganchem.2017.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanova, Bojidarka10aOrganosilver(I) and organozinc(II) catalysed synthesis of quaterphenyls – Experimental and theoretical treatment  ap. 160-183.  aAn essential part of molecular scaffolds of organosilver(I) catalysing reactions of C–H bond activation and C–X (X = C or O) bond formation of polysubstituted benzoic acids in polar medium represent biphenyls, 6H-benzo-[c]-chromene[6]-one, chromeno[5,4,3-cde]chromene-5,10-dione, and 4,10-dioxa-pyrene-5,9-diones. A second strand of catalytic activity is in promoting synthesis of substituted quanterphenyls. This paper is a an extend of the systematic examining of catalytic activity of Agᴵ–containing intermediates of substituted benzoic acids, gaining insights by synthesis of oligomers, studying benzene-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (124BA) and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (135BA). Arguably, the optimization of the latter reactions need further effort in order to achieve the standard characteristics allowing their effective implementation as routine routs in the field of organic synthesis. The purpose of this part of the research is mass spectrometric (MS) quantitative kinetic and thermodynamic treatment of collision induced dissociation (CID) reactions comparing experimental reaction kinetics and energetics with quantum chemical modelling of MS fragment processes. Analyses - experimental and theoretical - include deuterium labelled oligomers as the most useful technique studying MS reaction mechanisms. More specifically we treat eight substituted quaterphenyls both experimentally and theoretically along with a set of one hundred twenty 3D molecular models of MS fragment species. Importantly, the detail understanding of the molecular mechanistic aspects of the reactions causing for obtaining of high functionalized oligomers allows an efficient optimization of synthetic roads studying polyfunctional derivatives. This knowledge is the kay to understanding why the obtaining of the oligomer derivatives depends on the positional isomerism of the starting reagents as clearly evidenced in this study. In this context the study is relevant to the fields of organometallic synthesis and catalysis as well as the polymers' chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 0aQuaterphenyls 0aOrganosilver(I) catalysis 0aKinetics 0aMass spectrometry 0aQuantum chemistry1 aSpiteller, M.q(Michael),0 tJournal of organometallic chemistry.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 851 p.160-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26739x0022-328X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2017.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245009600169300002000265520145100285592002801736650001801764650001501782650001801797650002001815650002401835650001901859650001501878650001401893650001401907650002501921650001101946653002801957653001401985653002101999653002002020773015702040856007902197852000902276655001202285IND60586934220221118064136.0190318e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058693422DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-133992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThatcher, William W.12aA 100-Year Review: Historical development of female reproductive physiology in dairy cattle  ap. 10272-10291.  aThe objective of this historical review in female reproductive physiology is to encapsulate major advancements since the founding of the American Dairy Science Association in 1906. The emphasis is on landmark publications in the Journal of Dairy Science since its first volume in 1917. A historical perspective and inferences are made in forecasting evolution of female reproduction and links between physiology of reproduction and the mammary gland. Subsequent sections are focused into main physiological categories and the temporal advancements within these physiological windows. Time points of understanding vary considerably within categories due to various advancements in technology, biological techniques, experimental design, data collection, statistical analyses, and computational forecasting. The physiological windows examined are hypothalamic and pituitary control of the ovary related to estrous behavior and cycle; differential control of the corpus luteum and uterus as influenced by cycling and pregnancy statuses; peripartum and postpartum programing of reproduction; and scientific foundation for the next century. The importance of interdisciplinary programs and integration of reproduction, nutrition/metabolism, genetics, health, and management are emphasized.

The prepared oleogels were characterized by different methods to study the influence of oil type on the oleogel properties. The oil type influenced the colour and appearance of the oleogel. The flaxseed oil based oleogel showed lower oil loss and higher firmness than those of other oils based oleogels. The increase of gelator mixture from 15 to 20 g/100 g oil reduced the oil loss and improved the firmness of oleogel samples. The microscopy and small-angle x-ray scattering analyses showed different microstructures and crystallographic reflections for oleogels prepared from different oil types. Also, the oil type and concentration of gelator mixture influenced the melting and crystallization enthalpies of oleogel. Furthermore, different oils based oleogels showed varying values of viscosity, storage modulus (G’), and loss modulus (G”). Therefore, it can be concluded that the oil type and concentration of gelator influence the functional properties of oleogel and the flaxseed oil resulted in oleogel with good properties compared with other oils used in the study.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0400404cNational Key R&D Plan of China 3abeta-sitosterol 3acolor 3acorn oil 3acrystallization 3aenthalpy 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afirmness 3afunctional properties 3alinseed oil 3aloss modulus 3amelting 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3astearic acid 3astorage modulus 3asunflower oil1 aZhu, Minpeng1 aWang, Na1 aCui, Xiaotong1 aXu, Qing1 aSaleh, Ahmed S.

Growth of B. thailandensis E264 under two different incubation temperatures (25 and 30 °C) resulted in a significantly higher dry cell biomass production at 30 °C (7.71 g/l) than at 25 °C (4.75 g/l) after 264 h; however, incubation at the lower temperature resulted in consistently higher concentration of RL production throughout the growth period. After 264 h, the concentration of crude RL extract for the 25 °C culture was 2.79 g/l compared to 1.99 g/l for the 30 °C culture. Overall RL production concentration after 264 h was 0.258 g/g dry cell biomass (DCB) for the 30 °C culture compared to 0.587 g/g DCB for the 25 °C culture. Real-time PCR (qPCR) was also used to analyse expression of the RL biosynthesis genes throughout the incubation period at 25 °C showing that the expression of the rhlA, rhlB and rhlC genes is continuous. During the log and early stationary phases of growth, expression levels remain low and are increased upon entry to the late stationary phase. B. thailandensis E264 produces mostly di-RLs and the Di-RL C14-C14 in most abundance (41.88 %). Fermentations were also carried out in small-scale bioreactors (4 l working volume) under controlled conditions, and results showed that RL production was maintained. Our findings show that B. thailandensis E264 has excellent potential for industrial scale RL production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBurkholderia thailandensis 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3afermentation 3agenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhamnolipids 3asoil 3atemperature 3aThailand1 aTsaousi, Konstantina1 aRudden, Michelle1 aSmyth, Thomas J.1 aStevenson, Paul S.1 aMarchant, Roger1 aBanat, Ibrahim M.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Sept., v. 100, no. 18 p.7945-7956dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7564-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005100154245005300205300001600258520095100274592002801225650002501253650001701278650001501295650001301310653001901323653001801342653002101360653002501381653003401406700002001440700001901460700005701479773009501536856008801631852000901719655001201728IND60552690420221118190554.0161021e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055269042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3952-879910aSynthetic fusion protein design and applications  ap. 155-164.  aSynthetic fusion proteins can be designed to achieve improved properties or new functionality by synergistically incorporating multiple proteins into one complex. The fusion of two or more protein domains enhances bioactivities or generates novel functional combinations with a wide range of biotechnological and (bio)pharmaceutical applications. In this review, initially, we summarize the commonly used approaches for constructing fusion proteins. For each approach, the design strategy and desired properties are elaborated with examples of recent studies in the areas of biocatalysts, protein switches and bio-therapeutics. Subsequently, the progress in structural prediction of fusion proteins is presented, which can potentially facilitate the structure-based systematic design of fusion proteins toward identifying the best combinations of fusion partners. Finally, the current challenges and future directions in this field are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiocatalysts 3aprediction 3aproteins 0aFusion protein 0aLinker design 0aDomain insertion 0aProtein therapeutics 0aSynthetic protein engineering1 aLiu, Chengcheng1 aKim, Byung-Gee1 aLee, Dong-Yup1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0901-708X0 tBiotechnology Advances.g2015 Jan.,  Feb., v. 33 p.155-164dElsevier Inc.x0734-97507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03972naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001800162245011800180300001600298520173700314592002802051650001102079650002002090650000902110650001902119650001102138650001302149650001002162650002102172650001602193650001002209650004102219650002402260650003302284650001102317650001102328650006102339650001402400650005502414650006102469650000902530650001502539650002102554650005402575650005402629650002302683650006902706650001602775651001002791651002502801700002502826700001802851700001402869700001902883700001402902700001302916700001602929700001402945700001402959700001502973700001602988700001703004773013703021856008303158852000903241655001203250IND4470751220221120180531.0120419e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447075122DNAL7 a222053142pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.111.0280012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSang, Zhongna10aExploration of the safe upper level of iodine intake in euthyroid Chinese adults: a randomized double-blind trial  ap. 367-373.  aBACKGROUND: The beneficial health effects associated with Universal Salt Iodization are well known. Yet, little is known about the possible adverse health effects in people with high iodine intake and the safe daily intake upper limit in the Chinese population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the safe upper level of total daily iodine intake among adults in China. DESIGN: A 4-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 256 euthyroid adults. Participants were randomly assigned to 12 intervention groups with various iodine supplement doses ranging from 0 to 2000 μg/d. Total iodine intake included iodine from both supplements and diet. Multiple outcome measures were used to evaluate possible adverse effects, including thyroid function, thyroid size, and urinary iodine. RESULTS: The mean iodine intake from the diets and salt intake of the participants were 105 ± 25 and 258 ± 101 μg/d, respectively. In comparison with the placebo group, all iodide-supplemented groups responded with significant increases in median urinary iodine concentrations (P < 0.05) and in thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration (P < 0.05). Thyroid volume decreased after 4 wk in the high-iodine intervention groups (1500–2000 μg). Subclinical hypothyroidism appeared in the groups that received 400 μg I (5%) and 500–2000 μg I (15–47%). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that subclinical hypothyroidism appeared in the participants who took the 400-μg I supplement, which provided a total iodine intake of ∼800 μg/d. Thus, we caution against a total daily iodine intake that exceeds 800 μg/d in China and recommend further research to determine a safe daily upper limit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3adiet 3ahypothyroidism 3aiodine 3aplacebos 3asalts 3athyroid function 3athyrotropin 2aAdult 2aDietary Supplementsxadverse effects 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypothyroidismxbloodxchemically inducedxepidemiology. 2aIncidence 2aIodidesxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aIodinexadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxurine. 2aMale 2aOrgan Size 2aReference Values 2aSodium Chloride, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aThyroid Glandxanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 2aThyrotropinxblood 2aTrace Elementsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxurine. 2aYoung Adult 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aWang, Peizhong Peter1 aYao, Zhaixiao1 aShen, Jun1 aHalfyard, Beth1 aTan, Long1 aZhao, Na1 aWu, Yuntang1 aGao, Shuo1 aTan, Jian1 aLiu, Jiayu1 aChen, Zupei1 aZhang, Wanqi0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2012 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.367-373dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.0280013Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03784naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245016300165300001600328500034500344520184900689592002802538650002202566650001202588650001302600650001502613650002102628650002902649650002102678650001302699650001402712650001502726650001302741650002502754650001802779650002902797650000702826650000902833650001802842650000902860650001802869650001502887650002602902650001002928700001802938700001502956700001802971700001702989773014403006856008303150852000903233655001203242IND60614099520221118135643.0181002e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061409952DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e3182a35c922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Haijun10aLaboratory Lysimeter Analysis of NH3 and N2O Emissions and Leaching Losses of Nitrogen in a Rice-Wheat Rotation System Irrigated With Nitrogen-Rich Wastewater  ap. 316-323.  aAffiliations: 1State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China. 2Oklahoma State University, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, Stillwater, OK. 3Schools of Environmental Science and Technology, Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, Lin’an, China.  aSewage effluents are increasingly used for farmland irrigation worldwide. This practice makes N losses via gaseous forms and leaching process more complex. Twelve repacked lysimeters with 90 cm height and 25 cm inner diameter were used for comprehensively determining ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and N leaching losses in a rice-wheat cropping system irrigated with N-rich wastewater from a livestock pond. There were four irrigation treatments with three replications: wastewater with high N concentration (HW), wastewater with medium N concentration (MW, one-half dilution of wastewater of HW), wastewater with low N concentration (LW, one-fourth dilution of wastewater of HW), and ultrapure water control (CK). All treatments received equal amounts of total N (225 kg N ha in the rice season and 150 kg N ha in the wheat season) by balancing with commercial N fertilizer. The wastewater was proven to be as effective as commercial N fertilizer to achieve the optimum crop yields when applied in an appropriate amount. The NH3 emission, N leaching, and N2O emission losses accounted for 16.2 to 19.8%, 4.6 to 6.4%, and 0.26 to 0.35% of the total N applied in the rice season, respectively, whereas they were 2.7 to 3.3%, 2.2 to 2.8%, and 0.77 to 1.0% in the wheat season. Irrigating with wastewater did not change the NH3 emission flux pattern after N fertilizer (urea) was applied, but it boosted the NH3 emission flux to a certain extent in the rice season, especially for the MW treatment, which was mainly attributed to the high ammonium content and pH of the flood surface water resulting from a combined effect of wastewater and urea-N application. In addition, N-rich wastewater irrigation did not significantly increase N2O emission and N leaching when the total N inputs and the amount of irrigation were the same.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aammonia 3aammonium 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3airrigation rates 3aleaching 3alivestock 3alysimeters 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3apH 3arice 3asurface water 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation 3awheat1 aZhang, Hailin1 aWu, Jiasen1 aJiang, Peikun1 aShi, Weiming0 tSoil science.g2013 June, v. 178, no. 6 p.316-323dWolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e3182a35c923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014100173520107900314592002801393650001401421650001301435650001701448650001501465650003701480653002701517653001801544653003701562653002201599653002301621653001501644700002901659700002901688700002101717700001801738773010801756856008601864852000901950655001201959IND60716054420221120090541.0220502e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071605442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1172712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampano, Cristina10aIn-depth characterization of the aggregation state of cellulose nanocrystals through analysis of transmission electron microscopy images  aDispersion of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is of utmost importance to guarantee their reliable application. Nevertheless, there is still no consensual method to characterize CNC aggregation. The hypothesis of this paper is that dispersion could be quantified through the classification of aggregates detected in transmission electron microscopy images. k-Means was used to classify image particulate elements of five CNC samples into groups according to their geometric features. Particles were classified into five groups according to their maximum Feret diameter, elongation, circularity and area. Two groups encompassed the most application-critical aggregates: one integrated aggregates of high complexity and low compactness while the other included elongated aggregates. In addition, the characterization of CNC dispersion after different levels of sonication was achieved by assessing the change in the number of elements belonging to each cluster after sonication. This approach could be used as a standard for the characterization of the aggregation state of CNCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3ageometry 3ananocrystals 3asonication 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aNanocellulose 0aTransmission electron microscopy 0aAggregation state 0ak-Means clustering 0aDispersion1 aLopez-Exposito, Patricio1 aGonzalez-Aguilera, Laura1 aBlanco, Angeles,1 aNegro, Carlos0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 254 p.117271-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1172713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008400172520205400256592002802310650002102338650002402359650001202383650001302395650002502408650002402433650003002457650001302487650001002500650002102510650001602531650001202547650001802559650001702577650001102594653003102605653002402636653002702660653002402687700001702711700002302728773008802751856008702839852000902926655001202935IND60701626720221117200603.0200824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070162672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2020.1022312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Linda10aMultiple enzymes can make hydrogen sulfide from cysteine in Treponema denticola  aTreponema denticola is a spirochete that is involved in causing periodontal diseases. This bacterium can produce H₂S from thiol compounds found in the gingival crevicular fluid. Determining how H₂S is made by oral bacteria is important since this molecule is present at high levels in periodontally-diseased pockets and the biological effects of H₂S can explain some of the pathologies seen in periodontitis. Thus, it is of interest to identify the enzyme, or enzymes, involved in the synthesis of H₂S by T. denticola. We, and others, have previously identified and characterized a T. denticola cystalysin, called HlyA, which hydrolyzes cysteine into H₂S (and pyruvate and ammonia). However, there have been no studies to show that HlyA is, or is not, the only pathway that T. denticola can use to make H₂S. To address this question, allelic replacement mutagenesis was used to make a deletion mutant (ΔhlyA) in the gene encoding HlyA. The mutant produces the same amount of H₂S from cysteine as do wild type spirochetes, indicating that T. denticola has at least one other enzyme that can generate H₂S from cysteine. To identify candidates for this other enzyme, a BLASTp search of T. denticola strain 33520 was done. There was one gene that encoded an HlyA homolog so we named it HlyB. Recombinant His-tagged HlyB was expressed in E. coli and partially purified. This enzyme was able to make H₂S from cysteine in vitro. To test the role of HlyB in vivo, an HlyB deletion mutant (ΔhlyB) was constructed in T. denticola. This mutant still made normal levels of H₂S from cysteine, but a strain mutated in both hly genes (ΔhlyA ΔhlyB) synthesizes significantly less H₂S from cysteine. We conclude that the HlyA and HlyB enzymes perform redundant functions in vivo and are the major contributors to H₂S production in T. denticola. However, at least one other enzyme can still convert cysteine to H₂S in the ΔhlyA ΔhlyB mutant. An in silico analysis that identifies candidate genes for this other enzyme is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aTreponema denticola 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3acomputer simulation 3acystathionine gamma-lyase 3acysteine 3agenes 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aperiodontitis 3apyruvic acid 3athiols 0aHydrogen sulfide synthesis 0aPeriodontal disease 0aCystathionine-β-lyase 0aCysteine catabolism1 aChu, Lianrui1 aKolodrubetz, David0 tAnaerobe.g2020 Aug., v. 64 p.102231-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2020.1022313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008500161300001800246520162100264592002801885650002301913650002001936650001601956650002201972650002301994650001202017650001302029650001402042650002202056650001002078700002002088700002602108773013702134856007302271852000902344655001202353IND60515853720221118182207.0160321e20120718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051585372DNAL7 a10.1139/x2012-1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarson, Andrew J.10aEffects of restoration thinning on spatial heterogeneity in mixed-conifer forest  ap. 1505-1517.  aSpatial pattern is an essential attribute of forest ecosystems and influences many ecological processes and functions. We hypothesized that restoration thinning conducted in fire-excluded ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson) – western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) – mixed-conifer forest would restore spatial patterns characteristic of active fire regime old-growth. We evaluated effects of thinning on spatial patterns and also compared post-treatment patterns with reconstructions of pre-suppression patterns at nearby old-growth reference sites that developed in the historical mixed-severity fire regime. Restoration thinning reduced spatial aggregation and resulted in globally random tree patterns comprised of local tree clumps, openings, and widely spaced single trees, similar to reference conditions. Post-treatment spatial patterns in the replicate treatment units spanned the range of variability bounded by the reference sites. Our analyses indicate that, under certain circumstances, restoration of spatial heterogeneity in unlogged, fire-excluded forests can be achieved by retaining live legacy pre-suppression trees during thinning treatments. However, success is not assured. Restoration of spatial heterogeneity in forests where few live pre-suppression trees remain due to past mortality or harvest, a common condition of candidate restoration sites, presents a greater silvicultural challenge. Thus, we recommend that, as a general rule, managers deliberately address spatial pattern when crafting forest restoration treatment objectives and prescriptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix occidentalis 3aPinus ponderosa 3afire regime 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3amanagers 3amortality 3aspatial variation 3atrees1 aStover, Kyle C.1 aKeyes, Christopher R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2012 July 18, v. 42, no. 8 p.1505-1517dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x2012-1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03947naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245015400214300001600368520207300384592002802457650003002485650002002515650001402535650003202549650002202581650001602603650001002619650000802629650003002637650002002667650001302687650001702700650001102717650001002728651001102738653001102749653001702760653001402777653002602791700002202817700001902839700006302858700002602921700002602947700003002973700001903003700002503022700002503047700002103072700002203093773016003115856008503275852000903360655001203369IND60643114220221122024321.0190620e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064311422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Natalia de M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2877-913810aContribution of ultra-processed foods consumption in sodium ingestion of atherosclerotic disease patients, residents in the southern region of Brazil  ap. 140-144.  aRecent studies have related the consumption of ultra-processed foods with the development of cardiovascular diseases and have considered this relation with excessive sodium intake. While Brazilian studies have analysed that this consumption may have no direct relationship with the processing, but rather with the addition of salt. The purpose of this study is to investigate the contribution of the consumption of processed products in the daily intake of sodium ingestion by atherosclerotic disease patients.A sub study, conducted with data from 630 cardiopathic patients who take part in “Effect of Brazilian Cardioprotective Food Program study on the reduction of events and risk factors in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease part”. Food was classified as: unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods, ultra-processed food and beverages. Twenty-four-hour food recall (R24h) was collected from patients, and the estimation of total calories and sodium intake were calculated, as well as the percentage of sodium contribution according to the categories already mentioned. For the adequacy ratio analysis, the daily values of sodium intake were used to compared to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (<2000 mg / day).The average sodium intake was 1970.87 mg for women and 2642.86 mg for men, being higher for males' patients aged 60–79. It was observed that 64% of the studied population demonstrated sodium intake > 2000 mg. When considered levels > 3001 mg, a higher incidence of consumption was observed in the male group. Only 21.1% were intaking sodium within the recommended amount. Industrialized foods contributed to 33% of the mineral intake.These findings have demonstrated that the majority of the studied patients exceeded the dietary sodium recommendation. It has also indicated that patient's male, have presented increased consumption of the mineral. Consequently, warning for the necessity of greater investments in the nutritional re-education of these patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aatherosclerosis 3abeverages 3afood and nutrition programs 3aindustrialization 3aingredients 3amales 3amen 3aminimally processed foods 3anutrient intake 3apatients 3arisk factors 3asodium 3awomen 3aBrazil 0aSodium 0aHypertension 0aIngestion 0aUltra-processed foods1 aFrehner, Caroline1 aZanini, Ana C.1 aZaina, Francisca E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0318-93311 ade Matos, Cristina H.1 aBertacco, Renata T.A.1 aSchirmann, Gabriela da S.1 aPoloni, Soraia1 aAdorne, Elaine de F.1 aKumbier, Magali C.C.1 aWeber, Bernadete1 aRocco, Claudia S.0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2019 Aug., v. 32 p.140-144dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01307naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245005900159300001800218520034300236592002800579650001600607650004300623650001800666650001600684653002500700653001800725653000900743700001500752773014000767856007700907852000900984655001200993IND60522178620221123032646.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052217862DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2002-10152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCsuk, René10aSynthesis of Rigid Cyclopropanoid Nucleoside Analogues  ap. 1169-1173.  aA convenient synthesis has been developed for the synthesis of cyclopropanoid nucleoside analogues that possess no additional spacer groups between the heterocycle and the hydroxylated cyclopropane ring.

Male gametogenesis works as a bottleneck for the parasite life cycle, where, during a peculiar and rapid exflagellation, a male gametocyte produces 8 intracellular axonemes that generate by budding 8 motile gametes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gametogenesis is key to design strategies for controlling malaria transmission. In the rodent P. berghei, the microtubule-based motor kinesin-8B (PbKIN8B) is essential for flagellum assembly during male gametogenesis and its gene disruption impacts on completion of the parasitic life cycle. In efforts to improve our knowledge about male gametogenesis, we performed an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic comparison of P. berghei mutants with disrupted kinesin-8B gene (ΔPbkin8B) and wild type parasites. During the 15 min of gametogenesis, ΔPbkin8B parasites exhibited important motor protein dysregulation that suggests an essential role of PbKIN8B for the correct interaction or integration of axonemal proteins within the growing axoneme. The energy metabolism of ΔPbkin8B mutants was further affected, as well as the response to stress proteins, protein synthesis, as well as chromatin organisation and DNA processes, although endomitoses seemed to occur.Malaria continues to be a global scourge, mainly in subtropical and tropical areas. The disease is caused by parasites from the Plasmodium genus. Plasmodium life cycle alternates between female Anopheles mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts through bites. Gametocytes are the parasite blood forms responsible for transmission from vertebrates to vectors. Inside the mosquito midgut, after stimulation, male and female gametocytes transform into gametes resulting in fertilization. During male gametogenesis, one gametocyte generates eight intracytoplasmic axonemes that generate, by budding, flagellated motile gametes involving a process termed exflagellation. Sexual development has a central role in ensuring malaria transmission. However, molecular data on male gametogenesis and particularly on intracytoplasmic axoneme assembly are still lacking. Since rodent malaria parasites permit the combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments and reverse genetic studies, our group investigated the molecular events in rodent P. berghei gametogenesis. The P. berghei motor ATPase kinesin-8B is proposed as an important component for male gametogenesis. We generated Pbkin8B gene-disrupted gametocytes (ΔPbkin8B) that were morphologically similar to the wild- type (WT) parasites. However, in mutants, male gametogenesis is impaired, male gametocytes are disabled in their ability to assemble axonemes and to exflagellate to release gametes, reducing fertilization drastically. Using a comparative quantitative proteomic analysis, we associated the nonfunctional axoneme of the mutants with the abnormal differential expression of proteins essential to axoneme organisation and stability. We also observed a differential dysregulation of proteins involved in protein biosynthesis and degradation, chromatin organisation and DNA processes in ΔPbkin8B parasites, although DNA condensation, mitotic spindle formation and endomitoses seem to occur. This is the first functional proteomic study of a kinesin gene-disrupted Plasmodium parasite providing new insights into Plasmodium male gametogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles 3aDNA 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3ablood 3achromatin 3aenergy metabolism 3afemales 3aflagellum 3agametocytes 3agametogenesis 3agene expression regulation 3agene targeting 3agenes 3ahumans 3akinesin 3amalaria 3amales 3amidgut 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3amolecular motor proteins 3aparasites 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3areverse genetics 3arodents 3asexual development 3astress response 0aPlasmodium 0aExflagellation 0aQuantitative proteomics 0aMutant 0aCLB 0aHSP 0aip 0aIFA 0aΔPbkin8B 0aPbKIN8B 0aRBC 0aRPMI medium 0aTCA 0aTEAB 0aTFA 0aWT1 aDepoix, Delphine1 aCarvalho, Paulo Costa1 aBastos, Izabela Marques Dourado1 aRicart, Carlos André Ornelas1 ade Sousa, Marcelo Valle1 aFerguson, David J.P.1 aSantana, Jaime Martins1 aGrellier, Philippe1 aCharneau, Sébastien0 tJournal of proteomics.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 236 p.104118-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2021.1041183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03993naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013700173300001600310500011500326520218000441592002802621650002002649650001802669650001202687650001102699650001202710650002302722650001102745650000902756650001502765650001802780650001002798650001602808650003102824650001202855650001402867650002102881650001402902650001402916650000902930650001402939650001702953650001802970650000902988650001602997650001203013650001903025650001203044650001203056650001203068650001603080700001803096700002303114773014403137856008903281852000903370655001203379IND60614099720221118135651.0181002e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061409972DNAL7 a10.1097/01.SS.0000435534.41794.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekele, Asfaw10aUse of Biochar and Oxidized Lignite for Reconstructing a Functioning Topsoil: Plant Growth Response and Soil Nutrient Concentrations  ap. 344-358.  aAffiliations: 1Imperial Oil Resources, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 2Imperial Oil Limited, Anjou, Quebec, Canada.  aTopsoil (TS) shortage often limits the successful reclamation of older mined sites. We evaluated the effectiveness of one-time application of biochar or oxidized lignite (humalite) alone or in combination with a mix of conventional organic materials to reconstruct functioning TS using subsoil (SS) as a substrate. Biochar or humalite carbon (C) represented a stable form of C, whereas C from a mix of sawdust, wheat straw, and alfalfa (labile organic mix (LOM)) represented the labile C fraction. The amount and composition of organic amendment mix were determined so that organic C levels of reconstructed TS would be equivalent to that of the native TS in the long-term. Three SS substrates differing in texture (clay, loam, and sand) and organic C levels were used in the study. We used field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) as test crops in rotation in four sequential greenhouse studies. All treatments except the control SS and TS received supplemental fertilizer nutrients. Plant biomass yield and tissue concentrations were evaluated at the end of each study, whereas soil nutrient levels were assessed at the end of Study II and Study IV. Labile organic mix amendment alone was superior in biomass production relative to any of the other treatments at the early stages of the study. Cumulative biomass yield of SS amended with either biochar or humalite in the presence of LOM was statistically identical for clay and sand soils. These values were also statistically indistinguishable from the fertilized native TS control treatment for the clay soil but not for the sand soil. Humalite application at a high rate (76 g/kg soil) increased soil CEC, decreased soil pH and P concentration, and increased both soil and plant tissue B concentrations. Our data show that a functioning TS can be reconstructed using either biochar or humalite in the presence of LOM and adequate supplemental fertilizers particularly N and P. Detailed characterization of organic amendments is recommended to avoid undesirable effects emanating from their use. Field-based long-term studies are needed to confirm the longevity of benefits of using these amendments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aPisum sativum 3aalfalfa 3abarley 3abiochar 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3afertilizers 3agreenhouse experimentation 3alignite 3alongevity 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aoxidation 3apeas 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aplant tissues 3asand 3asandy soils 3asawdust 3asoil nutrients 3asoil pH 3atexture 3atopsoil 3awheat straw1 aRoy, Julie L.1 aYoung, Michelle A.0 tSoil science.g2013 July, v. 178, no. 7 p.344-358dWolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.SS.0000435534.41794.153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245014300162300001800305520125000323592002801573650001501601650001401616650002501630650000901655650001101664650001601675650001101691650001501702650001701717650002401734650001301758650000901771650002301780650001301803700001501816700001701831700001801848773016201866856008202028852000902110655001202119IND60688499020221119154426.0200414e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068849902DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02660-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmes, M.10aSingle-particle analysis of atmospheric particulate matter using automated mineralogy: the potential for monitoring mine-derived emissions  ap. 2743-2754.  aThis article describes a new method for the analysis of fine (> 1 µm) atmospheric particulates using the Mineral Liberation Analyzer. After determining the optimum sampling technique, the accuracy and precision of the instrument were tested by repeat analysis and by comparison to certified reference materials, with relative standard deviations of less than 10% achieved. A pilot study using this method was applied to identify arsenic-bearing phases near a gold mine and to identify particulates near a large iron-ore mining operation. The results revealed the presence of only negligible amounts of the arsenic-bearing phases and sulfides typically associated with the gold deposit, with only 159 particles detected in the 22,511 particles analyzed. The presence of aluminum-enriched iron oxides in the particulates sampled near the iron-ore operation suggests that re-entrained soil is a significant source of particulates in this region. From the results of this study, the technique has been shown to have a significant potential for the rapid acquisition of reliable data for the characterization of airborne particulates, which is requisite for effective emissions management and for the monitoring of human and environmental health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aemissions 3aenvironmental health 3agold 3ahumans 3airon oxides 3amining 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3areference standards 3asampling 3asoil 3astandard deviation 3asulfides1 aDelbem, I.1 aGasparon, M.1 aCiminelli, V.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2020 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.2743-2754dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-020-02660-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245014500151300002000296520115400316592002801470650001901498650002001517650001401537650002301551650001501574650001401589650002201603650001101625700001401636700002301650700001801673700002201691700002401713700002701737700002801764773014301792856007401935852000902009655001202018IND60641812820221121194515.0190506e20160802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064181282DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta03669d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Qi14aThe quantum mechanics derived atomistic mechanism underlying the acceleration of catalytic CO oxidation on Pt(110) by surface acoustic waves  ap. 12036-12045.  aExperimental evidence that surface acoustic waves (SAW) can significantly enhance the rate of catalytic oxidation of CO to CO₂ over the Pt(110) catalyst surface [S. Kelling et al., Faraday Disc., 1997, 107, 435–444] is examined using quantum mechanics (QM) simulations. First we determined the QM based mechanism for the O₂-rich régime of the reaction, and the energy landscape of CO interacting with an O-covered reconstructed Pt(110) surface at both static and dynamic levels, but in the absence of SAW. We then utilized ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations to determine how SAW might modify the kinetics. We focus here on the short (picosecond time scale) shock spikes induced by switching of domains in the piezoelectric driver on which the catalyst is deposited. We find that SAW-induced spikes promote dynamic changes in the diffusion and desorption, from which we estimate the influence of SAW on CO oxidation rate over Pt(110). We find good agreement with the experimentally observed catalytic enhancement by SAW. With an atomistic mechanism in place one can now consider how to use SAW to enhance other catalytic reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3aoxidation 3aquantum mechanics 3asounds1 aQian, Jin1 aNielsen, Robert R.1 aSementa, Luca1 aBarcaro, Giovanni1 aNegreiros, Fabio R.1 aFortunelli, Alessandro1 aGoddard III, William A.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Aug. 2, v. 4, no. 31 p.12036-12045dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta03669d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01544naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013900159300002000298520032600318592002800644650001500672650001900687650002600706650001300732650001200745650001200757650001300769650001400782650002200796700001800818700001600836700001700852700001600869700001600885700001800901773014400919856007401063852000901137655001201146IND60641812920221121194542.0190506e20160726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064181292DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta03675a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianqiang10aRational synthesis of a novel 3,3,5-c polyhedral metal–organic framework with high thermal stability and hydrogen storage capability  ap. 11630-11634.  aBy using a functionalized ligand strategy, a novel (3,3,5)-c polyhedron-based metal–organic framework (GDMU-2) with high thermal stability has been constructed.

We have identified four different HCN paralogs/isoforms in the goldfish Carassius auratus (CaHCN1, CaHCN2b, CaHCN4a and CaHCN4b) as likely candidates to contribute to renal, branchial and intestinal acid-base and ammonia regulation in this teleost. Quantitative real-time PCR showed not only high mRNA abundance of all isoforms in heart and brain, but also detectable levels (particularly of CaHCN2b and CaHCN4b) in non-excitable tissues, including gills and kidneys. In response to an internal or external acid-base and/or ammonia disturbance caused by feeding or high environmental ammonia, respectively, we observed differential and tissue-specific changes in mRNA abundance of all isoforms except CaHCN4b. Furthermore, our data suggest that the functions of specific HCN channels are supplemented by certain Rhesus glycoprotein functions to help in the protection of tissues from elevated ammonia levels, or as potential direct routes for ammonia transport in gills, kidney, and gut. The present results indicate important individual roles for each HCN isoform in response to acid-base and ammonia disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius auratus 3aammonia 3abrain 3agills 3aglycoproteins 3agoldfish 3aheart 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aintestines 3aion channels 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 0aHigh environmental ammonia 0aFeeding 0aKidney 0aGill 0aRhesus glycoprotein 0amRNA expression 0aqPCR 0aPhylogeny 0aα 0aBLASTn / x 0abp 0aCa 0acDNA 0aE 0aEF1α 0aEMBL 0a+G 0aHEA 0aHCN 0aJTT 0ak 0aMEGAX 0amRNA 0aMUSCLE 0aNCBI 0aNKA 0aPAST 0aqPCR 0aRhcg / Rhbg1 aWood, Chris M.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2020 Oct.,  Nov., v. 248-249 p.110469-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2020.1104693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245004700167300001600214520176600230592002801996650001702024650002202041650001002063650001202073650002702085650001102112650002502123700002502148773011302173856008202286852000902368655001202377IND60575242520221119093519.0211216e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057524252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-002-0912-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibas, Carla R.10aAre all ant mosaics caused by competition?  ap. 606-611.  aIn this paper we tested the hypothesis that ant mosaics are generated and maintained by stochastic processes, against the general idea that deterministic processes, such as competition, are the main forces that structure these communities. We analysed 14 published ant mosaics, described for crops and natural forests, transforming their data in presence/absence matrices. These matrices were submitted to species co-occurrence analysis, using software that generates null models. The observed species co-occurrence index was then statistically compared to the null matrices, to test whether there is evidence for biological processes structuring the ant communities. From the 14 mosaics analysed, seven had less and one had more co-occurrence than expected by chance. In six mosaics, species co-occurrence was within the 95% limits of frequency distribution of randomized matrices. Even though the observation of ant spatial distribution, together with association indices between species pairs, have usually been interpreted as a result of negative interactions, our results show that in only 50% of the studied mosaics there is evidence for this explanation. Furthermore, there are alternative hypotheses to explain the result of less co-occurrence than expected by chance, besides the competition hypothesis. Association of ant species with resources and conditions may also explain the observed pattern, although these hypotheses are rarely exploited. In conclusion, competition may be an important process when studying assembly rules in ant communities, although it is certainly not the only process involved. The importance of other biological processes and of stochastic events has to be taken into account to explain the species distribution patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3acomputer software 3acrops 3aforests 3afrequency distribution 3amodels 3astochastic processes1 aSchoereder, José H.0 tOecologia.g2002 May, v. 131, no. 4 p.606-611dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-0912-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013900158300001800297520164800315592002801963650002701991650002102018650001902039650001502058650001102073650001902084650001702103650001502120650001902135650001702154650000902171650001302180650001902193650002202212650001902234650001602253650002102269650002002290650001402310650001402324650001002338650002102348653001902369653001502388653001702403653001502420653002102435700001702456700001802473700002002491700001802511700002002529700002602549700002002575700001702595700001702612773012602629856007302755852000902828655001202837IND60527846920221121173411.0160715e20140312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052784692DNAL7 a10.1021/am500159p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPak, So-yŏng,10aPhotoluminescent Green Carbon Nanodots from Food-Waste-Derived Sources: Large-Scale Synthesis, Properties, and Biomedical Applications  ap. 3365-3370.  aWe have developed a simple approach for the large-scale synthesis of water-soluble green carbon nanodots (G-dots) from many kinds of large food waste-derived sources. About 120 g of G-dots per 100 kg of food waste can be synthesized using our simple and environmentally friendly synthesis approach. The G-dots exhibit a high degree of solubility in water because of the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups around their surface. The narrow band of photoluminescence emission (400–470 nm) confirms that the size of the G-dots (∼4 nm) is small because of a similar quantum effects and emission traps on the surfaces. The G-dots have excellent photostability; their photoluminescence intensity decreases slowly (∼8%) under continuous excitation with a Xe lamp for 10 days. We carried out cell viability assay to assess the effect of cytotoxicity by introducing G-dots in cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), mouse muscle cells (C2C12), and African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7), up to a concentration of 2 mg mL–¹ for 24 h. Due to their high photostability and low cytotoxicity, these G-dots are excellent probes for in vitro bioimaging. Moreover, the byproducts (not including G-dots) of G-dot synthesis from large food-waste derived sources promoted the growth and development of seedlings germinated on 3DW-supplemented gauze. Because of the combined advantages of green synthesis, high aqueous stability, high photostability, and low cytotoxicity, the G-dots show considerable promise in various areas, including biomedical imaging, solution state optoelectronics, and plant seed germination and/or growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopithecus aethiops 3aChinese hamsters 3aanimal ovaries 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afood waste 3aimage analysis 3akidney cells 3amice 3amyocytes 3ananotechnology 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotostability 3aplant ovary 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asynthesis 3atraps 3awater solubility 0acarbon nanodot 0afood waste 0acytotoxicity 0abioimaging 0aseed germination1 aLee, Hyun Uk1 aPark, Eun Sik1 aLee, Soon Chang1 aLee, Jae-won,1 aJeong, Soon Woo1 aKim, Chiq(Chi Hyun),1 aLee, Young-Chul1 aHuh, Yun Suk1 aLee, Jouhahn0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Mar. 12, v. 6, no. 5 p.3365-3370dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am500159p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04436naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245021400182520272300396592002803119650001603147650002003163650002103183650001303204650000903217650001503226650003103241650001503272650001303287650001803300650001603318650002703334650001203361650001303373650001903386650001103405650003903416650002903455653002003484653002003504653002303524653002503547653001603572700001903588700002203607700001903629700002603648700002203674773009903696856009003795852000903885655001203894IND60704555320221123030017.0210909e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070455532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Rijn, Christian A.10aAtlantic salmon (Salmo salar) exposed to different preparatory photoperiods during smoltification show varying responses in gill Na+/K+-ATPase, salinity-specific mRNA transcription and ionocyte differentiation  aControl of the parr-smolt transformation (or smoltification) is crucial for the husbandry and successful seawater (SW) transfer of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reared in freshwater (FW) hatcheries. Photoperiod is an important environmental signal that initiates the complex physiological, morphological and behavioural changes that coincide with marine migration. While the use of long-day photoperiods to initiate smoltification has been well studied, this study investigated how three preparatory photoperiods in FW (LD 08:16, LD 12:12, LD 16:08) preceding exposure to 24-h light (LD 24:0) may influence or enhance smolt performance and growth post-SW transfer. After the photoperiod treatment phase (8 weeks), all groups were exposed to LD 24:0 for 8 weeks (FW) and then transferred to SW for a further 8 weeks. Exposure to LD 16:08 induced rapid development of smolt-related characteristics such as increased gill NKA activity, gill NKAα1b mRNA, and plasma cortisol, and decreased gill NKAα1a mRNA levels and condition factor through the 8-week treatment phase. Subsequent exposure to a LD 24:0 photoperiod resulted in a partial reversal of several of these characteristics, suggesting these fish went through a partial desmoltification. Exposure to LD 12:12 for 8 weeks prior to LD 24:0 elicited an intermediary response in smoltification attributes compared to LD 16:08 and LD 08:16. The LD 12:12 group adapted to SW and showed no negative effects on growth or physiological responses after transfer to SW. Exposure to a shortened photoperiod (LD 08:16) did not elicit any smoltification-related changes prior to LD 24:0, however, exposure to LD 24:0 increased gill NKA activity, plasma cortisol, changes in NKAα1a and NKAα1b mRNA, and the ratio of NKAα1b: NKAα1a. These results were confirmed by the expected changes in NKAα1a and NKAα 1b-positive immuno-reactive gill ionocytes. In summary, after exposure to LD 24:0 fish in the LD 08:16 group showed similar levels of change to those of the LD 16:08 group during the initial FW phase (prior to exposure to LD 24:0). After SW transfer, all groups were able to upregulate SW-specific NKAα1b mRNA and acclimate to SW, even though no increase in cortisol was evident. By the end of the study, there was no difference in SW growth among the groups. Overall, our data indicate that LD 16:08 advanced hypoosmoregulatory characteristics prior to LD 24:0 exposure. In addition, the physiological and molecular indicators measured in this group suggest that fish could have been transferred to SW immediately after 8 weeks in LD 16:08, with no added benefit of successive exposure to LD 24:0, which is typically used by industry to induce smoltification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3abehavior change 3acondition factor 3acortisol 3afish 3afreshwater 3agene expression regulation 3ahatcheries 3aindustry 3amessenger RNA 3aphotoperiod 3aphysiological response 3arearing 3aseawater 3asmoltification 3asodium 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase 3atranscription (genetics) 0aAtlantic salmon 0aGene expression 0aGill Na+/K+-ATPase 0aImmunohistochemistry 0aPhotoperiod1 aJones, Paul L.1 aSchultz, Aaron G.1 aEvans, Brad S.1 aMcCormick, Stephen D.1 aAfonso, Luis O.B.0 tAquaculture.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 529 p.735744-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014600173500001900319520100600338592002801344650000801372650002101380650001201401650001501413650001301428650001301441650001101454650001401465650001801479650003001497650001401527650003101541653002501572653002601597653002401623653002001647653002601667653001801693700002401711700002801735700006401763773011501827856008501942852000902027655001202036IND60674297120221118021934.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067429712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarros, Gerlane S.10aApplication of an entropy-based computational strategy to identify genomic markers for molecular detection and typing of human papillomavirus  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a diverse group of double-stranded DNA viruses that present high tropism for the epithelium and infect keratinocytes. Currently, over 200 viral types have been identified, and almost 40 types preferentially infect the epithelial cells of the genital tract. Infections caused by HPV are the most prevalent viral infections that are sexually transmitted in the world. Given how HPV infection is one of the key factors in the development of cervical cancer, we need to develop more effective diagnostic methods to correctly diagnose patients. The significance of our research is that we have developed and applied a novel computational approach based on entropy to identify phylogenetically informative genomic regions that could be used as markers for the detection and typing of HPV. We have demonstrated that our strategy is capable of finding phylogenetically informative L1 regions to design a primer set that can be used to accurately detect and genotype HPV isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPapillomaviridae 3aentropy 3aepithelium 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ahumans 3ainfection 3akeratinocytes 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aphylogeny 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0aHuman papillomavirus 0aInformational entropy 0aMolecular detection 0aGenomic markers 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aPrimer design1 aAraujo, Edilaine D.1 aSantos, Fernanda L.S.G.1 aBatista, Marcus V.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4745-89190 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Jan., v. 77 p.104048-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245015100216506007600367520109300443592002801536506003701564650002401601650002401625650002601649650002301675650001301698650001701711650002301728650001101751650002901762650001501791650001501806650001401821650001501835650002701850650002001877650001701897650002101914650002701935651001401962653001401976653001501990653001702005653001902022653002102041700002802062700002102090700001902111700002202130700001902152773011202171856008502283852000902368655001202377IND60643114720221207110414.0191223e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064311472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parepi.2019.e001102doi7 aPMC65818752pmcid7 a312364882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Bravo, Andrea10aHigh effectiveness of an adulticide-larvicide formulation for field control of sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in the city of Clorinda, Argentina  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Argentina, Leishmania infantum (syn.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and residual effect of two commercial insecticide formulations, one with permethrin and pyriproxyfen as active ingredients (Dragon Max®) and the other with only permethrin (Flop®) for the control of sandflies. Both formulations were applied in chicken coops and other surroundings structures of the peridomicile of urban houses in Clorinda, Formosa (Argentina). Entomological monitoring was carried out weekly for 44 weeks after the intervention. The results showed great effectiveness and residual effect up to 21 weeks post-intervention for Dragon Max®. This result could be explained by the excellent larvicidal activity of the Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) pyriproxyfen against the immature forms of phlebotomines and by the delay on the restoration of the natural threshold of the vector population in treated sites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania donovani 3aLeishmania infantum 3aLutzomyia longipalpis 3aactive ingredients 3achickens 3aepidemiology 3aetiological agents 3ahumans 3ainsect growth regulators 3alarvicides 3amonitoring 3aparasites 3apermethrin 3apesticide formulations 3apoultry housing 3apyriproxyfen 3aresidual effects 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aArgentina 0aSandflies 0aPermethrin 0aPyriproxyfen 0aVector control 0aLong-term effect1 aAlvarez-Costa, Agustín1 aFronza, Georgina1 aAbril, Marcelo1 aZerba, Eduardo N.1 aJuan, Laura W.0 tParasite epidemiology and control.g2019 Nov., v. 7 p.e00110-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23217x2405-67317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2019.e001103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245008400161500001900245520139100264592002801655650002301683650001401706650001401720650001801734650002701752650003101779653002101810653001201831653000901843653001001852653000901862653000901871700001501880700001701895700001201912700001701924700001301941700002001954700001401974700001901988700001802007700001602025700001802041773011502059856008502174852000902259655001202268IND60674297220221118021735.0200210e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067429722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Bo12aA comparison of genotyping tool in Treponema pallidum: Review and meta-analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo decipher the molecular epidemiology of the Treponema pallidum subspecies, pallidum, researchers have developed different molecular typing schemes which identify strains type from clinical specimens. However, the results of these studies show remarkable diversity.We searched for literature in PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Sciences, and OVID from January 1998 to January 2019, in order to compare the efficiency of typing schemes using published evidence for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.From the 43 studies included, the overall typing efficiency of Treponema pallidum was 71.4% (95% CI: 63.2–78.9%). Subgroup analyses indicated that the typing efficiency of CDC-typing (CDCT, 68.2%, 95% CI: 53.6–81.2%) was worse than those of enhanced CDC-typing (ECDCT, 72.3%, 95% CI: 60–83.1%), CDC-rspA (81.6%, 95% CI: 76.1–86.6%), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST, 67.1%, 95% CI: 61.1–72.7), and sequencing-based molecular typing (SBMT, 71.6%, 95% CI: 50–89.2%). A limitation of this review is that the studies included employed different criteria to collect and investigate samples of Treponema pallidum, which could contribute to heterogeneity.This analysis suggests that CDCT is an inferior scheme in molecular typing, the discriminatory power was very similar for ECDCT and SBMT. Other factors contributing to the heterogeneity between typing studies warrants further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTreponema pallidum 3aevolution 3ainfection 3ameta-analysis 3amolecular epidemiology 3amultilocus sequence typing 0aMolecular typing 0aSubtype 0aCDCT 0aECDCT 0aSBMT 0aMLST1 aLi, Huahua1 aZhao, Yulong1 aLi, Wei1 aZhao, Feijun1 aYu, Jian1 aLiu, Shuangquan1 aZhao, Tie1 aXiao, Yongjian1 aLi, Changqing1 aCao, Longgu1 aZeng, Tiebing0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Mar., v. 78 p.104049-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015300172300001400325520163300339592002801972650001202000650002002012650002402032650001502056650001302071650002302084650001502107651001002122653001602132653002302148653002902171653002402200700001802224700006002242700001802302700003602320773009502356856008402451852000902535655001202544IND60643114820221122054841.0190705e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064311482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cliser.2019.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGbangou, Talardia10aSeasonal variability and predictability of agro-meteorological indices: Tailoring onset of rainy season estimation to meet farmers’ needs in Ghana  ap. 19-30.  aReliable information on onset of the rainy season is important for local agriculture planning in Ghana. We examine the (i) trend and variability of onset in local observations to better understand the need for onset forecast information and (ii) performance of ECMWF System 4 seasonal climate forecast in reproducing this variability and discriminating tercile categories of onset dates across Ghana. The analyses focused on two pilots locations of interest among the fourteen synoptic stations studied, namely Ada and Tamale located in the coastal savanna and in northern Ghana. Two different onset date definitions were tested to suite with uncorrected and bias-corrected forecasts in order to test the predictability. The definitions were tailored to suit with forecast start dates, local climate data availability and cropping calendar. Results show a significant decreasing trend in historical onset dates towards more recent times (i.e 1986–2010) at Tamale station. Also, historical onset dates exhibit a significant increasing variability towards more recent time at Ada station. System 4 shows some ability for reproducing local onset variability with significant correlational relationship between forecasted and observed onset dates at some locations including Ada station. The forecasting system also has significant skill in predicting early and late onset dates categories (i.e H-K score > 0) at the pilot stations. In conclusion, the use of onset agro-meteorological index, based on System 4 as climate service in Ghana, has a potential value for decision making when considering categorical based forecasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adecision making 3ameteorological data 3aprediction 3asavannas 3aseasonal variation 3awet season 3aGhana 0aOnset dates 0aSeasonal forecasts 0aInter-annual variability 0aForecast categories1 aLudwig, Fulco1 avan Slobbe, Erik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0499-22811 aHoàng, Long,1 aGordana Kranjac-Berisavljevic, 0 tClimate services.g2019 Apr., v. 14 p.19-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23241x2405-88077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2019.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011500169300001600284520149100300592002801791650001301819650001101832650001901843650001001862650001401872650002301886650001701909650003101926650001101957650001401968650001101982650001401993650001402007650000902021650003502030700002002065773011302085856008202198852000902280655001202289IND60575242820221118014631.0211216e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057524282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-002-0899-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadkarni, Nalini,10aPotential effects of climate change on canopy communities in a tropical cloud forest: an experimental approach  ap. 580-586.  aGlobal climate change models predict reduced cloud water in tropical montane forests. To test the effects of reduced cloud water on epiphytes, plants that are tightly coupled to atmospheric inputs, we transplanted epiphytes and their arboreal soil from upper cloud forest trees to trees at slightly lower elevations that are naturally exposed to less cloud water. Control plants moved between trees within the upper site showed no transplantation effects, but experimental plants at lower sites had significantly higher leaf mortality, lower leaf production, and reduced longevity. After the epiphytes died, seedlings of terrestrial gap-colonizing tree species grew from the seed banks within the residual mats of arboreal soil. Greenhouse experiments confirmed that the death of epiphytes can result in radical compositional changes of canopy communities. Thus, tropical montane epiphyte communities constitute both a potentially powerful tool for detecting climate changes and a rich arena to study plant/soil/seed interactions under natural and manipulated conditions. This study also provides experimental evidence that the potential effects of global climate change on canopy and terrestrial communities can be significant for cloud forest biota. Results suggest there will be negative effects on the productivity and longevity of particular epiphytes and a subsequent emergence of an emerging terrestrial component into the canopy community from a previously suppressed seed bank.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3adeath 3aepiphytes 3aforest communities 3aforest trees 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaves 3alongevity 3amodels 3amortality 3aseedlings 3asoil 3atropical montane cloud forests1 aSolano, Rodrigo0 tOecologia.g2002 May, v. 131, no. 4 p.580-586dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-0899-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007400173520136900247592002801616650001201644650001901656650001901675650002501694650001101719650002401730650002501754650001401779650002201793651001101815653001601826653002501842653002401867653002501891653001301916700002701929700006901956700003002025700002402055700003102079700003302110700003102143700003402174700004102208700002102249700006702270773013002337856008502467961000902552852000902561655001202570IND60726072720221120045345.0211003e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072607272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1016712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Salas, Dora10aMolecular detection of Theileria equi in horses from Veracruz, Mexico  aEquine piroplasmosis is a tropical parasitic disease caused by several intraerythrocytic members of the genera Babesia and Theileria. These pathogens are transmitted by multiple tick species and are considered as important exotic microorganisms in several countries. Equine piroplasmosis causes significant economic losses due to abortions, decreased activity and even death of equines, making surveillance of these infectious disease essential. In the northern and eastern parts of Mexico, few molecular and serological reports have been made on the presence and exposure of horse to these agents. For this reason, the aim of the current work was to perform a molecular detection study of Babesia and Theileria in equines from the state of Veracruz, Mexico. A total of 100 whole blood samples were tested. Chelex-100 resin was used for DNA extraction and a fragment of 459 bp of the 18S rRNA gene of members of the genera Babesia/Theileria were identified. Of the 100 samples analysed, 18 tested positive for Babesia/Theileria, resulting in a prevalence of 18 %. Identity analyses and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that all samples were infected with Theileria equi. This work represents the first molecular record of Babesia/Theileria in equines from the state of Veracruz, Mexico, and demonstrates the endemicity of T. equi in this region of the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia 3aTheileria equi 3ablood sampling 3aequine piroplasmosis 3ahorses 3amicrobial detection 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3atropical diseases 3aMexico 0aPiroplasmid 0aEquine piroplasmosis 0aTick-borne pathogen 0aVector-borne disease 0a18S-rRNA1 aSolis-Cortés, Marlene1 aZazueta-Islas, Héctor M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5106-087X1 aFlores-Vásquez, Fernanda1 aCruz-Romero, Anabel1 aAguilar-Domínguez, Mariel1 aSalguero Romero, José Luis,1 ade León, Adalberto Pérez1 aFernández-Figueroa, Edith A.1 aLammoglia-Villagómez, Miguel Ángel1 aBecker, Ingeborg1 aSánchez-Montes, Sokani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6316-21870 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2021 May, v. 12, no. 3 p.101671-dElsevier GmbHaElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1016713Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007500171300001800246520122000264592002801484650001101512650000701523650000901530650002701539650001201566650002001578650001201598650002701610650001801637650001601655653001201671653002001683653003801703700001601741700002801757700002101785700001701806773013001823856008101953852000902034655001202043IND60540030320221123032612.0190318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054003032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2014.05.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonnell, Ciara K.14aThe use of pulsed electric fields for accelerating the salting of pork  ap. 1054-1060.  aThe efficiency of PEF as a pre-treatment for accelerating the salting (175 kg/m3 NaCl) of pork was assessed through PEF treatments of varying energy densities (22.6–181.1 kJ/kg). This was achieved through a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design of field strength (1.2 or 2.3 kV/cm), frequency (100 or 200 Hz) and pulse number (150 or 300 pulses). NaCl and water content (kg/kg) acted as indicators for increased saline diffusion. Weight change, pH, cook loss, water-binding capacity (WBC) and texture profiles were also assessed. PEF at 2.3 kV/cm caused greater weight loss than 1.2 kV/cm (p < 0.05). Two treatments (1.2 or 2.3 kV/cm at 100 Hz for 300 pulses) increased the NaCl content of samples (p < 0.05) above the control. A similar trend was evident for cook loss whereby an interaction of 100 Hz and 300 pulses gave the highest value. Within PEF treatments, 100 Hz resulted in greater water content than 200 Hz (p < 0.05). There was no significant effect of PEF on weight change post-curing, WBC or texture profiles of samples. Theses findings indicate that a potential may exist for reduced curing time through PEF, however further work on the optimisation of treatment parameters is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3apH 3apork 3apulsed electric fields 3asalting 3asodium chloride 3atexture 3awater binding capacity 3awater content 3aweight loss 0aSalting 0aElectroporation 0aPulsed electric fields processing1 aAllen, Paul1 aChardonnereau, Fanny S.1 aArimi, Joshua M.1 aLyng, James,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2014 Dec., v. 59, no. 2 p.1054-1060dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2014.05.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010300170300001600273520085700289592002801146650002301174650001101197650001701208650001501225650001901240650001501259650001401274650001001288650001901298650001201317651001001329653002101339653001401360653002701374700002001401700001601421700001501437773009401452856008101546852000901627655001201636IND60724892620221120091110.0210124e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072489262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aĀr̲umukam, Kā.,10aDistribution of Major and trace elements in Koppunuru area, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India  ap. 180-189.  aFrom koppunuru study area totally 58 samples were collected in 7 different boreholes, minimum depth of 28 m and Maximum depth of 157.7 m.

Strong positive correlation between Uranium and Lead (r = 0.887) suggested radiogenic nature of this system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeoproterozoic era 3abasins 3ageochemistry 3agovernance 3amineralization 3aprovenance 3aquartzite 3ashale 3atrace elements 3auranium 3aIndia 0aPalnad sub-basin 0aKoppunuru 0aUranium mineralization1 aSrinivasalu, S.1 aPurvaja, R.1 aRamesh, R.0 tData in Brief.g2018 June, v. 18 p.180-189dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011600156300001800272500001500290520118400305592002801489650001901517650001401536650000901550650001701559650000901576650001501585650002401600650001501624650001301639650001301652650002301665650002501688653001701713653001901730653002601749653002301775653001701798653001701815700001801832700002501850700001901875700001701894700001701911700001901928773012601947856007302073852000902146655001202155IND60527847320221121173435.0160715e20140312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052784732DNAL7 a10.1021/am500269t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Jungmok10aHighly Fluorescent Conjugated Polyelectrolyte for Protein Sensing and Cell-Compatible Chemosensing Applications  ap. 3305-3311.  a2019-12-06  aUsing a highly fluorescent, water-soluble polymer derived from a triazine-bridged copolymer (DTMSPV), we explored the tunable fluorescence properties of the water-soluble DTMSPV by solvent polarity to function as a fluorescence sensory probe for protein sensing. The green-blue fluorescence from DTMSPV was significantly enhanced in the presence of bovine serum albumin through hydrophobic interactions. Meanwhile, complete quenching of the fluorescence from DTMSPV occurred in the presence of hemoglobin through iron complexation with the polyelectrolyte. In addition, the DTMSPVs were highly fluorescent and permeated into living mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), enabling effective imaging of the MSCs. This permeation into stem cells is crucial to the detection of Al³⁺ in living MSCs. The interaction between the triazine units in DTMSPV with the Al³⁺ ions allows for the detection of Al³⁺ in living cells. Thus, a strong fluorescence from living MSCs pretreated with DTMSPV was quenched as a function of the Al³⁺ concentration, confirming that DTMSPV is a cell-permeable fluorescent polymer that can function as a versatile probe to detect Al³⁺ in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3atriazines 3aions 3afluorescence 3airon 3ahemoglobin 3ahydrophobic bonding 3astem cells 3aaluminum 3asolvents 3acomposite polymers 3abovine serum albumin 0aelectrolytes 0aprotein sensor 0awater-soluble polymer 0aconjugated polymer 0achemosensing 0acell imaging1 aPark, Teahoon1 aKim, David Junghoon,1 aHeo, June Seok1 aKim, Han-su,1 aKim, Hyun Ok1 aKim, Eunkyoung0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Mar. 12, v. 6, no. 5 p.3305-3311dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am500269t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007000160300001800230520141100248592002801659650002001687650001201707650001101719650002501730650001301755650001401768650001201782650001701794650002501811650000901836650001001845650001601855651001201871700002401883700002901907700002401936773013701960856007302097852000902170655001202179IND60515854620221118182155.0160321e20120822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051585462DNAL7 a10.1139/x2012-1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinkral, Alex J.10aEstimating consumption and remaining carbon in burned slash piles  ap. 1744-1749.  aFuel reduction treatments to reduce fire risk have become commonplace in the fire adapted forests of western North America. These treatments generate significant woody debris, or slash, and burning this material in piles is a common and inexpensive approach to reducing fuel loads. Although slash pile burning is a common practice, there is little information on consumption or even a common methodology for estimating consumption. As considerations of carbon storage and emissions from forests increase, better means of quantifying burn piles are necessary. This study uses two methods, sector sampling and a form of line intersect sampling, for estimating both the percent consumption and conversion to charcoal in slash piles of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson) in northern Arizona, USA. On average, burning released between 92% and 94% of the carbon in each slash pile to the atmosphere and converted between 0.05 and 0.34 Mg C·ha–¹ to charcoal across the treatment area. These results demonstrate that burning slash piles converts significant quantities of carbon stored in wood to atmospheric carbon and charcoal, both of which should be considered as forest carbon accounting is further refined. Sector sampling and line intersect strategies produced similar estimates of consumption; however, the line intersect protocol was more easily and rapidly implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus ponderosa 3aburning 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acharcoal 3aemissions 3aforests 3afuel loading 3afuels (fire ecology) 3arisk 3aslash 3astored wood 3aArizona1 aEvans, Alexander M.1 aSorensen, Christopher D.1 aAffleck, David L.R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2012 Aug. 22, v. 42, no. 9 p.1744-1749dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x2012-1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014700158300001800305520174900323592002802072650001402100650001002114650002102124650001502145650001002160650001002170650001802180650001102198650001702209650001302226650001402239650002202253650002402275650001202299650001302311700002102324700001802345700001802363773014202381856007402523852000902597655001202606IND60641813620221117231340.0190506e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064181362DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta03729a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Jiyuan10aIn situ formation of NiO on Ni foam prepared with a novel leaven dough method as an outstanding electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions  ap. 9797-9806.  aA novel leaven dough method was developed to prepare three-dimensional Ni foams, upon which a thin NiO nanostructure was grown through thermal oxidation to form NiO/Ni foams as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). This method is simple, scalable, and carries less environmental burdens, involving no cumbersome time-consuming templating procedures and adopts a new concept of “solid solvent” instead of using a large amount of solvent. In this method, nickel(ii) nitrate hexahydrate served as the Ni precursor and leavening agent, with F127 acting as a “solid solvent” and fuel. Heating the ground mixture of the nitrate and F127 powders at 80 °C led to formation of a green dough that was calcinated at 300 °C to obtain the Ni foam. The NiO/Ni foam was prepared by in situ thermal oxidation of the Ni foam and applied as an electrocatalyst for OERs. The NiO/Ni electrode fabricated from the NiO/Ni composite exhibited a remarkably low onset over-potential of 268 mV and low working over-potential of 345 mV at 10 mA cm⁻². The electrochemical kinetics of the electrode were outstanding with an ultra-small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec⁻¹ in 1 M KOH. The outstanding electrocatalytic performances of the present NiO/Ni electrode, comparable to those achieved by noble metal oxide based electrodes, can be attributed to the three-dimensionally well-connected Ni foam skeleton and the intact contact of the NiO/Ni domains, offering excellent charge transfer and transport networks. The present leaven dough method can be extended to fabricate a wide variety of metal oxide/metal foams for applications in electrochemical devices for intact functional material/current collector composite electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adough 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afoams 3afuels 3ananomaterials 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3apotassium hydroxide 3apowders 3asolvents1 aWang, Yong-Zheng1 aWang, Junjie,1 aLü, Shiyuan,0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 June 21, v. 4, no. 25 p.9797-9806dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta03729a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245010100200500001900301520192700320592002802247650002202275650001302297650001102310650001202321650002002333650001402353650001602367650003002383650001502413650001302428650002602441650001302467650001302480650002202493650001202515650001002527651001102537653002602548653002602574653002502600653002002625653002302645700001502668700001702683773011302700856008202813852000902895655001202904IND60701627720221117195007.0200913e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070162772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2020.1261122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuech, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2192-971910aCharacterising the diversity and spatial differentiation of crop managements at a regional scale  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChanges in agricultural land use over recent decades have exacerbated the pressures and impacts of agriculture on the environment. Researchers model these pressures and impacts using data on soils, climate and agricultural land use characteristics, which have to be represented at the spatial and temporal scales appropriate to the ecological or biophysical processes being studied. Representation of agricultural land use across large areas (several thousand of km2 or more) is hampered by lack of data on the diversity of farming practices and their spatial distribution, usually reduced to land cover. We propose in this article a methodological approach for combining generic and local information sources to characterise, across a large area, the diversity of crop managements and their spatial distribution, at a resolution appropriate to a specific environmental issue: assessment of nitrate contamination of groundwater. The approach involves four steps: (i) devise a system of spatial units that is appropriate to the research context and the available information sources, (ii) use multivariate analysis to characterise the diversity of crop managements obtained from a national database, (iii) conduct a survey, holding semi-directive interviews with experts and local actors to identify specific features that may locally modify this diversity, (iv) synthesise the statistical findings and survey results to establish a set of representative crop management "types". Illustrated in connection with the problem of diffuse nitrogen pollution of groundwater in the Seine-Normandie basin in France, it enabled to describe 919 crop managements out of the 18 main crops in the basin and especially highlighted the high diversity of practices on wheat with more than 200 crop managements. The knowledge produced on the diversity of crop managements and their spatial distribution was used for environmental modelling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagronomy 3abasins 3aclimate 3acrop management 3adatabases 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aland cover 3aland use 3amultivariate analysis 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aspatial variation 3asurveys 3awheat 3aFrance 0aCrop farming practice 0aAgricultural practice 0aSpatial distribution 0aLocal knowledge 0aNational databases1 aSchott, C.1 aMignolet, C.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2020 Oct., v. 120 p.126112-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2020.1261123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245015600162520099400318592002801312650001601340650002101356650002001377650001901397650004201416650001201458650002601470650001901496650001501515650001401530650002501544650000901569650001101578650001501589650002501604653002001629653001901649653003601668653001501704700001901719700001501738700005501753700001601808700002001824700001401844700002101858700001601879700002801895773011001923856008402033852000902117655001202126IND60643115120221122045833.0200128e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064311512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2019.1002092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yi10aEffective removal of methyl siloxane from water by sewage activated sludge microbes: biodegradation behavior and characteristics of microbial community  aCurrent approaches of polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) treatment mostly rely on transferring from the liquid phase to other phases (gas and solid), leaving secondary pollution risks. In this study, biodegradation of PDMS in wastewater was found with activated sludge collected from real wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The highest biodegradation rates of dodecamethylpentasiloxane (L5) and tetradecamethylhexasiloxane (L6) reached up to 58.3% and 21.4% within 5-day anaerobic incubation at 37 °C under shaking at 100 rpm. Moreover, the microbial communities were investigated by using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of 16S-rRNA, which pointed Clostridium spp. as a potential candidate responsible for the biodegradation of PDMS under anaerobic condition. Notably, this is the first report of effective biodegradation of PDMS by microbes in activated sludge.

One of the most cultivated tomato landraces in different montane areas in Spain is the ‘Moruno’ type, a savory fruit much appreciated by consumers for its dark color and organoleptic attributes, but with a short postharvest storage, or low yield in some locations (Moreno et al., 2019). Like many tomato landraces, ‘Moruno’ cultivars are highly susceptible to several viruses, such as Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) (Cebolla-Cornejo et al., 2007), Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) (Gómez et al., 2012), Tomato torrado virus (ToTV) (Verbeek et al., 2007) or Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) (Juárez et al., 2019). A breeding program for introgressing resistance to ToMV, TSWV, and TYLCV into several tomato landraces has been carried out over the past 20 years at Miguel Hernández University (Orihuela, Spain) (Carbonell et al., 2018). The breeding line UMH1209, homozygous for Tm-2a, Ty-1, and Sw-5 genes, and UMH1155, homozygous for Tm-2a and Sw-5 genes, are the first releases obtained within the ‘Moruno’ tomato type in the Escuela Politécnica Superior Orihuela-Universidad Miguel Hernández breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPepino mosaic virus 3aTomato leaf curl New Delhi virus 3aTomato mosaic virus 3aTomato torrado virus 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3acolor 3acultivars 3afruits 3ahomozygosity 3aintrogression 3alandraces 3apostharvest storage 3asavory 3atomatoes 3aviruses 3aSpain 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0aToMV 0aTSWV 0aTYLCV 0aTm-2a gene 0aSw-5 gene 0aTy-1 gene1 aGrau, Adrián1 aAlonso, Aranzazu1 aCarbonell, Pedro1 aSalinas, Juan Francisco1 aCabrera, José Ángel1 aRuiz, Juan J.0 tHortScience.g2020 June, v. 55, no. 6 p.959-960dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:1941x2327-98347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI14711-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011200162300001600274520223300290592002802523650001702551650001702568650002102585650001502606650002002621650002002641650001502661650001702676650001902693650003102712650001302743650002102756650002302777650002102800650001002821650003702831651001102868651001202879651001202891651001302903651001502916700001802931700001402949700001702963700001402980773011302994856008203107961000903189852000903198655001203207IND60575243020221118014845.0211216e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057524302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-002-0931-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurton, A.10aRoot respiration in North American forests: effects of nitrogen concentration and temperature across biomes  ap. 559-568.  aRoot respiration rates have been shown to be correlated with temperature and root N concentration in studies of individual forest types or species, but it is not known how universal these relationships are across forest species adapted to widely different climatic and edaphic conditions. In order to test for broad, cross-species relationships, we measured fine root respiration, as O₂ consumption, over a range of temperatures on excised root samples from ten forested study sites across North America in 1997. Significant differences existed among study sites in root respiration rates, with patterns among sites in respiration rate at a given temperature corresponding to differences among sites in fine root N concentrations. Root respiration rates were highly correlated with root N concentrations at all measurement temperatures (r ²>0.81, P<0.001, for 6, 18 and 24°C). Lower root respiration rates in gymnosperms than in angiosperms were largely explained by lower fine root N concentrations in gymnosperms, and root N concentrations and respiration rates (at a given temperature) tended to be lower at warm sites (New Mexico, Florida, and Georgia) than at cool sites with short growing seasons (Michigan and Alaska). Root respiration rates increased exponentially with temperature at all sites. The Q ₁₀ for root respiration ranged from 2.4 to 3.1, but there were no significant differences among the forest types. The average Q ₁₀s for gymnosperms (Q ₁₀=2.7) and angiosperms (Q ₁₀=2.6) were almost identical, as were the average Q ₁₀s for roots of ectomycorrhizal species (Q ₁₀=2.7) and arbuscular mycorrhizal species (Q ₁₀=2.6). In 1998, fine root respiration at the study sites was measured in the field as CO₂ production at ambient soil temperature. Respiration rates under field conditions were dependent on both ambient soil temperature and root N concentration. Relationships between respiration (adjusted for temperature) and root N concentration for the field measurements were similar to those observed in the 1997 laboratory experiments. For root respiration in tree species, it appears that basic relationships with temperature and nitrogen exist across species and biomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aGymnospermae 3acell respiration 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3aedaphic factors 3afine roots 3aforest types 3agrowing season 3alaboratory experimentation 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen consumption 3asoil temperature 3atrees 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aAlaska 3aFlorida 3aGeorgia 3aMichigan 3aNew Mexico1 aPregitzer, K.1 aRuess, R.1 aHendrick, R.1 aAllen, M.0 tOecologia.g2002 May, v. 131, no. 4 p.559-568dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-0931-73Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007400169300001200243520227800255592002802533650001102561650002002572650000902592650002002601650001302621650001302634650001502647650001802662653000802680653000802688653000802696653000802704653000702712653000802719653000802727653000802735653000902743653000802752653000802760653001002768653002202778653001702800700002802817700001702845700003002862700002202892773009002914856008103004852000903085655001203094IND60724892820221120095157.0210124e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072489282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraccia, Clarissa12aA new SWATH ion library for mouse adult hippocampal neural stem cells  ap. 1-8.  aOver the last years, the SWATH data-independent acquisition protocol (Sequential Window acquisition of All THeoretical mass spectra) has become a cornerstone for the worldwide proteomics community (Collins et al., 2017) [1]. In this approach, a high-resolution quadrupole-ToF mass spectrometer acquires thousands of MS/MS data by selecting not just a single precursor at a time, but by allowing a broad m/z range to be fragmented. This acquisition window is then sequentially moved from the lowest to the highest mass selection range. This technique enables the acquisition of thousands of high-resolution MS/MS spectra per minute in a standard LC–MS run. In the subsequent data analysis phase, the corresponding dataset is searched in a “triple quadrupole-like” mode, thus not considering the whole MS/MS scan spectrum, but by searching for several precursor to fragment transitions that identify and quantify the corresponding peptide. This search is made possible with the use of an ion library, previously acquired in a classical data dependent, full-spectrum mode (Fabre et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017) [2,3]. The SWATH protocol, combining the protein identification power of high-resolution MS/MS spectra with the robustness and accuracy in analyte quantification of triple-quad targeted workflows, has become very popular in proteomics research. The major drawback lies in the ion library itself, which is normally demanding and time-consuming to build. Conversely, through the realignment of chromatographic retention times, an ion library of a given proteome can relatively easily be tailored upon “any” proteomics experiment done on the same proteome. We are thus hereby sharing with the worldwide proteomics community our newly acquired ion library of mouse adult hippocampal neural stem cells. Given the growing effort in neuroscience research involving proteomics experiments (Pons-Espinal et al., 2017; Sarnyai and Guest, 2017; Sethi et al., 2015; Bramini et al., 2016) [4,5–7], we believe that this data might be of great help for the neuroscience community.

A Study of the Reactions in the System K-Nb-S Using Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Infrared Spectroscopy, and X-Ray Powder Diffraction  ap. 1382-1386.  aThe reactions of potassium polysulfides with elemental Nb were investigated with different analytical techniques. The amount of the polysulfide applied has no influence onto product formation, i. e. the ratio K₂Sₓ: Nb is not important. The length of the polsysulfide chain, i. e. the value of x in K₂Sₓ determines what product is formed. In sulfur-poor melts, K₃NbS₄ is observed. Increasing x to 5 - 6, K₄Nb₂S₁₁ is formed with a structure containing S₂²⁻ anions. Finally, applying a melt with x > 6, K6Nb4S25 is found as the product with a crystal structure containing the S₅²⁻ polysulfide anion. When K₂Sₓ (x < 5) is heated with sulfur in the first step the pentasulfide K₂S₅ is formed. Immediately after melting of K₂S₅ a reaction with elemental Nb occurs. The results of FT-IR and X-ray investigations have demonstrated that after oxidation the anion [Nb₂S₁₁]⁴⁻ is formed relatively fast, and after a short time crystalline K₄Nb₂S₁₁ can be detected. After 24 h the reaction is complete.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanions 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amelting 3aoxidation 3apotassium 3asulfur 0aAlkalimetal Niobium Polychalcogenides 0aInfrared Spectroscopy 0aDifferential Scanning Calorimetry1 aBensch, Wolfgang0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 57, no. 12 p.1382-1386dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2002-12073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245012200170520144600292592002801738650002801766650002401794650001801818650001501836650003301851650001501884650002301899650002501922650002401947650001901971650002001990650002502010650002502035650001202060650002402072650001802096650002002114650002802134650001402162650001402176653001902190653002302209700001802232700001602250700001802266700001602284700001802300700002002318773009902338856009002437852000902527655001202536IND60704555920221120022952.0201104e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070455592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yao-Wu10aEffectiveness assessment of plant mixtures against Ichthyophthirius multifiliis in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella  aIchthyophthirius multifiliis, a ciliated parasite, results in “white spot disease” of freshwater fish. The outbreak of this disease causes a significant economic loss in the aquaculture industry. The present study aimed to screen the plants mixture with high antiparasitic efficacy against I. multifiliis and assess the toxicity of plants mixture to grass carp. The screening study indicated that ethanol extracts of Cynanchum atratum, Psoralea corylifolia, Zingiber officinale, Sophora flavescens, Homalomena occulta, Curcuma longa, and Morus alba showed antiparasitic efficacy against I. multifiliis. Twenty-one combinations composed of every two of the seven plants were prepared to investigate their additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects as well as indifference using the checkerboard arrays method. Nine combinations with synergistic and additive effects were screened for the further in vitro, in vivo, and acute toxicity experiments. Finally, combination 4 (Com 4) containing C. atratum and S. flavescens showed high efficacy in treating grass carp infected with I. multifiliis. Com 4 at a concentration of 6 mg/L with a continuous usage for 10 days cured the infected grass carp. The 96 h median lethal concentration (LC₅₀) of Com 4 to grass carp was 173.4 mg/L with a safe concentration (SC) of 47.4 mg/L. Thus, Com 4 has a low toxicity potential candidate to prevent and control I. multifiliis in grass carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aCullen corylifolium 3aCurcuma longa 3aHomalomena 3aIchthyophthirius multifiliis 3aMorus alba 3aSophora flavescens 3aVincetoxicum atratum 3aZingiber officinale 3aacute toxicity 3aadditive effect 3aantiparasitic agents 3aaquaculture industry 3aethanol 3afinancial economics 3afish diseases 3afreshwater fish 3alethal concentration 50 3aparasites 3ascreening 0aPlants mixture 0aSynergistic effect1 aGuo, Shu-Quan1 aLuo, Jia-Ju1 aSang, Chi-Guo1 aLin, De-Jie1 aLiu, Yan-Meng1 aZhang, Qi-Zhong0 tAquaculture.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 530 p.735742-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011900168520116900287592002801456650001901484650001601503650002701519650001701546650003101563650002301594650001501617650001901632650002001651650002801671650001101699650002301710650001901733650002401752650001001776650002901786653001901815653002501834653002101859653001801880653001101898653003201909700002801941700001601969700001601985700001202001700002002013700001502033700001802048700001602066700001402082773011502096856008502211852000902296655001202305IND60726073320221120045329.0211003e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072607332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1016772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, Naveed10aIdentification and evaluation of midgut protein RL12 of Dermacentor silvarum interacting with Anaplasma ovis VirD4  aAnaplasma ovis, a tick-borne intra-erythrocytic Gram-negative bacterium, is a causative agent of ovine anaplasmosis. It is known that Dermacentor ticks act as biological vectors for A. ovis. VirD4 is the machine component of Type IV Secretion System of A. ovis. To better understand the pathogen-vector interaction, VirD4 was used as a bait protein for screening midgut proteins of Dermacentor silvarum via yeast two-hybrid mating assay. As a result, a ribosomal protein RL12 was identified from the midgut cDNA library of D. silvarum. For further validation, using in vitro Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, interaction between the proteins, GST-RL12 and HIS-VirD4, was observed in Western blot analysis. The study is first of its kind reporting a D. silvarum midgut protein interaction with VirD4 from A. ovis. Functional annotations showed some important cellular processes are attributed to the protein, particularly in the stringent response and biogenesis. The results of the study suggest the involvement of the VirD4-RL12 interaction in the regulation of signaling pathways, which is a tool for understanding the pathogen-vector interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma ovis 3aDermacentor 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aanaplasmosis 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aarthropod proteins 3abiogenesis 3acDNA libraries 3adisease vectors 3aglutathione transferase 3amidgut 3aribosomal proteins 3asheep diseases 3asignal transduction 3aticks 3atype IV secretion system 0aAnaplasma ovis 0aDermacentor silvarum 0aYeast two-hybrid 0aGST pull-down 0aMidgut 0aPathogen-vector interaction1 aMukhtar, Muhammad Uzair1 aYang, Jifei1 aNiu, Qingli1 aLi, Zhi1 aZhao, Shuaiyang1 aZhao, Yaru1 aGuan, Guiquan1 aLiu, Zhijie1 aYin, Hong0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2021 May, v. 12, no. 3 p.101677-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1016773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010100157300001800258500001900276520135300295592002801648650001201676650001501688650002001703650002801723650002301751650001001774650001601784650001301800650001601813650001401829650000701843650002301850700001101873700001601884700001901900700001801919700001801937700001701955700001501972700001801987700001802005773013002023856007402153852000902227655001202236IND60699334720221119164738.0200617e20200616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069933472DNAL7 a10.1039/d0bm00295j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Mingyue12aA reduction and pH dual-sensitive nanodrug for targeted theranostics in hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 3485-3499.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSorafenib (SF) is the first drug demonstrated to improve the survival of patients diagnosed with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its clinical application is limited by the poor oral bioavailability and severe side effects. In this study, a multifunctional micellar nanodrug was developed for simultaneous HCC-targeted delivery of SF and tumor detection with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The micellar nanodrug incorporating SF and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) was prepared from a diblock copolymer of monomethoxyl poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(N-(2-aminoethanethiol-co-2-aminoethyldiisopropylamine) aspartamide) and then decorated with anti-glypican-3 antibody (AbGPC₃). Owing to the small size, weak positive charge and AbGPC₃-mediated active targeting to HCC cells, the nanodrug exhibited an easy cellular uptake and enhanced tumor accumulation. The prominent reduction and pH dual-sensitivity allowed the nanodrug to rapidly release SF inside cancer cells via responding to the cytoplasmic glutathione and lysosomal acidity. The nanodrug not only significantly improved the anticancer effects of SF in hepatoma treatment but also facilitated a noninvasive tumor detection and monitoring of in vivo drug delivery by MRI, which revealed its great potential as a promising theranostic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aantibodies 3abioavailability 3abiocompatible materials 3acomposite polymers 3adrugs 3aglutathione 3ahepatoma 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3apH 3aprecision medicine1 aLi, Bo1 aLin, Liteng1 aHuang, Jingjun1 aAn, Yongcheng1 aHuang, Wensou1 aZhou, Zhimei1 aWang, Yong1 aShuai, Xintao1 aZhu, Kangshun0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 June 16, v. 8, no. 12 p.3485-3499dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00295j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01258naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245008200160300001800242520040600260592002800666650001100694650002200705650001200727650001400739700001900753773011800772856008100890852000900971655001200980IND60550607020221122175846.0160911e20160318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055060702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b002462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aSynthetic Approaches To Construct the 6,8-DOBCO Framework in Natural Products  ap. 2203-2212.  a6,8-Dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton (6,8-DOBCO) is a very common structural motif in many biologically active natural products.

The present investigation used a combination of laboratory cultures and field surveys at three large estuarine systems in that region to examine toxin retention in Dinophysis spp. cells under optimum or growth-limiting conditions. This study represents the first successful culture of a Dinophysis isolate from the Atlantic South America region. Starved D. acuminata complex cells reached 5.6-fold higher cellular OA quotas (up to 18 pg cell⁻¹) than Mesodinium rubrum-fed cultures 20 days after inoculation in the laboratory. Moreover, in field samples, light-limited cells at the bottom of a stratified water column were less abundant, yet 6.6- to 11-fold more toxic (up to 26.4 pg OA and 1.7 pg DTX-1 cell⁻¹) than those located at the illuminated surface. This phenomenon of toxin retention by slow-dividing cells may partially explain the enormous variation in cell toxin quota found within Dinophysis spp. populations from a single location, and it may have serious implications for cell count-based monitoring program in bivalve aquaculture areas. In fact, only low to moderate OA levels were detected in the digestive glands of oysters Crassostrea spp. (up to 17.8 ng g⁻¹) and the guts and livers of filter-feeding fish (44.7 ng g⁻¹) during the present study, despite the relatively high Dinophysis cell densities (up to 19,500 cells L⁻¹) found in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea 3aDinophysis acuminata 3adiarrhetic shellfish poisoning 3afish 3amollusc culture 3amonitoring 3aokadaic acid 3aoysters 3apoisoning 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3aBrazil1 aTavares, Camila Prestes dos Santos1 aSchramm, Mathias Alberto0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2014 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.1727-1739dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-013-0219-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014300154300002000297520134000317592002801657650001901685650001401704650000901718650001901727650002301746650001701769650001401786650002401800650000701824650002001831650001401851650001601865700001501881700001601896773012801912856007502040852000902115655001202124IND60756837820221119141847.0211118e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075683782DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo02322e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Jiang10aProtection of menhaden oil from oxidation in Pickering emulsion-based delivery systems with α-lactalbumin-chitosan colloidal nanoparticle  ap. 11366-11377.  aIn this study, α-lactalbumin-chitosan (ALA–CHI) colloidal nanoparticles were spontaneously formed mainly through electrostatic interactions for stabilizing Pickering emulsion loaded with health-beneficial but unstable menhaden oil. The oxidative stability of menhaden oil was supposed to be significantly enhanced with Pickering emulsion-based delivery systems with ALA–CHI colloidal particles. The film of ALA–CHI colloidal nanoparticles had higher surface hydrophobicity than ALA at pH 5.0, and 6.5. A near-neutral wettability (89.6°) of ALA–CHI nanoparticles was observed at pH 5.0. Stable Pickering emulsions (60% menhaden oil fraction, w/w) were successfully fabricated with only 0.12% (w/w) of ALA–CHI nanoparticles. Pickering emulsions exhibited superior storage, heat, and centrifugation stability. The formation of gel-like structures was confirmed by rheological results. The viscosity and storage modulus in the frequency range of 0.1 to 10 Hz with a 1.0% strain exhibited remarkable increases with increasing colloidal particle concentration or oil fraction. Increasing oil fractions from 20% to 60% (w/w) or colloidal particle concentrations 0.12% to 2.40% (w/w) can pronouncedly facilitate the inhibition of lipid oxidation, as confirmed by detecting the formation of primary and secondary oxidation products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrifugation 3aemulsions 3aheat 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid peroxidation 3amenhaden oil 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apH 3astorage modulus 3aviscosity 3awettability1 aHe, Qingyu1 aFan, Yuting0 tFood & function.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 12, no. 22 p.11366-11377dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo02322e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01447naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007800158300002000236520055600256592002800812650002100840650002300861650002300884650002300907700002000930773013600950856007401086852000901160655001201169IND60639680620221121233453.0190502e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063968062DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc06863h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonne, Damien10aEnantioselective syntheses of atropisomers featuring a five-membered ring  ap. 12385-12393.  aAtropisomerism is a fundamental property of molecules featuring a hindered rotation around a chemical bond.

It was sought to determine whether nanomaterials pass through the maternal–fetal junction at any stage of pregnancy. Quantum dots (QDs) coated with heparinized Pluronic 127 nanogels and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were administered to pregnant mice. The biodistribution of QDs, as well as their biological impacts on maternal and fetal health, was evaluated. Encapsulation of QDs with a nanogel coating produces a petal-like nanotracer (PNt), which could serve as a nano-carrier of genes or drugs. PNts were injected through the tail vein and accumulated in the liver, kidneys, and lungs. QD accumulation in reproductive organs (uterus, placenta, and fetus) differed among phases of pregnancy. In phase I (7 days of pregnancy), the QDs did not accumulate in the placenta or fetus, but by phase III (19 days) they had accumulated at high levels in both tissues. Karyotype analysis revealed that the PNt-treated pups did not have genetic abnormalities when dams were treated at any phase of pregnancy. PNts have the potential to serve as carriers of therapeutic agents for the treatment of the mother or fetus and these results have a significant impact on the development and application of QD-based NPs in pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acaudal vein 3acytotoxicity 3aencapsulation 3afetus 3agenomics 3ahuman health 3akaryotyping 3aliver 3ananocarriers 3ananogels 3aplacenta 3apolyethyleneimine 3apregnancy 3auterus1 aPark, Ji Sun1 aYi, Se Won1 aGo, Minyeon1 aKim, Hye-Ryun1 aLee, Su-jin,1 aPark, Jong Min1 aCha, Dong Hyun1 aShim, Sung Han1 aPark, Keun-Hong0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 June 16, v. 8, no. 12 p.3392-3403dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00311e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010600157300002000263520097600283592002801259650001601287650001101303650001601314650001901330650001001349650001201359700002401371700002601395700002101421773012801442856007501570852000901645655001201654IND60756837920221119142020.0211118e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075683792DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo02339j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuo, Xinying10aEffect of pasta shape and gluten on pasta cooking quality and structural breakdown during mastication  ap. 11577-11585.  aOral processing behaviour of food is affected by the structural characteristics of the food matrix, including rheological and mechanical attributes as well as the size and shape. Pasta, a staple starchy food, may have a very similar macrostructure (shape) but a very different microstructure in gluten-containing (GC) and gluten-free (GF) products. In this context, this study aims to investigate the effect of pasta shape (in the presence and absence of gluten) on cooking/textural properties, chewing behaviour and structural breakdown during oral processing. The results suggest that the shape and presence of gluten affect not only the pasta texture but also the mastication behavior with gluten significantly increasing the mastication effort whereas a small pasta shape may trigger swallowing of almost not masticated pieces. The shape and gluten can therefore be used as a strategy to modulate chewing behavior, with possible effects on both perception and intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood matrix 3agluten 3amastication 3amicrostructure 3apasta 3atexture1 aMosca, Ana Carolina1 aPellegrini, Nicoletta1 aVittadini, Elena0 tFood & function.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 12, no. 22 p.11577-11585dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo02339j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012300168300001600291520125400307592002801561650002301589650001201612650002201624650001601646650002301662650001301685650001001698650002101708650002101729650001301750650001301763650001801776650002001794650001001814650001301824650000901837650001501846650001401861650002201875650002301897650002501920653001401945653001501959653002301974653001001997653001702007700001402024773014102038856008402179852000902263655001202272IND60544064520221121095147.0190415e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054406452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jssas.2013.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, F.A.S.10aImpact of different water regimes based on class-A pan on growth, yield and oil content of Coriandrum sativum L. plant  ap. 155-161.  aThis experiment was carried out to study the effect of five irrigation levels on growth, yield and chemical composition of coriander plants. The amount of irrigation water was equal to 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% and 120% of the potential evapotranspiration (ETP) values based on class-A pan. The irrigation water was applied by drip irrigation system. The results of this experiment showed that the vegetative growth parameters were improved as a result of applying higher irrigation levels compared to lower levels. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was increased by reducing the irrigation levels. Increasing the irrigation level from 40% to 120% increased the volatile oil percentage as well as fruit and volatile oil yields/hill and per fed. The results of GC analysis of volatile oil showed that the main components of volatile oil were linalool, ß-cymene, limonene, nerol, borneol and geraniol. However, the irrigation treatments did not affect oil composition. The chemical analysis of the coriander herb indicated that increasing the irrigation rate from 40% to 120% of ETP gradually decreased nitrogen, phosphorus and carbohydrate percentages in the dried herb of coriander plants. However, there was no clear trend for potassium percentage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aborneol 3achemical analysis 3adried herbs 3aevapotranspiration 3ageraniol 3ahills 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3alimonene 3alinalool 3alipid content 3amicroirrigation 3anerol 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3avegetative growth 3avolatile compounds 3awater use efficiency 0aCoriander 0aIrrigation 0aEvapotranspiration 0aYield 0aVolatile oil1 aAli, E.F.0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2014 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.155-161dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009500167300001600262520075200278536027001030592002801300596009801328596008001426596010101506650002301607650001701630650004101647650001601688650001001704650002301714650001001737653001701747653001401764653001001778653001501788653001501803700002101818700001301839700002101852773013601873856008502009852000902094655001202103IND60679411820221122082010.0191228e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067941182DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2019.16124282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Li-Xia10aEvolution of the aromatic profile of traditional Msalais wine during industrial production  ap. 911-924.  aMsalais is a traditional Chinese wine. The strong caramel odor makes Msalais monotonous and inharmonious, with more imbalances in industrially produced Msalais. In this study, the aromatic evolution of Msalais during industrial production was analyzed by sensory testing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The analysis revealed that dynamic changes of corresponding aromatic compounds were consistent with the change of odors. The concentration of grape juice caused strong caramel odor and weak floral and herbaceous odors in industrial Msalais. Further, controlled fermentation ameliorated the imbalance. These findings revealed the traditional aromatic characteristics that should be improved during the industrial production of Msalais.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31660460]; the China Agriculture Research System for National Technology System for Grape Industry [CARS-29]; China Agricultural University and Tarim University joint fund [TDZHLH201702].  aPublisher supplied data  a31660460cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aTDZHLH201702cChina Agricultural University and Tarim University joint fund  aCARS-29cthe China Agriculture Research System for National Technology System for Grape Industry 3aaromatic compounds 3afermentation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrape juice 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3awines 0aMsalais wine 0aevolution 0aaroma 0aindustrial 0aproduction1 aZhang, Meng-Meng1 aShi, Yin1 aDuan, Chang-Qing0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 22, no. 1 p.911-924dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2019.16124283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011500152300002000267500001500287520127200302592002801574650001401602650001601616650002001632650001601652650001601668650001301684650001601697653002301713700001301736700001601749700002201765700002101787773012301808856007401931852000902005655001202014IND60618384720221116233626.0181029e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061838472DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra02108b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Li10aFully solution-induced high performance indium oxide thin film transistors with ZrOₓ high-k gate dielectrics  ap. 16788-16799.  a2019-12-06  aSolution based deposition has been recently considered as a viable option for low-cost flexible electronics. In this context, research efforts have been increasingly focused on the development of suitable solution-processed materials for oxide based transistors. In this work, we report a fully solution synthesis route, using 2-methoxyethanol as solvent, for the preparation of In₂O₃ thin films and ZrOₓ gate dielectrics, as well as the fabrication of In₂O₃-based TFTs. To verify the possible applications of ZrOₓ thin films as the gate dielectric in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, fully solution-induced In₂O₃ TFTs based on ZrO₂ dielectrics have been integrated and investigated. The devices, with an optimized annealing temperature of 300 °C, have demonstrated high electrical performance and operational stability at a low voltage of 2 V, including a high μₛₐₜ of 4.42 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹, low threshold voltage of 0.31 V, threshold voltage shift of 0.15 V under positive bias stress for 7200 s, and large Iₒₙ/Iₒff of 7.5 × 10⁷, respectively. The as-fabricated In₂O₃/ZrOₓ TFTs enable fully solution-derived oxide TFTs for potential application in portable and low-power consumption electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aelectronics 3azirconium oxide 3adielectrics 3atransistors 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aelectric potential1 aHe, Gang1 aLv, Jianguo1 aFortunato, Elvira1 aMartins, Rodrigo0 tRSC advances.g2018 May 08, v. 8, no. 30 p.16788-16799dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra02108b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015100158300001800309500001900327520151800346592002801864650002801892650001501920650002301935650001301958650002301971650001601994650001202010650001602022650001302038650001702051650001902068650001402087650001102101650002302112650002202135650001902157650001402176650001302190700001502203700001902218773013002237856007402367852000902441655001202450IND60699335020221119164618.0200617e20200616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069933502DNAL7 a10.1039/d0bm00328j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhangting10aLight-enhanced hypoxia-responsive and azobenzene cleavage-triggered size-shrinkable micelles for synergistic photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy  ap. 3348-3358.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHypoxia is an important pathological phenomenon due to uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation and insufficient blood flow, which can be used to design hypoxia-responsive nanocarriers for the intelligent treatment of tumor. However, it is difficult to obtain the response of hypoxia-responsive polymers corresponding to the degree of hypoxia in the tumor sites. Therefore, hypoxia-responsive azobenzene-centered copolymers polyoligo (ethylene glycol) methacrylate-block-poly(ε-caprolactone)-azobenzene-poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly oligo (ethylene glycol) (POEGMA-b-PCL-Azo-PCL-b-POEGMA) were synthesized and further self-assembled into spherical micelles. Doxorubicin (DOX) and chlorine e6 (Ce6) were encapsulated inside the micelles. The photodynamic therapy (PDT) of Ce6 could be applied to further amplify the hypoxia condition in the tumor sites through oxygen consumption on laser irradiation (660 nm). Under this condition, the DOX/Ce6-loaded micelles progressively formed spherical micelles with a small size due to the cleavage of azobenzene, thus allowing the controlled release of DOX. The formed smaller micelles could significantly avoid the formation of large aggregates, which is beneficial for clinical application. Moreover, Ce6 would continuously convert oxygen to singlet oxygen (¹O₂), thus showing toxicity to cancer cells. Both in vitro and intracellular studies confirmed that our “all-in-one” micelles showed a superior synergistic effect of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood flow 3acell proliferation 3achlorine 3acomposite polymers 3adoxorubicin 3ahypoxia 3airradiation 3amicelles 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aphotochemotherapy 3asinglet oxygen 3asynergism 3atoxicity1 aPan, Chang1 aYuan, Weizhong0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 June 16, v. 8, no. 12 p.3348-3358dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00328j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245011400203520121400317592002801531650001301559650002001572650002001592650001101612650001401623650001401637653002301651653002101674653003401695653002801729653001601757700001601773700001801789700005601807700001301863773010401876856008401980852000902064655001202073IND60748995720221117162700.0210911e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074899572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2021.1049122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0916-780310aSiamFuseNet: A pseudo-siamese network for detritus detection from polarized microscopic images of river sands  aDetecting detritus from the polarized microscopic images of river sands is the first step in the tasks of sediment source analysis, tectonic evolution, and lithofacies paleogeography. Traditional detritus detection mainly relies on professionals to identify and detect manually, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive facing large volumes of microscopic images of river sands. Currently, deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have achieved good performance in many visual detection tasks, and can be applied to geological tasks such as detritus detection. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based pesudo-siamese network for detritus detection called the SiamFuseNet. SiamFuseNet accepts both plane-polarized and cross-polarized images as input, and learns the fused feature representation to improve the detection accuracy. Besides, Both the multi-scale detection structure and the loss function are optimized to improve both the performance and robustness of SiamFuseNet. Compared to available object detection models, the experiment results show that SiamFuseNet robustly achieves greater accuracy of detritus detection without sacrificing the detection speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetritus 3aneural networks 3apalaeogeography 3arivers 3asediments 3atectonics 0aDetritus detection 0aObject detection 0aConvolutional neural networks 0aPseudo-siamese networks 0aRiver sands1 aGe, Shiping1 aJiang, Zhiwei1 aHao, Huizhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4910-763X1 aGu, Qing0 tComputers & geosciences.g2021 Nov., v. 156 p.104912-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2021.1049123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245015600164300001800320520059600338592002800934650002000962650001400982650002300996650002301019650001501042650002401057650001601081650002201097650002201119650001401141650001801155700002501173700002001198700002301218700002501241700001801266700001901284700002201303700002301325700002301348700002101371773011801392856008101510852000901591655001201600IND60550607420171220000000.0160911e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055060742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b024752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGayakhe, Vijay10aWater-Soluble Pd–Imidate Complexes: Broadly Applicable Catalysts for the Synthesis of Chemically Modified Nucleosides via Pd-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling  ap. 2713-2729.  aA broadly applicable catalyst system consisting of water-soluble Pd–imidate complexes has been enployed for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of four different nucleosides in water under mild conditions.

The biological mechanisms triggering the development of chemobrain are largely unknown. However, a literature study suggests the generation of free radicals, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, epigenetic chromatin remodeling, decreased neurogenesis, secretion of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), dendritic branching, and neurotransmitter release to be the cumulative contributions to the ailment. Unfortunately, there is no means to prevent/mitigate the development and intensity of chemobrain. Given the lack of effective prevention strategies or treatments, preclinical studies have been underway to ascertain the usefulness of natural products in mitigating chemobrain in the recent past. Natural products used in diets have been shown to provide beneficial effects by inhibition of free radicals, oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, and/or concomitant upregulation of various cell survival proteins. For the first time, this review focuses on the published effects of astaxanthin, omega-3 fatty acids, ginsenoside, cotinine, resveratrol, polydatin, catechin, rutin, naringin, curcumin, dehydrozingerone, berberine, C-phycocyanin, the higher fungi Cordyceps militaris, thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and polyherbal formulation Mulmina™ in mitigating cognitive impairments in preclinical models of study, and also addresses their potential neuro-therapeutic mechanisms and applications in preventing/ameliorating chemobrain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps militaris 3aThymus vulgaris 3aastaxanthin 3aberberine 3acatechin 3acell viability 3achromatin 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acotinine 3acurcumin 3acytokines 3adrug therapy 3aepigenetics 3aginsenosides 3anaringin 3aneurogenesis 3aneurotransmitters 3aoxidative stress 3aquality of life 3aresveratrol 3arutin 3asecretion 3athyme1 aKudva, Avinash Kundadka1 aRao, P.

(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a key pest of crucifer vegetables in Southern China. The use of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) within an integrated pest management approach may offer an effective and environmentally safe strategy to suppress outbreaks of this pest. In the present study, the efficacy of Steinernema carpocapsae All and Heterorhabditis indica LN2 for the control of P. striolata in the field was evaluated, as well as the combined application of EPNs and azadirachtin against the pest. Both nematode species were capable of reducing populations of the soil-dwelling stages of P. striolata, thus leading to a reduction of the adult populations and the associated shot-hole damage on the leaves. Nematode treatments also increased cabbage yields as compared to the control and azadirachtin treatments alone. Azadirachtin alone was not effective to prevent damage by P. striolata, but it could enhance the control effect of S. carpocapsae shortly after application. Osmotically treated infective juveniles (IJs) of S. carpocapsae All performed as well as untreated IJs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterorhabditis indica 3aPhyllotreta striolata 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3aadults 3aazadirachtin 3abiological control 3acrop yield 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aintegrated pest management 3aleaves 3anematode larvae 3apests 3avegetables 3aChina1 aHan, Richou1 aMoens, Maurice1 aChen, Shulong1 aDe Clercq, Patrick0 tBioControl.g2013 Apr., v. 58, no. 2 p.247-256dSpringer-Verlagx1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-012-9482-y  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011500164300001800279520030300297592002800600650001200628650001200640650002300652650002300675650001300698650001600711650002200727700001500749700002300764700002000787700002100807700002200828700002200850773011800872856008100990852000901071655001201080IND60568878820221122070521.0170519e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056887882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b006092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumino, Shuhei10aPhotoredox-Catalyzed Hydrodifluoroalkylation of Alkenes Using Difluorohaloalkyl Compounds and a Hantzsch Ester  ap. 5469-5474.  aPhotoredox-catalyzed hydrodifluoroalkylation of alkenes proceeded smoothly in the presence of a Hantzsch ester as a hydrogen source under visible light irradiation.

Application of synthetic fungicides is the only control measure practiced. Fortuitously, during a field survey, congregations of coccinellid adults and grubs were found associated with powdery mildews on a wild plant, Xanthium brasilicum Vell., locally known as “Ramtouk”, at Shambat area/Khartoum North. Therefore, the insect was subjected to some bionomical studies conducted during winter season 2011/12. Emphasis was devoted to morphometric investigations, supported with life cycle durations and seasonal trend on the foregoing host. Accordingly, the species was recognized as Psyllobora bisoctonotata (Muls.), a well known powdery mildew feeder in several countries. This is the first record of a mycophagous insect in Sudan. Hence, the important morphological features of the different stages were presented. The rearing of the insect on powdery mildew infected Ramtouk leaves in the laboratory (27.50±3.75°C and 15.83±3.82% R.H.) revealed that the mean total lifecycle from egg to adult was 25.28±1.57days. The insect appeared on X. brasilicum in a very small number in December, peaked in February, and then gradually declined thereafter coinciding with an increase in temperature and a decrease in powdery mildew infection. So far, the real distribution of this mycophagous species and its host range are waiting for more investigations. Meticulous bio-ecological studies are important to ascertain the proper habitat for such insect throughout the year, and to evaluate its potential role as a biocontrol agent for the powdery mildews.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccinellidae 3aErysiphe 3aLeveillula 3aSphaerotheca 3aXanthium 3aadults 3abiological control agents 3acontrol methods 3aeggs 3afungi 3afungicides 3afungivores 3ahabitats 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect rearing 3ainsects 3aleaves 3amorphometry 3apowdery mildew 3asurveys 3atemperature 3awild plants 3awinter 3aSudan 0aPsyllobora bisoctonotata 0aMycophagous 0aBionomics 0aLife cycle 0aPowdery mildews 0aFirst record 0aSudan0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2015 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.48-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011500169300001600284520097600300536034201276592002801618596010801646650001001754650002001764650004101784650001001825650002701835650001601862650003301878650002301911650001101934650001601945653001601961653002501977653002702002653001502029700001802044700001702062700001902079700001902098700001702117700001702134700001602151700001302167700001602180700001902196700001602215773013602231856008502367852000902452655001202461IND60679412320221122082006.0191228e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067941232DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2019.16173042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Haonan10aStudy of sensitivity evaluation on ridgetail white prawn (Exopalaemon carinicauda) quality examination methods  ap. 942-951.  aIn this paper, ridgetail white prawn (Exopalaemon carinicauda) quality evaluation was performed by electronic nose (e-nose). Physical/chemical, such as human sensory evaluation (HSE), weight loss, colour, total viable counts (TVC), GC-MS, K value, microbial, and e-nose were persistently tested. Principal component analysis (PCA) and stochastic resonance (SR) were used for measurement data processing. Results suggested that prawn quality persistently decreased due to microbial propagation. GC-MS results demonstrated that the volatile gases emitted by the samples increased during measurement. PCA could not discriminate all prawn samples, and SR eigen values discriminated all samples. Sensitivity evaluation on colour, TVC, weight loss, HSE, GC/MS, K value, and e-nose was made, and results indicated that e-nose presents some advantages including low cost, rapid examination, and good repeatability. E-nose Prawn quality evaluation model was also built for e-nose.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. U1709212], Scientific Research Project of Zhejiang Province [Grant Nos. 2019C02075, LGG18F030006, LGG19F010012, LY19F030023], China College Student Research Programme [Grant No. 105-2013200055], College Student Research Programme of Zhejiang Province  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. U1709212cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3acolor 3aelectronic nose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agases 3ainformation processing 3aplate count 3aprincipal component analysis 3asensory evaluation 3ashrimp 3aweight loss 0awhite prawn 0aphysiochemical index 0asensitivity evaluation 0anon-linear1 aYing, Xiaoguo1 aWang, Wenxin1 aChen, Zhenzhen1 aShao, Chenning1 aZhou, Huimin1 aWang, Siyang1 aPing, Xinyi1 aLi, Jian1 aYi, Xiaomei1 aDeng, Shanggui1 aHui, Guohua0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 22, no. 1 p.942-951dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2019.16173043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009900172520158800271592002801859650002101887650002301908650002401931650002401955650001701979650002401996650001202020650002002032650001002052650001902062650001102081650002202092650001702114650001102131650001402142653000902156653001402165653001902179700001602198700002102214700001602235700001602251700001702267700005702284773011302341856008802454852000902542655001202551IND60748996220221117162701.0211219e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074899622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2021.1098972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Tingting10aFull-length TprK of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum in lipid nanodiscs is a monomeric porin  aTprK is a key virulence factor of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum) due to its ability to undergo intra-strain antigenic variation through gene conversion. This mechanism can generate millions of tprK gene and protein variants to allow immune evasion and pathogen persistence during infection. In silico structural modeling supports that TprK is an outer membrane β-barrel with porin function and with several surface-exposed loops, seven of which corresponding to the variable regions. No definitive structural of functional data, however, exist for this protein aside from its role in immune evasion. Studies to elucidate TprK biological function as a porin, are hindered by the evidence that TprK is not abundant on T. pallidum outer membrane, and by the fragility of T. pallidum envelope. To gain insight onto TprK structure and possible function as a porin, we used an Escherichia coli - based expression system that yielded highly pure full-length TprK without any intermediate denaturation step, and proceeded to reconstitute it in detergents and lipid nanodiscs. Visualization of TprK in nanodiscs using negative staining electron microscopy supported that TprK is a monomeric porin in an artificial lipid environment mimicking T. pallidum membrane. Our work provided evidence that TprK is a possible porin transporter of T. pallidum, a biological function compatible with its structural models. These results bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the function of this important virulence factor in syphilis pathogenesis and T. pallidum biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aTreponema pallidum 3aantigenic variation 3acomputer simulation 3adenaturation 3aelectron microscopy 3aenzymes 3agene conversion 3agenes 3aimmune evasion 3alipids 3apathogen survival 3apathogenesis 3aporins 3avirulence 0aTprK 0aNanodiscs 0aReconstitution1 aZhang, Bing1 aGiacani, Lorenzo1 aKou, Caixia1 aYang, Xiuna1 aZhang, Ruili1 aWang, Qianqiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0654-38260 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2022 Jan., v. 153 p.109897-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2021.1098973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012000157300002000277520069900297592002800996650001301024650001701037650001201054650002201066650001201088650001901100700001901119700001601138700001201154700001501166700001501181773012301196856007501319852000901394655001201403IND60618385320221116233736.0210813e20180531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061838532DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra02122h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhiqun10aLithium sulfonate-grafted poly(vinylidenefluoride-hexafluoro propylene) ionomer as binder for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 20025-20031.  aLithium sulfonate-grafted poly(vinylidenefluoride-hexafluoro propylene) P(VDF-HFP) ionomers are synthesized through covalent attachment of taurine and used as binder for the LiFePO₄ cathode of lithium-ion batteries(LIBs). The incorporation of the ionomer binders will add ionic conducting channels inside the electrodes, and prevent electrolyte depletion during rapid charge–discharge processes. It leads to an improved performance of LIBs using the ionomer binders including cycling stability and rate capability compared to that of LIBs using non-ionic binders (PVDF and PVDF-HFP). Therefore, the lithium sulfonate-grafted P(VDF-HFP) ionomers offer a new route to develop high-power LIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ataurine 3athermoplastics1 aTian, Shaokang1 aLi, Shangda1 aLi, Lei1 aYin, Yimei1 aMa, Zifeng0 tRSC advances.g2018 May 31, v. 8, no. 36 p.20025-20031dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra02122h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017600157300002000333520181700353592002802170650002002198650001702218650001802235650001702253650001202270650001002282650001402292650001202306650001402318650002502332650003002357650001602387650001102403650001702414650003002431650000902461650001902470650001902489650002002508700001602528700001702544700001602561700001502577773012802592856007502720852000902795655001202804IND60756838620221119141924.0211118e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075683862DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo02454j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Jingjing10aAnti-inflammatory effects of purple sweet potato anthocyanin extract in DSS-induced colitis: modulation of commensal bacteria and attenuated bacterial intestinal infection  ap. 11503-11514.  aPurple sweet potato anthocyanins have been acknowledged for their beneficial effects on human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the ability of anthocyanins in modulating the gut microbiota has been reported, the relationship between the bacteria modulated by anthocyanins and intestinal inflammation has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to ascertain whether the purple sweet potato anthocyanin extract (PSPAE) modulation of gut microbiota in the dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced chronic colitis mouse model could result in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protection against bacterial intestinal inflammation. Chronic colitis was induced by adding DSS in drinking water while administering the mice with PSPAE via gavage (20 mg kg⁻¹). Effects on colon tissue damage, gut microbiota composition, tight junction protein, and cytokines were evaluated. PSPAE prevented the loss of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and inhibited the increase of Gammaproteobacteria and Helicobacter upon DSS treatment. The non-pathogenic-dependent and pathogenic-dependent microenvironments were established upon treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both PSPAE treatment and non-pathogenic treatments modified the colonic expression of mouse tight junction proteins and maintained the architecture of the colon. However, the non-pathogenic treatment could not attenuate intestinal inflammation. Moreover, the pathogenic-dependent dysbiosis was exacerbated because of the increasing colonization of pathogens such as Helicobacter. The PSPAE exerted the modulation of gut microbiota to maintain the gut microbiome homeostasis in DSS-induced chronic colitis mice, which may help to propose a new treatment that combines efficacy and reduction of the possibility of bacterial intestinal infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aHelicobacter 3aLactobacillus 3aanthocyanins 3acolitis 3acolon 3acytokines 3adextran 3adysbiosis 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agastrointestinal diseases 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3asodium sulfate 3asweet potatoes 3atight junctions1 aXu, Jingwen1 aWang, Linlin1 aChen, Caifa1 aChen, Ping0 tFood & function.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 12, no. 22 p.11503-11514dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo02454j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011400172520111900286592002801405650001001433650002101443650000901464650001801473653003701491653003201528653003701560653003101597700002301628700001901651700001901670700001701689773010601706856008801812852000901900655001201909IND60793014320221120184512.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079301432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1141052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMundo, Rodrigo10aEnvironmental processes and fate of PAHs at a shallow and enclosed bay: West Nanao Bay, Noto Peninsula, Japan  aFrom August 2019 to August 2020, particulate and dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations (PAHs) were analyzed in the water body of West Nanao Bay, Japan, to determinate their levels, environmental pathways, and ecological risks at this remote but shallow and semi-enclosed bay. The 14 targeted PAHs were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detector. Even when water column stratifies, the summatory of 14 targeted dissolved PAHs did not follow significantly change with depth. Results agreed with our previous findings in the surface distribution at the bay and can be attributed to long retention time of the water mass of the semi-enclosed bay. Suspended solids start precipitating according to their size; with biggest particles rapidly settling in the proximities of river mouths. Partition coefficients (Kp) varied from 10³ to 10⁷, according to molecular weights. In general, highest Kp were found in the nepheloid layer. The risk quotients, RQ∑₁₄ PAHₛ ₍NCₛ₎ (1.04–174.08), indicated that PAHs represented a very low to low environmental risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3amarine pollution 3arisk 3asurface water 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aRemote coastal marine areas 0aEnvironmental organic pollutants 0aEcological risk assessment1 aMatsunaka, Tetsuya1 aIwai, Hisanori1 aOchiai, Shinya1 aNagao, Seiya0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Nov., v. 184 p.114105-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1141053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011100156300002000267520141200287592002801699650002501727650001201752650002001764650002401784650001501808650002501823650001801848650001301866650000901879650000901888650001201897650001501909650001701924650001701941650000901958700001701967700001401984700002401998700002202022700001502044773012802059856007502187852000902262655001202271IND60756838720221119141806.0211118e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075683872DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo02493k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Simin10aPectin–zein based stigmasterol nanodispersions ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice  ap. 11656-11670.  aDue to the insolubility of phytosterols in both water and oil, their application in the medicine and health and food industries is limited. In this study, zein and pectin were selected as wall materials of phytosterol nanoparticles to enhance the solubility and bioactivity of phytosterols. The colitis-inhibitory effects of zein-based stigmasterol nanodispersions (ZNs) and zein/pectin-based stigmasterol nanodispersions (ZPNs) were investigated in the sodium dextran sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. The results showed that ZPNs’ therapeutic effect was better than that of ZNs. According to electron microscopy observation, pectin adsorbed on the surface of zein appeared to form an elastic network structure, which increased the stability of stigmasterol nanodispersions. ZPNs not only relieved the adverse physiological symptoms of colitis in mice, but additionally prevented colonic length shortening and reduced fecal hemoglobin content. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that ZPNs could alleviate colitis by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway involved in the expression of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CSF-1 and coenzyme COX-2. This study suggests that supplement of nano-embedded stigmasterol based on zein and pectin has a positive therapeutic effect on alleviating colitis in mice. Such activities of nano-embedded stigmasterol in humans remain to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acolitis 3adextran sulfate 3aelectron microscopy 3ahemoglobin 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterleukin-6 3amedicine 3amice 3aoils 3apectins 3asolubility 3astigmasterol 3atherapeutics 3azein1 aSui, Minghui1 aWang, Dan1 aRitzoulis, Christos1 aFarag, Mohamed A.1 aShao, Ping0 tFood & function.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 12, no. 22 p.11656-11670dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo02493k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01558naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245012900160300001800289520035600307592002800663650001400691650001400705650001300719650001400732650002300746650002300769650001500792650002200807650001400829650002400843700001800867700001800885700001700903700001400920700001800934773011800952856008101070852000901151655001201160IND60568879220221120194537.0170519e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056887922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b006402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Yixia10aSynthesis of 4H-Chromen-4-one Derivatives by Intramolecular Palladium-Catalyzed Acylation of Alkenyl Bromides with Aldehydes  ap. 5481-5486.  aThe palladium-catalyzed intramolecular acylation of alkenyl bromides and aldehydes was developed for an efficient synthesis of 4H-chromen-4-ones.

We explore whether changes in trophic interactions in response to declining calcium (Ca) concentrations, a water quality issue only recently recognized in Europe and North America, can be linked with unexplained bloom production. Using a palaeolimnological approach analysing the remains of Cladocera (herbivorous grazers) and visual reflectance spectroscopically inferred chlorophyll a from the sediments of a Nova Scotia (Canada) lake, we show that a keystone grazer, Daphnia, declined in the early 1990s and was replaced by a less effective grazer, Bosmina, while inferred chlorophyll a levels tripled at constant total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. The decline in Daphnia cannot be attributed to changes in pH, thermal stratification or predation, but instead is linked to declining lakewater [Ca]. The consistency in the timing of changes in Daphnia and inferred chlorophyll a suggests top-down control on algal production, providing, to our knowledge, the first evidence of a link between lakewater [Ca] decline and elevated algal production mediated through the effects of [Ca] decline on DAPHNIA: [Ca] decline has severe implications for whole-lake food webs, and presents yet another mechanism for potential increases in algal blooms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDaphnia 3aalgal blooms 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acalcium 3achlorophyll 3afood webs 3alakes 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apredation 3areflectance 3asediments 3atemperature profiles 3awater quality 3aEurope 3aNova Scotia1 aBurke, Samantha M.1 aThienpont, Joshua R.1 aSmol, J.

Prismatic layer in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata consists of polygonal prisms enveloped by thick organic matrices. In this study, we found that the organic matrices were heterogeneously distributed, with highly acidic fractions (EDTA-soluble and EDTA-insoluble) embedded inside the prism columns, while basic EDTA-insoluble faction as inter-column framework enveloping the prisms. The intra-column matrix was enriched in aspartic acid whereas the inter-column matrix was enriched in glycine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. Moreover, the intra-column matrix contained sulfo group further contributing to its acidic property. Proteomics data showed that the intra-column proteins mainly consisted of acidic proteins, while some typical matrix proteins were absent. The absent matrix proteins such as shematrin family and KRMP family were highly basic and contained aromatic amino acids, suggesting that electric charge and hydrophobic effect might play a role in the matrix heterogeneity. Interestingly, chitin metabolism related proteins were abundant in the inter-column matrix, which may be involved in reconstructing the prism organic matrix. Overall, our study suggests that each single prism grew in an enclosed organic envelope and the organic matrix undergoes rearrangement, thus leading to the peculiar growth of the prismatic layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinctada fucata 3aaspartic acid 3achitin 3ahydrophobicity 3ametabolism 3aoysters 3aphenylalanine 3aproteomics 3atyrosine 0aPrismatic layer 0aShell matrix protein 0aSulfo group1 aLiu, Yangjia1 aLiu, Zhuang,1 aXie, Liping1 aZhang, Rongqing0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Oct. 31, v. 189 p.641-648dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04156naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245015000199300001600349500001900365500002000384520250300404592002802907596003502935596004002970650001303010650002103023650003503044650001503079650000903094650001503103650001303118650002303131650002103154650001403175650001403189650000903203650001203212700006303224700001603287700002003303700001903323700002203342700002503364700006203389773011703451856007303568852000903641655001203650IND60727349520221119023600.0210210e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072734952DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.136522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnnen, Joshua R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3898-011510aAssessing the success of conservation efforts for a North American topminnow at risk of extinction from spatially variable mosquitofish invasions  ap. 458-467.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInvasive species can cause population declines and extinctions of native species through several mechanisms including predation and competition. One such species, western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), is an invasive, aggressive predator and competitor of numerous freshwater species around the world that has caused precipitous declines of native species. The Barrens topminnow (Fundulus julisia) is a spring‐endemic fish of the south‐eastern U.S.A., and the western mosquitofish limits its recruitment via predation of smaller individuals but there is also potential for competition (i.e. interference competition) between the species in laboratory trials. All of these negative interactions probably contribute to the Barrens topminnow's precipitous decline since the 1980s and the listing of the species as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in late 2019. Ongoing conservation measures for Barrens topminnow include long‐term monitoring of populations and reintroductions through stocking of hatchery‐reared individuals into numerous sites. Here, we investigate trends in Barrens topminnow and western mosquitofish occupancy and abundance over an 8‐year period (three or four generations for Barrens topminnow) and assess the effectiveness of a stocking programme. We also included habitat covariates including distance to the nearest downstream confluence, stream order, and habitat size. Our findings revealed significant range‐wide Barrens topminnow declines in both occupancy and abundance were occurring over the 8‐year period. These declines were associated with the presence of western mosquitofish. Overall, the stocking programme of hatchery‐reared individuals did not significantly enhance or restore populations of Barrens topminnow but had a negative effect on topminnow abundance when western mosquitofish were present. The lack of a positive effect of stocking hatchery‐reared individuals on Barrens topminnow populations and the long‐term population declines of Barrens topminnow suggest that propagation and stocking alone are not effective at creating self‐sustaining populations of the Barrens topminnow. The presence of western mosquitofish does not currently appear to be compatible with long‐term persistence of topminnow populations. Moving forward, conservation strategies will be needed to create and maintain mosquitofish‐free habitats, which may include eradication of mosquitofish, construction of barriers, or other actions.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  cTennessee Wildlife Resources Agency 3aFundulus 3aGambusia affinis 3aU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 3aextinction 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alimnology 3apredation 3arisk 3astreams1 aKuhajda, Bernard R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7557-49871 aFix, Shawna1 aSweat, Sarah C.1 aZuber, Brianna1 aWatts, Allison V.1 aMattingly, Hayden T.1 aCecala, Kristen K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5739-41650 tFreshwater biology.g2021 Mar., v. 66, no. 3 p.458-467dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.136523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245011200178520118000290592002801470650001701498650001101515650001101526650002601537650001401563650002101577650002101598650001301619650001201632651002201644653002001666653002501686653002201711653000801733653001301741653002101754700002001775700002501795700002001820700001801840700002201858773010601880856008801986852000902074655001202083IND60793014720221120184358.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079301472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1141092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmanuela, Frapiccini10aPeculiar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons accumulation patterns in a non-zooxanthellate scleractinian coral  aAssessing the sources and accumulation patterns of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in corals is critical, as they threaten coral ecosystem resilience in addition to other anthropogenic pressures. We determined acenaphthene, fluorene, fluoranthene, and pyrene concentration in the skeleton and soft tissue of 7 adult and 29 old specimens of the non-zooxanthellate coral Leptopsammia pruvoti from the Mediterranean Sea. Leptopsammia pruvoti accumulated 2–72 times higher PAH concentrations than the previously investigated zooxanthellate Balanophyllia europaea living at the same site at shallower depth, likely in relation to the different trophic strategy. Low molecular weight PAHs were preferentially accumulated compared to high molecular weight PAHs. Detected PAHs were mainly petrogenic, consistently with local pollution sources. Populations of L. pruvoti immobilized PAHs in the skeleton 3–4 orders of magnitude more efficiently than B. europaea. This highlights the need to investigate other non-zooxanthellate species, which represent the majority of Mediterranean scleractinians, but are widely overlooked with respect to the few zooxanthellate species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScleractinia 3aadults 3acorals 3aecological resilience 3afluorenes 3amarine pollution 3amolecular weight 3askeleton 3atissues 3aMediterranean Sea 0aBioaccumulation 0aLeptopsammia pruvoti 0aMediterranean Sea 0aPAH 0aQuEChERS 0aTrophic strategy1 aErik, Caroselli1 aSilvia, Franzellitti1 aFiorella, Prada1 aMauro, Marini1 aStefano, Goffredo0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Nov., v. 184 p.114109-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1141093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010100176300001600277520073300293592002801026650002601054650002001080650002901100650002101129650002201150650001701172650004301189650000701232650001601239650001701255650001601272653001601288653002301304653001801327653001801345700001601363700002101379773013601400856008501536852000901621655001201630IND60679413020221122082037.0191228e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067941302DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2019.16225642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolat Yemis, Gökçe10aAntibacterial activity of polyphenol-rich pomegranate peel extract against Cronobacter sakazakii  ap. 985-993.  aThe purpose of the study was to determine if pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) peel contains polyphenolic compounds with antibacterial activity against Cronobacter sakazakii.

Nutrient enrichment can promote their abundance. Above critical thresholds in water nutrient concentrations, however, submerged macrophytes have collapsed in many lakes worldwide with negative consequences for important ecosystem functions. The mechanisms behind this decline are complex and subject to debate. We conducted mesocosm and laboratory experiments to investigate the top‐down effect of invasive herbivorous snails (Pomacea canaliculata) on native submerged macrophytes (Vallisneria natans) under low and moderate nutrient treatment. We tested whether effects of nutrient addition to the water column on snail herbivory were influenced by shading by phytoplankton and epiphyton, macrophyte elemental tissue content and snail nutrient release. We found that herbivorous snails had strong negative top‐down effects on macrophytes, which were amplified by nutrient enrichment in the water column leading to higher macrophyte consumption rates. In moderate nutrient treatment, macrophyte consumption was faster and snails grew better than in low nutrient treatment. Additionally, snail treatments had higher nitrogen concentrations in the water leading to a negative feedback loop. Our results suggest that snail herbivory may increase the chance for macrophyte collapse and shifts of shallow lakes to turbid states, and this effect occurs at lower snail densities when nutrient concentrations increase. Shallow lakes are thus severely at risk from projected increases in nutrient loading and spread of invasive herbivorous molluscs.  aPublisher supplied data  a31700402cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201820YBKT22cScience and Technology Project of Department of Water Resources of Jiangxi Province  a20171BBH80019cKey R&D Program of Jiangxi Province 3aPomacea canaliculata 3aVallisneria 3aecosystems 3aherbivores 3alimnology 3amacrophytes 3anitrogen 3aphytoplankton 3arisk 3asnails1 aHe, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2513-73801 aHilt, Sabine1 aWang, Rui1 aZhang, Huan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5044-89601 aGe, Gang0 tFreshwater biology.g2021 Mar., v. 66, no. 3 p.436-446dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.136493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245070200156300001400858520134000872592002802212650002302240650002702263650002202290653001802312653001402330700001502344773014802359856007702507852000902584655001202593IND60522176520221120043813.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052217652DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2002-01102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBzik, S.10aNeue bifunktionelle Silazane und ihr Kondensationsverhalten: 3-Methyl-2,2,4,4-tetrakis(methylamino)-1-phenyl-[1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidin, 1,3-Dichloro-2-phenyl-1,1,3,3-tetrakis(dimethylamino)disilazan, 3-Methyl-2,2,4,4-tetrakis(dimethylamino)-1-phenyl-[1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidin und 2,2,4,4-Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-1-phenyl-[1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidin/New Bifunctional Silazanes and their Condensation Reactions: 3-Methyl-2,2,4,4-tetrakis(methylamino)-1-phenyl-[1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidine, 1,3-Dichloro-2-phenyl-1,1,3,3-tetrakis(dimethylamino)disilazane, 3-Methyl-2,2,4,4-tetrakis(dimethylamino)-1-phenyl-[1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidine and 2,2,4,4-Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-1-phenyl-[1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidine  ap. 83-91.  a3-Methyl-2,2,4,4-tetrakis(methylamino)-1-phenyl-[1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidine (1), 1,3-Dichloro- 2-phenyl-1,1,3,3-tetrakis(dimethylamino)disilazane (2), 3-Methyl-2,2,4,4-tetrakis(dimethylamino)- 1-phenyl-[1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidine (3) and 2,2,4,4-Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-1-phenyl-[ 1,3,2,4]diazadisiletidine (4) have been synthesized as potential precursors for the preparation of porous oxygen-free solids.

Powder mixing is the simplest and most traditional method to prepare nanoenergetic composites, and preliminary findings have shown that these composites perform more effectively than their micro- or macro-sized counterparts in terms of energy release, ignition, and combustion. Powder mixing technology represents only the minimum capability of nanotechnology to boost the development of energetic material research, and it has intrinsic limitations, namely, random distribution of fuel and oxidizer particles, inevitable fuel pre-oxidation, and non-intimate contact between reactants. As an alternative, nanostructured energetic composites can be prepared through a delicately designed process.

A subset of OP completed the e-NutLit again to examine instrument temporal stability. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach α.Construct validity, temporal stability, and internal consistency.Parametric and nonparametric tests and general linear modeling were used as appropriate.A total of 103 participants completed the study (OP: n = 59; 64.4% female; DI: n = 44; 86.4% female). Newest Vital Sign and e-NutLit scores were significantly and positively associated (rs = 0.66; P <.001). The DI performed significantly better than the OP (OP: 59.7 ± 13.1 percentage points; DI: 83.9 ± 5.5 percentage points; P <.001), further supporting construct validity. The e-NutLit Cronbach α was >0.9 indicating a good level of internal consistency. The OP test and retest scores were not significantly different, supporting instrument temporal stability.The results support the validity of the e-NutLit, for both clinicians and researchers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3afemales 3ahospitals 3alinear models 3anutrition education 3aobesity 3apatients 0anutrition 0aliteracy 0ahealth 0aknowledge 0aelectronic1 aTam, Mr Ryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4726-41611 aPrvan, Dr Tania1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6403-43441 aStuart-Smith, Mrs Wendy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1283-91321 aDenyer, Prof Gareth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1551-39361 aFranklin, Janet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0885-59061 aHolman, Cheyenne1 aTam, Ryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4726-41611 aGifford, Janelle1 aPrvan, Tania1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6403-43441 aStuart-Smith, Wendy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1283-91321 aDenyer, Gareth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1551-39361 aMarkovic, Tania1 aO'Connor, Helen0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 Oct. 14, dElsevier Inc.aSociety for Nutrition Education and BehaviorwJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011400166300001800280520119000298592002801488650002201516650001601538650001001554650001901564650001901583650001501602650001701617650001601634650001101650650002501661650001601686650001501702700002101717700001601738700002101754700001501775700001901790773016201809856008201971852000902053655001202062IND60688496920221119152821.0200414e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068849692DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02636-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYashas, S.

TcH is known to be widely used antibiotic, but even minute concentrations of it make the aqueous environment unsafe for living beings. As-synthesized SnO₂ was thoroughly characterized to reveal its morphology, crystal structure and other intrinsic properties. SnO₂ 2D nanoflakes possessed excellent photocatalytic TcH degradation under visible light. Preliminary investigation inferred that sonophotocatalytic mode of TcH degradation was efficient over other modes with respect to degradation efficiencies for 20 mg L⁻¹ TcH and 20 mg of SnO₂. The optimum degradation of TcH was observed to be 88.82% in 135 min under LED (9 W, 220 V) irradiation with 30 mg of SnO₂ dosage and 40 kHz ultrasound. The degradation dynamics complied with pseudo-first-order kinetics where the kinetic rate constant (k) was 0.02 min⁻¹. Hence, SnO₂ 2D nanoflakes were promising in mineralization of the biotoxin (TcH) in aqueous environments that accent its application to treat real-time water and wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3airradiation 3alight 3amineralization 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3atetracycline 3atin dioxide 3atoxins 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awastewater1 aShivaraju, H.

We studied the release of vanillin, encapsulated in Hylon VII under experimental conditions in which the amylose–vanillin inclusion complex is obtained, along with the enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch carried out using salivary amylase of human origin. The flavor release into the aqueous phase was quantified spectrophotometrically and the partition into the headspace was assessed by a gas sensor array. Simultaneously, the progress of the enzymatic reaction was determined by analysis of reducing sugars. The release of flavor into the aqueous phase followed a diffusion/relaxation kinetic, whereas the headspace analysis showed an increase in the aroma intensity according to the increase of reducing sugars concentration in the solution. Furthermore, by using the Unfolded Cluster Analysis methodology it was possible to accurately discriminate the samples corresponding to each of the assayed hydrolysis times. The joint detection of the flavor in the condensed phase and in the headspace compared with the degree of starch hydrolysis provides an overall analytical painting of a daily food intake process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3acluster analysis 3acorn starch 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aflavor 3afood industry 3afood intake 3agelling properties 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrolysis 3aodors 3areducing sugars 3avanillin 0aEncapsulation-release 0aVanillin 0aHigh amylose starch 0aHylon VII 0aFlavor1 aBernik, Delia L.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2014 Dec., v. 59, no. 2 p.635-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2014.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245006300166300001600229500001900245520148500264592002801749650002301777650001601800650001101816650001901827650001201846650001201858650001001870650001201880650001301892650001301905650001101918650001401929650001401943650001301957650002501970650002501995650002202020650001602042650002002058650001702078653001802095653002002113653002802133653002002161700002302181700002002204700002202224700002002246773012502266856007802391852000902469655001202478IND60708368520221116231920.0200824s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070836852DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2019-04232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBucholz, Ethan R.10aWater relations and drought response of Pinus strobiformis  ap. 905-916.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSouthwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis Engelm.) faces dual threats of climate change shifting its environmental niche and mortality due to a nonnative, invasive fungal pathogen. To inform efforts to sustain this species, we established experimental field trials in three common gardens along an elevational gradient with drought treatments to assess trait responses in southwestern white pine. We measured predawn and midday water potential on 44 maternal families from 10 populations at each garden. We used regression between predawn and midday water potentials to estimate hydroscape area, an index of stomatal regulation of transpiration. We measured leaf carbon isotope ratio and estimated carbon isotope discrimination and leaf mass per area to understand the effects of gardens and treatments on stomatal aperture and leaf structure. Water stress caused by experimental drought and temperature decreased leaf carbon isotope discrimination and leaf mass per area, indicating formation of thin leaves with low stomatal conductance in response to heat and drought. The hydroscape area of southwestern white pine suggests tight control of transpiration via stomatal closure, similar to other isohydric pines. Families with greater stomatal closure (inferred from carbon isotope ratio) at the warm, dry garden had higher survival than other families, suggesting an important role of isohydry in acclimation of southwestern white pine to expected habitat drying and warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus strobiformis 3aacclimation 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aforests 3afungi 3agardens 3ahabitats 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3amortality 3apathogens 3aresearch 3aspecific leaf weight 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3atemperature 3awater potential 3awater stress 0acommon garden 0ahydroscape area 0asouthwestern white pine 0awater relations1 aWaring, Kristen M.1 aKolb, Thomas E.1 aSwenson, Jared K.1 aWhipple, Amy V.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2020, v. 50, no. 9 p.905-916dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2019-04233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245007000159300001600229500001900245520130700264592002801571650001801599650002401617650001201641650001801653650001301671650001701684650001501701650001801716650001301734650002001747651001001767653002601777653001501803653001501818653002801833700001401861700001901875700001501894700001901909700001401928700001801942773012201960856008202082852000902164655001202173IND60701625020221117200553.0201111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070162502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2020.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Tao10aPollutant toxicology with respect to microalgae and cyanobacteria  ap. 175-186.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroalgae and cyanobacteria are fundamental components of aquatic ecosystems. Pollution in aquatic environment is a worldwide problem. Toxicological research on microalgae and cyanobacteria can help to establish a solid foundation for aquatic ecotoxicological assessments. Algae and cyanobacteria occupy a large proportion of the biomass in aquatic environments; thus, their toxicological responses have been investigated extensively. However, the depth of toxic mechanisms and breadth of toxicological investigations need to be improved. While existing pollutants are being discharged into the environment daily, new ones are also being produced continuously. As a result, the phenomenon of water pollution has become unprecedentedly complex. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on five kinds of aquatic pollutants, namely, metals, nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Further, we present information on emerging pollutants such as graphene, microplastics, and ionic liquids. Efforts in studying the toxicological effects of pollutants on microalgae and cyanobacteria must be increased in order to better predict the potential risks posed by these materials to aquatic ecosystems as well as human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aaquatic environment 3abiomass 3aecotoxicology 3agraphene 3ahuman health 3amicroalgae 3amicroplastics 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3aChina 0aAquatic ecotoxicology 0aHerbicides 0aFungicides 0aAlgae and cyanobacteria1 aZhang, Qi1 aZhang, Zhenyan1 aHu, Baolan1 aChen, Jianmeng1 aChen, Jun1 aQian, Haifeng0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2021 Jan., v. 99 p.175-186dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012300168300001800291520150900309592002801818650002601846650002501872650001401897650001801911650001901929650001501948650001701963650002901980650001102009650002202020650002302042650002402065650001402089650001102103650001802114650001402132650001802146651002202164700001502186700005502201700001602256700005602272773016202328856008202490852000902572655001202581IND60688497120221119152849.0200414e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068849712DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02644-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGambardella, C.10aSea urchin coelomocytes cultured on nanoporous aluminium oxide as a potential tool for marine environmental monitoring  ap. 2937-2948.  aOceans and seas are of paramount importance to the health of planet Earth and human kind. Marine ecosystems should be defended against attack of polluting agents by continuous monitoring; the means of such monitoring should be as green as possible, i.e. based on sensors manufactured by biocompatible and easily disposable raw materials. In this study, we lay the basis for the future development of biosensors of marine environment based on sea urchin cells cultured on nanoporous aluminium oxide. These cells are promising as in previous works they demonstrated high response to stressors, and the proposed substrates have low costs since fabricated by inexpensive anodization process from consumer quality aluminium foils. Coelomocytes of the Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus were cultured on the nanoporous alumina for up to 5 days in vitro. Then, a biochemical characterization was carried out, checking the cholinergic system pathway by means of serotonin autofluorescence induced by aldehyde exposure and by expression and functionality of neuroactive molecules, such as acetylcholinesterase and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Both living cell quality and system biochemistry were not affected after the culture, and both electrical modulation and non-self-reactivity were maintained. These findings suggest the possibility of using the sea urchin immune cells cultured on nanoporous alumina as tools for monitoring the marine water quality, based on their electrical response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParacentrotus lividus 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aaldehydes 3aaluminum foil 3aaluminum oxide 3abiosensors 3acoelomocytes 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahumans 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amuscarine receptors 3ananopores 3aoceans 3araw materials 3aserotonin 3awater quality 3aMediterranean Sea1 aFalugi, C.1 aSalerno, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4522-828X1 aNeviani, M.1 aPaladino, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1111-79440 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2020 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.2937-2948dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-020-02644-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002300167245012000190300001600310520107000326592002801396650002101424650001801445650000901463650001601472650001001488650001501498650001101513650001201524650005501536650007201591650004701663650001101710650005501721650005601776650005701832651001101889651002601900700003601926700003001962700003001992773010202022856008402124852000902208655001202217IND4451704920221119034843.0141111e20110419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445170492DNAL7 a211768642pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuidelli, Gislaine10aRelative condition factor and parasitism in anostomid fishes from the floodplain of the Upper Paraná River, Brazil  ap. 145-151.  aIndividuals of four species of Leporinus were captured in the floodplain of the Upper Paraná River and their metazoan parasites were collected. Fifty-eight taxa of ectoparasites and endoparasites were recorded: 31 in Leporinus lacustris, 32 in Leporinus friderici, 28 in Leporinus obtusidens and 25 in Leporinus elongatus. The aim of this paper was to study the relationship between the host's condition and the parameters of infrapopulations and infracommunities. The health of the host was represented by the relative condition factor (Kn). Richness and number of individuals in the infracommunities of ectoparasites covariated with the Kn of the hosts in one species of fish. Some infrapopulations of ectoparasites covariated negatively and/or the mean Kn of parasitized individuals was lower than those without parasites. The abundance in some infrapopulations of endoparasites covariated positively with the Kn and/or the mean Kn of parasitized fish was better. These results may be related to different transmission strategies used by ecto and endoparasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondition factor 3aendoparasites 3afish 3afloodplains 3ahosts 3aparasitism 3arivers 2aAnimals 2aCestodaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aEctoparasitic Infestationsxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aFish Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aFishes 2aHelminthiasis, Animalxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aNematodaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aTrematodaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aTavechio, Washington Luiz Gomes1 aTakemoto, Ricardo Massato1 aPavanelli, Gilberto Cezar0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2011 Apr. 19, v. 177, no. 1-2 p.145-151dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245014600168300001600314500016900330520154200499592002802041650001502069650000902084650003102093650002102124650000902145650000902154650001802163651001002181700001702191700001902208700001802227700001802245700001702263700001602280773014402296856008302440852000902523655001202532IND60614098220221118141942.0181002e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061409822DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e31829908be2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei-Peng10aEvaluation of Laser Diffraction Analysis of Particle Size Distribution of Typical Soils in China and Comparison With the Sieve-Pipette Method  ap. 194-204.  aAffiliations: 1Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. 2Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.  aLaser diffraction method (LDM) provides a rapid solution for obtaining soil particle size distribution (PSD) especially in the analysis of a larger number of soil samples. However, there are disadvantages associated with the use of LDM for PSD measurements over the traditional sieve-pipette method (SPM). The present study is aimed to assess the suitability of LDM as a routine method for determining soil PSD, evaluate the precision or its repeatability of PSD parameters, and establish a simplified protocol for transforming the LDM results into SPM ones. The soil samples (n = 43) from 13 Chinese provinces were analyzed, and the results indicated that the relative errors for clay, silt, and sand fractions by the LDM were 35.34, 27.38, and 19.41%, respectively, compared with those by the SPM in the condition of limited sample numbers and large between-sample variation; samples could best be run at least twice during the LDM analysis to reduce the error caused by a limited sample volume; and a soil particle refractive index of 1.50 and a soil particle absorption index of 0.01 were found to be optimal for the Mie theory model. With relatively limited sample numbers and apparent textural difference between the samples, the distinct incompatibilities were observed in the present work between the PSD obtained by the LDM and SPM. However, depending on the specific research purpose, the deviations between the LDM and SPM may be considerably reduced with an increase in the sample capacity or a decrease in the spatial scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aclay 3aparticle size distribution 3arefractive index 3asilt 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aChina1 aLiu, Jian-Li1 aZhang, Jia-Bao1 aLi, Xiao-Peng1 aCheng, Ya-Nan1 aXin, Wen-Wen1 aYan, Yi-Fan0 tSoil science.g2013 Apr., v. 178, no. 4 p.194-204dWolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e31829908be3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011700167506011700284506007600401520180100477592002802278506003702306650001102343650001602354650001702370650001302387650002102400650001002421650001502431650001902446650002402465650001702489650001102506650001102517650001602528650002102544650003102565650001102596651001002607653001302617653001702630653002102647653001302668653003302681700001502714700001402729700001702743700001502760700001402775700001802789700001402807700001702821700001602838700001902854773010502873856008502978852000903063655001203072IND60760241420221207091508.0220502e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076024142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2021.1070482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Jiexiao10aIdentification of ozone sensitivity for NO2 and secondary HCHO based on MAX-DOAS measurements in northeast China  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column densities (VCDs) were measured using multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) from January to November 2019 in Shenyang, Northeast China. The maximum HCHO VCD value appeared in the summer (1.74 × 10¹⁶ molec/cm²), due to increased photo-oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). HCHO concentrations increased from 08:00 and peaked near 13:00, which was mainly attributed to the increased release of isoprene from plants and enhanced photolysis at noon. The HCHO VCDs observed by MAX-DOAS and OMI have a good correlation coefficient (R) of 0.78, and the contributions from primary and secondary HCHO sources were distinguished by the multi-linear regression model. The anthropogenic emissions showed unobvious seasonal variations, and the primary HCHO was relatively stable in Shenyang. Secondary HCHO contributed 82.62%, 83.90%, 78.90%, and 41.53% to the total measured ambient HCHO during the winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. We also found a good correlation (R = 0.78) between enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and HCHO VCDs, indicating that the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) was the main source of HCHO. The ratio of secondary HCHO to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) was used as the tracer to analyze O₃-NOₓ-VOC sensitivities. We found that the VOC-limited, VOC-NOₓ-limited, and NOₓ-limited regimes made up 93.67%, 6.23%, 0.11% of the overall measurements, respectively. In addition, summertime ozone (O₃) sensitivity changed from VOC-limited in the morning to VOC-NOₓ-limited in the afternoon. Therefore, this study offers information on HCHO sources and corresponding O₃ production sensitivities to support strategic management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautumn 3aenvironment 3aformaldehyde 3aisoprene 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3aregression analysis 3aspectroscopy 3aspring 3asummer 3atroposphere 3avegetation index 3avolatile organic compounds 3awinter 3aChina 0aMAX-DOAS 0aFormaldehyde 0aSecondary source 0aHCHO/NO2 0aOzone production sensitivity1 aZhao, Ting1 aLuo, Yifu1 aMiao, Congke1 aSu, Pinjie1 aLiu, Feng1 aZhang, Guohui1 aQin, Sida1 aSong, Youtao1 aBu, Naishun1 aXing, Chengzhi0 tEnvironment international.g2022 Feb., v. 160 p.107048-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.1070483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007000161300001600231520138000247592002801627650001401655650001801669650001501687650001601702650001501718650001201733650001901745650003101764650001101795650001901806650001401825650001901839650002101858650002601879650001801905650001201923653001101935653001401946653002901960653000801989700001601997700001402013700001802027700001602045773014602061856008202207852000902289655001202298IND60615918420221123035314.0181015e20181012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061591842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.1742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yong10aLong non-coding RNA EPIC1 promotes cholangiocarcinoma cell growth  ap. 654-659.  aCholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the as the most frequently observed biliary tract malignancy, which has low survival rate in addition to constrained treatment options. However, the fundamental molecular mechanism underlying malignant progression of CCA is quite ambiguous. Recent studies reported that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) might play critical roles in regulating chemo-resistant of multiple types of cancer. In this study, our results indicate that the LncRNA-EPIC1 expression were significantly increased in cholangiocarcinoma tissues, compared to adjacent normal tissues. And also, its expression also increased in several CCA cancer cell lines than that in human normal immortalized cholangiocyte cell. Loss-and-gain of Lnc-EPIC1 contributes to the CCA cell growth, colony formation, cell apoptosis and also cell cycle. Myc has been reported to directly interact with Lnc-EPIC1 in several cancer cells. Myc targets, including Cyclin A/D and CDK9 were downregulated by Lnc-EPIC1 siRNA. Myc knockout also suppresses the CCA cell growth, colony formation and cell apoptosis. However, Lnc-EPIC1 knockdown failed to enhance the Myc-KO-induced suppression of CCA tumor progression. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) results showed the direct interaction between Lnc-EPIC1 and Myc. Taken together, our results show that Lnc-EPIC1 promotes CCA cancer progression by targeting Myc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiliary tract 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acell lines 3acyclins 3adisease course 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anon-coding RNA 3aprecipitin tests 3asmall interfering RNA 3asurvival rate 3atissues 0aLncRNA 0aLnc-EPIC1 0aCholangiocarcinoma (CCA) 0aMYC1 aCai, Quanyu1 aLi, Wanhu1 aFeng, Feiling1 aYang, Liang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Oct. 12, v. 504, no. 4 p.654-659dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013700154300002000291520094700311592002801258650001501286650002801301650001001329650001301339650001701352650001301369650002301382650001601405650002101421700001801442700001201460700001701472700002101489700001701510700001501527700001401542773014401556856007401700852000901774655001201783IND60641810820221121194532.0190506e20160726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064181082DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta03585j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yue10aHighly efficient aqueous-processed polymer/nanocrystal hybrid solar cells with an aqueous-processed TiO₂ electron extraction layer  ap. 11738-11746.  aIn this work, a novel environmentally friendly approach to deposit TiO₂ films via an aqueous process is developed.

Different contents of amylose was blended with PBAT for improving mechanical strength and oxygen-barrier properties of MSPF. The microstructures, crystallinity, mechanical properties, oxygen-barrier capacity of MSPF were thoroughly evaluated. The result showed that MSPF with high starch content and excellent performances was successfully prepared with the synergy of PUP modification, amylose introduction and extrusion blowing. The crystallinity, hydrophobicity, oxygen-barrier properties and mechanical properties of MSPF increased with the increasing amylose content.

The result demonstrated that MSPF having excellent mechanical properties and oxygen-barrier properties could be use in the biodegradable field such as packaging materials, agricultural films and garbage bags.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3abiodegradability 3acrystal structure 3aextrusion 3ahydrophobicity 3amunicipal solid waste 3apolyurethanes 3atensile strength 0aBiodegradable 0aBlown film 0aModified starch 0aPolyurethane prepolymer 0aPBAT1 aChen, Fangping1 aMeng, Wei1 aLi, Chengqiang1 aCui, Ruihua1 aXia, Zhean1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3904-62711 aLiu, Changsheng0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 253 p.117168-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1171683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245012300180300001600303520152900319592002801848650002801876650002201904650001701926650001001943650002601953650001601979650001201995650001902007650001102026650001402037650002002051650001802071650001802089773014402107856008302251852000902334655001202343IND60614098320221118141948.0181002e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061409832DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e318298bdd12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOshunsanya, Suarau Odutola10aSurface Soil Properties and Maize Yields in Runoff Plots Planted With Vetiver Grass (Vetiveria nigritana Stapf) Hedges  ap. 205-213.  aSurface soil properties are more susceptible to water erosion. Planting vetiver grass hedges (VGH) across the slope could protect surface soil from being washed away and allow meaningful cultivation of crops. A field experiment was carried out to assess the effects of VGH spaced at surface intervals of 5 m (VGH5), 10 m (VGH10), and control (no-VGH plot) on surface soil properties, runoff and sediments, and maize yields for five growing seasons on 6% slope in Southwest Nigeria.Vetiver grass hedges and growing season interaction had significant effects on some physical (bulk density and moisture content) and chemical (N, C, P, and K) properties. Nutrient enrichment ratio for N, C, P, and K was highest in control plot, followed by VGH10, and least by VGH5 plots. In addition, VGH and growing season interaction had significant effects on runoff, soil loss, and soil loss/crop yield ratio. Average runoff (in millimeters) per five growing reasons obtained from control, VGH10, and VGH5 plots was in the ratio of 6.5:3:1, respectively. Corresponding soil loss was 8:2:1, respectively. Soil loss/crop yield ratio was significantly higher in control plot (9.69) than VGS10 (1.84) and VGH5 (0.74). The mean grain yield values during the five growing seasons obtained from VGH5 and VGS10 plots was higher than the control by 21.4 and 6.8%, respectively. The reduction of runoff nutrient losses on plots with VGH demonstrated the beneficial effects of protecting surface soil from being washed away on this sloping farmland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysopogon zizanioides 3aagricultural land 3abulk density 3acrops 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3agrasses 3agrowing season 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil properties 3awater content 3awater erosion0 tSoil science.g2013 Apr., v. 178, no. 4 p.205-213dWolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e318298bdd13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016100163500001400324520104600338592002801384650002201412650002001434650001601454650001801470650002701488650001501515650001101530650001601541650002201557650001401579650001701593653001301610653001801623653002201641653002201663653002401685653000901709653001101718653001101729653001101740653000801751653001001759653001701769653001701786653001701803653001401820700002101834773011201855856008201967852000902049655001202058IND60726070420221118225700.0210408e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072607042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2021.1043732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilipek, A.10aOleacein may intensify the efflux of oxLDL from human macrophages by increasing the expression of the SRB1 receptor, as well as ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters  aNAL-light  aOleacein is a polyphenol and can be found in unfiltered extra virgin olive oil and leaves Ligustrum vulgare L. (Oleaceae). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oleacein could increase efflux cholesterol from macrophages.Oleacein in dose-dependent manner (OLEA20, OLEA50) significantly reduced lipid deposits in macrophages. The increase of SRB1 expression was found for OLEA50 and OLEA20 compared to oxLDL-induced macrophages. Oleacein significantly up-regulated protein expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporter. Moreover, oleacein increased of HO-1 intracellular secretion, as well as increased activation of Nrf2. Whereas, the level of NF-κB protein was almost completely inhibited by oleacein at the same concentrations. For OLEA10, no significant changes were observed for the parameters tested.Our study demonstrated that oleacein may reduce foam cell formation. Therefore, we propose a novel explanation for the oleacein, that can be used to develop new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLigustrum vulgare 3aatherosclerosis 3acholesterol 3adose response 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afoam cells 3ahumans 3apolyphenols 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 0aOleacein 0aSRB1 receptor 0aABCA1 transporter 0aABCG1 transporter 0aFoam cell formation 0aOLEA 0aOLEA10 0aOLEA20 0aOLEA50 0aKAM 0aoxLDL 0aOLEA10+oxLDL 0aOLEA20+oxLDL 0aOLEA50+oxLDL 0aKAM+oxLDL1 aGierlikowska, B.0 tJournal of functional foods.g2021 Mar., v. 78 p.104373-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.1043733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011400164300001600278500001900294520190900313592002802222650004402250650002202294650001602316650001302332650002202345650002202367650000902389650002002398650001602418650001702434650001002451650004402461650000702505650001202512650001902524650001802543650001402561650000902575650001502584651001002599653002902609653002402638653001602662653001702678700001902695700001702714700001502731773012202746856008202868852000902950655001202959IND60701625220221117200645.0201111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070162522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2020.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Wenquan10aSynthesis and evaluation of cationic flocculant P(DAC-PAPTAC-AM) for flocculation of coal chemical wastewater  ap. 239-248.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, a high-efficiency cationic flocculant, P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM), was successfully prepared using UV-induced polymerization technology. The monomer Acrylamide (AM): Acryloxyethyl Trimethyl ammonium chloride (DAC): methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (MAPTAC) ratio, monomer concentration, photoinitiator concentration, urea content, and cationic monomer DAC:MAPTAC ratio, light time, and power of high-pressure mercury lamp were studied. The characteristic groups, characteristic diffraction peaks, and characteristic proton peaks of P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM) were confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (¹H NMR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of dosage, pH value, and velocity gradient (G) value on the removal efficiencies of turbidity, COD, ammonia nitrogen, and total phenol by poly aluminum ferric chloride (PAFC), P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM), and PAFC/P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM) in the flocculation treatment of coal chemical wastewater were investigated. Results showed that the optimal conditions for the flocculation of coal chemical wastewater using P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM) alone are as follows: dosage of 8–12 mg/L, G value of 100–250 s ⁻ ¹, and pH value of 4–8. The optimal dosage of PAFC is 90–150 mg/L with a pH of 2–12. The optimal dosage for PAFC/P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM) is as follows: PAFC dosage of 90–150 mg/L, P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM) dosage of 8–12 mg/L, and pH range of 2–6. When P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM) was used alone, the optimal removal efficiencies of turbidity, COD, ammonia nitrogen, and total phenol were 81.0%, 35.0%, 75.0%, and 80.3%, respectively. PAFC has good tolerance to wastewater pH and good pH buffering. Thus, the flocculation treatment of coal chemical wastewater using the PAFC/P(DAC-MAPTAC-AM) compound also exhibits excellent resistance and buffering capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacrylamides 3aaluminum 3aammonium chloride 3aammonium nitrogen 3acoal 3aferric chloride 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3alamps 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aphenols 3apolymerization 3aspectrometers 3aturbidity 3aurea 3awastewater 3aChina 0aCoal chemical wastewater 0aCationic flocculant 0aCoagulation 0aPretreatment1 aZhou, Shengbao1 aSun, Yongjun1 aXu, Yanhua0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2021 Jan., v. 99 p.239-248dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245011000168300001800278520164900296592002801945650004401973650001302017650001202030650002202042650002302064650001502087650000902102650002102111650006602132650001902198650001902217653002302236653001502259653001602274653001302290653001802303653003702321700001802358700002002376700001902396773012302415856007502538852000902613655001202622IND60527845120221121121209.0160715e20140312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052784512DNAL7 a10.1021/am405868j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Priyadarshi10aImproved Mechanical and Electronic Properties of Co-assembled Folic Acid Gel with Aniline and Polyaniline  ap. 3615-3622.  aCo-assembled folic acid (F) gel with aniline (ANI) (ANI:F = 1:2, w/w) is produced at 2% (w/v) concentration in water/DMSO (1:1, v/v) mixture. The gel is rigid and on polymerization of the gel pieces in aqueous ammonium persulfate solution co-assembled folic acid - polyaniline (F-PANI) gel is formed. Both the co-assembled F-ANI and F-PANI gels have fibrillar network morphology, the fiber diameter and its degree of branching increase significantly from those of F gel. WAXS pattern indicates co-assembled structure with the F fiber at the core and ANI/PANI at its outer surface and the co-assembly is occurring in both F-ANI and F-PANI systems through noncovalent interaction of H-bonding and π stacking processes between the components. FTIR and UV–vis spectra characterize the doped PANI formation and the MALDI mass spectrometry indicates the degree of polymerization of polyaniline in the range 24-653. The rheological experiments support the signature of gel formation in the co-assembled state and the storage (G′) and loss (G″) modulii increase in the order F gel< F-ANI gel < F-PANI gel, showing the highest increase in G′ ≈ 1100% for the F-PANI gel. The stress at break, elasticity, and stiffness also increase in the same order. The dc-conductivity of F-ANI and F-PANI xerogels is 2 and 7 orders higher than that of F xerogel. Besides, the current (I)–voltage (V) curves indicate that the F-xerogel is insulator, but F-ANI xerogel is semiconductor showing both electronic memory and rectification; on the other hand, the F-PANI xerogel exhibits a negative differential resistance (NDR) property with a NDR ratio of 3.0.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aammonium 3aaniline 3acomputer hardware 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afolic acid 3agels 3ahydrogen bonding 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apolymerization 3asemiconductors 0asupramolecular gel 0afolic acid 0apolyaniline 0arheology 0arectification 0anegative differential resistance1 aBairi, Partha1 aRoy, Bappaditya1 aNandi, Arun K.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Mar. 12, v. 6, no. 5 p.3615-3622dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam405868j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015200174520152500326592002801851650001701879650002501896650001601921650001901937650001801956650001301974650001301987650001202000650001202012650002002024650001002044650002802054650001002082650001702092650001802109650001302127650001402140650001702154650001202171650001202183650001302195653003102208653001102239653001302250653001202263700001802275700002302293700002102316700002502337700001902362700002102381700002302402700002102425700002102446700001802467700001902485700002102504773012102525856008302646852000902729655001202738IND60674295020221118021837.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067429502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.1086352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakayama, Shouta M.M.10aAvian interspecific differences in VKOR activity and inhibition: Insights from amino acid sequence and mRNA expression ratio of VKORC1 and VKORC1L1  aWorldwide use of anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) for rodents control has frequently led to secondary poisoning of non-target animals, especially raptors. In order to suggest some factors that may help considering the mechanism of the incidents, this study focused on the avian vitamin K 2, 3-epoxide reductase (VKOR) that is the target protein of ARs. We addressed the interspecific differences in VKOR activity and inhibition related to amino acid sequence and mRNA expression of VKORC1 and VKORC1-like1 (VKORC1L1). Poultry have been considered to be more tolerant to ARs than mammals. However, VKOR activity of owls, hawks, falcon and surprisingly, canaries, was lower and inhibited by warfarin more easily than that of chickens and turkeys. The amino acid sequence of VKORC1 and VKORC1L1 implied that the value of Ki for VKOR activity to ARs could depend on the amino acid at position 140 in the TYX warfarin-binding motif in VKORC1, and other amino acid mutations in VKORC1L1. The mRNA expression ratio of VKORC1:VKORC1L1 differed between turkey (8:1) and chicken (2:3) liver. VKORC1L1 has been reported to be resistant to warfarin compared to VKORC1. Hence, both the Ki of specific VKORC1 and VKORC1L1, and the mRNA expression ratio would cause avian interspecific difference of the VKOR inhibition. Our study also suggested the high inhibition of VKOR activities in raptors and surprisingly that in canaries as well.

Since hydrology plays a fundamental role in wetland ecological functioning and determines wetland sensitivity to human disturbances, the characterization of anthropogenic impacts on wetland hydrology in the AOSR is necessary to assess wetland resilience and to improve current best management practices. As such, this paper reviews the impacts of oil sands development and related disturbances including infrastructure construction, gravel extraction, and land clearing on wetland function in the AOSR. Hydrologic disturbances in wetlands in the AOSR include changes to soil hydrophysical properties that control water table position, the interruption of recharge–discharge patterns, and alteration of micrometeorological conditions; these in turn govern wetland ecological structure and wetland ecosystem processes (e.g., evapotranspiration, nutrient cycling). Given that anthropogenic disturbance can affect natural wetland succession, long-term hydrological monitoring is crucial for predicting the response of these ecosystems to varying levels of human impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abedrock 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3agravel 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3alandscapes 3aoils 3asubhumid zones 3atopography 3awater table 3awetlands 0ahydrologic functioning 0aAthabasca Oil Sands Region 0ahuman disturbance 0aanthropogenic impact1 aElmes, Matthew1 aPetrone, Richard1 aKessel, Eric1 aGreen, Adam1 aCobbaert, Danielle1 aPrice, Jonathan0 tEnvironmental reviews.g2020, v. 28, no. 3 p.246-261dNRC Research PresswJournal:18950x1208-60537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2019-00403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012300170300001600293520172600309592002802035650002502063650001602088650001502104650001602119650001502135650002402150650001502174650001402189650001202203650001802215650002302233650002002256650001602276650001902292650001802311650001402329653001802343653001402361653001602375653001802391653002502409653002002434700001902454700002102473700002402494700002202518773012102540856008202661852000902743655001202752IND60611857520221117232742.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061185752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadeira, Carolina10aComparing biomarker responses during thermal acclimation: A lethal vs non-lethal approach in a tropical reef clownfish  ap. 104-112.  aKnowledge of thermal stress biology for most tropical fish species in reef ecosystems under climate change is still quite limited. Thus, the objective of this study was to measure the time-course changes of thermal stress biomarkers in the commercially exploited coral reef fish Amphiprion ocellaris, during a laboratory simulated event of increased temperature. Heat shock protein 70kDa (Hsp70) and total ubiquitin (Ub) were determined in the muscle (lethal method) and in the fin (non-lethal alternative method) under two temperature treatments (control – 26°C and elevated temperature – 30°C) throughout one month with weekly samplings. Results suggest that biomarker basal levels are tissue-specific and influence the degree of response under temperature exposure. Responses were highly inducible in the muscle but not in fin tissue, indicating that the latter is not reliable for monitoring purposes. Thermal stress was observed in the muscle after one week of exposure (both biomarkers increased significantly) and Ub levels then decreased, suggesting the animals were able to acclimate by maintaining high levels of Hsp70 and through an effective protein turnover. In addition, the results show that mortality rates did not differ between treatments. This indicates that A. ocellaris is capable of displaying a plastic response to elevated temperature by adjusting the protein quality control system to protect cell functions, without decreasing survival. Thus, this coral reef fish species presents a significant acclimation potential under ocean warming scenarios of +4°C. Monitoring of thermal stress through a non-lethal method, fin-clipping, although desirable proved to be inadequate for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphiprion ocellaris 3aacclimation 3abiomarkers 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3aheat shock proteins 3amonitoring 3amortality 3amuscles 3aocean warming 3aprotein metabolism 3aquality control 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3atropical fish 3aubiquitin 0aBiomonitoring 0aClownfish 0aCoral reefs 0aEcophysiology 0aMolecular biomarkers 0aThermal biology1 aMadeira, Diana1 aDiniz, Mário S.1 aCabral, Henrique N.1 aVinagre, Catarina0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Feb., v. 204 p.104-112dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245014100202300001800343520200300361592002802364650002102392650002702413650002202440650001402462650002402476650001902500650001402519650000702533650002402540650001302564700006102577700005302638773016202691856008202853852000902935655001202944IND60688497520221119153008.0200414e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068849752DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02651-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarank, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3437-450510aElectro-activated peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate oxidation of leachate nanofiltration concentrate: multiple-response optimization  ap. 2707-2720.  aIn this study, the performance of electro-peroxymonosulfate and electro-peroxydisulfate methods in biologically stabilized leachate nanofiltration concentrate treatment was investigated. To increase treatability and biodegradability of the concentrated leachate was aimed. Central composite design was applied for the optimization of process parameters and development of mathematical model. Variance analyses were performed to attain the interaction among the responses and process variables and to analyze the data. Second-order regression models were developed by Statgraphics Centurion XVI.I software program in order to estimate the removal efficiencies. Model’s correlation coefficients for COD removal through electro-peroxymonosulfate and electro-peroxydisulfate processes were determined to be 0.8769 and 0.8910, respectively, expressing conformity of the experimental data to the model. COD removal rates obtained through electro-peroxymonosulfate and electro-peroxydisulfate processes under optimum conditions (HSO₅⁻/COD ratio: 2.5, current: 1.8 A, pH: 6.4 and reaction time: 35.9 min for electro-peroxymonosulfate process and S₂O₈⁻²/COD ratio: 1.9, current: 2.1 A, pH: 5.1 and reaction time: 32.3 min for electro-peroxydisulfate process) were determined as 84.2% and 79.6%, respectively. Before advanced treatment processes, the biodegradable COD fraction of leachate nanofiltration concentrate was 12.7% and the soluble COD fraction was 78.3%. After electro-peroxymonosulfate process, biodegradable COD fraction increased to the value of 44.6% and the soluble COD fraction increased to the value of 90.5%, whereas after electro-peroxydisulfate process, biodegradable COD fraction increased to the value of 37.5% and the soluble COD fraction increased to the value of 87.4%. The results of the study showed that electro-peroxymonosulfate and electro-peroxydisulfate oxidation processes were effective treatment methods for leachate concentrates with low biodegradability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3achemical oxygen demand 3acomputer software 3aleachates 3amathematical models 3ananofiltration 3aoxidation 3apH 3aregression analysis 3avariance1 aYazici Guvenc, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2877-09771 aDemir, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4649-33680 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2020 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.2707-2720dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-020-02651-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001800285520109400303592002801397650001601425650001801441650001101459650001401470650001301484650001901497650002001516653001701536653001801553653001701571653001701588653001901605653001101624653001501635700006001650700002101710700001901731700002301750773009601773856008101869852000901950655001201959IND60724890320221121025127.0210124e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072489032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmusan, Lekan M.10aData exploration on factors that influences construction cost and time performance on construction project sites  ap. 1320-1325.  aThis data article explores the factors that contribute to maintaining steady cost projection on construction projects. The data was obtained using structured questionnaire designed in Likert scale. The responses were solicited from category of construction practitioners. Simple random sampling was employed in the distribution of the questionnaires to the respondents. Data samples were analysed using severity index, ranking and simple percentages. The analysis of the data brought to fore some important data on factors that causes cost overrun, they include: contractor's inexperience, inadequate planning, inflation, incessant variation order, and change in project design. They are critical to causing cost overrun, while project complexity, shortening of project period and fraudulent practices are found to be responsible. The data fall within the percentages of possible consequences of cost overrun when compared with those available in scientific literature. The data can provide insights on how to mitigate the risks of project deviation from initial cost and as-built project.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontractors 3adata analysis 3adesign 3ainflation 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3arisk management 0aLikert scale 0aQuestionnaire 0aConstruction 0aCost overrun 0aSeverity index 0aSurvey 0aStatistics1 aAfolabi, Adedeji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9065-47661 aOjelabi, Raphael1 aOmuh, Ignatius1 aOkagbue, Hilary I.0 tData in Brief.g2018 Apr., v. 17 p.1320-1325dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245009700200300001600297500001900313520122700332592002801559650002201587650001801609650001701627650001201644650001401656650000901670650002401679650001301703650001901716650001901735650001901754653001901773653001801792653001101810700001501821700001501836700001501851700001501866700001301881700005301894700001501947773014701962856008302109852000902192655001202201IND60705435120221118234913.0200907e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070543512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3933-849010aAqueous synthesis of PEGylated Ag2S quantum dots and their in vivo tumor targeting behavior  ap. 930-935.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith significantly decreased light scattering and tissue autofluorescence, fluorescence imaging in the second near infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) region has been heavily explored in biomedical field recently. Silver sulfide quantum dots (Ag₂S QDs) with unique optical properties were one of the most classic NIR-II imaging probes. However, the Ag₂S QDs for in vivo purpose were mainly obtain by oil phase-based high-temperature route at present. Here, we proposed a mild aqueous route to prepare NIR-II emissive Ag₂S QDs for in vivo tumor imaging. Original Ag₂S QDs was obtained by mixing sodium sulfide and silver nitrate in a thiol-terminated polyethylene glycol (mPEG-SH) solution. Treating the original Ag₂S QDs with extra mPEG-SH ligands produced highly PEGyalted Ag₂S QDs. These re-PEGylated Ag₂S QDs exhibited much better blood circulation and tumor accumulation in vivo comparing with the original ones, which can serve as excellent tumor imaging probes. The whole-body blood vessel imaging of living mice was achieved with high resolution, the bio-distribution of these QDs were studied by NIR-II imaging as well. This work also highlighted the importance of ligand density for tumor targeting.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood circulation 3ablood vessels 3afluorescence 3aligands 3aneoplasms 3aoils 3apolyethylene glycol 3aresearch 3asilver nitrate 3asilver sulfide 3asodium sulfide 0aLigand density 0aTumor imaging 0aNIR-II1 aJu, Wenwen1 aZhao, Ning1 aZhao, Ting1 aZhan, Chen1 aWang, Qi1 aFan, Quli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9387-01651 aHuang, Wei0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 529, no. 4 p.930-935dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007200169300001800241520081800259592002801077596006401105650001101169650002401180650001801204650001701222650001001239650001201249650001801261700001801279700006001297700001401357773016201371856008201533852000901615655001201624IND60688497620221119152946.0200414e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068849762DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02655-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWierzchowski, K.10aCharacterization of unburned carbon separated from power plant slag  ap. 2499-2510.  aThis article presents the results of slag property studies, for characterization of unburned carbon separated.

The successful tests on carbon particle separation using: the magnetic separation, separation in heavy liquids with magnetic separation of light ends and separation in a rising water stream with magnetic separation of the overflow methods, were performed. At laboratory scale and with using similarly rising water stream with magnetic separation methods, concentrates with 71–85% loss-on-ignition were obtained. Using gravitational separation method and magnetic separation, concentrates with 57–86.5% loss-on-ignition were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data  aDZP/ERA-MIN-III/129/2016cNarodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju 3acarbon 3amagnetic separation 3aparticle size 3apower plants 3aslags 3astreams 3asurface water1 aBiałecka, B.1 aCalus Moszko, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5392-76571 aKlupa, A.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2020 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.2499-2510dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-020-02655-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009200162300001600254500001900270520093300289592002801222650001401250650002201264650001901286650001101305650001101316650001501327653001801342653002501360653003001385653001401415700001601429700001201445700001701457700001801474700002001492773010901512856007601621852000901697655001201706IND60708369020221116232118.0200824s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070836902DNAL7 a10.1139/er-2019-00652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pengcheng10aEcological revetments for enhanced interception of nonpoint source pollutants: a review  ap. 262-268.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe riparian zone is a transitional zone between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and is also the only passage for surface runoff to enter a river. The role of the riparian zone as a means for intercepting nonpoint source (NPS) pollution has been receiving growing attention and, in recent years, various ecological revetments have been developed to strengthen the interception of runoff pollutants. This research reviews the current development of ecological revetments in terms of NPS pollution control with a focus on the key functions and optimization methods of vegetation allocation and substrate configuration. Future research on improving the ecological revetments for enhanced NPS pollution control are also highlighted. This review is intended to provide a technical reference for the optimization and implementation of ecological revetment projects, and possible pathways for the effective control of NPS pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3apollution 3apollution control 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3arunoff 3avegetation 0ariparian zone 0aecological revetment 0anonpoint source pollution 0asubstrate1 aDing, Jiaqi1 aHe, Yan1 aWang, Difang1 aCao, Chengjin1 aHuang, Minsheng0 tEnvironmental reviews.g2020, v. 28, no. 3 p.262-268dNRC Research PresswJournal:18950x1208-60537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2019-00653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007900158300001800237520116900255592002801424650001401452650001601466650001101482650000801493650001601501650001301517650002101530650001301551653002001564653003001584653001501614653002201629653002801651653003601679700002201715700002101737773012301758856007501881852000901956655001201965IND60527845420221121121159.0160715e20140312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052784542DNAL7 a10.1021/am40591492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehta, Prateek10aIdentifying Potential BO2 Oxide Polymorphs for Epitaxial Growth Candidates  ap. 3630-3639.  aTransition metal dioxides (BO₂) exhibit a number of polymorphic structures with distinct properties, but the isolation of different polymorphs for a given composition is carried out using trial and error experimentation. We present computational studies of the relative stabilities and equations of state for six polymorphs (anatase, brookite, rutile, columbite, pyrite, and fluorite) of five different BO₂ dioxides (B = Ti, V, Ru, Ir, and Sn). These properties were computed in a consistent fashion using several exchange correlation functionals within the density functional theory formalism, and the effects of the different functionals are discussed relative to their impact on predictive synthesis. We compare the computational results to prior observations of high-pressure synthesis and epitaxial film growth and then use this discussion to predict new accessible polymorphs in the context of epitaxial stabilization using isostructural substrates. For example, the relative stabilities of the columbite polymorph for VO₂ and RuO₂ are similar to those of TiO₂ and SnO₂, the latter two of which have been previously stabilized as epitaxial films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amethodology 3apyrite 3atin 3atin dioxide 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3avanadium 0aoxide polymorph 0adensity functional theory 0ametastable 0aequation of state 0aepitaxial stabilization 0aexchange correlation functional1 aSalvador, Paul A.1 aKitchin, John R.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Mar. 12, v. 6, no. 5 p.3630-3639dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40591493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009200170300001400262520174800276592002802024650001402052650001602066650001402082650000902096650001102105650002202116650001402138650001202152650001502164650002302179650001502202650001402217650001702231650001502248650000902263700001602272700001702288773009402305856008102399852000902480655001202489IND60575241120221119094023.0170728e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057524112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-002-0944-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Richard B.10aTissue-specific induction of herbivore resistance: seaweed response to amphipod grazing  ap. 68-76.  aTissues within individual plants can vary greatly in the strength of their constitutive (i.e., permanent) and induced resistance to herbivores. Optimal defense theory predicts that defenses should be allocated among tissues in proportion to the value of the tissues to the plant and the tissue-specific risk of attack by grazers. We examined the relationship between tissue value and defense in the highly-differentiated brown seaweed Sargassum filipendula. Tissues within S. filipendula varied widely in palatability to the herbivorous amphipod Ampithoe longimana, with younger tissues preferred over older tissues and blades preferred over stipes. Old stipes (at the base of the plant), which linked the other tissues to the seafloor and were thus the most valuable tissue to the plant, were defended constitutively and resisted amphipod grazing by virtue of their toughness rather than via deterrent chemistry. Induction of resistance as a result of amphipod grazing occurred only in the top stipes, which contain the meristematic tissue responsible for future growth. Induction in the top stipes was not due to toughness or other structural properties, as the unpalatability persisted when top stipes were dried, ground to a fine powder, and reconstituted into an agar matrix. This suggests that the induced resistance to grazing resulted from an increase in chemical defenses. The demonstration of constitutive or induced defenses in only the more valuable tissues of the seaweed is consistent with predictions of optimal defense theory. Our finding of induction due to mesograzer (amphipod) feeding is also consistent with the notion that it is these small, more sedentary, herbivores that are most likely to induce defenses in seaweeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aFilipendula 3aSargassum 3aagar 3ablades 3achemical defenses 3achemistry 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3ainduced resistance 3amacroalgae 3ameristems 3apalatability 3aprediction 3arisk1 aSotka, Erik1 aHay, Mark E.0 tOecologia.g2002 June, v. 132, no. 1 p.68-76dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-0944-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03683naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011900165520184000284592002802124650001602152650001902168650001902187650001102206650002502217650001602242650002402258650001002282650001302292650002102305650001802326650001402344650000902358650001002367650001602377650002302393650001002416650002002426650001202446650002102458650002302479650001702502650002802519650001102547650001602558650002502574650001502599650001502614653001502629653001602644653002102660653002002681653002002701653002302721700001902744700001402763700001602777700001502793773012102808856008302929852000903012655001203021IND60674295420221118022135.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067429542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.1086402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guihua10aInduction of time- and dose-dependent oxidative stress of triazophos to brain and liver in zebrafish (Danio rerio)  aExtensive use of triazophos for the chemical control of pests in agriculture or aquaculture might strongly disturb the aquatic environment due to residue accumulation through various routes like surface run-off, spray-drift and effluent from factories, which have potential negative effects to non-target aquatic organisms. Previous studies have documented the antioxidative effects of triazophos to mammals, however, the oxidative toxicity of triazophos to fish has not been adequately studied to date. Thus, an acute exposure (96 h) to triazophos at different concentrations of 0.06, 0.3 and 1.5 mg/L (corresponding to 1/50th, 1/10th and 1/2th of 96 h-LC50, respectively), was conducted to investigate the triazophos-induced oxidative stress in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results showed that the time- and dose-dependent induction of oxidative stress except for the ROS level in liver after 24 and 48 h exposure, as indicated by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) level and a compromised antioxidant defense system, including increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione (GSH) content as well as the increased at first and decreased afterwards genes expression (Sod1, Sod2, Cat and Gpx) in brain. Simultaneously, ROS and MDA showed an increased trend, SOD activity, CAT activity and GSH content showed a trend of increasing at 24 h and decreasing at 48 h, and then increasing at 96 h and Sod1, Sod2, Cat and Gpx gene showed decreasing at first and then increasing in liver tissue. The present study concluded that the damage of the antioxidant system by triazophos induced oxidative stress in the brain and liver of zebrafish with concomitant lipid peroxidation, which is an important mechanism underlying the triazophos-induced acute toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacute exposure 3aacute toxicity 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaculture 3aaquatic environment 3abrain 3acatalase 3achemical control 3adose response 3afactories 3afish 3agenes 3aglutathione 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3amammals 3aoxidative stress 3aoxidative toxicity 3apest control 3areactive oxygen species 3arunoff 3aspray drift 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriazophos 3awastewater 0aTriazophos 0aDanio rerio 0aOxidative stress 0aEnzyme activity 0aGene expression 0aLipid peroxidation1 aXiong, Dongmei1 aWu, Manni1 aWang, Lixin1 aYang, Jing0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2020 Feb., v. 228 p.108640-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.1086403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012500165300001600290520175100306592002802057650001202085650002502097650001402122650000902136650001302145650001402158650001502172650001502187650002302202650001702225650001202242650001302254653001402267653001602281653001302297653002502310700001902335700001702354773012102371856008202492852000902574655001202583IND60611857820221119093545.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061185782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Li-Juan10aDigesting or swimming? Integration of the postprandial metabolism, behavior and locomotion in a frequently foraging fish  ap. 205-210.  aFish that are active foragers usually perform routine activities while digesting their food; thus, their postprandial swimming capacity and related behavior adjustments might be ecologically important. To test whether digestion affect swimming performance and the relationships of digestion with metabolism and behavior in an active forager, we investigated the postprandial metabolic response, spontaneous swimming activities, critical swimming speed (Ucrit), and fast-start escape performance of both fasted and digesting (3h after feeding to satiation) juvenile rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus). Feeding to satiation elicited a 50% increase in the oxygen consumption rate, which peaked at 3h after feeding and returned to the prefeeding state after another 3h. However, approximately 50% and 90% of individuals resumed feeding behavior at 2 and 3h postfeeding, respectively, although the meal size varied substantially. Digestion showed no effect on either steady swimming performance as suggested by the Ucrit or unsteady swimming performance indicated by the maximum linear velocity in fast-start escape movement. However, digesting fish showed more spontaneous activity as indicated by the longer total distance traveled, mainly through an increased percentage of time spent moving (PTM). A further analysis found that fasting individuals with high swimming speed were more inclined to increase their PTM during digestive processes. The present study suggests that as an active forager With a small meal size and hence limited postprandial physiological and morphological changes, the swimming performance of rose bitterling is maintained during digestion, which might be crucial for its active foraging mode and anti-predation strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodeus 3abiochemical pathways 3adigestion 3afish 3aforaging 3ajuveniles 3alocomotion 3ametabolism 3aoxygen consumption 3aportion size 3asatiety 3aswimming 0aDigestion 0aCompetition 0aPriority 0aSwimming performance1 aCao, Zhen-Dong1 aFu, Shi-Jian0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Feb., v. 204 p.205-210dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013300165300001600298500001900314520120700333592002801540650003201568650002101600650002601621650001801647650002501665650001901690650001001709650001001719650002401729650002901753650001301782650002301795650001801818653003001836653001901866653003301885653003101918653001801949653002201967653000901989653001001998653002002008700002102028700001902049700001802068700001702086700002302103700005702126700002102183773014702204856008302351852000902434655001202443IND60705435320221118235054.0200824e20200924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070543532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Yuya10aAntimicrobial antisense RNA delivery to F-pili producing multidrug-resistant bacteria via a genetically engineered bacteriophage  ap. 533-540.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMultidrug-resistant bacteria are a growing issue worldwide. This study developed a convenient and effective method to downregulate the expression of a specific gene to produce a novel antimicrobial tool using a small (140 nucleotide) RNA with a 24-nucleotide antisense (as) region from an arabinose-inducible expression phagemid vector in Escherichia coli. Knockdown effects of rpoS encoding RNA polymerase sigma factor were observed using this inducible artificial asRNA approach. asRNAs targeting several essential E. coli genes produced significant growth defects, especially when targeted to acpP and ribosomal protein coding genes rplN, rplL, and rpsM. Growth inhibited phenotypes were facilitated in hfq⁻ conditions. Phage lysates were prepared from cells harboring phagemids as a lethal-agent delivery tool. Targeting the rpsM gene by phagemid-derived M13 phage infection of E. coli containing a carbapenem-producing F-plasmid and multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae containing an F-plasmid resulted in the death of over 99.99% of infected bacteria. This study provides a possible strategy for treating bacterial infection and can be applied to any F-pilus producing bacterial species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aantisense RNA 3abacterial infections 3abacteriophages 3adeath 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3amultiple drug resistance 3aresearch 3aribosomal proteins 3asigma factors 0aCis-encoded antisense RNA 0aGene silencing 0aMultidrug-resistant bacteria 0aF-pilus producing bacteria 0aPhage therapy 0aRibosomal protein 0asRNA 0aasRNA 0achloramphenicol1 aIshimoto, Takumi1 aFujita, Shouta1 aKiryu, Sachie1 aWada, Mamoru1 aAkatsuka, Takahiro1 aSaito, Mineki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8208-55861 aKawano, Mitsuoki0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 530, no. 3 p.533-540dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007600169300001800245520101100263592002801274650001901302650001201321650001601333650001301349650001101362650001601373650002101389650001501410651001101425700001801436773009601454856008101550852000901631655001201640IND60724890620221120160924.0210124e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072489062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Agostino, Delia10aData on cost-optimal Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) across Europe  ap. 1168-1174.  aThis data article refers to the research paper A model for the cost-optimal design of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) in representative climates across Europe [1]. The reported data deal with the design optimization of a residential building prototype located in representative European locations. The study focus on the research of cost-optimal choices and efficiency measures in new buildings depending on the climate. The data linked within this article relate to the modelled building energy consumption, renewable production, potential energy savings, and costs. Data allow to visualize energy consumption before and after the optimization, selected efficiency measures, costs and renewable production. The reduction of electricity and natural gas consumption towards the NZEB target can be visualized together with incremental and cumulative costs in each location. Further data is available about building geometry, costs, CO₂ emissions, envelope, materials, lighting, appliances and systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aelectricity 3ageometry 3amodels 3anatural gas 3apotential energy 3aprototypes 3aEurope1 aParker, Danny0 tData in Brief.g2018 Apr., v. 17 p.1168-1174dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008500170300001600255520147500271592002801746650002201774650001701796650002501813650001601838650001301854650001401867650001601881650002001897650001501917651001601932653002101948653001701969653002801986653002202014653002002036653001602056700002902072700002002101700001702121773012502138856008302263852000902346655001202355IND50071203320221119072548.0190318e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007120332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakker, Martha M.10aTrends in soil–land-use relationships in the Netherlands between 1900 and 1990  ap. 134-143.  aThe distribution of agricultural land use today is less dependent on soil properties than in the past, as a result of technological advances. This fact has long been suspected by scientists from different disciplines, but the changing relationships between specific soil types and specific forms of land use have so far not been tested quantitatively. In this paper, we have quantified the association between soil type and land use for the Netherlands, for the years 1900, 1960, 1980 and 1990. For our analyses, we distinguished 21 soil groups and four land use classes. Cramer's V was used as a statistical measure to quantify the association.As a general trend, we find that associations are indeed weakening: intrinsically poor sandy soils became increasingly cultivated, while intrinsically rich soils are no longer reserved exclusively for crop cultivation. This general trend does not apply to all soil types, however: drift sands and other coarse sandy soils where large-scale mechanization was impeded by an undulating topography remained uncultivated. Moreover, even though the trend of a decrease in association is very clear we have several reasons to think that it may not decrease further in future. One reason is that inputs such as fertilizers which influenced the trend over the period 1900–1990, are nowadays less used than two decades ago as a result of environmental policies. Other reasons are the growing support for geoheritage and biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abiodiversity 3aenvironmental policy 3afertilizers 3aland use 3alandforms 3asandy soils 3asoil properties 3atopography 3aNetherlands 0aLand use pattern 0aSoil pattern 0aStatistical association 0aHistorical trends 0aThe Netherlands 0aAgriculture1 aSonneveld, Marthijn P.W.1 aBrookhuis, Bart1 aKuhlman, Tom0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 181 p.134-143dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01648naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245007600164300001800240500001500258520064400273592002800917650001800945650000900963650001200972653001700984700001801001700002301019700001801042700001901060700001501079773013201094856007501226852000901301655001201310IND60538568520221119222414.0160815e20120613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053856852DNAL7 a10.1021/ja303480a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLichtenberg, Crispin10aBis(allyl)zinc Revisited: Sigma versus Pi Bonding of Allyl Coordination  ap. 9805-9811.  a2019-12-06  aThe reinvestigation of two allyl zinc compounds, parent bis(allyl)zinc [Zn(C₃H₅)₂] (1) and 2-methallyl chloro zinc [Zn(C₄H₇)Cl] (2), revealed two new coordination modes in the solid state for the allyl ligand, viz cis- and trans-μ₂-η¹:η¹.

The emergence of zoonotic Onchocerca lupi in North America and reports of cervid-associated zoonotic onchocerciasis by Onchocerca jakutensis highlight the need for increased entomological surveillance. In addition, there is mounting evidence that Onchocerca diversity in North America is far greater than previously thought, currently regarded as Onchocerca cervipedis species complex. This study reports new geographic records and black fly vector associations of an uncharacterized Onchocerca species. METHODS: To better understand the biodiversity and geographic distribution of Onchocerca, 485 female black flies (2015: 150, 2016: 335) were collected using CO₂-baited traps from February to October 2015–2016 in Lake County, northern California, USA. Individual flies were morphologically identified and pooled (≤ 10 individuals) by species, collection date, and trap location. Black fly pools were processed for DNA extraction, and subsequent PCR and sequencing targeting of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene of filarioids. RESULTS: Among the pools of black flies, there were 158 individuals of Simulium tescorum (2015: 57, 2016: 101), 302 individuals of Simulium vittatum (sensu lato [s.l.]) (2015: 82, 2016: 220), 16 individuals of Simulium clarum “black” phenotype (2015: 5, 2016: 11), and 13 individuals of S. clarum “orange” phenotype (2015: 6, 2016: 7). PCR analysis revealed the percentage of filarioid-positive pools were 7.50% (n = 3) for S. tescorum, 3.75% (n = 3) for S. vittatum (s.l., likely S. tribulatum), 7.69% (n = 1) for S. clarum “black” phenotype, and no positives for S. clarum “orange” phenotype. Genetic distance and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the northern California Onchocerca isolates belong to the same species reported in black flies from southern California (average pairwise comparison: 0.32%), and seem closely related to Onchocerca isolates of white-tailed deer from upstate New York (average pairwise comparison: 2.31%). CONCLUSION: A cryptic Onchocerca species was found in Lake County, California, and may be a part of a larger, continentally distributed species complex rather than a single described species of North America. In addition, there are at least three putative vectors of black flies (S. clarum, S. tescorum, S. vittatum) associated with this cryptic Onchocerca species. A comprehensive reassessment of North American Onchocerca biodiversity, host, and geographic range is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aOnchocerca 3aSimulium vittatum 3aarthropods 3abiodiversity 3afemales 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3ageographical distribution 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aonchocerciasis 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3awildlife 3aCalifornia 3aNew York1 aNelson, Kimberly J.1 aMorales, Alana M.1 aRyan, Bonnie M.1 aKoschik, Michelle L.1 aScott, Jamesina J.1 aVerocai, Guilherme G.0 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.478-478dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04990-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245008300152300002000235520118600255592002801441650001501469650001501484650002301499650001101522650001401533650002101547650001201568650000901580650001001589650001701599650002801616650000901644650004401653650001301697650001701710650002401727650001701751650001601768700001601784700001401800700001501814700001601829773012501845856007401970852000902044655001202053IND60641125520221121233704.0190505e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064112552DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17766b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jin10aSol–gel derived mesoporous GaAlPO₄ glass for heavy metal ion sequestration  ap. 99149-99157.  aMesoporous phosphate materials with chemical diversity and a high surface area are essential for their practical applications as heavy metal ion adsorbent materials.

The glass structure and its evolution from the gel to the final glass were monitored using solid-state NMR techniques, providing detailed insight into the reaction mechanism. During the formation of the mesoporous GaAlPO₄ glass, the gallium entered into the PO₄ tetrahedron via Ga–O–P bonds. The resulting mesoporous glass samples were tested as adsorbents to remove Pb(ii) anions from solution and the ternary oxide glasses show high adsorption capacities (>36.63 mg g⁻¹, that is 0.18 mmol g⁻¹). Owing to their integrated features (including their variable compositions, high specific surface area, tunable pore size and shape flexibility) as well as specific acid–base surface properties, such mesoporous gallium aluminum phosphate materials are also expected to have potential either as catalysts or catalyst supports for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum phosphate 3aanions 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3agallium 3agels 3aglass 3aheavy metals 3aindustrial applications 3alead 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aporosity 3aporous media 3areaction mechanisms 3asurface area 3asurfactants1 aMa, Pengfei1 aZhang, Ge1 aLi, Rihong1 aZhang, Long0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 18, v. 6, no. 101 p.99149-99157dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17766b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002700169245007800196300001600274520200900290592002802299653003502327653001602362653001202378653001202390653001602402653002302418653002202441653002402463653002002487653002202507653001302529700002402542700002302566700002202589700001902611773010602630856011702736852000902853655001202862IND60131282720221118045516.0151127e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013128272DNAL7 a10.2193/0022-541X(2005)069[0739:BPOCLO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOVING, CHRISTOPHER L.10aBroad-scale predictors of canada lynx occurrence in eastern north america  ap. 739-751.  aThe Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) is listed as a threatened species throughout the southern extent of its geographic range in the United States. Most research on lynx has been conducted in the western United States and Canada; little is known about the ecology of lynx in eastern North America. To fill critical knowledge gaps about this species, we modeled and mapped lynx occurrence using habitat and weather data from 7 eastern states and 3 Canadian provinces. Annual snowfall, road density, bobcat (L. rufus) harvest, deciduous forest, and coniferous forest were compared at 1,150 lynx locations and 1,288 random locations. Nineteen a priori models were developed using the information––theoretic approach, and logistic regression models were ranked using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and by our ability to correctly classify reserved data (Kappa). Annual snowfall and deciduous forest predicted lynx presence and absence for a reserved dataset (n == 278) with 94%% accuracy. A map of the probability of lynx occurrence throughout the region revealed that 92%% of the potential habitat (i.e., >50%% probability of occurrence) was concentrated in a relatively contiguous complex encompassing northern Maine, New Brunswick, and the Gaspéé peninsula of Quebec. Most of the remaining potential habitat (5%%) was on northern Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. Potential habitat in New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York was small (1,252 km²), fragmented, and isolated (>200 km) from known lynx populations. When federally listed as threatened in the contiguous United States in 2000, inadequate regulations on federal lands were cited as the primary threat to Canada lynx. However, the majority of potential lynx habitat in the eastern United States is on private lands and continuous with potential habitat in Canada. Therefore, lynx conservation in eastern North America will need to develop partnerships across national, state, and provincial boundaries as well as with private landowners.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAkaike's Information Criterion 0aCanada lynx 0aclimate 0ahabitat 0ainformation 0atheoretic approach 0alandscape ecology 0alogistic regression 0aLynx canadensis 0apredictive models 0asnowfall1 aHARRISON, DANIEL J.1 aKrohn, William B.,1 aJOSEPH, RONALD A.1 aO'Brien, Mike,0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2005 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.739-751dWildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F0022-541X%282005%29069%5B0739%3ABPOCLO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245008100212300001400293500001400307506007600321520092600397592002801323506003701351650001501388650001001403650001601413650001301429650001001442650001501452650001501467650001101482650001401493650001801507653002801525653001801553653002601571653001701597653002501614653002901639700001901668700002001687773009301707856008501800852000901885655001201894IND60690000020221207070711.0200424e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069000002DNAL7 a10.1080/19336934.2016.12215492doi7 aPMC53542372pmcid7 a275623402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashio, Soshiro10aHow tissue damage MET metabolism: Regulation of the systemic damage response  ap. 27-36.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLiving organisms experience tissue damage from both, the surrounding environment and from inside their bodies. Tissue repair/regeneration is triggered by local tissue injury to restore an injured, or lost, part of the body. Tissue damage results in a series of responses, not only locally but also systemically in distant tissues. In our recent publication, we established a “dual system” that induces spatiotemporal tissue damage simultaneously with gene manipulation in surrounding tissues. With this system, we demonstrated that appropriate regulation of methionine metabolism in the fat body is required for tissue repair in Drosophila wing discs, thus highlighting the importance of systemic damage response (SDR) in tissue repair. This “Extra View” aims to discuss our recent reports that propose methionine metabolism to be an essential part of SDR, together with related topics in several model organisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3adiscs 3aenvironment 3afat body 3agenes 3ametabolism 3amethionine 3amodels 3aorganisms 3atissue repair 0aDrosophila melanogaster 0aimaginal disc 0amethionine metabolism 0aregeneration 0aS-adenosylmethionine 0asystemic damage response1 aObata, Fumiaki1 aMiura, Masayuki0 tFly.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 11, no. 1 p.27-36dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19336934.2016.12215493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012200160300002000282520164500302592002801947650002101975650001101996650001602007650002102023650001302044650001102057700002202068700002002090773012502110856007402235852000902309655001202318IND60641125620221122005518.0190505e20160929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064112562DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17767k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakanishi, Waro10aNature of S₂Se₂ σ(4c–6e) at naphthalene 1,8-positions and models, elucidated by QTAIM dual functional analysis  ap. 93195-93204.  aThe nature of extended hypervalent interactions of the ᴮE–*–ᴬE–*–ᴬE–*–ᴮE type is elucidated for 1-(8-MeᴮEC₁₀H₆)ᴬE–ᴬE(C₁₀H₆ᴮEMe-8′)-1′, (1 (ᴬE, ᴮE) = (S, S), 2 (S, Se), 3 (Se, S) and 4 (Se, Se)) and models A–D, ᴮR₂ᴮE⋯(ᴬR)ᴬE–ᴬE(ᴬR)⋯ᴮEᴮR₂ (ᴬR, ᴮR = H and Me). QTAIM dual functional analysis, which we proposed recently, is applied to the analysis. Total electron energy densities Hb(rc) are plotted versus Hb(rc) − Vb(rc)/2 for the interactions at bond critical points (BCPs; *), where Vb(rc) show potential energy densities at BCPs. Data for the perturbed structures around the fully optimized structures are employed for the plots, in addition to those of the fully optimized ones. While the data for the fully optimized structures are analysed by the polar coordinate (R, θ) representation, those containing the perturbed structures are by (θₚ, κₚ): θₚ corresponds to the tangent line for the plot and κₚ is the curvature. While (R, θ) show the static nature, (θₚ, κₚ) represent the dynamic nature of interactions. All ᴬE–*–ᴬE interactions in 1–4 and models A–D are classified by the shard shell interactions and have the character of a weak covalent nature. The ᴬE–*–ᴮE interactions in 1–4 are all classified by the regular closed shell interactions. They are predicted to have the typical HB (hydrogen bond) nature with covalency for 1 and 2 but the nature of the molecular complex formation through CT for 3 and 4. The ᴬE–*–ᴮE interactions in models A–D are predicted to be weaker than those in 1–4.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3anaphthalene 3apotential energy 3aselenium 3asulfur1 aTsubomoto, Yutaka1 aHayashi, Satoko0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 29, v. 6, no. 95 p.93195-93204dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17767k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245019900171500002200370520102000392592002801412650004401440650002801484650001601512650003601528650002401564650002901588650001701617650002101634650002401655650002001679650001601699650001601715650001301731650000801744650001901752650001401771650002301785653006101808653005201869653008801921653004902009653003502058653004402093653004202137653001702179653000902196653002602205653002202231700001402253700001502267700001602282700001502298700001602313700001702329700002002346700001502366700001702381773008402398856008702482852000902569655001202578IND60659372620221120155259.0190822e20190817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065937262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1253802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhongqin10aInsight into the inactivation mechanism of soybean Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor (BBTI) induced by epigallocatechin gallate and epigallocatechin: fluorescence, thermodynamics and docking studies  aPre-press version  aSoybean Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor (BBTI), an antinutritional factor of soy products, could strongly inhibit the protein digestion. The inactivation effect and mechanism of BBTI induced by tea polyphenols (TPs) and its major components (EGCG and EGC), were investigated in this study using fluorescence, FTIR, CD spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and molecular docking. EGCG and EGC interacted with BBTI via static quenching process and hydrophobic interaction, with binding constant (Ka) of 2.19 × 103 M−1 and 0.25 × 103 M−1 at 298 K, respectively. TPs, EGCG and EGC induced a transition of BBTI conformation from disorder to order. ITC analysis and molecular docking revealed the interaction of EGCG-BBTI and EGC-BBTI were spontaneous, and hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds were the predominant forces. Overall, this study clearly suggested that EGCG could be a promising inactivating agent for BBTI, which could also improve the safety and nutritional value of soy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantinutritional factors 3acalorimetry 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomputer simulation 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3anutritive value 3apolyphenols 3aproteolysis 3asoybeans 3atea 3athermodynamics 3atitration 3atrypsin inhibitors 0a(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (PubChem CID: 65064) 0a(-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) (PubChem CID: 72277) 0aNα-benzoyl-DL-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride (BAPNA) (PubChem CID: 2724371) 0aDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (PubChem CID: 679) 0aAcetic acid (PubChem CID: 176) 0aPotassium bromide (PubChem CID: 253877) 0aSoybean Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor 0aInactivation 0aEGCG 0aInteraction mechanism 0aMolecular docking1 aChen, Yue1 aXue, Zihan1 aGao, Xudong1 aJia, Yanan1 aWang, Yajie1 aLu, Yangpeng1 aZhang, Jianying1 aZhang, Min1 aChen, Haixia0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Aug. 17, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1253803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245013800187300001600325500001500341520106100356592002801417650001901445650001701464650001601481650001101497650002801508650001601536650002301552650001201575650002701587650001101614650003401625650005001659650003701709650001501746650007001761650005201831650008901883650001001972651002601982651003102008651003302039653003902072700002202111700002402133773013202157852000902289856008302298655001202381IND2290659020221118234323.0181016e200103  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229065902DNAL7 a112892082pmid7 a10.1177/1040638701013002062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrubbs, Steven T.10aPrevalence of Ovine and Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections in Cattle Determined with a Synthetic Peptide-Based Immunoassay  ap. 128-132.  a2019-12-04  aSubgroup-specific peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays from the G-protein of the ovine and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively, were used to determine the prevalence of the ovine and bovine subgroup strains of RSV infections in cattle. A total of 1,102 bovine serum samples were obtained from 6 diagnostic laboratories located in the northwestern and the southeastern USA and were tested for antibody to either the bovine or ovine subgroups of RSV. Antibody to viruses from each subgroup was present in samples from each region and all states tested. The Southeast had a higher prevalence of the bovine subgroup strains (69.5%). Then did the Northwest (40.9%). The prevalence of the ovine strain was similar for the two regions (16.7% in the southeast, 14.9% in the northwest). The overall prevalence was 56.6% for the bovine strain and 15.9% for the ovine strain. These results suggest members of the ovine subgroup of RSV circulate in the cattle population but with less frequency than those viruses of the bovine subgroup.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseroprevalence 3aimmunoassays 3ablood serum 3acattle 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3aPneumovirus 3asynthetic peptides 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxblood 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsximmunology 2aPrevalence 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virus Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovineximmunology 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virusesxclassificationximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aSheep 3aWestern United States 3aSoutheastern United States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0aBovine respiratory syncytial virus1 aKania, Stephen A.1 aPotgieter, L.

In 90 min, 95.9 ± 1.0% of BPM (initial concentration of 10 μM) could be removed in the optimal reaction conditions: [BPM]0:[PMS]0 = 1:40 (molar ratio), [PMS]0:[Fe0]0 = 1:3 (molar ratio), pH = 8.0 (maintained by 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution), T = 35 °C. Common environmental ions like HCO3−, Cl−, NO3− accelerated BPM degradation while NH4+ hindered it. In radical quenching tests, sulfate radicals (SO4−) were found to play a dominant role in BPM degradation, while hydroxyl radicals (OH) were also detected. By high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis, 13 products of BPM including small molecules, oligomers and hydroxylated derivatives were identified, and five possible degradation pathways were then proposed. The predicted acute toxicity of the reaction products was reduced after BPM was treated by Fe0/PMS. All these results prove that Fe0/PMS is an efficient, convenient, and environmentally friendly treatment method for the removal of BPM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3aammonium 3aaqueous solutions 3abicarbonates 3achlorides 3afree radicals 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxylation 3airon 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3asulfates 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aBisphenol M 0aPeroxymonosulfate 0aZero-valent iron 0aKinetics 0aProducts1 aGao, Manqi1 aGuo, Xiaofeng1 aAi, Fuxun1 aWang, Zunyao0 tChemosphere.g2019 Apr., v. 221 p.314-323dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245009600209300001400305500001400319506007600333520131300409592002801722506003701750650002201787650001701809650002301826650002601849650001101875650001701886650002501903650001101928650002001939650001901959650002701978650001502005650002702020650001302047651001202060651001702072653002502089653003002114653003002144653002202174653003002196653002402226773009302250856008502343852000902428655001202437IND60690000120221207064110.0200424e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069000012DNAL7 a10.1080/19336934.2016.12215502doi7 aPMC65167922pmcid7 a275603692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYassin, Amir10aDrosophila yakuba mayottensis, a new model for the study of incipient ecological speciation  ap. 37-45.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA full understanding of how ecological factors drive the fixation of genetic changes during speciation is obscured by the lack of appropriate models with clear natural history and powerful genetic toolkits. In a recent study, we described an early stage of ecological speciation in a population of the generalist species Drosophila yakuba (melanogaster subgroup) on the island of Mayotte (Indian Ocean). On this island, flies are strongly associated with the toxic fruits of noni (Morinda citrifolia) and show a partial degree of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation. Here, I mine the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and provide a full morphological description of this population. Only 29 nuclear sites (< 4 × 10⁻⁷ of the genome) are fixed in this population and absent from 3 mainland populations and the closest relative D. santomea, but no mitochondrial or morphological character distinguish Mayotte flies from the mainland. This result indicates that physiological and behavioral traits may evolve faster than morphology at the early stages of speciation. Based on these differences, the Mayotte population is designated as a new subspecies, Drosophila yakuba mayottensis subsp. nov., and its strong potential in understanding the genetics of speciation and plant-insect interactions is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila yakuba 3aMelanogaster 3aMorinda citrifolia 3aenvironmental factors 3afruits 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3amodels 3anatural history 3anew subspecies 3aplant-insect relations 3apopulation 3areproductive isolation 3atoxicity 3aComoros 3aIndian Ocean 0aconvergent evolution 0aecological specialization 0agenotypic species concept 0aisland speciation 0aplant-insect interactions 0aspeciation genetics0 tFly.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 11, no. 1 p.37-45dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19336934.2016.12215503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008500159300001800244500002000262520094300282592002801225596006301253650001701316650001201333650001201345650001601357650001201373650001301385650001801398650001801416650001201434650000901446650001501455700001201470700001701482700001601499700001601515700005501531700001501586700001701601700002101618700005801639773014101697856007401838852000901912655001201921IND60751103020221118120812.0210922e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075110302DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.130982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiaorui10aNovel Wx alleles generated by base editing for improvement of rice grain quality  ap. 1632-1638.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAmylose content (AC), which is regulated by the Waxy (Wx) gene, is a major indicator of eating and cooking quality (ECQ) in rice (Oryza sativa). Thus far, only a limited number of mutations in the N‐terminal domain of Wx were found to have a major impact on the AC of rice grains and no mutations with such effects were reported for other regions of the Wx protein. Here, nucleotide substitutions in the middle region of Wx were generated by adenine and cytosine base editors. The nucleotide substitutions led to changes in 15 amino acid residues of Wx, and a series of novel Wx alleles with ACs of 0.3%–29.43% (wild type with AC of 19.87%) were obtained. Importantly, the waxyᵃᵇᵉ² allele showed a “soft rice” AC, improved ECQ, favorable appearance, and no undesirable agronomic traits. The transgenes were removed from the waxyᵃᵇᵉ² progeny, generating a promising breeding material for improving rice grain quality.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801016cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aOryza sativa 3aadenine 3aalleles 3aamino acids 3aamylose 3acytosine 3agrain quality 3aplant biology 3aprogeny 3arice 3atransgenes1 aSu, Fei1 aHuang, Sheng1 aMei, Fating1 aNiu, Xiaomu1 aMa, Changle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3360-27991 aZhang, Hui1 aZhu, Xiaoguo1 aZhu, Jian‐Kang1 aZhang, Jinshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7360-68370 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2021 Sept., v. 63, no. 9 p.1632-1638dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.130983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013300162300001600295520102400311592002801335650001901363650003601382650001701418650001901435650002101454650001501475650001401490650001601504650002601520650002501546650001701571650002001588653001401608653002501622653001301647653002201660653001701682700001701699700005501716700001601771700001901787700001301806700001601819700002001835773011601855856008201971852000902053655001202062IND60530334920221118060219.0180904e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053033492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2016.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Jing10aEffects of resazurin on perchlorate reduction and bioelectricity generation in microbial fuel cells and its catalysing mechanism  ap. 164-172.  aResazurin could improve the performance of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Compared with a mediator-free MFC, MFCs with 3μM resazurin, 6μM resazurin, and 9μM resazurin exhibited increases in perchlorate reduction ratio of 50.8%, 72.6% and 101.6%, respectively, and increases in the output voltage of 24.5%, 33.3% and 41.7%, respectively. An electrochemical analysis indicated that adding resazurin decreased the anode resistance and enhanced the biocatalytic activities of the anode. The content of humic acid increased, and the content of polysaccharide decreased in the resazurin-addition MFCs, which accelerated the transfer of electrons to the anode. Adding 9μM resazurin to MFC with one of eight different inhibitors (6μM) demonstrated that the acceleration sites of resazurin were NADH-ubiquinone reductase, NADH reductase and methylnaphthoquinone. A microbial analysis showed that adding resazurin changed the composition of the anodic microbial community and stimulated the growth of certain dominant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 3abiocatalysis 3abioelectricity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3ahumic acids 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aperchlorates 3apolysaccharides 0aResazurin 0aWastewater treatment 0aBiofilms 0aElectron transfer 0aOptimisation1 aTian, Xiulei1 aGuo, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5246-68121 aGuo, Yankai1 aSong, Yuanyuan1 aYue, Lin1 aWang, Yajun1 aLiang, Xiaohong0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 114 p.164-172dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2016.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010100169300001400270520142800284592002801712650002101740650001401761650001401775650002301789650002001812650001101832650001001843650001301853650001901866650002201885650001301907650002401920650003101944700001701975773012601992856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60089622320221118142115.0141102e20120817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008962232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamarzija, Ivana10aHedgehog pathway regulators influence cervical cancer cell proliferation, survival and migration  ap. 64-69.  aHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection is considered to be a primary hit that causes cervical cancer. However, infection with this agent, although needed, is not sufficient for a cancer to develop. Additional cellular changes are required to complement the action of HPV, but the precise nature of these changes is not clear. Here, we studied the function of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in cervical cancer. The Hh pathway can have a role in a number of cancers, including those of liver, lung and digestive tract. We found that components of the Hh pathway are expressed in several cervical cancer cell lines, indicating that there could exists an autocrine Hh signaling loop in these cells. Inhibition of Hh signaling reduces proliferation and survival of the cervical cancer cells and induces their apoptosis as seen by the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein cleaved caspase 3. Our results indicate that Hh signaling is not induced directly by HPV-encoded proteins but rather that Hh-activating mutations are selected in cells initially immortalized by HPV. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand induces proliferation and promotes migration of the cervical cancer cells studied. Together, these results indicate pro-survival and protective roles of an activated Hh signaling pathway in cervical cancer-derived cells, and suggest that inhibition of this pathway may be a therapeutic option in fighting cervical cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3adigestive tract 3ahumans 3aliver 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aBeard, Peter0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Aug. 17, v. 425, no. 1 p.64-69dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245008600207300001800293500001100311520132100322592002801643650002301671650002001694650001801714650001501732650001101747650001101758650001601769650001101785650002201796650002201818650001201840650001101852650000901863650001301872700002401885700001401909773012501923856008302048852000902131655001202140IND60676311720221118010905.0200523e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067631172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-019-09957-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanveer, Mohsin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4560-643910aLithium in Environment and Potential Targets to Reduce Lithium Toxicity in Plants  ap. 1574-1586.  aReview  aIndustrialization and inevitable mining have resulted in the release of some metals in environment, which have different uses on the one hand and also showed environmental toxicity. Lithium (Li) is one of them; however, its excess use in different fields or inappropriate disposal methods resulted in high Li accumulation in soil and groundwater. This subsequently is affecting our environment and more potentially our arable crop production system. In humans, Li has been extensively studied and causes numerous detrimental effects at different organ levels. Moreover, increases in Li in groundwater and food items, cases for mental disorders have been reported in different regions of the world. In plants, only a few studies have been reported about toxic effects of lithium in plants. Moreover, plant products (fruits, grains or other plant parts) could be a major source of Li toxicity in our food chain. Therefore, it is more imperative to understand how plants can be developed more tolerant to Li toxicity. In this short mini-review article, we primarily highlighted and speculated Li uptake, translocation and Li storage mechanism in plants. This article provides considerable information for breeders or environmentalist in identifying and developing Li hyperaccumulators plants and environment management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior disorders 3acrop production 3aecotoxicology 3afood chain 3afruits 3agrains 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3ahyperaccumulators 3aindustrialization 3alithium 3amining 3asoil 3atoxicity1 aHasanuzzaman, Mirza1 aWang, Lei0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2019 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.1574-1586dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-019-09957-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011100159300001600270520146200286592002801748650002301776650001601799650000901815650001301824650001001837650001901847650002201866700001901888700001801907700002101925700001801946773012501964856007302089852000902162655001202171IND60408772320221117203528.0150921e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040877232DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.121382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan, C. J.10aInfluences of gear type and analytical methodology on fish assemblage characterisations in temperate lakes  ap. 388-399.  aA variety of gears and analytical methods can be used to characterise lentic fish assemblages; however, the combined influence of gear type and analysis can affect conclusions about assemblage patterns. Fish assemblages sampled with night electric fishing, gillnets and trapnets from 153 lakes were evaluated using summary indices of species composition, pairwise community similarity comparisons and multivariate ordination. For a given amount of effort, electric fishing had the highest species richness, while gillnets had higher diversity and evenness. Pairwise comparisons between gears revealed that (1) richness was positively correlated among all gears, (2) diversity and evenness were generally not correlated across gears and (3) electric fishing and trapnets captured more similar species than all other pairwise comparisons. Gear‐specific multivariate correlation and ordination revealed that gillnet and electric fishing samples more similarly characterised variation in assemblages among lakes, while trapnets characterised assemblages along different gradients of species composition. These results indicate that either electric fishing or trapnetting can be used when assessing shallow‐water assemblages for diversity or evenness, gillnets and either electric fishing or trapnets should be used for whole‐lake assessments, and either gillnets or electric fishing should be used when evaluating regionwide variation in lake assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acorrelation 3afish 3agillnets 3alakes 3alentic systems 3aspecies diversity1 aCoulter, D.

However, even on the same localities, different systems of vegetation classification de-scribe the forest types according to the naturally dominant tree species with different accuracy. A set of 20 representative natural beech stands in the borderland between the Bohemian Massif (Hercyni-an biogeographical subprovince) and the Outer Western Carpathians (Westcarpathian subprovince) was selected in order to compare textural, hydrostatic, physico-chemical and chemical properties of soils between the included geomorphological regions, bioregions and biotopes. Differences in the soils of the surveyed beech stands were mainly due to volume weight and specific weight, maximum capillary capacity (MCC), porosity, base saturation (BS), total soil nitrogen (Nₜ) and fulvic acids. Specifics in the relations between these soil characteristics indicated that transient trans-Hercynian beech forests developed in the borderland between the two compared subprovinces. Soils of the investigated Hercynian beech forests were generally characterized by lower BS and lower Nₜ. Soils of the trans-Hercynian beech forests were more similar to the Carpathian beech forest soils than soils in the other Hercynian beech forests. Soils of the trans-Hercynian and Carpathian beech forests showed similarly higher BS, deeper occurrence of humic substances, lower specific weight and also higher MCC. Higher content of humic substances as well as MCC indicated an equal effect on forest ecology, which may contribute to more accurate classification of forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3abase saturation 3abiogeography 3abiotopes 3aedaphic factors 3aforest ecology 3aforest soils 3aforest types 3afulvic acids 3ageomorphology 3anitrogen 3aporosity 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil organic nitrogen 3asoil texture 3atrees 3aCarpathian region 3aCentral European region 0aEuropean beech 0abiogeographical subprovince 0afulvic acids 0asoil maximum capillary capacity1 aKučera, Aleš1 aRejsek, Klement,0 tEkológia (Bratislava).g2014 Dec. 10, v. 33, no. 4 p.321-343dDe Gruyter Openx1337-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/eko-2014-00303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245010900175300001600284520125200300592002801552650002401580650001501604650001701619650001801636650002001654650001901674650002801693650001001721650001801731650002001749653002301769653003101792653002601823700002201849700002101871700002101892700002101913773011801934856008302052852000902135655001202144IND60678568020221120151142.0191231e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067856802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2019.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro-Muñoz, Roberto10aMembrane technologies assisting plant-based and agro-food by-products processing: A comprehensive review  ap. 219-232.  aNowadays, membrane-based technologies (e.g. microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, membrane distillation, and pervaporation) have demonstrated to meet the requirements to be involved in different food and bioproduct processes.Several applications have been developed, including either separation, recovery or concentration of bioactive molecules from agro-food products and by-products, treatment of natural extracts, recovery of aromas from natural and processed products, production of non-alcoholic beverages, as the most popular ones. Therefore, the goal of this review is to give a comprehensive outlook of the latest developments focused on the separation, fractionation and concentration of several bioactive compounds contained in their original sources, as well as the food processes-assisted by membrane technologies.Throughout this review, ongoing literature has been analysed, discussing the relevant insights according to the type of membrane-based separation process, properties of molecules, membrane features and key factors influencing the separation performance of those technologies.

In addition to the well-known 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) have recently been discovered in genomic DNA, which all result from iterative oxidation of 5mC by the TET (Ten-Eleven-Translocate) family of enzymes. Recent studies have proposed the roles of these oxidized cytosines in mediating active demethylation of 5mC. Through affinity-based genome-wide sequencing and oxidation-assisted base-resolution sequencing methods, 5hmC is found to be dynamically regulated during development, and is enriched mainly in distal regulatory elements in human and mouse embryonic cells. Among RNA modifications, N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) is a widespread yet poorly studied base modification in mRNA and non-coding RNA. The recent discovery that m⁶A in RNA is the major substrate of the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) protein draws attention to the potential regulatory functions of reversible RNA methylations, which can be dynamic, and could be important in many fundamental cellular functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aobesity 3aoxidation1 aHe, Chuan0 tCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology.g2012 Dec., v. 16, no. 5-6 p.516-524dElsevier Ltdx1367-59317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001700167245012700184300001600311500000900327520147300336592002801809650001901837650000901856700002101865773012301886852000902009856009702018655001202115991576672320742620221121231603.0191122e197509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7591003552DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1975.00021962006700050030x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, S.

Methods which are accurate over short periods of 15 min to 1 hour can indicate the influence of changing weather conditions on crop photosynthetic activity. Three micrometeorological methods—the lysimetric, energy balance, and stability-corrected aerodynamic—can be used for field determination of the flux of CO₂ to a crop surface. The objective of this paper is to present a detailed comparison of the performances of the three methods. Measurements were made in an oat field at Mead, Neb. Results obtained with the three methods were in good agreement, both on a short-period and on a daily basis. The calculated CO₂ flux agreed reasonably well with estimates from other oat-photosynthesis studies. Midday CO₂ flux rates ranged from about 2 to 3 ✕ 10⁻⁷ g cm⁻² sec⁻¹. The three micrometerological methods were subjected to detailed error analysis to evaluate the relative influence of errors in measurement of the constituent input parameters used to calculate the flux of carbon dioxide, namely water vapor flux and gradients of vapor pressure and CO₂ concentration in the lysimetric method; net radiation, soil heat flux and gradients of vapor pressure, air temperature and CO₂ concentration in the energy balance method; and gradients of windspeed, air temperature and CO₂ concentration in the stability-corrected aerodynamic method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aoats1 aRosenberg, N.

P. K.10aExperimental and Theoretical Mechanistic Investigation of the Iridium-Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Decarbonylation of Primary Alcohols  ap. 834-842.  aThe mechanism for the iridium–BINAP catalyzed dehydrogenative decarbonylation of primary alcohols with the liberation of molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide was studied experimentally and computationally. The reaction takes place by tandem catalysis through two catalytic cycles involving dehydrogenation of the alcohol and decarbonylation of the resulting aldehyde. The square planar complex IrCl(CO)(rac-BINAP) was isolated from the reaction between [Ir(cod)Cl]₂, rac-BINAP, and benzyl alcohol. The complex was catalytically active and applied in the study of the individual steps in the catalytic cycles. One carbon monoxide ligand was shown to remain coordinated to iridium throughout the reaction, and release of carbon monoxide was suggested to occur from a dicarbonyl complex. IrH₂Cl(CO)(rac-BINAP) was also synthesized and detected in the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. In the same experiment, IrHCl₂(CO)(rac-BINAP) was detected from the release of HCl in the dehydrogenation and subsequent reaction with IrCl(CO)(rac-BINAP). This indicated a substitution of chloride with the alcohol to form a square planar iridium alkoxo complex that could undergo a β-hydride elimination. A KIE of 1.0 was determined for the decarbonylation and 1.42 for the overall reaction. Electron rich benzyl alcohols were converted faster than electron poor alcohols, but no electronic effect was found when comparing aldehydes of different electronic character. The lack of electronic and kinetic isotope effects implies a rate-determining phosphine dissociation for the decarbonylation of aldehydes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3abenzyl alcohol 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3achlorides 3adehydrogenation 3adissociation 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen 3airidium 3aisotopes 3aligands 3aphosphine1 aSingh, Thishana1 aHarris, Pernille1 aAndersson, Pher G.1 aMadsen, Robert0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Jan. 21, v. 137, no. 2 p.834-842dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja51069433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245011800206300001800324520116000342592002801502650001201530650002201542650002901564650001801593650001401611650001201625650001301637650001901650650003101669700005401700700002001754773011901774856008701893852000901980655001201989IND60614590120221118205204.0181002e20180828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061459012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b019782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4249-617410aDetermination and Understanding of Solvent Losses to Tailings from a Laboratory Hybrid Bitumen Extraction Process  ap. 9202-9210.  aHybrid bitumen extraction (HBE) at ambient conditions has potential, as an alternative to the currently used modified Clark hot water extraction (CHWE), to reduce thermal energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for bitumen extraction from mined ore. Importantly, this extraction method could be retrofitted to the current commercial process. This research focuses on the extent of solvent loss in the sand tailings, which is the most important issue associated with the success and commercialization of HBE. In this work, a series of bench-scale HBE tests were conducted under various conditions, and the solvent content in the tailings was determined. Results suggest that the amount of solvent in the tailings depends largely on the processability of oil sand ore and the type and dosage of solvent used to soak the ore in the HBE. With a good processing ore, for which over 90% bitumen recovery was obtained, solvent losses to tailings were below the regulated volatile organic compound loss limit, without the use of a tailings solvent recovery unit. The correlation between solvent loss to tailings and unrecovered bitumen content is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acommercialization 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amine tailings 3aoil sands 3asoaking 3asolvents 3athermal energy 3avolatile organic compounds1 aXu, Yuming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0837-42801 aNelson, Richard0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Aug. 28, v. 32, no. 9 p.9202-9210dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b019783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014200167520190900309592002802218650001302246650002402259650001602283650002602299650002002325650001702345650002002362650001302382650002002395650001102415650003302426650001602459650001602475650000902491650002102500650003302521650001302554650002202567650002502589651001002614653002102624653002102645653001602666653002302682653004302705700001102748700002802759700001902787700001702806773010902823856008602932852000903018655001203027IND60791364620221121061645.0220914e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079136462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1114712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jinjin10aAerated drip irrigation improves water and nitrogen uptake efficiencies of tomato roots with associated changes in the antioxidant system  aChina has the largest area of vegetable cultivation in greenhouse vegetable system in the world. However, the excessive application of irrigation and fertilizers has caused soil degradation and hardening, even leading to injury and yield loss in vegetable. Increasing soil aeration oxygen can improve crop water and nutrient uptake efficiencies. However, its effects on crop antioxidant systems are less known. Due to the sensitivity of the antioxidant system to changes in soil oxygen content, it is expected that aerated drip irrigation (ADI) delivering microbubble water to the crop rhizosphere will alter root antioxidant enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and osmotic regulators in tomato plants. We conducted pot experiments under eight irrigation regimes: five aerated durations (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of the subsurface drip irrigation period aerated (CK, A₂₅%, A₅₀%, A₇₅%, and A), with two aerated sequences (L: subsurface drip irrigation follow by aerated drip irrigation, F: aerated drip irrigation follow by subsurface drip irrigation) for the A₂₅%, A₅₀% and A₇₅% treatments. All treatments with ADI had an average of 7.63% higher oxygen concentration (OC) than the CK treatment at 74 d after transplanting. The principal component analysis revealed that MDA of all treatments had the greatest effect on the antioxidant system, while aerated drip irrigation reduced MDA content. Increasing aeration duration from A₂₅% to A₇₅% significantly affected antioxidant enzyme activities and root growth parameters, and the L treatment had higher values than the F treatment. The L-A₇₅% treatment had the highest water use efficiency, nitrogen uptake efficiency, and yield. The structural equation model demonstrated that ADI indirectly promotes tomato water and nitrogen uptake efficiencies by affecting the antioxidant system and root growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aantioxidant enzymes 3agreenhouses 3airrigation scheduling 3amalondialdehyde 3amicrobubbles 3amicroirrigation 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aoxygen 3aprincipal component analysis 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3asoil 3asoil degradation 3astructural equation modeling 3atomatoes 3avegetable growing 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aAerated duration 0aAerated sequence 0aSoil oxygen 0aAntioxidant system 0aWater and nitrogen uptake efficiencies1 aXu, Na1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.M.1 aZhang, Zhenhua1 aNiu, Wenquan0 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 306 p.111471-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1114713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245006200201300001600263506007600279520113000355592002801485506003701513650002001550650001701570650001901587650001901606650001501625700002101640700001601661700001901677700002301696700002801719700001801747700002001765700001701785700001901802773012901821856007501950852000902025655001202034IND60541013520221207142621.0160820e20150121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054101352DNAL7 a10.1021/ja51070182doi7 aPMC43087582pmcid7 a255844962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDal Molin, Marta10aFluorescent Flippers for Mechanosensitive Membrane Probes  ap. 568-571.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this report, “fluorescent flippers” are introduced to create planarizable push–pull probes with the mechanosensitivity and fluorescence lifetime needed for practical use in biology. Twisted push–pull scaffolds with large and bright dithienothiophenes and their S,S-dioxides as the first “fluorescent flippers” are shown to report on the lateral organization of lipid bilayers with quantum yields above 80% and lifetimes above 4 ns. Their planarization in liquid-ordered (Lₒ) and solid-ordered (Sₒ) membranes results in red shifts in excitation of up to +80 nm that can be transcribed into red shifts in emission of up to +140 nm by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). These unique properties are compatible with multidomain imaging in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and cells by confocal laser scanning or fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Controls indicate that strong push–pull macrodipoles are important, operational probes do not relocate in response to lateral membrane reorganization, and two flippers are indeed needed to “really swim,” i.e., achieve high mechanosensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3alipid bilayers 3amicroscopy1 aVerolet, Quentin1 aColom, Adai1 aLetrun, Romain1 aDerivery, Emmanuel1 aGonzalez-Gaitan, Marcos1 aVauthey, Eric1 aRoux, Aurélien1 aSakai, Naomi1 aMatile, Stefan0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Jan. 21, v. 137, no. 2 p.568-571dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja51070183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012500169300001600294520116700310592002801477650001601505650001801521650001801539650001801557650002601575650001301601650002101614650002101635650001601656650000901672650001301681650002201694653001201716653001801728653001201746653001701758700001901775700002001794773011801814856008301932852000902015655001202024IND60678568320221120160144.0191231e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067856832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2019.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Estelle10aPisum sativum vs Glycine max, a comparative review of nutritional, physicochemical, and sensory properties for food uses  ap. 196-204.  aBackground; Current issues surrounding meat consumption and changes in eating habits have motivated the development of meat substitutes. Vegetable proteins, especially legume proteins, are of interest. Soybean is the most widely used legume crop for food, but due to some negative aspects, it may be relevant to develop soybean substitutes.Scope and approach; Pea is a possible alternative to soybean and the latter was thus compared with pea to determine if pea would be a good substitute. This review provides a brief insight into the similarities and differences between soybean and pea regarding composition and nutrition as well as physicochemical and sensory aspects impacting their food uses.Key findings and conclusions; As pea is less allergenic than soybean but has similar nutritional and functional properties, it could be a great alternative to soybean. Nevertheless, some particularities of the pea composition can lead to a stronger “beany” off-flavor and so a less acceptable product. In addition, the isoenzymes involved in the development of off-flavor are more varied in the pea.

Using post‐mortem badger body weight records from 15 878 individuals captured across the Republic of Ireland (7224 setts across ca. 15 000 km²; 2009–2012), we employed a hierarchical multilevel mixed model to evaluate the effects of climate (rainfall and temperature) and habitat quality (landscape suitability), while controlling for local abundance (unique badgers caught/sett/year). Body weight was affected strongly by temperature across a number of temporal scales (preceding month or season), with badgers being heavier if preceding temperatures (particularly during winter/spring) were warmer than the long‐term seasonal mean. There was less support for rainfall across different temporal scales, although badgers did exhibit heavier weights when greater rainfall occurred one or 2 months prior to capture. Badgers were also heavier in areas with higher landscape habitat quality, modulated by the number of individuals captured per sett, consistent with density‐dependent effects reducing weights. Overall, the mean badger body weight of culled individuals rose during the study period (2009–2012), more so for males than for females. With predicted increases in temperature, and rainfall, augmented by ongoing agricultural land conversion in this region, we project heavier individual badger body weights in the future. Increased body weight has been associated with higher fecundity, recruitment and survival rates in badgers, due to improved food availability and energetic budgets. We thus predict that climate change could increase the badger population across the Republic of Ireland. Nevertheless, we emphasize that, locally, populations could still be vulnerable to extreme weather variability coupled with detrimental agricultural practice, including population management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeles meles 3aagricultural land 3abadgers 3abody weight 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afecundity 3afemales 3afood availability 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amales 3apopulation 3arain 3aspring 3astatistical models 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3aIrish Republic1 aFogarty, Ursula1 aO'Keeffe, James1 aNewman, Chris0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Sept., v. 21, no. 9 p.3336-3346dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.129393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03683naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015600158300001600314500002000330520175600350592002802106596006702134596005902201596005902260596006502319650002502384650002202409650002402431650002302455650001702478650001502495650001302510650001702523650001702540650001502557650001902572650000802591650001002599650002902609650002602638650003302664650001102697700001902708700001502727700001602742700001302758700001702771700001502788700001502803700001302818700005602831773012402887856007303011852000903084655001203093IND60651594620221118233449.0190712e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065159462DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.128512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xueying10aAtHB2, a class II HD‐ZIP protein, negatively regulates the expression of CsANS, which encodes a key enzyme in Camellia sinensis catechin biosynthesis  ap. 936-945.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTea (Camellia sinensis) is an important cash crop that is beneficial to human health because of its remarkable content of catechins. The biosynthesis of catechins follows the flavonoid pathway, which is highly branched. Among the enzymes involved in catechin biosynthesis, ANTHOCYANIDIN SYNTHASE (CsANS) functions at a branch point and play a critical role. Our previous work has showed that the gene encoding CsANS is regulated by light signals; however, the molecular mechanism behind remains unclear. Here, we cloned a full‐length CsANS promoter and found that it contained a cis‐element recognized by Arabidopsis thaliana HOMEOBOX2 (AtHB2). AtHB2 constitutes one of the class II HOMEODOMAIN‐LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD‐ZIP) proteins, which accumulate in the dark and mediate the shade avoidance response in most angiosperms. To analyze the transcription of CsANS in vivo, β‐glucuronidase and luciferase reporter genes driven by the obtained promoter were introduced into A. thaliana and Nicotiana attenuata, respectively. In both expression systems there were indications that the A. thaliana PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1 (AtPAP1), a MYB transcription factor of flavonoid biosynthesis, increased the activity of the CsANS promoter, while AtHB2 could significantly undermine the effect of AtPAP1. Yeast two‐hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that AtHB2 interacted with the A. thaliana TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA 1 (AtTTG1). A yeast three‐hybrid assay further suggested that AtHB2 represses the expression of CsANS and regulates its response to light signals through competitive interactions with AtTTG1. These results show that HD‐ZIP II proteins participate in light regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data  a3150024231670291cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31670291cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31500242cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLY16C020004cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCamellia sinensis 3aNicotiana attenuata 3abeta-glucuronidase 3abiosynthesis 3acash crops 3acatechin 3afluorescence 3ahuman health 3aluciferase 3areporter genes 3atea 3atesta 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3ayeasts1 aJiang, Xiaolan1 aHe, Yuqing1 aLi, Linying1 aXu, Ping1 aSun, Zongtao1 aLi, Junmin1 aXu, Jiming1 aXia, Tao1 aHong, Gaojie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5254-53580 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2019 Aug., v. 166, no. 4 p.936-945dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.128513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013400171300001600305520150000321592002801821650001001849650001401859650002001873650001001893650001601903650001201919650001601931650002201947650001501969650001401984650001801998650001802016650001702034650002202051653001302073653001902086653002402105700002002129700001902149700002902168700001802197700002102215700002102236700002202257773011802279856008502397852000902482655001202491IND60579847520221116190414.0170902e20170903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057984752DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2017.12839472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafronova, Vera10aDoes the Miocene-Pliocene relict legume Oxytropis triphylla form nitrogen-fixing nodules with a combination of bacterial strains?  ap. 706-714.  aFour pairs of strains were isolated from four individual root nodules collected from different plants of the Miocene-Pliocene relict legume Oxytropis triphylla growing in the Baikal region (one nodule – one pair of strains). Identification of these strains by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that one strain of each pair was fast-growing and phylogenetically closest to the type strains Phyllobacterium endophyticum PEPV15 ᵀ (98.8–99.5% 16S rDNA similarity) and Phyllobacterium bourgognense STM 201 ᵀ (98.8–99.3% 16S rDNA similarity). The other strain was slow-growing and closely related to the type strains Bosea vestrisii 34635 ᵀ and Bosea eneae 34614 ᵀ (99.5–99.8% 16S rDNA similarity). Results of the atp D gene sequencing suggested that Phyllobacterium -related isolates most probably belong to a new species of Phyllobacterium. It is known that none of the currently described strains of P. endophyticum , P. bourgognense (family Phyllobacteriaceae), B. vestrisii and B. eneae (family Bradyrhizobiaceae) can induce root nodules, but several symbiotic genes were found in the representatives of these two genera . Thus we hypothesize that the pairs of strains isolated from O. triphylla root nodules can be co-microsymbionts having complementary sets of symbiotic genes and their simultaneous presence in roots is required for efficient nodulation of the host plant. The whole genome sequencing of the studied strains is in progress to find and compare symbiotic genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBosea 3aOxytropis 3aPhyllobacterium 3agenes 3ahost plants 3alegumes 3anew species 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3aroot nodules 3asequence analysis 0aRhizobia 0arelict legumes 0aOxytropis triphylla1 aBelimov, Andrey1 aSazanova, Anna1 aKuznet︠s︡ova, Irina,1 aPopova, Janna1 aAndronov, Evgeny1 aVerkhozina, Alla1 aTikhonovich, Igor0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2017 Sept. 3, v. 74, no. 5 p.706-714dRoutledgex1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2017.12839473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245008100164300001600245520100700261592002801268650002301296650001201319650002001331650001301351650002101364650001301385650001101398650001101409650001901420700002501439700002101464700002201485773011801507856007501625852000901700655001201709IND60559120020221119133118.0161126e20140116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055912002DNAL7 a10.1021/jp408659n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuellar, Kristina
A.10aNoncovalent Interactions in Microsolvated Networks of Trimethylamine N-Oxide  ap. 449-459.  aThe effects of the formation of hydrogen-bonded networks on the important osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) are explored in a joint Raman spectroscopic and electronic structure theory study. Spectral shifts in the experimental Raman spectra of TMAO and deuterated TMAO microsolvated with water, methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol are compared with the results of electronic structure calculations on explicit hydrogen-bonded molecular clusters. Very good agreement between experiment and theory suggests that it is the local hydrogen-bonded geometry at TMAO’s oxygen atom that dominates the structure of the extended hydrogen-bonded networks and that TMAO’s unique stabilizing abilities are a result of the “indirect effect” model. Natural bonding orbital (NBO) calculations further reveal that hyperconjugation results in vibrational blue shifts in TMAO’s C–H stretching region when solvated and a red shift in methanol’s C–H stretching region when hydrogen bonding with TMAO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aethanol 3aethylene glycol 3ageometry 3ahydrogen bonding 3amethanol 3amodels 3aoxygen 3atrimethylamine1 aMunroe, Katherine L.1 aMagers, David H.1 aHammer, Nathan I.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Jan. 16, v. 118, no. 2 p.449-459dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp408659n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014600165520166600311592002801977650001902005650002802024650001102052650002002063650001502083650001102098650001002109650003502119650001102154650001102165650001902176650002202195650002102217650003102238650001102269650001802280650002002298653001402318653001602332653001702348653002902365653003002394653001202424653002402436653000702460653000902467653000702476653000802483653000702491653000702498653001102505653000802516653000702524653000702531653000702538653001002545653000802555653000802563653000702571653000702578653000702585700001402592700001602606700001502622700001702637700001802654700005702672773010902729856008602838852000902924655001202933IND60791364920221121061720.0220914e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079136492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1114792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Yuan10aPhysiological and transcriptome analyses reveal that mid-fruit load improves the strength of source and sink in grapevine (Vitis Vinifera L.)  aAppropriately adjusting fruit loads (FL) can promote plant productivity in the field. In the present study, physiological, transcriptomic, and gene function assays were conducted by ¹³C labeling, full-length RNA-seq, and gene transformation. A comparative analysis of three different FL treatments (25%FL, 50%FL, and 100% FL) was performed to identify the mechanism that response to different FL. The results showed that 50%FL significantly improved the source strength by enhancing photosynthesis. The sink strength of 50%FL also reached the maximum when considering soluble sugar, weight, ¹³C allocation, sugar metabolism-related enzyme activity, and composition in berries, and yield. In addition, full-length transcriptome profiling exploited 1,098 differently expressed genes (DEGs) in 25%FL and 100%FL, and 1,479 DEGs in 50%FL and 100%FL, respectively. Thirty-four genes, including PUP1 and FBA1, were identified in carbon transport and metabolism-related pathways. As a major candidate gene, VvPUP1 was found to enhance sugar accumulation when overexpressed in grape cells. The transgenic cells had high soluble sugar contents and sucrose synthase (SS), neutral invertase (NI), and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities. Overexpression of VvPUP1 in tomatoes increased fruit size and weight, soluble sugar concentration, and the expression levels of SlSUS1, SlSPS1, and SlBGLU13, suggesting that VvPUP1 can promote berry enlargement and sugar accumulation. These results provide novel insights into the response of grapevine to different FL, demonstrating the differences in the source (leaf) and sink (berry) strength among different FL grapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acarbon 3aenzyme activity 3afruit size 3afruits 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agrapes 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3asequence analysis 3asucrose synthase 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3asugars 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aGrapevine 0aFruit loads 0a13C labeling 0aSource and sink strength 0aFull-length transcriptome 0aQuality 0aGene transformation 0aFL 0aDEGs 0aSS 0aSPS 0aNI 0aAI 0aβ-Amy 0aDAA 0aPn 0aGs 0aCi 0aFv/Fm 0aNPQ 0aETR 0aEV 0aWT 0aCK1 aMao, Juan1 aLi, Wenfang1 aWang, Ping1 aHou, Yingjun1 aQiu, Yinsheng1 aChen, Baihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6963-12790 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 306 p.111479-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1114793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245006900213300001400282520091000296592002801206653001101234653003001245653002201275653002901297653001101326653001301337700002401350700002901374700002201403700002301425700001701448700002101465700002301486773008601509856008301595852000901678655001201687IND60558751220221122220252.0170731e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055875122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ncrna.2016.11.0022doi7 aPMC60964112pmcid7 a301594102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhat, Shakil Ahmad10aLong non-coding RNAs: Mechanism of action and functional utility  ap. 43-50.  aRecent RNA sequencing studies have revealed that most of the human genome is transcribed, but very little of the total transcriptomes has the ability to encode proteins. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. Members of the non-coding genome include microRNA (miRNA), small regulatory RNAs and other short RNAs. Most of long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) are poorly annotated. Recent recognition about lncRNAs highlights their effects in many biological and pathological processes. LncRNAs are dysfunctional in a variety of human diseases varying from cancerous to non-cancerous diseases. Characterization of these lncRNA genes and their modes of action may allow their use for diagnosis, monitoring of progression and targeted therapies in various diseases. In this review, we summarize the functional perspectives as well as the mechanism of action of lncRNAs.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLncRNA 0aX-chromosome inactivation 0aGenome imprinting 0aTranscription regulation 0aCancer 0aImmunity1 aAhmad, Syed Mudasir1 aMumtaz, Peerzada Tajamul1 aMalik, Abrar Ahad1 aDar, Mashooq Ahmad1 aUrwat, Uneeb1 aShah, Riaz Ahmad1 aGanai, Nazir Ahmad0 tNon-coding RNA Research.g2016 Oct., v. 1 p.43-50dElsevier B.V.x2468-05407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ncrna.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245008500209300001400294520090900308592002801217650002501245650001001270650001501280650001301295700001801308700002201326773010501348856008201453990002301535852000901558655001201567IND60094144420221118130109.0141104e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009414442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.10.0382doi7 aPMC35940402pmcid7 a233326652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLone, Anna Mari10aPeptidomics methods for the identification of peptidase–substrate interactions  ap. 83-89.  aPeptidases have important roles in controlling physiological signaling through their regulation of bioactive peptides.

Here, we highlight the utility of recent peptidomics approaches in identifying endogenous substrates of peptidases. These approaches reveal bioactive substrates and help characterize the biochemical functions of the enzyme. Most recently, peptidomics approaches have been applied to address the challenging question of identifying the peptidases responsible for regulating specific bioactive peptides. Since peptidases are of great biomedical interest, these approaches will begin to impact our ability to identify new drug targets that regulate important bioactive peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3adrugs 3apeptidases 3apeptides1 aKim, Yun-gon,1 aSaghatelian, Alan0 tCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology.g2013 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.83-89dElsevier Ltdx1367-59317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.10.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245012300170300001400293520166600307592002801973650001302001650002002014650002402034650002402058650001602082650001602098650002202114650001602136651001802152700002102170700002102191700002202212773010502234856008402339852000902423655001202432IND4478647720221119221502.0141110e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447864772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2012.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArroqui, Mauricio10aRESTful Web Services improve the efficiency of data transfer of a whole-farm simulator accessed by Android smartphones  ap. 14-18.  aThe relentlessly increasing importance and application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in Agriculture have given birth to a new field called e-Agriculture, which focus on improving agricultural and rural development through a variety of technologies. In this sense, Agricultural Information Systems (AISs) are distributed sources of information that exploit ICTs to make agricultural processes and decision making more efficient. In order to integrate AISs and therefore build added value AISs, Web Service technologies seem to be the right path towards heterogeneous systems integration. However, there is still uncertain which is the best implementation approach to integrate Web Service-enabled AISs and mobile devices, i.e., the remote information accessors by excellence in rural areas. We comparatively explore the outcomes of employing either Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) or REpresentational State Transfer (REST) approaches in a Web Service-enabled whole-farm simulator accessed from Android-powered smartphones. Memory usage was 24% lower in SOAP, but even older and lower-end smartphones have enough RAM to avoid detrimental effects on performance. REST-based approaches broadly incur in less byte transferred compared to SOAP, which has huge implications on costs. That is particularly important when the Internet is accessed via GPRS or 3G protocols and pay-per-byte data plans as in most of Latin America rural areas. However, when unlimited data usage became less costly and more available in such areas, SOAP might be preferred due to the higher maturity of both the protocol and the available developer environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adecision making 3ainformation sources 3ainformation systems 3aparturition 3arural areas 3arural development 3avalue added 3aLatin America1 aMateos, Cristian1 aMachado, Claudio1 aZunino, Alejandro0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2012 Sept., v. 87 p.14-18dElsevier B.V.x0168-16997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2012.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245008200128300001400210506002800224520189500252592002802147506003702175650000802212650001102220650001402231650001902245650002302264650002302287650002102310650002602331650001602357650002402373650001202397650001502409650001002424650001102434650001402445650000902459650001802468650001702486650001102503650001302514650002402527651002502551653001202576653001502588653001802603653001302621700002702634700002902661773012902690852000902819655001202828IND60773878420221207054502.0180507e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077387842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGALE, Uğur10aProperties of Conventional Greenhouse Production in Kepez Township of Antalya  ap. 68-77.  aResource is Open Access  aIn our country greenhouse cultivation has developed according to the prevailing climatic conditions and become widespread at the Mediterranean coast where the climate is suitable. In this coastal area, Antalya is the leading province with 47.2% of greenhouses located in the Mediterranean Region and 38.8% of greenhouses of Turkey. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate greenhouse cultivation in Antalya-Kepez where the number of protected cultivation holdings was the highest. For this purpose, data was collected with direct contact via the questionnaires from 45 producers selected according to purposive sampling during the summer months of 2011 in Kepez in order to reveal information related to greenhouse producers, operation and greenhouse structure, production, selection of species and varieties, marketing and their problems. The results obtained showed that the majority of producers are primary school graduates, production has realized in greenhouses covered with PE and iron-framed, insect net is not used in greenhouses particularly having side air vent, heating has done only for frost protection, plants are grown in soil and mostly tomato, cucumber and strawberry are grown as long season crop production. It has drawn attention that soil analysis is not realized and synthetic chemicals are used in excessive amounts. It’s determined that producers make variety selections based on themselves or dealers’ orientations and the most common criteria that are taken into consideration is pest and disease resistance, seedling usage has increased and the majority has started with non-grafted seedlings, pesticide dealers are the most common agricultural information source for the growers, growers are dissatisfied due to lack of information and controls, not-well-timed controls most of the products are sold in wholesale market hall and price is determined by broker.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3acoasts 3acucumbers 3adirect contact 3adisease resistance 3aelementary schools 3afrost protection 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3ainformation sources 3ainsects 3apesticides 3apests 3aprices 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil analysis 3astrawberries 3asummer 3atomatoes 3awholesale marketing 3aMediterranean region 0aAntalya 0agreenhouse 0aquestionnaire 0aproducer1 aTüzel, Y.q(Yüksel),1 aÖZTEKİN, Gölgen Bahar0 tTürkiye tarımsal araştırmalar dergisi.g2014 Mar., v. 1, no. 1 p.68-77dSiirt UniversitywJournal:27812x2528-858X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013400158300001800292500002000310520146100330592002801791596006301819596005701882596009601939650002502035650002802060650001602088650001302104650000902117650001302126650000902139650001002148650000902158650001702167650002102184650003502205650001202240650002202252650001102274650001902285650001802304650001102322700003302333700002702366700001802393700002002411700005602431773012602487856007302613852000902686655001202695IND60651594920221118233400.0190712e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065159492DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.130242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Rika10aAnti‐PirA‐like toxin immunoglobulin (IgY) in feeds passively immunizes shrimp against acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease  ap. 1125-1132.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAcute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), caused by a toxin‐producing Vibrio parahaemolyticus strain, has become a serious threat to shrimp aquaculture. The need to regulate antibiotic use prompted the development of alternative ways to treat infections in aquaculture including the use of chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) for passive immunization. This study evaluated the protective effect of IgY against AHPND infection in Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone). IgY was isolated from eggs laid by hens immunized with recombinant PirA‐like (rPirA) and PirB‐like (rPirB) toxins. Whole‐egg powders having IgY specific to rPirA (anti‐PirA‐IgY) and rPirB (anti‐PirB‐IgY) and IgY from non‐immunized hen (control‐IgY) were mixed with basal diets at 20% concentrations and used to prefeed shrimp 3 days before the bacterial challenge test. Survival rates of the challenged shrimp fed the anti‐PirA‐IgY, anti‐PirB‐IgY and control‐IgY diets were 86%, 14% and 0%, respectively. Only the feed containing anti‐PirA‐IgY protected shrimp against AHPND. Increasing the concentration of rPirA antigen to immunize hens and lowering the amount of egg powder in feeds to 10% consistently showed higher survival rates in shrimp fed with anti‐PirA‐IgY (87%) compared with the control (12%). These results confirm that addition of anti‐PirA‐IgY in feeds could be an effective prophylactic method against AHPND infection in shrimp.  aPublisher supplied data  aSATREPS JPMJSA1806cJapan International Cooperation Agency  a15H02462cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aSATREPS JPMJSA1806cScience and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aantibiotics 3aantigens 3adiet 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3afeeds 3ahens 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin Y 3anecrotizing hepatopancreatitis 3apowders 3aprotective effect 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3asurvival rate 3atoxins1 aPedrosa‐Gerasmio, Ivane R.1 aAlenton, Rod Russel R.1 aNozaki, Reiko1 aKondo, Hidehiro1 aHirono, Ikuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2355-31210 tJournal of fish diseases.g2019 Aug., v. 42, no. 8 p.1125-1132dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.130243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006500170520194800235592002802183650001202211650001302223650001802236650002102254650001202275650001502287650001902302650002402321653001702345653002102362653002002383653002302403700002902426700002102455700002202476700002302498773011902521856008202640852000902722655001202731IND60791365120221119222002.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079136512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2022.1044822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarioti, Anastasia10aChemical profiling of six Stachys taxa from Balkan Peninsula  aAim of this work was the chemical profiling of six Stachys taxa from Balkan Peninsula: S. recta subsp. nitens, S. atherocalyx, S. beckeana, S. zepcensis (all four belonging to S. recta group), S. alpina subsp. dinarica and S. plumosa. Dry ethanol extracts of aerial flowering plant parts were qualitatively and quantitatively characterized for their phenolic composition using the HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS technique. In total, 44 phenolic compounds were detected, belonging to three main classes of constituents: phenolic acids, phenylethanol glycosides (PhGs) and flavonoids. Chlorogenic acid was the main phenolic acid in all samples. Regarding PhGs, in all investigated extracts acteoside and lavandulifolioside were present. In S. recta group, extracts of S. atherocalyx, S. recta subsp. nitens and S. beckeana showed similar pattern considering phenylethanol glycosides, while S. zepcensis contained only the two aforementioned compounds. PhGs profile of S. plumosa extract comprised the same compounds from S. recta group, but it was also characterized by the presence of few high-molecular compounds. PhGs composition of S. alpina subsp. dinarica extract was somewhat similar with those of S. recta group and also with S. plumosa, but still specific by the presence of echinacoside and leucosceptoside A. The main flavonoids in extracts of Stachys recta group as well as in S. alpina subsp. dinarica extract were 8-hydroxyflavone glycosides (7-O-allosylglucosides of isoscutellarein and hypolaetin and their 4′-methyl derivatives). In addition, in the extract of S. alpina subsp. dinarica two luteolin-7-O-hexosides were also present. On the other hand, S. plumosa extract differed considerably containing mainly derivatives of chrysoeriol and apigenin, while 8-hydroxyflavones (isoscutellarein derivatives) were detected in traces. The results confirmed the importance of flavone 7-O-allosylglucosides at the sectional level of Stachys genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStachys 3aapigenin 3achemotaxonomy 3achlorogenic acid 3aecology 3aglycosides 3aphenolic acids 3aphenylethyl alcohol 0aStachys taxa 0aBalkan peninsula 0aHPLC-DAD-ESI-MS 0aChemical profiling1 aKukić-Marković, Jelena1 aBilia, Anna Rita1 aNiketić, Marjan,1 aPetrović, Silvana0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2022 Oct., v. 104 p.104482-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2022.1044823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010600178300001400284520186400298592002802162653001602190653004502206653002502251653002902276653001602305700002202321700002302343700002202366700002202388700002202410773008702432856008402519852000902603655001202612IND60558751620221122220408.0170320e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055875162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.comtox.2016.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzybylak, Katarzyna R.10aRead-across of 90-day rat oral repeated-dose toxicity: A case study for selected β-olefinic alcohols  ap. 22-32.  aThere are no in vivo repeated-dose data for the vast majority of β-olefinic alcohols. However, there are robust and consistent ex vivo data suggesting many of these chemicals are metabolically transformed, especially in the liver, to reactive electrophilic toxicants which react in a mechanistically similar manner to acrolein, the reactive metabolite of 2-propen-1-ol. Hence, an evaluation was conducted to determine suitability of 2-propen-1-ol as a read-across analogue for other β-olefinic alcohols. The pivotal issue to applying read-across to the proposed category is the confirmation of the biotransformation to metabolites having the same mechanism of electrophilic reactivity, via the same metabolic pathway, with a rate of transformation sufficient to induce the same in vivo outcome. The applicability domain for this case study was limited to small (C3 to C6) primary and secondary β-olefinic alcohols. Mechanistically, these β-unsaturated alcohols are considered to be readily metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase to polarised α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. These metabolites are able to react via the Michael addition reaction mechanism with thiol groups in proteins resulting in cellular apoptosis and/or necrosis. The addition of the non-animal in chemico reactivity data (50% depletion of free glutathione) reduced the uncertainty so the read-across prediction for the straight-chain olefinic β-unsaturated alcohols is deemed equivalent to a standard test. Specifically, the rat oral 90-day repeated-dose No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for 2-propen-1-ol of 6mg/kg body weight (bw)/d in males based on increase in relative weight of liver and 25mg/kg bw/d in females based on bile duct hyperplasia and periportal hepatocyte hypertrophy in the liver, is read across to fill data gaps for the straight-chained analogues.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRead across 0aNo Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) 0aβ-Olefinic alcohols 0aWeight-of-evidence (WoE) 0aUncertainty1 aSchultz, Terry W.1 aRicharz, Andrea-N.1 aMellor, Claire L.1 aEscher, Sylvia E.1 aCronin, Mark T.D.0 tComputational Toxicology.g2017 Feb., v. 1 p.22-32dElsevier B.V.x2468-11137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comtox.2016.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012900158300001800287520170700305592002802012650002402040650002202064650002502086650001602111650001202127650000902139650001302148650001602161650001502177650001602192650001202208650001402220650001902234650003002253650001302283650001402296700002102310700002002331700002002351700002002371700001902391773010102410856007302511852000902584655001202593IND60408773520221117203546.0150921e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040877352DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.129522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrell, Hazel10aWarm temperature acclimation impacts metabolism of paralytic shellfish toxins from Alexandrium minutum in commercial oysters  ap. 3402-3413.  aSpecies of Alexandrium produce potent neurotoxins termed paralytic shellfish toxins and are expanding their ranges worldwide, concurrent with increases in sea surface temperature. The metabolism of molluscs is temperature dependent, and increases in ocean temperature may influence both the abundance and distribution of Alexandrium and the dynamics of toxin uptake and depuration in shellfish. Here, we conducted a large‐scale study of the effect of temperature on the uptake and depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins in three commercial oysters (Saccostrea glomerata and diploid and triploid Crassostrea gigas, n = 252 per species/ploidy level). Oysters were acclimated to two constant temperatures, reflecting current and predicted climate scenarios (22 and 27 °C), and fed a diet including the paralytic shellfish toxin‐producing species Alexandrium minutum. While the oysters fed on A. minutum in similar quantities, concentrations of the toxin analogue GTX1,4 were significantly lower in warm‐acclimated S. glomerata and diploid C. gigas after 12 days. Following exposure to A. minutum, toxicity of triploid C. gigas was not affected by temperature. Generally, detoxification rates were reduced in warm‐acclimated oysters. The routine metabolism of the oysters was not affected by the toxins, but a significant effect was found at a cellular level in diploid C. gigas. The increasing incidences of Alexandrium blooms worldwide are a challenge for shellfish food safety regulation. Our findings indicate that rising ocean temperatures may reduce paralytic shellfish toxin accumulation in two of the three oyster types; however, they may persist for longer periods in oyster tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium minutum 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aSaccostrea glomerata 3aacclimation 3aclimate 3adiet 3adiploidy 3afood safety 3ametabolism 3aneurotoxins 3aoysters 3ashellfish 3ashellfish meat 3asurface water temperature 3atoxicity 3atriploidy1 aSeebacher, Frank1 aO'Connor, Wayne1 aZammit, Anthony1 aHarwood, D.

Left-over spaces in urban environments, such as traffic roundabouts and strips along paths, roads and other corridors, will be important in the future city in order to deliver different eco-system services, especially stormwater management. It is therefore essential to start now to develop the knowledge and experience needed to create sustainable plantings for these sites. This paper presents the findings of a field survey in eastern Romania that sought to identify potential species for urban paved plantings in the Scandinavian region (northern Europe). The research approach is rooted in the hypothesis that studies of natural vegetation systems and habitats where plants are exposed to environmental conditions similar to those in inner-city environments can: 1) identify new or non-traditional species and genotypes adapted to urban environments; and 2) supply information and knowledge about their use potential concerning growth, flowering, life form, etc. In total, 117 different herbaceous species, all of which experience water stress regimes comparable to those in urban paved sites in Scandinavia. The initial information obtained from this field survey present a base of knowledge of which species that have a future potential for use in urban environment, which is of great importance in the following work within this project instead of testing species randomly without this knowledge of the species tolerance and performance in similar habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3aherbaceous plants 3aparks 3aroads 3asteppes 3astormwater management 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awater stress 3aNorthern European region 3aRomania 3aScandinavia 0aurban planning 0aecosystem services 0asteppe meadows 0aflowering field layers 0aurban horticulture1 aBellan, Patrick1 aHitchmough, James1 aOprea, Adrian0 tEkológia (Bratislava).g2015 Mar. 1, v. 34, no. 1 p.39-53dDe Gruyter Openx1337-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/eko-2015-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245006300167300001400230520136000244592002801604650001301632650005001645650001901695650001601714650001901730650001401749650001801763650002301781650001801804653003701822653001001859653001201869653001401881700001801895700001901913700002401932700002101956773009701977856007702074852000902151655001202160IND60481038220170822000000.0160201e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048103822DNAL7 a10.1515/eko-2015-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatamin, Abd Rahman10aRemote Sensing of Suspended Sediment Over Gulf of Martaban  ap. 54-64.  aGulf of Martaban is located at the north of Andaman, and is one of the world most turbid areas. The presence of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the water body could reduce the underwater transmittance. This study has been conducted to investigate the variation of SSC over the Gulf of Martaban. Remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) of 667 nm is used as a proxy to represent the sediment SSC variation over the study area. The data for the period of July 2002 to March 2014 acquired from MODIS Aqua 4 km resolution are used in this study. As a result, there is no obvious yearly variation in the SSC cover area. The SSC variation over this study area is found to be seasonal. High homogenous SSC covers area observably during the northeast (NE) monsoon season that occurs from December to January. The sediment cover area could reach the latitude of 15°N that located at the south of the gulf. During southwest (SW) monsoon season that occurs from May to September, low and sparse SSC cover area is observed. As a consequence, the area covered by the SSC is higher during the NE monsoon season as compared to the SW monsoon season. Hence, the SSC cover area during the NE monsoon season is greater than the yearly averaged SSC cover area. Meanwhile the SSC cover area during the rainy SW monsoon season is less than the yearly and NE monsoon season.  aPublisher supplied data 3alatitude 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonsoon season 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asediments 3asurface water 3asuspended sediment 3atransmittance 0asuspended sediment concentration 0aMODIS 0amonsoon 0aturbidity1 aAhmad, Fadhli1 aMamat, Mustafa1 aAbdullah, Khiruddin1 aHarun, Shahariah0 tEkológia (Bratislava).g2015 Mar. 1, v. 34, no. 1 p.54-64dDe Gruyter Openx1337-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/eko-2015-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245014600177300001600323520130100339592002801640653002301668653002201691653002001713653003001733653002201763700002701785700001701812773015401829856008201983852000902065655001202074IND60558751820221122220313.0161115e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055875182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.serj.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaicedo-Concha, Diana M.13aAn experimental study on the impact of two dimensional materials in waste disposal sites: What are the implications for engineered landfills?  ap. 255-261.  aIt is generally accepted that landfilled municipal solid waste develops a heterogeneous and anisotropic structure during placement, degradation and settlement. Flow and transport processes, in traditional and alternative landfills, are strongly influenced by the type of structure developed. The presence of preferential flow has gained research interest, given its impact on landfill processes. This paper describes an experimental investigation carried out on a specimen of degraded municipal solid waste.Preferential flow was detected and caused by the specimen layered structure composed of two dimensional particles derived from less easily degradable materials such as plastics, textiles and paper which made up more than 50% of the specimen dry mass. The results suggest that two dimensional particles play a role in promoting preferential flow because they modify flow paths and increase the tortuosity. A high content of less easily degradable two dimensional materials suggests incompatibility with better management practices, seeking a more even distribution of fluids to enhance degradation and faster stabilisation rates within engineered landfills. Consequently, there is a need to re-think the types and quantities of materials that are restricted under current landfill policies.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLandfill processes 0aPreferential flow 0aWaste structure 0aTwo dimensional materials 0aLandfill policies1 aSandoval-Cobo, John J.1 aWhiting, Kai0 tSustainable Environment Research.g2016 Nov., v. 26 p.255-261dElsevier B.V.aChinese Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taiwanx2468-20397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.serj.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011000173300001600283520170200299592002802001650002902029650001702058650001902075650002302094650001102117650001402128650001902142650001302161650002402174650001502198650002902213650001002242650001602252650001502268651001002283653001602293653001702309653002102326653002302347653001302370700005802383700001702441773020702458856008802665852000902753655001202762IND60678569120221120160058.0191220e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067856912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chuanpeng10aMapping large-area tidal flats without the dependence on tidal elevations: A case study of Southern China  ap. 256-270.  aCoastal ecosystems are under increased pressure from climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Tidal flat maps are necessary for managing, protecting, and restoring coastal ecosystems. Most of the existing tidal flat mapping approaches that are dependent on modelled tidal elevations, suffer high uncertainty over offshore, especially over areas where the tidal conditions have been changed by human-made structures and anthropogenic impacts. Meanwhile, these approaches separate the tidal flats in estuaries by a coastal distance rather than actual distance of saltwater intrusion. In this study, we propose a tidal flat mapping approach, using a new method to avoid the dependence on tidal elevations. The proposed approach synthesizes large-area satellite observations over a time period, to acquire the high and low tidal datum, and then classifies land and water under each tidal datum utilizing an adaptive binary classifier. The tidal flats are identified as areas being water during high tides and being land during low tides. Furthermore, the proposed approach uses the distribution of salt vegetation (i.e., mangroves) as a salinity proxy to particularly identify the tidal flats in estuaries. The proposed approach was applied for mapping the tidal flats in southern China (covering over a half of the coastline of China) utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from July 2016 to July 2018. The results achieved an overall accuracy of 92.4% and an agreement rate of 70.5% with the most recent global tidal flat map. The proposed approach does not depend on the modelled tidal elevations or large sample sets and could be easily applied for mapping tidal flats globally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acoastal ecosystems 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aremote sensing 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3asatellites 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atides 3auncertainty 3avegetation 3aChina 0aTidal flats 0aTidal datums 0aTidal elevations 0aEstuarine salinity 0aSAR data1 aQin, Cheng-Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5910-98071 aTeng, Jiakun0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2020 Jan., v. 159 p.256-270dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this paper, a friction constitutive model for the friction behavior between mortise and tenon was proposed based on the modern frictional theory. A series of surface topography and hardness tests were conducted to obtain some parameters used in the friction constitutive model. A finite element (FE) model of a Chinese ancient wooden frame with mortise–tenon joints under reversed cyclic loading was performed based on the proposed friction constitutive model, and a FE model using a constant friction coefficient was also carried out. Experimental results were used to validate the results modeled by the two models, and better agreement of the proposed model was observed.  aPublisher supplied data  a51278399cNSFC  a2016ZDJC-23cScience and Technology Department of Shaanxi Province of China 3abuildings 3adeformation 3afinite element analysis 3afriction 3ahardness 3ajoints (wood) 3amodels1 aZhang, Lipeng1 aLi, Shuang1 aZhou, Weijian1 aWang, Long0 tJournal of wood science.g2018 Feb., v. 64, no. 1 p.40-51dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-017-1669-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010500168300001600273520117700289592002801466653003001494653002201524653001301546653001201559700001801571700002201589700001801611700001901629700002101648700001901669700001801688700001801706700001801724700001101742700001901753773009801772856008201870852000901952655001201961IND60558751920221122220508.0161115e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055875192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.serj.2016.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Chia-Chi10aConversion of waste bamboo chopsticks to bio-oil via catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction using K2CO3  ap. 262-267.  aHydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was employed to transform biomass into bio-oil. Waste bamboo chopsticks (WBC) were utilized as the raw materials of HTL reaction for resolving excessive WBC problem. Effects of temperatures (TC) from 563 to 653 K and K2CO3 catalyst on the yield (YBOAS) of bio-oil (BOAS) obtained as acetone soluble were assessed. As illustrations, for WBC without catalyst at TC of 593 K with reaction time of 30 min, the yield YBOAS reaches only 3.8 wt% with heating value (HBOAS) of 30.9 MJ kg−1, while the addition of catalyst (catalytic HTL, CHTL) with TC at 563 K can lead to evident enhancement of YBOAS to 21.2 wt% with HBOAS of 31.6 MJ kg−1. The yield (YBOCC) of organic C of BOAS with respect to C of dry-ash-free raw WBC for CHTL corresponding to 21.2 wt% of YBOAS is 33.1 wt%. Higher YBOAS and carbon content of BOAS give higher YBOCC and HBOAS, respectively. The results indicate that K2CO3 is an effective catalyst for HTL of biomass of WBC with significant lignin content of 25.5 wt% in dry-basis. Furthermore, the BOAS shows simulated distillation characteristic close to diesel, while is superior to heavy oil and boat oil.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHydrothermal liquefaction 0aBamboo chopsticks 0aBio-fuel 0aBio-oil1 aChen, Chi-Pai1 aYang, Cheng-Shiun1 aChen, Yen-Hau1 aHuang, Michael1 aZhang, Jingyuan,1 aShie, Je-Lueng1 aYuan, Min-Hao1 aChen, Yi-Hung1 aHo, Chungfang1 aLi, Ke1 aYang, Meng-Tse0 tSustainable Environment Research.g2016 Nov., v. 26 p.262-267dElsevier B.V.x2468-20397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.serj.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01410naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245006600153300001800219520034500237592002800582650002700610650002300637650001300660650002000673650001300693650002400706650001200730650001500742700002000757700001700777700001900794700001800813773013300831856007500964852000901039655001201048IND60659015620221122204538.0190826e20110705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065901562DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12513c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jun10aSilicon-doped hematite nanosheets with superlattice structure  ap. 8040-8042.  aWe report a universal strategy for doping hematite photoanode materials.

Its first period is a pre-commercial hunting period (1959–1971). The second is the period of intensive organised commercial hunting (1972–1993). The third is a post-commercial hunting period (1994–2007). Finally, there is the period of barbarity (2008 – present time). The analysis covers the dynamics of the size, sex and age structure of the population (according to the data of aerial census survey and commercial hunting samples), female barrenness, animals’ natural mortality, commercial hunting and productivity of the population. It has been demonstrated that the predominance of males in the sex and age structure of the population begins mainly at the beginning of animals’ lives. The analysis of the data on reindeer’s fertility and mortality (both natural and from commercial hunting) lead us to the conclusion that the most productive indices of the population were reached in the period of intensive organised commercial hunting. It has been demonstrated through the latest data that uncontrolled poaching might very soon lead to the destruction of this unique biological resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage structure 3afemales 3aherds 3amales 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3areindeer 3asurveys 0aReindeer 0ahunting 0aharvest 0aproduction 0aRussian: Taimyr1 aKolpaschikov, Leonid0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2017 Sept. 3, v. 74, no. 5 p.862-883dRoutledgex1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2017.12843843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245005500214300001400269520093000283592002801213650001001241650002801251650001501279650002701294650002201321650001901343650003601362650001501398700002401413700002001437773010501457856008201562990002301644852000901667655001201676IND60094145020221118130120.0141104e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009414502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.11.0232doi7 aPMC35940632pmcid7 a232872892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez, Jeannie L10aProfiling and inhibiting reversible palmitoylation  ap. 20-26.  aProtein palmitoylation describes the posttranslational modification of cysteines by a thioester-linked long-chain fatty acid. This modification is critical for membrane association, spatial organization, and the proper activity of hundreds of membrane-associated proteins. Palmitoylation is continuously remodeled, both by spontaneous hydrolysis and enzyme-mediated de-palmitoylation. Bioorthogonal pulse-chase labeling approaches have highlighted the role of protein thioesterases as key regulators of palmitoylation dynamics. Importantly, thioesterases are critical for regulating the spatial organization of key oncogenic proteins, such as Ras GTPases. New inhibitors, probes, and proteomics methods have put a spotlight on this emerging posttranslational modification. These tools promise to advance our understanding the enzymatic regulation of dynamic palmitoylation, and present new opportunities for drug development.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahydrolysis 3along chain fatty acids 3amembrane proteins 3apalmitoylation 3apost-translational modification 3aproteomics1 aMajmudar, Jaimeen D1 aMartin, Brent R0 tCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology.g2013 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.20-26dElsevier Ltdx1367-59317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.11.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012200163300001600285520173600301592002802037650002502065650002202090650001602112650002302128650001302151650003102164650001002195650001202205650002102217650001202238650002902250650002402279650001102303650002402314653002502338653002602363653000902389653000802398653000802406700001402414700001902428700001302447700002002460700001802480700001602498700001602514700001902530700001802549773011202567856008202679852000902761655001202770IND60551038720221116173639.0190411e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055103872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Ze-Quan10aGrouper (Epinephelus coioides) BCR signaling pathway was involved in response against Cryptocaryon irritans infection  ap. 198-205.  aB cell antigen receptor (BCR) plays a crucial role in B cell development and antibody production. It comprises membrane immunoglobulin non-covalently associated with CD79a/CD79b heterodimer. After B cell activation, initial extracellular signals are transduced by BCR complex and amplified by two protein tyrosine kinases, LYN and SYK, which then trigger various pathways. In the present study, we cloned grouper genes for BCR accessory molecules, EcCD79a (669 bp) and EcCD79b (639 bp), as well as two protein tyrosine kinases, EcLYN (1482 bp) and EcSYK (1854 bp). Homology analysis showed that all four molecules had a relatively high amino acid identity compared with those in other animals. Among them, they all shared the highest identity with Takifugu rubripes (EcCD79a 49%, EcCD79b 52%, EcLYN 82% and EcSYK 77%). The conserved features and important functional residues were analyzed. Together with IgM and IgT, tissue distribution analysis showed that all six molecules were mainly expressed in immune organs, particularly systematic immune organs. In groupers infected with Cryptocaryon irritans, up-regulation of EcCD79a and b, EcIgM and EcIgT were not seen in the early stage skin and gill until 14–21 days. Up-regulation of EcCD79a was seen in head kidney at most time points, while EcCD79a and b were only significantly up-regulated in day 14 spleen. Significant up-regulation of EcIgT were seen in day 21 head kidney and day 1, day14 spleen. Significant up-regulation of EcIgM were seen in day 1 head kidney and 12 h spleen. In addition, two protein kinase genes, EcLYN and EcSYK, were up-regulated in the skin at most time points, which suggested that B cells may be activated at the skin local infection site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aTakifugu rubripes 3aamino acids 3aantibody formation 3aantigens 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrouper 3aimmunoglobulin M 3akidneys 3aprotein-tyrosine kinases 3asignal transduction 3aspleen 3atissue distribution 0aEpinephelus coioides 0aCryptocaryon irritans 0aCD79 0aLYN 0aSYK1 aYang, Man1 aWang, Hai-Qing1 aXu, Yang1 aHuang, Mian-Zhi1 aLao, Guo-Feng1 aLi, Yan-Wei1 aLi, An-Xing1 aLuo, Xiao-Chun1 aDan, Xue-Ming0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2016 Oct., v. 57 p.198-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245011800192520223500310592002802545650001402573650002502587650003102612650001002643650001702653650001802670650003302688650001302721650000902734700001802743700002302761773009502784856008102879852000902960655001202969IND60654932220221117182317.0190727s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065493222DNAL7 a258828712pmid7 a10.1017/S00166723150000752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKHAN, MOHAMMAD HAROON10aEvaluation of the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and its association with cancer risk: a HuGE review and meta-analysis  aCodon 72 is a hotspot of polymorphisms in the TP53 gene, which encodes a hub protein in the protein–protein interaction network of p53. It is thus a central player in the apoptotic pathway, preventing cancer. A large number of articles have been published exploring its association with an increased susceptibility to most common cancers. However, these studies have produced inconclusive results, which may be due to their small sample sizes or study designs. To comprehensively evaluate the potential correlation between the TP53 Pro72Arg polymorphism and cancer risk and to better characterize the Pro72Arg polymorphism, we performed a systematic HuGE review and meta-analysis of candidate studies through online resources, according to the proposal of MOOSE and the PRISMA statement. The identified articles were carefully examined according to the inclusion criteria. Pooled odds ratios were calculated on the basis of different genetic models, while heterogeneity was assessed through a chi-based Q-test and I². After applying the inclusion filters, we obtained a pool of 54 eligible studies, representing 18 718 cases and 21 261 controls. Overall, non-significant cancer risk was observed in all the genetic models but their observed heterogeneity was extremely significant. In subgroup analysis, an increased susceptibility was observed in the case of colorectal cancer, while in cancers of the female reproductive system, significantly increased risk was detected in all the genetic models except the dominant model. In another subgroup analysis, significantly increased cancer risk was observed among Asians in homozygous and recessive models, while in Americans increased cancer risk was observed only in dominant and recessive models. No association was observed in the rest of the populations. In conclusion, pooled subgroup analysis on the basis of ethnicity proved that the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of cancer in Asians and Americans only and is not associated in other populations. It can therefore be concluded that this meta-analysis of available data suggests partial confirmation of the association between the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and cancer risk susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afemale reproductive system 3agenes 3ahomozygosity 3ameta-analysis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aresearch 3arisk1 aKHALIL, AFTAB1 aḤamīd, Rāshid,0 tGenetics research.g2015, v. 97dCambridge University PresswJournal:1937x1469-50737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723150000753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009700167300001400264520151800278592002801796650002501824650002001849650001301869650001601882650001301898650002501911650000901936650002001945650002001965650003101985650002002016650002502036650001402061650001202075650001102087650002902098650001802127650001302145653001802158653001602176653002502192653002402217700002102241700001902262700001402281700001802295700001502313700001702328700005202345773011002397856008202507852000902589655001202598IND60551038920221116173720.0190411e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055103892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yanliang10aTranscriptome signatures in common carp spleen in response to Aeromonas hydrophila infection  ap. 41-48.  aThe common carp is an important aquaculture species that is worldwide distributed. Nowadays, intensive rearing in aquaculture increases the susceptibility of fish to various pathogens such as Aeromonas hydrophila, which has caused severe damage to carp production. However, systematic analysis on the host response of common carp against A. hydrophila is less studied. In order to better understand the common carp immune response process against bacteria at the global gene expression level, we examined transcriptional profiles of the common carp spleen at three timepoints following experimental infection with A. hydrophila. A total of 545 million 125-bp paired end reads were generated, and all trimmed clean reads were mapped onto the common carp whole genome sequence. Comparison of the transcriptomes between the treatment and control group fish revealed 2900 unigenes with significantly differential expression, including 732, 936, 928 genes up-regulated, and 248, 475, 700 genes down-regulated at 4 h, 12 h, 24 h post infection respectively. The captured significantly differentially expressed genes are mainly involved in the pathways including junction/adhesion, pathogen recognition, cell surface receptor signaling, and immune system process/defense response. Our study will provide fundamental information on molecular mechanism underlying the immune response of teleost against bacterial infection and might suggest strategies for selection of resistant strains of common carp in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aCyprinus carpio 3aadhesion 3aaquaculture 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3afish 3afish production 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3arearing 3aspleen 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 0aTranscriptome 0aCommon carp 0aAeromonas hydrophila 0aBacterial infection1 aFeng, Shuaisheng1 aZhang, Songhao1 aLiu, Hong1 aFeng, Jianxin1 aMu, Xidong1 aSun, Xiaowen1 aXu, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1531-50780 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2016 Oct., v. 57 p.41-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245008400191300001600275520177600291592002802067653001602095653001902111653002102130653001102151653001202162653001802174653003302192653002002225653001402245700002202259700002302281700001402304700002002318700002102338700001902359773010602378856011702484852000902601655001202610IND60131279120221118051447.0151127e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013127912DNAL7 a10.2193/0022-541X(2005)069<0298:SSRSBR>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANDERSON, DEAN P.10aScale-dependent summer resource selection by reintroduced elk in wisconsin, usa  ap. 298-310.  aIdentifying how habitat use is influenced by environmental heterogeneity at different scales is central to understanding ungulate population dynamics on complex landscapes. We used resource selection functions (RSF) to study summer habitat use in a reintroduced and expanding elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population in the Chequamegon National Forest, Wisconsin, USA. Factors were examined that influenced where elk established home ranges and that influenced habitat use within established home ranges. We also determined grain sizes over which elk responded to environmental heterogeneity and the number of categories of habitat selection from low to high that the elk distinguished. At a large spatial extent, elk home-range establishment was largely explained by the spatial distribution of wolf (Canis lupus) territories. Forage abundance was also influential but was relatively more important at a small spatial extent when elk moved within established home ranges. Areas near roads were avoided when establishing a home-range, but areas near roads were selected for use within the established home range. Elk distinguished among 4 different categories of habitat selection when establishing and moving within home ranges. Spatial and temporal cross validation demonstrated that to improve the predictive strength of habitat models in areas of low inter-annual variability in the environment, it is better to follow more individuals across diverse environmental conditions than to follow the same individuals over a longer time period. Last, our results show that the effects of environmental variables on habitat use were scale-dependent and reemphasize the necessity of analyzing habitat use at multiple scales that are fit to address specific research questions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCanis lupus 0aCervus elaphus 0across validation 0aforage 0ahabitat 0aheterogeneity 0aresource selection functions 0ascale-dependent 0aWisconsin1 aTURNER, MONICA G.1 aFORESTER, JAMES D.1 aZhu, Jun,1 aBoyce, Mark S.,1 aBEYER, HAWTHORNE1 aSTOWELL, LAINE0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2005 Jan., v. 69, no. 1 p.298-310dWildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F0022-541X%282005%29069%3C0298%3ASSRSBR%3E2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245010700180300001600287520100300303592002801306650001701334650003801351650003001389650001201419650001101431650001101442650001101453650000901464650001501473650000901488651001001497653001201507653001101519653003501530653001001565653001801575700002301593700002501616700002301641773009101664856009001755852000901845655001201854IND60628203720221123010615.0190326e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062820372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArulkumar, Abimannan10aMetals accumulation in edible marine algae collected from Thondi coast of Palk Bay, Southeastern India  ap. 856-862.  aThis study aimed to monitor the concentrations of metals including Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn in commercially important and commonly edible brown, red and green algal species collected from Thondi coast, southeast India. Green seaweed Chaetomorpha linum contained higher (Cd 8.51 mg kg−1, Pb 5.24 mg kg−1, Cu 15.38 mg kg−1, and Zn 22.34 mg kg−1) concentrations of metals than other tested seaweed samples. The concentrations of metals significantly varied within and between the investigated species of seaweed samples (P < 0.05). It was revealed that Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn metals were present in the species of seaweeds at different concentration. The residual levels of metals were less than the maximum allowable levels specified for human consumption compared to PTWIs, JECFA, FAO/WHO, FSSAI and EC. This study suggested that exposure to the analysed metals (Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn) through seaweeds consumption does not raise serious health effects to consumers and it is safe for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetomorpha 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3acadmium 3acoasts 3acopper 3ahumans 3alead 3amacroalgae 3azinc 3aIndia 0aSeaweed 0aMetals 0aAtomic absorption spectroscopy 0aFSSAI 0aFood analysis1 aNigariga, Pasumpon1 aParamasivam, Sadayan1 aRajaram, Rajendran0 tChemosphere.g2019 Apr., v. 221 p.856-862dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245007800162300001600240520117900256592002801435650000801463650002601471650002201497650001501519650001101534650001601545700005801561773011201619856008201731852000901813655001201822IND60750706820221120220158.0210916e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075070682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12562-021-01539-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zheng12aA mechanical separation method for surface ice glaze on ice-glazed shrimp  ap. 749-760.  aMost shrimp are frozen in an ice block to facilitate transport and storage. Thus, thawing or tempering is unavoidable before subsequent processing. Temperature fluctuations during storage and slow thawing may result in significant quality deterioration. Therefore, we propose a mechanical processing method to crush and separate the surface ice of ice-glazed food. Furthermore, we evaluated the applicability of stress concentration phenomenon analysis on mechanical separation. The dependence of mechanical properties on sample temperature was determined using compression and splitting tests. We also analyzed splitting fracture behavior after the splitting tests in ice-glazed samples. The stress concentration phenomenon was analyzed using measured mechanical property values. Under a splitting load, the stress generated on ice reached its fracture stress, whereas the stress generated on the shrimp was below its fracture stress. This prediction agreed with the splitting test results. Thus, we demonstrate that stress concentration phenomenon analysis is effective for predicting whether mechanical separation will break an ice glaze while maintaining food integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aice 3amechanical properties 3amechanical stress 3aprediction 3ashrimp 3atemperature1 aHagura, Yoshio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1270-71450 tFisheries science.g2021 Sept., v. 87, no. 5 p.749-760dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3867080x0919-92687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-021-01539-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245013900214300001400353500001400367506007600381520105000457592002801507506003701535650002801572650001101600650001301611650001601624650001901640650001001659650001901669650001101688650001701699650001501716650001101731650001201742650001401754650000901768650002401777650001201801653002301813653004501836653000901881653002001890653001901910700002701929700003501956700002201991700002002013700003202033773009302065856008502158852000902243655001202252IND60689996920221207094127.0200424e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068999692DNAL7 a10.1080/19336934.2016.11583652doi7 aPMC49347112pmcid7 a269546092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRohde, Palle Duun10aTesting candidate genes for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in fruit flies using a high throughput assay for complex behavior  ap. 25-34.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFruit flies are important model organisms for functional testing of candidate genes in multiple disciplines, including the study of human diseases. Here we use a high-throughput locomotor activity assay to test the response on activity behavior of gene disruption in Drosophila melanogaster. The aim was to investigate the impact of disruption of 14 candidate genes for human attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on fly behavior. By obtaining a range of correlated measures describing the space of variables for behavioral activity we show, that some mutants display similar phenotypic responses, and furthermore, that the genes disrupted in those mutants had common molecular functions; namely processes related to cGMP activity, cation channels and serotonin receptors. All but one of the candidate genes resulted in aberrant behavioral activity, suggesting involvement of these genes in behavioral activity in fruit flies. Results provide additional support for the investigated genes being risk candidate genes for ADHD in humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aassays 3abehavior 3afruit flies 3agene targeting 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aion channels 3alocomotion 3amodels 3amutants 3aphenotype 3arisk 3aserotonin receptors 3atesting 0alocomotor activity 0aattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 0aADHD 0acandidate genes 0aVideo tracking1 aMadsen, Lisbeth Strøm1 aNeumann Arvidson, Sandra Marie1 aLoeschcke, Volker1 aDemontis, Ditte1 aKristensen, Torsten Nygaard0 tFly.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 10, no. 1 p.25-34dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19336934.2016.11583653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245012500206520121300331592002801544650001201572650001301584650001401597650000901611650001901620650001101639650001101650650001601661650000901677653002301686653003401709653000801743653001801751653002501769700001701794700005601811773009001867856008501957852000902042655001202051IND60773146920221119033747.0220628e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077314692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1239182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaza, Hassan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3510-732110aInvestigation of an ammonium carbamate–based SCR system for NOx reduction in diesel engines under transient conditions  aThe deNOx performance of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system using ammonium carbamate (AC) was investigated and compared with that of a urea water solution (UWS). The effects of the NH₃/NOx (α) ratio, injection threshold temperature (Tᵢₙⱼ), and a zero-dimensional ammonia adsorption-desorption model on NOx conversion efficiency were evaluated. World harmonized transient cycle (WHTC) and non-road transient cycle (NRTC) tests were conducted using a 3.9-L diesel engine over a Cu-zeolite catalyst. The NOx conversion efficiency of AC in the WHTC and NRTC was increased compared with that of UWS during the cold phase by 6.43% and 8.71%, respectively, and during the hot phase by 14.79% and 11.93%, respectively. Gaseous ammonia injection at a low Tᵢₙⱼ can explain improved deNOx performance, as increasing Tᵢₙⱼ leads to a decrease in NOx conversion efficiency. Increasing the α ratio effectively increases NOx conversion efficiency, but a high α ratio leads to ammonia slip. Ammonia injection using a model-based control increased cold-start deNOx performance. These promising results provide an alternative pathway to controlling NOx emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium 3acatalysts 3acold 3adiesel engines 3aenergy 3amodels 3atemperature 3aurea 0aAmmonium carbamate 0aSelective catalytic reduction 0aNOx 0aDiesel engine 0aTransient test cycle1 aWoo, Sanghee1 aKim, Hongsuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2113-70250 tEnergy.g2022 July 15, v. 251 p.123918-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1239183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245010400151300002000255520154900275592002801824650000801852650004401860650002301904650001201927650003601939650002001975650001901995650002102014650000702035650002102042650001102063650002302074650001902097650001302116650001602129650001102145650003302156650003702189700001602226700001502242700001402257700001702271700001902288700001402307773012502321856007502446852000902521655001202530IND60641122620221121225520.0220402e20160906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064112262DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17689e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Na10aHigh-performance of deep eutectic solvent based aqueous bi-phasic systems for the extraction of DNA  ap. 84406-84414.  aAqueous bi-phasic systems (ABSs) based on deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are efficient and eco-friendly separation processes. Four kinds of novel green DESs were synthesized based on tetrabutylammonium bromide, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, and butyl alcohol, respectively. DES-based aqueous bi-phasic systems (ABSs) were developed and applied in the rapid and efficient extraction of DNA from salmon testes. Tetrabutylammonium bromide–ethylene glycol and sodium sulfate were selected as the appropriate phase components. Single factor experiments proved that the extraction efficiency of DNA was influenced by the mass of DES, the salt concentration, the temperature, the separation time, the pH value, and the ionic strength value. After extraction, 99.98% of the DNA was transferred to the DES-rich top phase. In order to meet the requirements of downstream applications and obtain high purity DNA, the back extraction experiments were carried out and 89.69% of the DNA could be back extracted into the salt-rich phase. Then the extraction and back-extraction were each applied to DNA complex samples containing protein, which proved that DNA could be selectively separated from complex samples. The outstanding results demonstrated that DES-based ABS is an effective and eco-friendly DNA selective separation method. Finally, FT-IR spectra, circular dichroism spectra, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy were combined to investigate the binding characteristics and the extraction mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abinding properties 3abutanol 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aethylene glycol 3aionic strength 3alight scattering 3apH 3apropylene glycol 3asalmon 3asalt concentration 3asodium sulfate 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atestes 3atetrabutylammonium compounds 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWang, Yuzhi1 aXu, Kaijia1 aWen, Qian1 aDing, Xueqin1 aZhang, Hongmei1 aYang, Qin0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 06, v. 6, no. 87 p.84406-84414dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17689e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017100164300001600335500001500351520174400366592002802110650002802138650002102166650002202187650000902209650001702218650002402235650002202259650001402281650002002295650001602315650001102331650001702342650001202359650001202371650001802383650002002401650002402421650001202445650001602457650001002473650002502483653001002508653002402518653004102542653002302583653001002606700001702616700001802633700001702651700005502668773011302723856008202836852000902918655001202927IND60551039020221116173652.0190411e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055103902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Juanjuan10aFunctional characterizations and expression profiles of ADAR2 gene, responsible for RNA editing, in response to GCRV challenge in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)  ap. 534-542.  a2019-12-06  aADAR (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA)-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a critical arm of the antiviral response. The present study focused on the structural and functional characterizations of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) ADAR2 (CiADAR2) gene. The complete genomic sequence of CiADAR2 is 150,458 bp in length, containing 12 exons and 11 introns. The open reading frame (ORF) of 2100 bp encodes a polypeptide of 699 amino acids (aa) which contains three highly conservative domains — two N-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and one C-terminal deaminase domain. The predicted crystal structure of CiADAR2 deaminase domain suggested a catalytic center form in the enzyme active site. CiADAR2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the fifteen tested tissues, and was induced post GCRV challenge in spleen and head kidney and C. idella kidney (CIK) cells. The ex vivo expression of CiADAR2 protein was verified by the Flag (tag)-based western blot assay. Antiviral activity assay of CiADAR2 was manifested by the delayed appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE) and inhibition of GCRV yield at 48 h post infection. Furthermore, in CiADAR2 overexpression cells, mRNA expression levels of CiIFN1, CiTLR7 and CiTLR8 were facilitated at different time points after GCRV infection, comparing to those in control group. Taken together, it was indicated that ADAR2 was an antiviral cytokine against GCRV and anti-GCRV function mechanism might involve in the TLR7/8-regulated IFN-signaling. These findings suggested that CiADAR2 was a novel member engaging in antiviral innate immune defense in C. idella, which laid a foundation for the further mechanism research of ADAR2 in fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aWestern blotting 3acytopathogenicity 3afish 3apolypeptides 3aopen reading frames 3acrystal structure 3acytokines 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3aspleen 3aactive sites 3aintrons 3atissues 3amessenger RNA 3aimmune response 3adouble-stranded RNA 3akidneys 3aRNA editing 3aexons 3aantiviral properties 0agenes 0aGrass carp reovirus 0aGrass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) 0aAntiviral activity 0aADAR21 aHan, Baoquan1 aRao, Youliang1 aFeng, Xiaoli1 aSu, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1340-61440 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2016 Sept., v. 56 p.534-542dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012600161300001600287520149100303592002801794650001501822650000801837650001301845650001401858650001301872650001501885650001701900650002501917650001601942650001901958700001301977700002701990700001702017700001902034773012202053856007502175852000902250655001202259IND60534430320221120035349.0160802e20120117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053443032DNAL7 a10.1021/es20356252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClausen, Per Axel10aInfluence of Temperature on the Emission of Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) from PVC Flooring in the Emission Cell FLEC  ap. 909-915.  aEmissions of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) from one type of polyvinylchloride (PVC) flooring with approximately 13% (w/w) DEHP as plasticizer were measured in the Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC). The gas-phase concentrations of DEHP versus time were measured at air flow rate of 450 mL·min–¹ and five different temperatures: 23 °C, 35 °C, 47 °C, 55 °C, and 61 °C. The experiments were terminated two weeks to three months after steady-state was reached and the interior surface of the FLECs was rinsed with methanol to determine the surface concentration of DEHP. The most important findings are (1) DEHP steady-state concentrations increased greatly with increasing temperature (0.9 ± 0.1 μg·m–³, 10 ± 1 μg·m–³, 38 ± 1 μg·m–³, 91 ± 4 μg·m–³, and 198 ± 5 μg·m–³, respectively), (2) adsorption to the chamber walls decreased greatly with increasing temperature (measured partition coefficient between FLEC air and interior surface are: 640 ± 146 m, 97 ± 20 m, 21 ± 5 m, 11 ± 2 m, and 2 ± 1 m, respectively), (3) gas-phase DEHP concentration in equilibrium with the vinyl flooring surface is close to the vapor pressure of pure DEHP, and (4) with an increase of temperature in a home from 23 to 35 °C, the amount of DEHP in the gas- and particle-phase combined is predicted to increase almost 10-fold. The amount in the gas-phase increases by a factor of 24 with a corresponding decrease in the amount on the airborne particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aair flow 3aemissions 3amethanol 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3atemperature 3avapor pressure1 aLiu, Zhe1 aKofoed-Sørensen, Vivi1 aLittle, John1 aWolkoff, Peder0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 Jan. 17, v. 46, no. 2 p.909-915dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes20356253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245008500194300001400279520100900293592002801302650001901330650001301349650001801362650001401380650001401394650002201408650002901430650002701459700002401486773010101510856007601611852000901687655001201696IND60691103920221122235944.0200427e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069110392DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.3.1.27182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolunovskiĭ, V.

This principle of convergence of oncogenic signaling – the ability of several hundred oncogenes to focus their effects on a few critical regulatory nodes that impart autonomy to the cell - motivates the search for putative focal points. Genomic, transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms that regulate the function of cancer gene pathways are all well established. It has recently become evident that cancer is also subject to translational control. Here we discuss cancer-related regulatory events that are mediated by the cap-dependent mRNA binding stage of translation initiation. This information implicates the cap-dependent protein synthesis pathway as a pleotropic integrator and amplifier of many essential oncogenic signals, and the translational control network as a bona fide molecular target for anti-cancer therapeutic interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3agenomics 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aBitterman, Peter B.0 tRNA biology.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 3, no. 1 p.10-17dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.3.1.27183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245006900193300001600262520165000278592002801928653002201956653001301978653003101991653002402022653002202046700001602068700001902084700002102103700001702124700002202141700001802163773010602181856011702287852000902404655001202413IND60131279420221118051603.0151127e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013127942DNAL7 a10.2193/0022-541X(2005)069<0345:PGORWD>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDOERNER, KINCHEL C.10aPopulation genetics of resurgence: white-tailed deer in kentucky  ap. 345-355.  aWhite-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Kentucky represent an example of successful wildlife restoration. Eliminated from all but a few remnant areas by the early part of the twentieth century, the species is once again widely distributed and abundant as a result of intensive restocking efforts since the 1940s. Seven DNA microsatellite markers were used to survey the extent and pattern of genetic variation in 322 deer from multiple localities throughout the commonwealth. Six genetically homogeneous regions and 1 heterogeneous region were identified across Kentucky. High levels of allelic diversity were detected with no apparent reduction in heterozygosity, disproportionate loss of rare alleles, or shift in modal allele frequency class as might be expected if the severe historical population size reduction generated a concomitant genetic bottleneck. These results are consistent with predictions of founder-flush models: that rapid population growth may minimize the loss of genetic variability associated with a population bottleneck. Nevertheless, comparisons of our data to that derived from other imperiled taxa suggest that species demographics can also play an important role in determining the genetic consequences of population size reduction and subsequent recovery. Our data also illuminate the critical role of deer from Land Between the Lakes (LBL) as the initial source population from which all extant Kentucky deer are descended. While generally supporting current regional management perspectives, our results argue for recognition of the LBL herd as a distinct management island of genetic and historical value.  aPublisher supplied data 0agenetic structure 0aKentucky 0amicrosatellite DNA markers 0apopulation genetics 0awhite-tailed deer1 aBRADEN, WES1 aCORK, JENNIFER1 aCunningham, Tom,1 aRICE, AMANDA1 aFURMAN, BONNIE J.1 aMcELROY, DOUG0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2005 Jan., v. 69, no. 1 p.345-355dWildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F0022-541X%282005%29069%3C0345%3APGORWD%3E2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04380naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001500175245006800190300001400258520265300272592002802925650001302953650001602966650001402982650001702996650001603013650002203029650001703051650000903068650002103077650001803098650002503116650002003141650001203161650001703173650002103190650001403211650000703225650001703232650001303249650001903262650002503281650002703306650001303333650002603346650001003372650001403382650001203396700002203408773014903430856006803579856009903647990002303746852000903769655001203778IND60643272020221122233511.0190510e20101108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064327202DNAL7 a10.3791/24452doi7 aPMC31596062pmcid7 a210851072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xueyou10aDetection of functional matrix metalloproteinases by zymography  ap. e2445.  aMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-containing endopeptidases. They degrade proteins by cleavage of peptide bonds. More than twenty MMPs have been identified and are separated into six groups based on their structure and substrate specificity (collagenases, gelatinases, membrane type [MT-MMP], stromelysins, matrilysins, and others). MMPs play a critical role in cell invasion, cartilage degradation, tissue remodeling, wound healing, and embryogenesis. They therefore participate in both normal processes and in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease1-6. Here, we will focus on MMP-2 (gelatinase A, type IV collagenase), a widely expressed MMP. We will demonstrate how to detect MMP-2 in cell culture supernatants by zymography, a commonly used, simple, and yet very sensitive technique first described in 1980 by C. Heussen and E.B. Dowdle7-10. This technique is semi-quantitative, it can therefore be used to determine MMP levels in test samples when known concentrations of recombinant MMP are loaded on the same gel11. Solutions containing MMPs (e.g. cell culture supernatants, urine, or serum) are loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; to linearize the proteins) and gelatin (substrate for MMP-2). The sample buffer is designed to increase sample viscosity (to facilitate gel loading), provide a tracking dye (bromophenol blue; to monitor sample migration), provide denaturing molecules (to linearize proteins), and control the pH of the sample. Proteins are then allowed to migrate under an electric current in a running buffer designed to provide a constant migration rate. The distance of migration is inversely correlated with the molecular weight of the protein (small proteins move faster through the gel than large proteins do and therefore migrate further down the gel). After migration, the gel is placed in a renaturing buffer to allow proteins to regain their tertiary structure, necessary for enzymatic activity. The gel is then placed in a developing buffer designed to allow the protease to digest its substrate. The developing buffer also contains p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) to activate the non-proteolytic pro-MMPs into active MMPs. The next step consists of staining the substrate (gelatin in our example). After washing the excess dye off the gel, areas of protease digestion appear as clear bands. The clearer the band, the more concentrated the protease it contains. Band staining intensity can then be determined by densitometry, using a software such as ImageJ, allowing for sample comparison.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3ablood serum 3acartilage 3acell culture 3acollagenase 3acomputer software 3adensitometry 3adyes 3aelectric current 3aembryogenesis 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3agelatin 3agelatinase A 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apathogenesis 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3astaining 3asubstrate specificity 3aurine 3aviscosity 3awashing1 aBeeton, Christine0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2010 Nov. 08, , no. 45 p.e2445-e2445dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/24453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2445/detection-of-functional-matrix-metalloproteinases-by-zymography  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012400167300001600291500001500307520166300322592002801985650001302013650002802026650001402054650001302068650002102081650002402102650001402126650001502140650001802155650001102173650001502184650000902199650002402208650002402232650001502256650001702271650001902288650001902307650002102326650002702347653001502374700001602389700002202405700002002427700001902447700002002466700001902486700001702505700001402522700001802536700001802554700001802572700001902590773012802609856008202737852000902819655001202828IND60089619720221118140438.0141102e20120810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008961972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Woochul10aPhorbol myristate acetate differentiates human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells into functional cardiogenic cells  ap. 740-746.  a2019-12-06  aTo achieve effective regeneration of injured myocardium, it is important to find physiological way of improving the cardiogenic differentiation of stem cells. Previous studies demonstrated that cardiomyocytes from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) activated with phorbolmyristate acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, restore electromechanical function in infarcted rat hearts. In this study, we investigated the effect of PMA on cardiogenic differentiation of adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) for clinical applications. To confirm the effect of PMA, ASCs treated with 1μM PMA were grown for nine days. The expression of cardiac-specific markers (cardiac troponin T, myosin light chain, myosin heavy chain) in PMA-treated MSCs was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. Alhough few α₁A receptors exist in ASCs, α₁-adrenergic receptor subtypes were preferentially expressed in PMA-treated ASCs. Moreover, expression of the β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors increased in PMA-treated ASCs compared to normal cells. The mRNA levels of Ca²⁺-related factors (SERCA 2a; sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase, LTCC; L-type Ca²⁺ channel) in treated ASCs were similar to the levels in cardiomyocytes. Following the transplantation of chemically activated cardiogenic ASCs into infarcted myocardium, histological analysis showed that infarct size, interstitial fibrosis, and apoptotic index were markedly decreased and cardiac function was restored. In conclusion, PMA might induce the cardiogenic differentiation of human ASCs as well as BMSCs. This result suggests successful use of human ASCs in cardiac regeneration therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3areceptors 3afibrosis 3acalcium channels 3amyosin light chains 3aapoptosis 3ainfarction 3amessenger RNA 3ahumans 3astem cells 3arats 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amyosin heavy chains 3atroponin T 3atherapeutics 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3aprotein kinase C 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 0amyocardium1 aLim, Soyeon1 aSong, Byeong-Wook1 aLee, Chang Youn1 aPark, Moon-Seo1 aChung, Young-An1 aYoon, Cheesoon1 aLee, Se-Yeon1 aHam, Onju1 aPark, Jun-Hee1 aChoi, Eunhyun1 aMaeng, Lee-So1 aHwang, Ki-Chul0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Aug. 10, v. 424, no. 4 p.740-746dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245007900169300001600248520151600264592002801780650001801808650002001826650001801846650001701864650002901881650001701910650001601927650001901943650000901962650001201971650001101983650001101994650000702005650001502012653001302027653001702040653000702057653001902064653002102083653003002104700001502134700001602149700005702165700005702222773009102279856009002370852000902460655001202469IND60628204120221122221507.0190326e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062820412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pei10aModeling kinetics of Ni dissociation from humic substances based on WHAM 7  ap. 254-262.  aUnderstanding the kinetics of Ni dissociation from dissolved organic matter (DOM) helps to better predict the fate and bioavailability of Ni ions in the environment. However, there is still a lack of predictive models for the kinetics of Ni dissociation from DOM under different reaction conditions. In this study, kinetics of Ni dissociation from humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), two most important components in DOM for Ni binding, was studied with a competing ligand exchange method at varying Ni concentrations, reaction pH, and ionic strength. The kinetic data were analyzed using a mechanistic kinetics model developed based on the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM). Experimental results showed that Ni dissociation rates were affected by both Ni concentrations and pH, and Ni dissociation from FA had faster rates than that from HA. The kinetics model can reproduce the experimental data well, with only two model fitting parameters for different reaction conditions. The modeling results showed that various HA and FA binding sites played different roles in controlling Ni dissociation rates, with bidentate binding sites and the weak tridentate sites being the most significant. At high pH values the Ni re-association reactions were significant for controlling the overall rates of Ni dissociation but had minimal impact at lower pH values. Our model provided a modeling framework based on WHAM 7 for predicting Ni dissociation rates when humic substances were the dominant binding ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3abioavailability 3adata analysis 3adissociation 3adissolved organic matter 3afulvic acids 3ahumic acids 3aionic strength 3aions 3aligands 3amodels 3anickel 3apH 3aprediction 0aKinetics 0aDissociation 0aNi 0aKinetics model 0aHumic substances 0aCompeting ligand exchange1 aDing, Yang1 aLiu, Minqin1 aLiang, Yuzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1958-50241 aShi, Zhenqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3131-32480 tChemosphere.g2019 Apr., v. 221 p.254-262dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245007800163300001400241520144100255592002801696650001901724650001401743650001001757650001201767650001801779650001901797650002401816650001501840650002001855650001301875650002201888650002301910700002301933700002101956700002001977700002501997700001902022700002102041700002002062700001902082700002202101700002002123700001502143700002002158700002702178700002102205700002102226773010102247856007602348852000902424655001202433IND60691104120221120165243.0200427e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069110412DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.3.1.27892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrith, Martin C.10aDiscrimination of Non-Protein-Coding Transcripts from Protein-Coding mRNA  ap. 40-48.  aSeveral recent studies indicate that mammals and other organisms produce large numbers of RNA transcripts that do not correspond to known genes. It has been suggested that these transcripts do not encode proteins, but may instead function as RNAs. However, discrimination of coding and noncoding transcripts is not straightforward, and different laboratories have used different methods, whose ability to perform this discrimination is unclear. In this study, we examine ten bioinformatic methods that assess protein-coding potential and compare their ability and congruency in the discrimination of noncoding from coding sequences, based on four underlying principles: open reading frame size, sequence similarity to known proteins or protein domains, statistical models of protein-coding sequence, and synonymous versus nonsynonymous substitution rates. Despite these different approaches, the methods show broad concordance, suggesting that coding and noncoding transcripts can, in general, be reliably discriminated, and that many of the recently discovered extra-genic transcripts are indeed noncoding. Comparison of the methods indicates reasons for unreliable predictions, and approaches to increase confidence further. Conversely and surprisingly, our analyses also provide evidence that as much as ~10% of entries in the manually curated protein database Swiss-Prot are erroneous translations of actually noncoding transcripts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3adatabases 3agenes 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aopen reading frames 3aprediction 3aprotein domains 3aproteins 3asequence homology 3astatistical models1 aBailey, Timothy L.1 aKasukawa, Takeya1 aMignone, Flavio1 aKummerfeld, Sarah K.1 aMadera, Martin1 aSunkara, Sirisha1 aFuruno, Masaaki1 aBult, Carol J.1 aQuackenbush, John1 aKai, Chikatoshi1 aKawai, Jun1 aCarninci, Piero1 aHayashizaki, Yoshihide1 aPesole, Graziano1 aMattick, John S.0 tRNA biology.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 3, no. 1 p.40-48dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.3.1.27893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012100165300001600286520137800302592002801680650001501708650003001723650002101753650003001774650001601804650001501820650002201835650001201857650001001869650001001879650001001889650001401899650001901913650002001932650002001952650001501972650001401987650001402001650001202015650001202027653003002039653000902069653002702078653002002105653003002125700001902155700001302174700001702187700001202204700001702216700001402233773011202247856008202359852000902441655001202450IND60551039320221116173549.0190411e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055103932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jinling10aToll receptor response to white spot syndrome virus challenge in giant freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii)  ap. 148-159.  aToll receptors are evolutionary ancient families of pattern recognition receptors with crucial roles in invertebrate innate immune response. In this study, we identified a Toll receptor (MrToll) from giant freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii). The full-length cDNA of MrToll is 4257 bp, which encodes a putative protein of 1367 amino acids. MrToll contains 17 LRR domains, a transmembrane domain, and a TIR domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MrToll was grouped with Drosophila Toll7 and other arthropod Tolls. The transcripts of MrToll are mainly distributed in the heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, and intestine. A low level of MrToll expression can be detected in hemocytes and the lymphoid organ. MrToll expression in gills was gradually upregulated to the highest level from 24 h to 48 h during the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. The expression levels of the crustin (Cru) genes Cru3 and Cru7 in gills were relatively lower than those of Cru2 and Cru4. The expression levels of Cru3 and Cru7 were inhibited after the RNA interference of MrToll in gills during the WSSV challenge. The anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) genes ALF2, ALF3, ALF4, and ALF5 were also regulated by MrToll in gills during the virus challenge. These findings suggest that MrToll may contribute to the innate immune defense of M. rosenbergii against WSSV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 3aRNA interference 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aamino acids 3aarthropods 3acomplementary DNA 3acrustin 3agenes 3agills 3aheart 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3aintestines 3aphylogeny 3areceptors 3astomach 3aviruses 0aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 0aToll 0aAntimicrobial peptides 0aInnate immunity 0aWhite spot syndrome virus1 aZhao, Lingling1 aJin, Min1 aLi, Tingting1 aWu, Lei1 aChen, Yihong1 aRen, Qian0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2016 Oct., v. 57 p.148-159dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245016100168300001400329520158300343592002801926650002801954650001801982650001902000650001002019650001302029650001902042650003402061650001202095650001302107650001402120650002602134650002702160700001802187773010102205856007602306852000902382655001202391IND60691104320221120161841.0200427e20060401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069110432DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.3.2.29902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharyya, Sankar13aAn Apical GAGA Loop within 5’ UTR of the Coxsackievirus B3 RNA Maintains Structural Organization of the IRES Element Required for Efficient Ribosome Entry  ap. 60-68.  aCoxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) a close relative of Poliovirus has been implicated as the primary cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in humans. The single-stranded, plus sense, viral genomic RNA is naturally uncapped and the translation of viral encoded protein is initiated from an ‘Internal Ribosome entry site’ (IRES) element at the 5' untranslated region (UTR). The 741 nucleotide 5'UTR is highly structured, with defined stem loops. Previously, we have reported results of probing the secondary structure of the 5'UTR RNA, and showed the existence of 11 putative stem loop (SL) structures, SL A-K. Further, using mutants, we showed the importance of an apical GAGA loop in SL-H, in IRES activity. In addition to significantly reducing CVB3 IRES activity the mutations in the 5'UTR drastically reduced interaction with La autoantigen, a critical trans acting factor. Here, we demonstrate that mutation of the GAGA loop to CAGU alters the structure around SL-H, and reduces the interaction of La protein with critical cis acting elements of the IRES RNA. Interestingly, mutation of the loop to GAAA also has similar effect, suggesting the GAGA sequence of the loop, is necessary for the function. Furthermore, using gene specific siRNA against La protein we have demonstrated La protein to be a bona fide trans acting factor for CVB3 IRES. However, upon partial knockdown of La protein, translation mediated by the mutant 5'UTRs are affected to a similar extent as the wild type, implicating the structural alteration as the reason for the effect of the mutations on IRES activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5' untranslated regions 3aEnterovirus C 3acardiomyopathy 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahuman diseases 3ainternal ribosome entry sites 3amutants 3amutation 3aribosomes 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranslation (genetics)1 aDas, Saumitra0 tRNA biology.g2006 Apr. 1, v. 3, no. 2 p.60-68dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.3.2.29903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245009300207520155600300592002801856650000801884650001501892650001701907650001001924650001601934650001401950650001101964650001101975653001901986653000902005653003202014653001602046700002002062700002202082700002902104773009802133856008702231852000902318655001202327IND60659370620221120155112.0201125e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065937062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1136972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer, Karl1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0905-470210aEvaluation of a new DCFB reactor system for chemical looping combustion of gaseous fuels  aA 120 kWₜₕ chemical looping combustion pilot plant, has been used to evaluate the performance of up to 10 different oxygen carrier materials within more than 1000 h of operation. It was one of the largest pilot plants, featuring a scale up ready design and auto thermal operation. Initially the plant was designed for nickel based oxygen carriers. During the evaluation of other materials, limitations of the reactor design caused by different design demands of the oxygen carriers have been identified. A new reactor system has been installed incorporating design adaptations to improve the reactor flexibility and performance. The new air reactor is narrower and allows higher gas velocities and high solid circulation rates, even at lower fuel loads. The upper loop seal, connecting the air reactor with the fuel reactor has been optimized to reduce a gas leakage between the reactors, identified in the old reactor system. The new fuel reactor consists of two sections, a lower part with a larger cross section and a narrower upper part. This allows larger specific inventories in the reactor and good gas/solid contact over the full reactor height. The new reactor system has been evaluated during a benchmark campaign, using a manganese based oxygen carrier which has also been used in the old unit. The results are reported in this work. The new design meets the design criteria, high solids circulation is possible, higher specific inventories can be operated and the gas leakage via the upper loop seal has been reduced significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion 3afuel loading 3afuels 3ainventories 3amanganese 3anickel 3aoxygen 0aReactor design 0aCLOU 0aChemical looping combustion 0aPilot study1 aPenthor, Stefan1 aStollhof, Michael1 aHofbauer, H.q(Hermann),0 tApplied energy.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 255 p.113697-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1136973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011300165520205200278592002802330650001902358650000902377650001502386650002202401650001102423650001902434650001702453650001302470650001302483650002202496650001402518650001802532650001102550650001202561650001002573650001702583650001702600653003602617653001602653653003002669653003102699653002002730700001402750700001802764700005702782700001602839700001802855700001802873700001602891773009002907856008502997852000903082655001203091IND60773147620221119035048.0220628e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077314762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1239302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiawei10aPhysicochemical structure, combustion characteristics and SiO2 properties of entrained flow gasification ash  aDuring the gasification process of coal, fine ash (FA) and coarse slag (CS) solid waste are produced, which contain a large amount of residual carbon and ash (mainly SiO₂), resulting in energy waste and environmental pollution. Therefore the main goal of this research is to recover the wasted energy from FA and CS. The investigation of the physicochemical structure, combustion characteristics and SiO₂ properties of entrained flow gasification ash (EFGA) is an important basis for the valorization of EFGA. The physicochemical, combustion characteristics and SiO₂ properties of EFGA in a entrained flow bed of 112,000 Nm³/h gas-forming capacity were investigated, showing that FA and CS undergo different gasification processes, with FA having a more developed pore structure and high specific surface area. FA and CS have different degrees of graphitization, with defects or heteroatoms in FA causing a scattered carbon layer structure with an irregular graphitic carbon crystal structure, and organic molecular functional group fragments forming an indeterminate structure and active sites. The organic molecule functional group fragments constitute an indeterminate structure and active sites. Kinetic analysis shows that the influence of chemical structure on the combustion characteristics of EFGA is higher than that of physical structure. Compared to CS, FA has fewer active sites and a small number of oxygen-containing functional groups, resulting in a weaker combustion reactivity of FA. The combustion activity of EFGA is lower than that of circulating fluidized bed gasification ash and anthracite, making it difficult to be eliminated by direct combustion, although co-combustion is feasible. The specific surface area of SiO₂ prepared by EFGA after acid treatment and calcination is small (<39.7086 m²/g), SiO₂ exists as crystals and the elemental silicon exists mainly in the form of Si–O, O–Si–O and hydrated silicon dioxide Si–O₂-nH₂O, which can be used as a raw material for the preparation of silica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3acoal 3acombustion 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3agraphene 3akinetics 3aorganic compounds 3apollution 3araw materials 3asilica 3asilicon 3aslags 3asolid wastes 3asurface area 0aEntrained flow gasification ash 0aSolid waste 0aPhysicochemical structure 0aCombustion characteristics 0aSiO2 properties1 aFan, Subo1 aZhang, Xuyang1 aChen, Zhichao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8431-60661 aQiao, Yanyu1 aYuan, Zhenhua1 aZeng, Lingyan1 aLi, Zhengqi0 tEnergy.g2022 July 15, v. 251 p.123930-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1239303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245022700189300001600416520143500432592002801867653002001895653003401915653002301949653001801972653003001990653002502020773010602045856011702151852000902268655001202277IND60131280020221118045456.0151127e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013128002DNAL7 a10.2193/0022-541X(2005)069[0466:DASMIT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHUETTMANN, FALK10aResearch and management viewpoint: databases and science-based management in the context of wildlife and habitat: toward a certified iso standard for objective decision-making for the global community by using the internet  ap. 466-472.  aAdaptive and science-based management is widely accepted as necessary to safeguard wildlife and their habitats into the future. However, many of the decisions in this field are still based on unsupported ideas that lack validation with real data and which do not make their analysis available for a public review. Decisions based on soft foundations can be harmful to wildlife, habitat and the survival of both. I suggest a new wildlife management approach founded on scientific databases that has become possible, if not imperative, with improved technology and increasing access to freely available data over the Word Wide Web (WWW). This approach is partly a consequence of the effective implementation of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. In order to justify management decisions relating to wildlife, habitat, and conservation, the listing, use, and full investigation of all available and relevant databases needs to be implemented, voluntarily or legally, as a prerequisite. Second, similar to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards, each major wildlife management decision needs to add a standard management documentation system as a backup that clearly records what data and research were or were not available at that time and what the recommended research still needs to address in order to complete the data situation and to decrease uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 0adecision-making 0ainternet (World Wide Web WWW) 0alegal requirements 0aglobal policy 0apublic information access 0ascientific databases0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2005 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.466-472dWildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F0022-541X%282005%29069%5B0466%3ADASMIT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245008300214300001400297500001400311506007600325520128100401592002801682506003701710650001501747650002201762650001001784650001901794650001201813650001701825650001101842650001201853650002401865650001201889650001701901650002601918653001001944653001101954653002201965653002501987700002302012773009302035856008502128852000902213655001202222IND60689997720221207092806.0200424e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068999772DNAL7 a10.1080/19336934.2016.11743532doi7 aPMC49347292pmcid7 a270641992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuncan, Olivia F.10aMitochondrial retrograde signaling in the Drosophila nervous system and beyond  ap. 19-24.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMitochondrial dysfunction has been suggested to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Cells respond to changes in the functional state of mitochondria via retrograde signaling pathways from the mitochondria to the nucleus, but little is known about retrograde signaling in the nervous system. We have recently shown that inhibition of retrograde signaling reduces the impact of neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction. We performed a study designed to characterize the mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway in the Drosophila nervous system. Using several different models we found that neuronal specific mitochondrial dysfunction results in defects in synapse development and neuronal function. Moreover, we identified the Drosophila hypoxia inducible factor α (HIFα) ortholog Sima as a key neuronal transcriptional regulator. Knock-down of sima restores function in several Drosophila models of mitochondrial dysfunction, including models of human disease. Here we discuss these findings and speculate on the potential benefits of inhibition of retrograde signaling. We also describe how our results relate to other studies of mitochondrial retrograde signaling and the potential therapeutic applications of these discoveries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aParkinson disease 3acells 3ahuman diseases 3ahypoxia 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aneurons 3asignal transduction 3asynapse 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factors 0aHIFα 0aneuron 0aneurodegeneration 0aretrograde signaling1 aBateman, Joseph M.0 tFly.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 10, no. 1 p.19-24dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19336934.2016.11743533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011300164300001800277520135000295592002801645596008201673596007901755596006301834596009901897650001401996650002502010650002402035650001202059650001302071650001602084650001102100650001502111650002002126650001702146650001102163650001202174650002002186650001302206650001502219650001902234650001402253650001702267650001702284650001702301650002102318650001002339650000902349650002502358650001302383700001902396700001302415700002002428700001802448700001502466700001602481700001802497700001902515773012502534856008302659852000902742655001202751IND60676309320221116155247.0200523e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067630932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-019-09924-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, MengJie10aEffects of Modifiers on the Growth, Photosynthesis, and Antioxidant Enzymes of Cotton Under Cadmium Toxicity  ap. 1196-1205.  aThe effects of four liquid modifiers (organic–inorganic composite modifier, inorganic polymer compound modifier, polyacrylate compound modifier, and organic polymer compound modifier) on plant growth, cadmium (Cd) content, photosynthetic parameters and antioxidant enzymes were studied in cotton (Xinluzao) under Cd stress (5 mg kg⁻¹) in a barrel experiment. The results showed that the Cd treatment of soil increased Cd content in cotton and reduced plant height, net photosynthesis rate (Pn), chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, antioxidant enzyme activity, and biomass. However, the application of liquid modifiers alleviated Cd stress, increased plant biomass, and decreased Cd content in plant organs as well as Cd transport coefficients of the stem and cottonseed. At the same time, there was an increase in gas exchange, photosynthetic pigment content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) activity in cotton leaves, whereas malondialdehyde content (MDA) decreased. These results suggest a positive role of liquid modifiers in alleviating Cd stress in cotton, which was due to (1) significant reduction in Cd uptake of roots and Cd-transportation to leaves and (2) improvement in the antioxidant activity, which regulated the oxidants to a level under control, minimizing the oxidative damage in cotton.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015DFA11660cInternational Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China  a2016YFC0501406cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a31560169cThe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aGJHZ201706cInternational Science &Technology Cooperation Promotion Plan of Shihezi University 3aGossypium 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acadmium 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acotton 3acottonseed 3aenzyme activity 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3aliquids 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidants 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aplant organs 3apolyacrylic acid 3aroots 3asoil 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity1 aWang, HaiJiang1 aFan, Hua1 aIppolito, J.

The study provides coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTADs) essential for diet formulations aimed at further growth performance and nutrient utilization studies with gadoids using these waste streams as potential replacements for high-cost fish meals and poorly digestible wheat by-products. Organic matter (OM) CTTAD was significantly improved (P=0.005) with Shrimp150 (0.82) relative to the Control (0.79), while Shrimp300 was similar (0.79) (P=1.000). No significant difference in OM CTTAD was found between the Control and Crab150 (P=0.110), Shrimp150 (P=0.473) or Shrimp300 (P=0.144) at an average of 0.80. However, OM CTTAD was significantly reduced (P<0.001) for Crab300 (0.76). Inclusion of Shrimp at 150g/kg significantly improved (P=0.003) gross energy (GE) CTTAD (0.85 on average) relative to the Control (0.83), while Crab150 (P=0.081), Crab300 (P=0.134) and Shrimp300 (P=0.986) were statistically equal to the Control (average, 0.82). Crude protein (CP) CTTAD of Crab150 (P=0.803) and Shrimp150 (P=0.980) were similar to the Control at an average of 0.90 while Crab300 (P<0.001) and Shrimp300 (P=0.005) were significantly reduced (average 0.86). Dietary inclusion of either Atlantic snow crab or Northern pink shrimp processing by-product meal at 150g/kg, concomitant with a 50% reduction in wheat middlings and 10% reduction in fish meal, resulted in OM, GE and CP CTTADs equal to or exceeding that of the fish meal-based Control diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChionoecetes opilio 3aMelanogrammus aeglefinus 3abyproducts 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3afish meal 3agrowth performance 3ahaddock 3amiddlings 3anutrient utilization 3aorganic matter 3ashrimp 3awheat 0aOM 0aGE 0aCP 0aFCR 0aDP 0aDE 0aIFN 0aCTTAD 0aHaddock 0aGadoid 0aCrab 0aShrimp 0aNutrient digestibility1 aLall, Santosh P.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2013 June 12, v. 182, no. 1-4 p.126-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2013.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245006300175300001400238520094800252592002801200650002501228650002301253650002801276650002401304650001101328773013901339856005701478852000901535655001201544IND4480352120221120231103.0120418e198604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448035212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1986.tb00451.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuilkey, John J.10aPromotion of primary products — a view from the cloister  ap. 38-52.  aThis paper is a discourse on how promotion may contribute to the efficiency of consumption. The view is taken that, through its addition to the quantity of search with respect to product characteristics, promotion may enable consumers to allocate their expenditures more efficiently and yield additional revenue to producers of the promoted product. The central plea is for consistency in the identification of promotion objectives, the implementation of the promotion program and monitoring of the outcome. In an idiosyncratic way, the promotion objectives are framed as being related to price and income elasticities and it is argued that promotional outcomes should be monitored in terms of these elasticities. Supply shifts may complement promotion strategies to the advantage or disadvantage of producers and the outcomes in terms of producer surplus are examined for particular promotion strategies and shifts in linear supply functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer expenditure 3aconsumers (people) 3aconsumption (economics) 3aincome elasticities 3asupply0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g1986 Apr., v. 30, no. 1 p.38-52dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8489.1986.tb00451.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013200160300001600292500002000308520137800328592002801706596007701734596007701811596007701888650001001965650002501975650002602000650001602026650002002042650002002062650002502082650001502107650003002122650002302152650001002175700005702185700006002242700001902302700002302321700006102344700005902405700005502464700001902519700001802538700001702556700005602573700006002629700005902689700006002748773012002808856007302928852000903001655001203010IND60751100720221118120624.0210922e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075110072DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.176242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanigaki, Shinji10aGene expression shapes the patterns of parallel evolution of herbicide resistance in the agricultural weed Monochoria vaginalis  ap. 928-940.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds is an example of parallel evolution, through which genes encoding herbicide target proteins are repeatedly represented as evolutionary targets. The number of herbicide target‐site genes differs among species, and little is known regarding the effects of duplicate gene copies on the evolution of herbicide resistance. We investigated the evolution of herbicide resistance in Monochoria vaginalis, which carries five copies of sulfonylurea target‐site acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes. Suspected resistant populations collected across Japan were investigated for herbicide sensitivity and ALS gene sequences, followed by functional characterization and ALS gene expression analysis. We identified over 60 resistant populations, all of which carried resistance‐conferring amino acid substitutions exclusively in MvALS1 or MvALS3. All MvALS4 alleles carried a loss‐of‐function mutation. Although the enzymatic properties of ALS encoded by these genes were not markedly different, the expression of MvALS1 and MvALS3 was prominently higher among all ALS genes. The higher expression of MvALS1 and MvALS3 is the driving force of the biased representation of genes during the evolution of herbicide resistance in M. vaginalis. Our findings highlight that gene expression is a key factor in creating evolutionary hotspots.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017‐4cJapan Association for Advancement of Phyto‐Regulators (JAPR)  a2018‐4cJapan Association for Advancement of Phyto‐Regulators (JAPR)  a2019‐2cJapan Association for Advancement of Phyto‐Regulators (JAPR) 3aJapan 3aMonochoria vaginalis 3aacetolactate synthase 3aamino acids 3aduplicate genes 3agene expression 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3aloss-of-function mutation 3aparallel evolution 3aweeds1 aUchino, Akira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9666-22221 aOkawa, Shigenori1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3163-99341 aMiura, Chikako1 aHamamura, Kenshiro1 aMatsuo, Mitsuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9155-06431 aYoshino, Namiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9685-040X1 aUeno, Naoya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1080-50831 aToyama, Yusuke1 aFukumi, Naoya1 aKijima, Eiji1 aMasuda, Taro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5549-375X1 aShimono, Yoshiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3432-06141 aTominaga, Tohru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6231-08511 aIwakami, Satoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4012-98990 tThe new phytologist.g2021 Oct., v. 232, no. 2 p.928-940dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.176243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009800174520201400272592002802286650001602314650002202330650001102352650001102363650001202374650001102386650001702397650002002414651001502434653001702449653001802466653003202484653002402516653001602540700002902556773009802585856008702683852000902770655001202779IND60659370920221120155251.0200117e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065937092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Patrick R.10aShaping photovoltaic array output to align with changing wholesale electricity price profiles  aLarge-scale deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) contributes to the occurrence of depressed—and sometimes negative—electricity prices during daylight hours as PV displaces higher-cost generators in the merit-order dispatch stack. These changes in electricity price provide an opportunity to increase the wholesale energy revenue of PV generators through temporal shaping of PV output. Here, we explore the impact of three output-shaping strategies on PV wholesale energy revenue and capacity factor: utilization of 1-axis tracking, curtailment during negative-price hours, and modification of fixed-tilt array orientation. Utility-scale PV arrays are modeled at more than 10,000 pricing nodes across six United States electricity markets over the 2010–2017 time period. Large changes in revenue-optimized output profiles are observed for the California system, where solar capacity penetration has increased from ∼2% of peak load in 2010 to ∼28% of peak load in 2017, and the wholesale revenue benefits of temporal output shaping are increasing with time. On the California real-time market in 2017, compared to capacity-factor-optimized fixed-tilt arrays with must-run operation, curtailment increases revenues by 9%, curtailment in conjunction with fixed-tilt orientation optimization increases revenues by 20%, 1-axis tracking without curtailment increases revenues by 32%, and 1-axis tracking with curtailment increases revenues by 42% for the median node. Median optimal fixed-tilt azimuths for PV on the real-time market in California have increased from 192° in 2010 to 235° (i.e. 55° west of south) in 2017. Among the markets and years studied, the California market in 2017 demonstrates the largest potential benefit from temporal output shaping. These results highlight mechanisms for mitigating some of the decline in PV wholesale value at high solar penetrations, and illustrate the importance of adapting PV installation and dispatch strategies to changing power system conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3aincome 3amarkets 3aprices 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aCalifornia 0aSolar energy 0aPhotovoltaics 0aLocational marginal pricing 0aElectricity markets 0aCurtailment1 aO’Sullivan, Francis M.0 tApplied energy.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 256 p.113734-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245009600159300001600255520119000271592002801461650002701489650001501516650001101531650003701542650001301579650001301592650001001605650002801615650002401643650001801667650001901685651001301704651001001717700002501727700001401752700001301766700001501779700002301794700002101817700002301838700001501861700001501876700001501891700001601906773009001922856004802012852000902060655001202069IND4479059020221119173817.0120417e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447905902DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-011-0202-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTindo, M.10aCurrent distribution and population dynamics of the little fire ant supercolony in Cameroon  ap. 175-182.  aThe little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, is native to Central America, but has been introduced into many parts of the world. We examined the current distribution of W. auropunctata in Cameroon, tested for aggression between workers from different parts of the country, and examined the genotypes of workers, queens, and males to evaluate the mating system. We found W. auropunctata at 36 sites in three provinces (Centre, East, and South). We found W. auropunctata only in human-disturbed habitats. Its spread appears to be primarily human mediated. Aggressive behaviour was almost non-existent between workers from different sites, indicating that there is only one supercolony in Cameroon. Our genetic analysis found that only one male/female pair of clones was introduced into Cameroon, probably from Gabon. No new male clonal lineage was identified, whereas new sexually derived female clonal lineages were noted. Apart from the genotype of the founding queen, which was well distributed but generally not dominant, a new clonal queen genotype emerged and was both omnipresent and dominant at most sites. These results may be useful in the development of management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWasmannia auropunctata 3aaggression 3aclones 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3amales 3apopulation distribution 3apopulation dynamics 3aqueen insects 3aworker insects 3aCameroon 3aGabon1 aMbenoun Masse, P.

This paper investigates the possibility of reducing the risks associated with the presence of these pollutants in sediments by amending the sediment with carbon-rich materials (activated carbon (AC) and humus (HC)) to sequester the contaminants and render them biologically unavailable. The effects of the dose and contact time between the sediment and the carbon-rich amendments on the effectiveness of the detoxification are estimated. Four doses of carbon-rich amendments (0.5–10%) and four equilibration contact times (14–180 days) were investigated. Results have shown that the bioavailable fraction of γ-HCH and HCB decreased significantly in comparison to the unamended sediment. Regarding the AC amendments, almost 100% for both compounds; and for HC amendments around 95% for γ-HCH, and 75% for HCB. Aging caused further reductions in the bioavailable fraction, compared to the untreated sediment. Phytotoxicity tests showed that Zea mays accumulated significantly higher amount of γ-HCH and HCB from unamended sediment, comparing to Cucurbita pepo and Lactuca sativa. Toxicity of HC and AC amended sediment assessed by Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition test and by measuring Zea mays germination and biomass yield was significantly reduced in the amended sediment samples. γ-HCH and HCB accumulation in the Zea mays biomass in the unamended sediment were a significantly higher than in the all HC and AC amended sediment. Both sorbents show potential to be used as remediation agents for organically contaminated sediment, but AC exhibited the better performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita pepo 3aLactuca sativa 3aVibrio fischeri 3aZea mays 3aactivated carbon 3abiomass production 3agermination 3ahexachlorobenzene 3ahumus 3alindane 3aluminescence 3aphytotoxicity 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asorbents 0aSequestration 0aBioavailability 0aToxicity 0aCarbon-rich sorbents 0aSediment remediation1 aMaletić, Snežana1 aBeljin, Jelena1 aIsakovski, Marijana Kragulj1 aRončević, Srđan1 aTubić, Aleksandra1 aAgbaba, Jasmina0 tChemosphere.g2019 Apr., v. 220 p.1033-1040dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245023700161300002000398520112700418592002801545650004401573650002201617650002101639650002201660650001401682650001101696650003701707650001601744650001601760650001001776650002001786650002401806650001901830650001801849650001901867650001501886650001501901650001501916650003301931650001601964700002301980700002402003700002602027773012502053856007502178852000902253655001202262IND60641123520221121170653.0220402e20160905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064112352DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17712c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhafuri, Hossein10aSynthesis and characterization of a new magnetic nanocomposite with metalloporphyrin (Co-TPyP) and sulfated tin dioxide (Fe₃O₄@SnO₂/SO₄²⁻), and investigation of its photocatalytic effects in the degradation of Rhodamine B  ap. 83947-83953.  aTo achieve the synthesis of (Fe₃O₄@SnO₂/SO₄²⁻), after the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles of Fe₃O₄ (MNP), tin dioxide was supported on the MNP, and it was sulfated using ammonium sulfate. To improve the photocatalytic activity of this magnetic nanocatalyst, after the synthesis of 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl) porphyrin and its cobalt metalloporphyrin, (Co-TPyP) was stabilized on Fe₃O₄@SnO₂/SO₄²⁻. The structure and morphology were characterized by XRD, EDX, FT-IR, SEM and FE-SEM. The X-ray diffraction studies showed tetragonal SnO₂ and the orthorhombic structure of Fe₃O₄. The Fe₃O₄@SnO₂/SO₄²⁻ is an acidic heterogeneous nanocatalyst with excellent magnetic properties and can be easily separated from the reaction mixture by an external magnetic field. The photocatalytic activity was investigated by studying the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The simplicity of the workup processes, the low cost of the catalyst and its high efficiency in the degradation of RhB are outstanding advantages of this procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aammonium sulfate 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airon oxides 3airradiation 3alight 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aporphyrins 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atin dioxide1 aMohammadi, Fatemeh1 aRahimi, Rahmatallah1 aMohammadiyan, Esmaeel0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 05, v. 6, no. 87 p.83947-83953dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17712c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245012000202300001600322500002000338520145300358592002801811596003101839596003101870596003101901596003101932596004001963596003502003596004002038596003402078650001502112650001702127650003302144650002602177650001302203650001802216650001102234650001502245650002102260650002002281650001102301651001802312700005802330700006102388700006802449700006502517700006202582700005502644773012002699856007302819852000902892655001202901IND60751100820221118120658.0210922e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075110082DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.176232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhonen, Saija H.

In addition, the communities may also be intrinsically shaped by heavy grazing, which may locally induce an ecosystem change that couples with increased soil temperature and nutrients and where shrub encroachment is less likely to occur than in lightly grazed conditions. We tested how 4 yr of experimental warming and fertilization affected organic soil fungal communities in sites with decadal history of either heavy or light reindeer grazing using high‐throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 ribosomal DNA region. Grazing history largely overrode the impacts of short‐term warming and fertilization in determining the composition of fungal communities. The less diverse fungal communities under light grazing showed more pronounced responses to experimental treatments when compared with the communities under heavy grazing. Yet, ordination approaches revealed distinct treatment responses under both grazing intensities. If grazing shifts the fungal communities in Arctic ecosystems to a different and more diverse state, this shift may dictate ecosystem responses to further abiotic changes. This indicates that the intensity of grazing cannot be left out when predicting future changes in fungi‐driven processes in the tundra.  aPublisher supplied data  a130507cAcademy of Finland  a218121cAcademy of Finland  a252323cAcademy of Finland  a310776cAcademy of Finland  cSocietas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica  cOulun Yliopiston Tukisäätiö  cElla ja Georg Ehrnroothin Säätiö  cOtto A.

We measured postmetamorphic body size for 4 species (Spea multiplicata, S. bombifrons, Bufo cognatus, Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium) and 3 age classes (metamorph, subadult, adult) of amphibians captured at playa wetlands surrounded by one of 2 general land-use types (cultivation, grassland) in the Southern High Plains. Sixteen playas (4 per land-use type in 1999 and 2000) were partially enclosed with drift fence and pitfall traps, and mass and snout-vent length (SVL) were measured from a subsample of captured individuals. Mass and SVL were 10––148%% greater for amphibians captured at grassland wetlands than at cropland wetlands for most species and age classes. Mass and SVL also were 3––124%% greater in 1999 than in 2000 for most species and age classes. We attribute differences in body size between land-use types to differences in the hydroperiods of the associated wetlands, and potentially to variation in the density of terrestrial conspecifics and aquatic predators. We attribute differences in body size between years to differences in rainfall. Body size is positively related to the probability of survival, reproduction, and evolutionary fitness in amphibians. Thus, if cultivation of landscapes surrounding wetlands negatively influences postmetamorphic body size of amphibians, restoration of native grasslands surrounding playa wetlands may help prevent local amphibian declines.  aPublisher supplied data 0aagriculture 0aamphibians 0abody size 0aconservation 0aSouthern High Plains 0awetlands1 aSmith, Loren M.,0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2005 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.515-524dWildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F0022-541X%282005%29069%5B0515%3AIOLUOP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011000164520131100274592002801585650004401613650002201657650003701679650001501716650001101731650000901742650001501751650001301766650002101779650001201800650002201812650001401834650001101848650002101859650001401880653002701894653001001921653003101931653002001962653002401982700001702006700001302023700001802036700001402054700001502068773010802083856008502191852000902276655001202285IND60759103120221119051857.0211227e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075910312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1071052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Anjun10aMercury removal from coal-fired flue gas by the mechanochemical S/FeS modified high sulfur petroleum coke  aThe mechanochemical S/FeS modified high sulfur petroleum coke (HSPC) were prepared in this work. The mercury removal performance of the adsorbents was evaluated in a simulated flue gas fixed bed experimental device. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), Hg temperature-programmed desorption (Hg-TPD) and thermogravimetric (TG) were used to obtain the physical and chemical properties of some typical samples. It shows that the mercury removal efficiency (MRE) of mechanochemical S/FeS modified HSPC (MC-S/FeS-PC) increases with increasing the S or FeS addition amount under the same mechanical conditions (600/300 rpm, 60 min), where S is superior to FeS. The mass ratio of carbon to sulfur (RCS) of 4.5 for the MC-S-PC is the optimal sulfur addition amount with the MRE of 98.6%. Mechanochemical S/FeS modification is conducive to the development pore structure of raw HSPC with certain effects. S is the main sulfur form on the surface of MC-S-PC, while thiophene, FeS, and Fe₂(SO₄)₃ are the main sulfur forms of MC-FeS-PC. The mercury compound on used adsorbents is mainly HgS (black). Moreover, another immature mechanism hypothesis about the mercury removal by MC-S-PC is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3acarbon 3acoal 3adesorption 3aflue gas 3amechanochemistry 3amercury 3amercury compounds 3apetroleum 3asulfur 3athermogravimetry 3athiophene 0aMechanochemical method 0aFeS/S 0aHigh sulfur petroleum coke 0aMercury removal 0aCoal-fired flue gas1 aZhao, Shilin1 aLuo, Hui1 aSun, Zhiqiang1 aSun, Kang1 aLi, Hesong0 tFuel processing technology.g2022 Mar., v. 227 p.107105-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1071053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245009400216300001600310520120600326592002801532650002401560650001901584650001201603650001701615650001501632650002601647650001501673650001301688650002101701650002101722650001801743650002201761650002201783650002701805650002601832650002301858650001701881650002301898650001501921650001101936650002401947653002701971653002901998653001502027653002102042653002702063700006102090700005902151700002602210700006302236773009102299856009002390852000902480655001202489IND60628204720221120104316.0190326e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062820472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonteiro, Hugo R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4913-119410aAmitraz toxicity to the midge Chironomus riparius: Life-history and biochemical responses  ap. 324-332.  aAcute and chronic toxicity of the formamidine pesticide amitraz to the midge Chironomus riparius was assessed using conventional ecotoxicological tests and biochemical approaches (biomarkers). Amitraz is mainly used as an ectoparasiticide in veterinary medicine, but also in agriculture and apiculture. However, information of amitraz toxicity to non-target invertebrates is limited. Besides the impairment of developmental and emergence rates (reduced larval growth, emergence, and delayed development time) caused by chronic exposure to amitraz, acute exposures induced alterations in the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT), and in energetic metabolism biomarkers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and electron transport system (ETS) activities. Moreover, lipid peroxidation (LPO) increased by amitraz exposure. Our results reveal potential secondary effects of amitraz to invertebrates and biomarkers that may aid in the interpretation of sub-lethal toxic responses to amitraz. These results add information concerning the potential outcomes of amitraz exposure to freshwater invertebrates underlining the importance of risk assessment studies of formamidine pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomus riparius 3aacute exposure 3aamitraz 3aantioxidants 3aapiculture 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3achronic exposure 3achronic toxicity 3aecotoxicology 3aectoparasiticides 3aelectron transfer 3aglutathione peroxidase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alarval development 3alife history 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolism 3amidges 3aveterinary medicine 0aFormamidine pesticides 0aFreshwater invertebrates 0aBiomarkers 0aOxidative stress 0aLife-history responses1 aLemos, Marco F.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9887-18641 aNovais, Sara C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1306-33961 aSoares, Amadeu M.V.M.1 aPestana, João L.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1322-29590 tChemosphere.g2019 Apr., v. 221 p.324-332dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002800180245007700208300002000285506007600305520119300381592002801574506003701602650003001639650002001669650001201689650001301701650001601714650001501730650001401745650001001759651001501769700001501784700002401799700002401823700001901847700001601866700002401882773012701906856007502033852000902108655001202117IND60534431020221207054508.0160802e20121016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053443102DNAL7 a10.1021/es300253p2doi7 aPMC36539722pmcid7 a228669362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, Christine Marie10aEvaluation of an Arsenic Test Kit for Rapid Well Screening in Bangladesh  ap. 11213-11219.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExposure to arsenic in groundwater via drinking remains unabated for millions of villagers in Bangladesh. Since a blanket testing campaign using test kits almost a decade ago, millions of new wells have been installed but not tested; thus affordable testing is needed. The performance of the Arsenic Econo-Quick (EQ) kit was evaluated by blindly testing 123 wells in Bangladesh and comparing with laboratory measurements; 65 wells were tested twice. A subset of the same 123 wells was also tested using the Hach EZ kit in the field and the Digital Arsenator in the laboratory in Bangladesh. The EQ kit correctly determined the status of 110 (89%) and 113 (92%) out of 123 wells relative to the WHO guideline (10 μg/L) and the Bangladesh standard (50 μg/L), respectively. Relative to the WHO guideline, all misclassifications were underestimates for wells containing between >10 and 27 μg/L As. Relative to the Bangladesh As standard, over- and underestimates were evenly distributed. Given its short reaction time of 10 min relative to the Hach EZ and its lower cost compared to the Arsenator, the EQ kit appears to have several advantages for well testing in Bangladesh and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanalytical kits 3aarsenic 3adrinking 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3ascreening 3awells 3aBangladesh1 aZheng, Yan1 aGraziano, Joseph H.1 aRasul, Shahriar Bin1 aHossain, Zakir1 aMey, Jacob,1 avan Geen, Alexander0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 Oct. 16, v. 46, no. 20 p.11213-11219dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes300253p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003100142245008300173300001600256520135400272592002801626650002101654650001801675650002601693650001001719650001501729650001201744650001301756650001701769650001501786700002101801700003201822700001901854773010301873856007601976852000902052655001202061IND60691104920221120141312.0200427e20060701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069110492DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.3.3.31162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Alexander Machado12aA Non‐Discriminating Aspartyl‐tRNA Synthetase from Halobacterium salinarum  ap. 110-114.  aThe tRNA‐dependent transamidation pathway is the essential route for Asn‐tRNAAsnformation in organisms that lack an asparaginyl‐tRNA synthetase. This pathway relies on anon‐discriminating aspartyl‐tRNA synthetase (ND‐AspRS encoded by aspS), an enzyme withrelaxed tRNA specificity, to form Asp‐tRNAAsn. The misacylated tRNA is then converted toAsn‐tRNAAsn by the action of an Asp‐tRNAAsn amidotransferase. Here we show that AsntRNAAsnformation in the extreme halophile Halobacterium salinarum also occurs by thistransamidation mechanism, and we explore the property of the haloarchaeal AspRS toaspartylate tRNAAsn in vivo and in vitro. Transformation of the E. coli trpA34 strain with theH. salinarum aspS and tRNAAsn genes led to restoration of tryptophan auxotrophy bymissense suppression of the trpA34 mutant with heterologously in vivo formed Asp‐tRNAAsn.The haloarchaeal AspRS works well at low and high (0.1‐3 M) salt concentrations but it isunable to use Escherichia coli tRNA as substrate. We show that mutations of two amino acids(H26 and P84) located in the AspRS anticodon binding domain limit the specificity of thisnon‐discriminating enzyme towards tRNAAsn. Thus, as was observed in an archaealdiscriminating AspRS and a bacterial ND‐AspRS, amino acids in these positions influencethe enzyme’s tRNA selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aHalobacterium 3aaspartate-tRNA ligase 3agenes 3ahalophiles 3amutants 3amutation 3atransfer RNA 3atryptophan1 aPolycarpo, Carla1 aMartins, Orlando Bonifácio1 aSöll, Dieter,0 tRNA biology.g2006 July 1, v. 3, no. 3 p.110-114dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.3.3.31163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009000157300001600247500002000263520233800283592002802621650002002649650001602669650001702685650001102702650001402713650001102727650001402738650001402752650002502766650002202791650003302813651001102846700001802857700001602875700001802891700001702909700001502926700001502941700001502956700001502971700001602986700001503002773012203017856007303139852000903212655001203221IND60589963120221116182949.0180312e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058996312DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.131562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Tianlong10aWhat makes the Sino‐Himalayan mountains the major diversity hotspots for pheasants?  ap. 640-651.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The Sino‐Himalayas have higher species richness than adjacent regions, making them a global biodiversity hotspot. Various mechanisms, including ecological constraints, energetic constraints, diversification rate (DivRate) variation, time‐for‐speciation effect and multiple colonizations, have been posited to explain this pattern. We used pheasants (Aves: Phasianidae) as a model group to test these hypotheses and to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that have generated the extraordinary diversity in these mountains. LOCATION: Sino‐Himalayas and adjacent regions. TAXON: Pheasants. METHODS: Using distribution maps predicted by species distribution models (SDMs) and a time‐calibrated phylogeny for pheasants, we examined the relationships between species richness and predictors including net primary productivity (NPP), niche diversity (NicheDiv), DivRate, evolutionary time (EvolTime) and colonization frequency using Pearson's correlations and structural equation modelling (SEM). We reconstructed ancestral ranges at nodes and examined basal/derived species patterns to reveal the mechanisms underlying species richness gradients in the Sino‐Himalayas. RESULTS: We found that ancestral pheasants originated in Africa in the early Oligocene (~33 Ma), and then colonized the Sino‐Himalayan mountains and other regions. In the Sino‐Himalayas, species richness was strongly related to DivRate, NPP, NicheDiv and colonization frequency, but weakly correlated with EvolTime. The direct effects of NicheDiv and DivRate on richness were stronger than NPP and EvolTime. NPP indirectly influenced species richness via DivRate, but its effect on richness via NicheDiv was relatively weak. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Higher species diversity in the Sino‐Himalayas was generated by both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. An increase in available niches, rapid diversifications and multiple colonizations was found to be key direct processes for the build‐up of the diversity hotspots of pheasants in the Sino‐Himalayan mountains. Productivity had an important but indirect effect on species richness, which worked through increased DivRate. Our study offers new insights on species accumulation in the Sino‐Himalayas and provides a useful model for understanding other biodiversity hotspots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOligocene epoch 3aPhasianidae 3abiogeography 3amodels 3amountains 3aniches 3apheasants 3aphylogeny 3aprimary productivity 3aspecies diversity 3astructural equation modeling 3aAfrica1 aFjeldså, Jon1 aWu, Yongjie1 aShao, Shimiao1 aChen, Youhua1 aQuan, Qing1 aLi, Xinhai1 aSong, Gang1 aQu, Yanhua1 aQiao, Gexia1 aLei, Fumin0 tJournal of biogeography.g2018 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.640-651dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.131563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012700163300002000290520174600310592002802056650002202084650002002106650001902126650002102145650003702166650001602203650002002219650001302239650002702252650001402279650001802293650001602311650001802327700002002345773012702365856007502492852000902567655001202576IND60534431220221120025158.0160802e20121016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053443122DNAL7 a10.1021/es300630t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Noort, P. C. M.10aNonequilibrium of Organic Compounds in Sediment–Water Systems. Consequences for Risk Assessment and Remediation Measures  ap. 10900-10908.  aIn many cases, sediment risk assessment, and remediation rely on the assumption of equilibrium between chemical concentrations in sediment pore water and overlying surface water and thus rely on pore water concentrations only and do not additionally include assessment of the overlying water concentration. Traditionally, the validity of this assumption was insufficiently documented due to a lack of data. Recent studies using passive samplers, however, provided sufficient data for the first systematic evaluation of the extent of disequilibrium between sediment pore water and overlying surface water. Recent bioaccumulation studies reveal uncertainty as to which of these concentrations govern bioaccumulation by benthic organisms. Here, we provide the first review of studies measuring disequilibrium identifying general patterns and implications for the aforementioned areas of application. In most studies on water/sediment (dis)equilibrium, sediment pore water and overlying surface water are close to equilibrium. For lower molecular weight PAHs, overlying water concentrations tended to be relative low, which is tentatively ascribed to biodegradation in the water column. Substantial nonequilibrium was observed at some hot-spot locations such as in semistagnant harbors. In such cases, efficacy of sediment remediation measures to improve overlying water quality can be questioned because differences between overlying water concentrations at the hot-spots and those at reference locations typically are small. For nonequilibrium situations and some benthic taxa, exposure may be determined best by pore water concentrations. Improving our understanding in this area may further improve risk assessment of contaminated sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic organisms 3abioaccumulation 3abiodegradation 3amolecular weight 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aremediation 3arisk assessment 3asamplers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3awater quality1 aKoelmans, A.

Patients with high blood lipids, such as triglycerides, are at high risk in developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. To identify genes involved in metabolism, we performed RNA-seq experiments on the liver and fat in mice treated with a high-fat diet or fasting, and identified Gm6484 (named Lipasin) as a novel nutritionally regulated gene. Human LIPASIN is liver specific, while the mouse one is enriched in the liver and fat, including both brown and white adipose tissues. Obesity increases liver Lipasin, whereas fasting reduces its expression in fat. ANGPTL3 (Angiopoietin-like 3) and ANGPTL4 are critical regulators of blood lipids. LIPASIN shares homology with ANGPTL3’s N-terminal domain that is needed for lipid regulation, and with ANGPTL4’s N-terminal segment that mediates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) binding. Lipasin overexpression by adenoviruses in mice increases serum triglyceride levels, and a recombinant Lipasin inhibits LPL activity. Therefore, a potential mechanism for Lipasin-mediated triglyceride elevation is through reduced triglyceride clearance by LPL inhibition. Lipasin is thus a novel nutritionally-regulated liver-enriched factor that plays a role in lipid metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aadipose tissue 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acardiovascular diseases 3afasting 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ahumans 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipid metabolism 3alipoprotein lipase 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3amice 3aobesity 3apatients 3apublic health 3arisk 3atriacylglycerols0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Aug. 10, v. 424, no. 4 p.786-792dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014100173300001800314520163400332592002801966650002201994650001902016650002902035650002102064650002502085650002302110650001202133650001002145650001302155650001602168650002002184650002102204650002202225650002002247650002202267650001502289650001502304650001502319650002702334650001902361650001402380650001002394650001102404650000902415650002502424650001102449650002502460650003702485700001902522700002702541700002402568700002002592700002002612773012502632856008302757852000902840655001202849IND60676309820221116155059.0200523e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067630982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-019-09929-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssahibi, Abdellatif10aResponsiveness of Carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) Plants to Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis Under Different Phosphate Fertilization Levels  ap. 1243-1254.  aThis experiment was carried out in pots in a greenhouse to evaluate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizophagus intraradices and Rhizophagus fasciculatus) on carob plant performance under different levels of phosphate fertilization. Non-mycorrhizal (NMyc) and mycorrhizal (Myc) carob plants were subjected to three levels of phosphate fertilization, L1 (0 mg P kg⁻¹ soil), L2 (25 mg P kg⁻¹ soil) and L3 (100 mg P kg⁻¹ soil). Results showed that under L1 and L2 P-fertilization levels, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis significantly improved growth and biomass production of carob plants. Moreover, mineral nutrient (P, K, Na and Ca) acquisition, photosynthetic activity (Fᵥ/Fₘ), stomatal conductance, total chlorophyll content, and soluble sugar accumulation were also strongly improved in Myc plants in comparison with NMyc ones. Under L1 P-fertilization level, Myc plants showed strongly increased acid phosphatase activity in roots and in the rhizospheric soil than NMyc plants. Furthermore, Myc plants maintained high membrane integrity (over 80%) and low hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, associated with increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (G-POD), and catalase (CAT) compared to NMyc plants. However, high phosphorus input (L3) negatively affected root colonization and mycorrhizal plant performance. Thus, carob plants associated with Funneliformis mosseae performed best under phosphorus deficiency and were the least sensitive to the variations of phosphorus input levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratonia siliqua 3aGlomus mosseae 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aacid phosphatase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abiomass production 3acalcium 3acarob 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3afertilizer rates 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amalondialdehyde 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aperoxidase 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3aroots 3asodium 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3asugars 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aBenhiba, Laila1 aFouad, Mohamed Oussouf1 aBabram, Mohamed Ait1 aGhoulam, Cherki1 aQaddoury, Ahmed0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2019 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.1243-1254dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-019-09929-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100001700179245013300196300001600329500002000345506007600365520108800441592002801529506003701557650002101594650001401615650001901629650002601648650001401674650001101688650001101699650001801710650001701728650001401745650002001759650001101779700002101790700002101811773010501832856007201937852000902009655001202018IND60589963320221207085108.0180312e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058996332DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.32872doi7 aPMC58379202pmcid7 a290487452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoffena, Joy10aInhibition of yeast‐to‐filamentous growth transitions in Candida albicans by a small molecule inducer of mammalian apoptosis  ap. 291-298.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans Candida albicans is able to grow in different morphological forms such as round or oval yeasts and filamentous hyphae and pseudohyphae. Morphogenesis, the ability to switch between the yeast and filamentous growth forms, is important for adapting to new microenvironments in the human host and for pathogenesis. The molecular pathways governing morphogenesis are complex and incompletely understood. Previously, we identified several small organic molecules that specifically inhibit the initiation of hyphal growth in C. albicans without affecting cell viability or budded growth. One molecule from that screen is known to induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. In this study, we have screened additional inducers of mammalian apoptosis and identified BH3I‐1, as well as several structural derivatives of BH3I‐1, that act as specific inhibitors of morphogenesis under a variety of environmental conditions. Chemical epistasis experiments suggest that BH3I‐1 acts downstream of the hypha‐specific gene regulators Rfg1, Nrg1 and Ume6.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3aenvironmental factors 3aepistasis 3ahumans 3ahyphae 3amorphogenesis 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aregulator genes 3ayeasts1 aToenjes, Kurt A.1 aButler, David K.0 tYeast.g2018 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.291-298dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39201x0749-503X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.32873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245011000192300001600302520218700318592002802505653001202533653001602545653001202561653001202573653001702585653001902602653002202621653001902643653001802662653001102680773010602691856011702797852000902914655001202923IND60131280720221118045432.0151127e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013128072DNAL7 a10.2193/0022-541X(2005)069[0549:MMTRHM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aARESCO, MATTHEW J.10aMitigation measures to reduce highway mortality of turtles and other herpetofauna at a north florida lake  ap. 549-560.  aRoads built through or near wetlands cause significant mortality of reptiles and amphibians and create barriers to migration and dispersal. I investigated the number of times turtles and other herpetofauna attempted to cross a 4-lane highway at Lake Jackson, Florida, USA, during a period of severe drought (Feb––Apr 2000). Levels of road mortality were so high that I designed and installed a temporary drift fence system to work with an existing drainage culvert and for the next 2.5 years I evaluated its effectiveness at reducing road mortality and facilitating migration. I monitored roads and fences several times per day for 44 months, during both drought and non-drought conditions. A total of 10,229 reptiles and amphibians of 44 species were found either road killed or alive behind drift fences: 8,842 turtles, 838 frogs, 363 snakes, 152 lizards, 32 alligators, and 2 salamanders. Drift fences combined with intensive monitoring greatly reduced turtle road kills and facilitated the use of an under-highway culvert. Along a 0.7-km section of the highway, turtle mortality before installation of the fence (11.9/km/day) was significantly greater than post-fence mortality (0.09/km/day) and only 84 of 8,475 turtles climbed or penetrated the drift fences. Pre-fence data provided strong evidence that turtles cannot successfully cross all 4 lanes of U.S. Highway 27, as 95%% of 343 turtles were killed as they first entered the highway adjacent to the shoulder and the remaining 5%% were killed in the first two traffic lanes. According to a probability model, the likelihood of a turtle successfully crossing U.S. Highway 27 decreased from 32%% in 1977 to only 2%% in 2001 due to a 162%% increase in traffic volume. Therefore, at least 98%% of turtles diverted by the fences probably would have been killed if fences were not in place. The results of this study represent the highest attempted road-crossing rate ever published for turtles (1,263/km/year). Because of demographic and life history constraints, turtle populations may incur irreversible declines in areas where road mortality is high, especially when mass migrations are triggered by periods of drought.  aPublisher supplied data 0aculvert 0adrift fence 0adrought 0aFlorida 0aherpetofauna 0amass migration 0amigration barrier 0aroad mortality 0asinkhole lake 0aturtle0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2005 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.549-560dWildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F0022-541X%282005%29069%5B0549%3AMMTRHM%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245004800162300001500210520084100225592002801066650001801094650001301112700002001125773010201145856007601247852000901323655001201332IND60691105220221121101428.0200427e20060701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069110522DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.3.3.34992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Shih-Peng10amicroRNA-Mediated Silencing Inside P Bodies  ap. 97-100.  aCytoplasmic processing bodies, or P bodies, contain a high concentration of enzymes and factors required for mRNA turnover and translational repression. Recent studies provide evidence that mRNAs silenced by miRNAs are localized to P bodies for storage or degradation, perhaps in adjacent subcompartments. mRNP remodeling, induced potentially by miRISC or RNA helicase activity, may cause the replacement of the translation initiation complex at the 5’ end of mRNA, translational repression, and localization to P bodies. Further remodeling may facilitate access of the decapping complex to the cap structure.

In the biomass gasification integrate with solid oxide fuel cell system, the alkali metals will enrich on anode in long term operation, which will affect the discharge performance. In this work, multiple loads by the aqueous solution are used to simulate the enrichment process of potassium carbonate on the NiO/YSZ anode surface. The results show that a light potassium carbonate load can improve the peak power density of the solid oxide fuel cell. But the peak power density of the cell gradually decreases with the load time increasing higher than twice. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, it is found that the second potassium carbonate loads reduced the polarization impedance from 0.69 Ω·cm² to 0.45 Ω·cm². But no obvious change of ohmic resistance is observed, indicating potassium carbonate loads affect anode catalytic reaction. Through scanning electron microscopes and X-ray diffractometer characterization, it can be concluded that a light potassium carbonate load can reduce the grain size of nickel and improve the anode three-phase boundaries, which leads to the improvement of cell peak power density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3aaqueous solutions 3abiogasification 3abiomass 3acatalytic activity 3adielectric spectroscopy 3afuel cells 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3apotassium carbonate 3avapors 0aBiomass gasification 0aAlkali metal 0aSolid oxide fuel cell 0aCatalysis 0aThree-phase boundaries1 aWu, Shiliang1 aYoon, Sang Jun1 aBae, Youn-Sang1 aPark, Bugae1 aXiao, Rui0 tFuel processing technology.g2022 Mar., v. 227 p.107123-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1071233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245009400204506007600298520136600374592002801740506003701768650001101805650001101816650002501827650001301852700002001865700001801885700001601903773009501919856008102014852000902095655001202104IND60654933720221207133323.0190727s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065493372DNAL7 a10.1017/S00166723150002692doi7 aPMC68651632pmcid7 a271599282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ying,12aA nonparametric method to test for associations between rare variants and multiple traits  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMore and more rare genetic variants are being detected in the human genome, and it is believed that besides common variants, some rare variants also explain part of the phenotypic variance for human diseases. Due to the importance of rare variants, many statistical methods have been proposed to test for associations between rare variants and human traits. However, in existing studies, most methods only test for associations between multiple loci and one trait; therefore, the joint information of multiple traits has not been considered simultaneously and sufficiently. In this article, we present a study of testing for associations between rare variants and multiple traits, where trait value can be binary, ordinal, quantitative and/or any mixture of them. Based on the method of generalized Kendall's τ, a nonparametric method called NM-RV is proposed. A new kernel function for U-statistic, which could incorporate the information of each rare variant itself, is also presented and is expected to enhance the power of rare variant analysis. We further consider the asymptotic distribution of the proposed association test statistic. Our simulation work suggests that the proposed method is more powerful and robust than existing methods in testing for associations between rare variants and multiple traits, especially for multivariate ordinal traits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenome 3ahumans 3aphenotypic variation 3aresearch1 aCHENG, YANGYANG1 aZHU, WENSHENG1 aZhou, Qian,0 tGenetics research.g2016, v. 98dCambridge University PresswJournal:1937x1469-50737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723150002693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002300175245009900198300001400297520158500311592002801896650003501924650002601959650002001985650001302005650001502018650001302033650001702046650001302063650001802076650001002094650001902104650002102123650001102144650001602155650001802171650001502189650002702204650001702231650001802248650001802266650002102284650002102305650001302326650001602339650001702355650002502372650001602397700002002413700001402433700002902447700002202476700002502498773014902523856006802672856009102740990002302831852000902854655001202863IND60643272720221122223434.0190510e20101209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064327272DNAL7 a10.3791/24602doi7 aPMC30522692pmcid7 a211789682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalkundi, Shantanu10aMethods development for blood borne macrophage carriage of nanoformulated antiretroviral drugs  ap. e2460.  aNanoformulated drugs can improve pharmacodynamics and bioavailability while serving also to reduce drug toxicities for antiretroviral (ART) medicines. To this end, our laboratory has applied the principles of nanomedicine to simplify ART regimens and as such reduce toxicities while improving compliance and drug pharmacokinetics. Simple and reliable methods for manufacturing nanoformulated ART (nanoART) are shown. Particles of pure drug are encapsulated by a thin layer of surfactant lipid coating and produced by fractionating larger drug crystals into smaller ones by either wet milling or high-pressure homogenization. In an alternative method free drug is suspended in a droplet of a polymer. Herein, drug is dissolved within a polymer then agitated by ultrasonication until individual nanosized droplets are formed. Dynamic light scattering and microscopic examination characterize the physical properties of the particles (particle size, charge and shape). Their biologic properties (cell uptake and retention, cytotoxicity and antiretroviral efficacy) are determined with human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). MDM are derived from human peripheral blood monocytes isolated from leukopacks using centrifugal elutriation for purification. Such blood-borne macrophages may be used as cellular transporters for nanoART distribution to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected organs. We posit that the repackaging of clinically available antiretroviral medications into nanoparticles for HIV-1 treatments may improve compliance and positively affect disease outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantiretroviral agents 3abioavailability 3acoatings 3acompliance 3acrystals 3acytotoxicity 3adroplets 3adrug toxicity 3adrugs 3ahomogenization 3alight scattering 3alipids 3amacrophages 3amanufacturing 3amicroscopy 3amononuclear leukocytes 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3apolymers 3asurfactants 3atransporters 3aultrasonic treatment 3awet milling1 aNowacek, Ari S.1 aRoy, Upal1 aMartinez-Skinner, Andrea1 aMcMillan, JoEllyn1 aGendelman, Howard E.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2010 Dec. 09, , no. 46 p.e2460-e2460dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/24603Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2460/methods-development-for-blood-borne-macrophage-carriage  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245008100184520124000265592002801505650002001533650002401553650001401577650001901591650002401610650001601634650001201650650002301662650002201685651001001707651001001717651001401727653002201741653001801763653003301781653002301814653002701837653003201864653000801896653000801904653000801912653000801920653000801928700002401936700002701960700002301987773010202010856008702112852000902199655001202208IND60678566020221120151223.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067856602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.1065282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Amador, Octavio,14aThe methane footprint of nations: Stylized facts from a global panel dataset  aWe develop a global dataset of methane inventories derived from production, supply use (final production), and consumption activities for 1997–2014, disaggregated to 78 countries/regions. Our dataset extends existing data on methane emissions to 2014 and allows to trace emissions embodied in international trade in intermediates and in final goods. Anthropogenic emissions are quantitatively important for global warming and increased by about 18% from 1997 to 2014. The bulk of produced emissions is attributable to developing economies, though a considerable amount is exported mainly via manufactured goods to high income countries, which are net-importers of methane. Trade-embodied emissions increased by 8% more than nationally produced emissions during 1997–2014, with the strongest increase experienced by China, India, and Indonesia. Decompositions of the growth rate of emissions over this period suggest that methane efficiency improved, but the effect of these efficiency gains on total emissions was outweighed by the effect of economic and population growth in low- and middle-income countries. In high-income countries, by contrast, methane efficiency gains were larger the effect of economic and population growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adeveloped countries 3aemissions 3aglobal warming 3ainternational trade 3ainventories 3amethane 3amethane production 3apopulation growth 3aChina 3aIndia 3aIndonesia 0aMethane emissions 0aMRIO analysis 0aProduction-based inventories 0aMethane footprints 0aDecomposition analysis 0aEmissions embodied in trade 0aF18 0aF64 0aO44 0aQ54 0aQ561 aFrancois, Joseph F.1 aOberdabernig, Doris A.1 aTomberger, Patrick0 tEcological economics.g2020 Apr., v. 170 p.106528-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.1065283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
