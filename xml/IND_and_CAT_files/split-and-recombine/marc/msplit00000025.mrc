DnaJ was first isolated as a heat shock protein from E. coli. Translation of the AtJ6 nucleotide sequence yields a protein with an N-terminal J-domain, but which lacks the G/F and C-rich domains characteristic of DnaJ. In addition to the J-domain, one region of the sequence has homology with the prokaryotic FtsA protein. The remainder of the AtJ6 sequence is not notably related to anything in the sequence databases. The AtJ6 sequence represents a unique member of the A. thaliana J-domain protein family. The results of Northern analysis revealed that the AtJ6 mRNA is expressed in all organs of A. thaliana; expression was high in leaves, flowers and siliques, and low in roots. The results of Southern analysis are consistent with a single unique gene.

Control can include the rodenticide zinc phosphide, but the potential impacts to American alligators, Alligator mississippiensis, must be assessed. The mean amount of zinc phosphide per nutria found in nutria carcasses was 50 mg. Risk assessment determined that a conservative estimate for maximum exposure would be 173 mg zinc phosphide for a 28 kg alligator, or 6.2 mg/kg. Probit analysis found an LD50 for alligators of 28 mg/kg. Our studies suggest that the use of zinc phosphide to manage nutria populations would pose only a small risk to alligators. 3aalligators 3aMyocastor coypus 3azinc phosphide 3aAlligator mississippiensis 3anontarget organisms 3arodenticides 3arisk assessment 3apest control 3apredation 3adietary exposure 2aAlligators and Crocodilesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aFood Chain 2aPhosphinesxtoxicity 2aRisk Assessment 2aRodent Controlxmethods 2aRodentiaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRodenticidesxtoxicity 2aZinc Compoundsxtoxicity 0aLouisiana 0aResidues1 aEisemann, John D.1 aPrimus, Thomas M.1 aO'Hare, Jeanette R.1 aPerry, Kelly R.1 aElsey, Ruth M.1 aTrosclair, Phillip L.

Contaminated manure and polluted irrigation water are probable vehicles for the pathogen in many outbreaks. In this study, the occurrence and persistence of E. coli O157:H7 in soil fertilized with contaminated poultry or bovine manure composts or treated with contaminated irrigation water and on lettuce and parsley grown on these soils under natural environmental conditions was determined. Twenty-five plots, each 1.8 by 4.6 m, were used for each crop, with five treatments (one without compost, three with each of the three composts, and one without compost but treated with contaminated water) and five replication plots for each treatment. Three different types of compost, PM-5 (poultry manure compost), 338 (dairy manure compost), and NVIRO-4 (alkaline-stabilized dairy manure compost), and irrigation water were inoculated with an avirulent strain of E. coli O157:H7. Pathogen concentrations were 10(7) CFU/g of compost and 10(5) CFU/ml of water. Contaminated compost was applied to soil in the field as a strip at 4.5 metric tons per hectare on the day before lettuce and parsley seedlings were transplanted in late October 2002. Contaminated irrigation water was applied only once on the plants as a treatment in five plots for each crop at the rate of 2 liters per plot 3 weeks after the seedlings were transplanted. E. coli O157:H7 persisted for 154 to 217 days in soils amended with contaminated composts and was detected on lettuce and parsley for up to 77 and 177 days, respectively, after seedlings were planted. Very little difference was observed in E. coli O157:H7 persistence based on compost type alone. E. coli O157:H7 persisted longer (by >60 days) in soil covered with parsley plants than in soil from lettuce plots, which were bare after lettuce was harvested. In all cases, E. coli O157:H7 in soil, regardless of source or crop type, persisted for >5 months after application of contaminated compost or irrigation water. 3aLactuca sativa var. crispa 3aseedlings 3aPetroselinum crispum 3avegetable growing 3apolluted soils 3abacterial contamination 3asoil pollution 3aincidence 3acomposted manure 3aparsley 3awater pollution 3apoultry manure 3aminerals 3amicrobial detection 3airrigation water 3aleaf lettuce 3afood contamination 3acattle manure 3afood pathogens 3aplant cultural practices 3apH 3aEscherichia coli O157 3anitrates 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & development 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Microbiology 2aLettucexmicrobiology 2aManurexmicrobiology 2aPetroselinumxmicrobiology 2aSoil Microbiology 2aStem Cells 2aWater Microbiology 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0afood safety1 aDoyle, M.P.1 aPhatak, S.C.1 aMillner, P.1 aJiang, X.0 tJournal of food protection.g2004 July, v.  67, no.  7 p.1365-1370wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/263853Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/09/07  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02061naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100001800175245006900193300001600262500002400278520070000302650001801002650001301020650001901033650001101052650002201063653003301085700002001118700002401138700001801162700001501180700002001195773012201215852000901337856008501346856011201431930003301543945002501576946001301601961001301614655001201627IND4402515220221118112601.0080309e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440251522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-008-1197-y2doi7 a10113/145612hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX5001 aHolser, R.

The reaction proceeded in toluene under reflux conditions with p-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst. Reaction of equimolar amounts of reactants produced the monoester in 20% yield after 2 h. The product was isolated and characterized by FTIR, mass spectrometry, and NMR techniques. Results of mass spectrometry and NMR experiments showed that the ester linkage formed between the carboxylic acid and the primary hydroxyl of glycerol. The ester displayed strong absorbance between 250 and 350 nm and shows potential as a UV filter in formulations where hydrophilic compounds are advantageous. 3acinnamic acid 3aglycerol 3aesterification 3aesters 3aspectral analysis 0a4-methoxy cinnamoyl glycerol1 aMitchell, T.

Methods: We fed 83 women nutritionally balanced diets, used anthropometry and dual x-ray absorptiometry to assess body composition, and measured serum and urinary Cr and biochemical indicators of iron status before and serially every 4 wk for 12 wk in a double-blind, randomized trial. Results: CrPic supplementation increased (P < 0.0001) serum Cr concentration and urinary Cr excretion compared with picolinic acid and placebo. CrPic did not affect body weight or fat, although all groups lost (P < 0.05) weight and fat; it did not affect fat-free, mineral-free mass or measurements of iron status. Conclusion: Under conditions of controlled energy intake, CrPic supplementation of women did not independently influence body weight or composition or iron status. Thus, claims that supplementation of 200 μg of Cr as CrPic promotes weight loss and body composition changes are not supported. 3anutritional status 3awomen 3alifestyle 3achromium 3adietary supplements 3apicolinic acid 3aweight loss 3aweight control programs 3alean body mass 3abody fat 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBiomarkersxbloodxurine. 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aChromiumxbloodxpharmacologyxurine. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIronxblood 2aIron Chelating Agentsxpharmacology 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdrug therapy 2aPicolinic Acidsxbloodxpharmacologyxurine. 2aTrace Elementsxbloodxpharmacologyxurine. 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWeight Loss 0abody composition 0afat free mass1 aSiders, William A.1 aPenland, James G.0 tNutrition.g2007 Mar., v.  23, no.  3 p.187-195x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/459693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2006.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site.  a20101129b20101204c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/05/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01931naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001100140245005400151300001600205500002400221500001500245520078800260650001601048650001301064650002601077650001301103650001301116650001301129653002501142653001801167653002401185653000901209773009801218852000901316856011201325930003301437945002501470946001301495961001301508655001201521IND4412311620221121030646.0081106s2008    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND441231162DNAL7 a10113/213542hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aLe, S.10aLint Cleaning with Two Air-jet Cleaners in Series  ap. 246-252.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe performance of two air-jet cleaners connected in series was evaluated. The air-jet cleaners were connected so that the fiber stream could be cleaned on one side or both sides. The effect of flow velocity on cleaning performance was also tested. In comparison to the baseline saw-type lint cleaner, which was the most efficient cleaner, the air-jet cleaners plus a special saw-type cleaner with only one cleaning point ranked second in cleaning performance. The air-jet cleaners were the least efficient cleaners, however, this cleaner configuration was the least aggressive; it generated the fewest neps and produced slightly longer fiber. Compared to cleaning only one side of the fiber stream, cleaning both sides at a higher flow velocity could gain 8% in cleaning efficiency. 3alint cotton 3acleaners 3aequipment performance 3avelocity 3aair flow 3acleaning 0acleaning performance 0alint cleaners 0acleaning efficiency 0ajets0 tJournal of cotton science.g2008, v.  12, no.  3 p.246-252wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/213543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081113b20081206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/11/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03696naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024001900131024002100150040001800171072000900189072000900198072000900207100001300216245007800229300001600307500002400323500001500347520156400362650001601926650001101942650003501953650001701988650001702005650001302022650002302035650001402058650001502072650001702087650003202104650001002136650001502146650001802161650002102179650002902200650002102229650004902250650003302299650002002332650003702352650001302389650001302402650001102415650001202426650003302438650003202471653002202503653002802525653001502553700001702568773009502585852000902680856011202689856008902801930003302890945002502923946001302948961001302961655001202974IND4361951320221121031819.0040406e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436195132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2003.11.0022doi7 a150234002pmid7 a10113/459702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT300 0aX3801 aZeng, H.10aCopper may interact with selenite extracellularly in cultured HT-29 cells  ap. 179-184.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrevious studies have demonstrated that copper (15.7 micromol/L) can inhibit selenite (12.6 micromol/L)-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HT-29 cells. However, the exact nature of the interactions between selenium and copper is not fully understood. In this study, the effect of copper on the cell cycle arrest induced by selenite or selenocystine was examined. Both selenite and selenocystine were effective in inhibition of cell growth and cell cycle progression. Cell cycle analysis revealed that selenite (3-5 micromol/L) caused a decrease in G1 phase cells that corresponded with an increase in S and G2 phase cells, and that 0.625 or 1.25 micromol/L copper sufficiently inhibited selenite-induced cell cycle arrest. In contrast, selenocystine caused an increase in G1 phase cells that corresponded with a decrease in S and G2 phase cells. Interestingly, 0.625 or 1.25 micromol/L copper did not inhibit selenocystine-induced cell cycle arrest. In addition, cell free gel shift assay demonstrated that selenite suppressed the inhibitory effect of copper on SP-1 DNA binding. Furthermore, although 5 micromol/L selenite in culture media significantly increased the intracellular selenium content, 1.25 micromol/L copper sulfate blocked this increase of the intracellular selenium content. Collectively, these data demonstrate that selenite and selenocystine cause cell cycle arrest via distinct mechanisms, and suggest that copper may interact with selenite extracellularly, which represents the basis of antagonism between copper sulfate and selenite. 3acell growth 3acopper 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3acell culture 3acytotoxicity 3aselenium 3aseleno amino acids 3aselenites 3acell cycle 3aantioxidants 3adietary mineral supplements 3acolon 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Division 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCell-Free System 2aCopperxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCopper Sulfatexpharmacology 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aG1 Phase 2aG2 Phase 2aHumans 2aS Phase 2aSelenocysteinexpharmacology 2aSodium Selenitexmetabolism 0acell cycle arrest 0aextracellular mechanism 0ainhibitors1 aBotnen, J.H.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2004 Mar., v.  15, no.  3 p.179-184x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/459703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2003.11.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20101130b20101204c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/04/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04017naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001600158245011000174300001800284500002400302500001500326520244800341650001602789650001302805650002202818650002602840650002102866650000902887650001302896650002102909650001902930650002102949650001602970650003402986650002403020650002503044651000903069653002703078653002903105653001803134700001703152700001703169773007203186852000903258856011203267930003303379945002503412946001303437961001303450655001203463IND4402383120221120070122.0080304e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440238312DNAL7 a10113/128622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF120 0aW0001 aThorp, K.R.10aSimulating Long-Term Effects of Nitrogen Fertilizer Application Rates on Corn Yield and Nitrogen Dynamics  ap. 1287-1303.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThoroughly tested agricultural systems models can be used to quantify the long-term effects of crop management practices under conditions where measurements are lacking. In a field near Story City, Iowa, ten years (1996-2005) of measured data were collected from plots receiving low, medium, and high (57-67, 114-135, and 172-202 kg N ha-1) nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rates during corn (Zea mays L.) years. Using these data, the Root Zone Water Quality Model linked with the CERES and CROPGRO plant growth models (RZWQM-DSSAT) was evaluated for simulating the various N application rates to corn. The evaluated model was then used with a sequence of historical weather data (1961-2005) to quantify the long-term effects of different N rates on corn yield and nitrogen dynamics for this agricultural system. Simulated and measured dry-weight corn yields, averaged over plots and years, were 7452 and 7343 kg ha-1 for the low N rate, 8982 and 9224 kg ha-1 for the medium N rate, and 9143 and 9484 kg ha-1 for the high N rate, respectively. Simulated and measured flow-weighted average nitrate concentrations (FWANC) in drainage water were 10.6 and 10.3 mg L-1 for the low N rate, 13.4 and 13.2 mg L-1 for the medium N rate, and 18.0 and 19.1 mg L-1 for the high N rate, respectively. The simulated N rate for optimum corn yield over the long term was between 100 and 150 kg N ha-1. Currently, the owner-operator of the farm applies 180 kg N ha-1 to corn in nearby production fields. Reducing long-term N rates from 180 to 130 kg N ha-1 corresponded to an 18% simulated long-term reduction in N mass lost to water resources. Median annual FWANC in subsurface drainage water decreased from 19.5 to 16.4 mg N L-1 with this change in management. Current goals for diminishing the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico call for N loss reductions of 30% and greater. Thus, long-term simulations suggest that at least half of this N loss reduction goal could be met by reducing N application rates to the production optimum. However, additional changes in management will be necessary to completely satisfy N loss reduction goals while maintaining acceptable crop production for the soil and meteorological conditions of this study. The results suggest that after calibration and thorough testing, RZWQM-DSSAT can be used to quantify the long-term effects of different N application rates on corn production and subsurface drainage FWANC in Iowa. 3acrop models 3aZea mays 3asimulation models 3along term experiments 3afertilizer rates 3acorn 3aleaching 3anitrate nitrogen 3adrainage water 3alosses from soil 3agrain yield 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3asubsurface drainage 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aIowa 0afertilizer application 0aRZWQM-DSSAT hybrid model 0aCROPGRO model1 aMalone, R.W.1 aJaynes, D.B.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2007 , v.  50, no.  4 p.1287-13037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/128623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080408b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/03  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02461naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002100183245008100204300001600285500002400301500001500325520074600340650001501086650002301101650002001124650002401144650001201168650001701180650001901197651001201216651001701228651001201245651001301257653003101270653001401301653002201315700002301337700001901360700001901379700002101398700002301419700002001442700001901462773011101481852000901592856007501601856011201676930003301788945002501821946001301846961001201859655001201871IND4441162320101204015935.0100813s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444116232DNAL7 a10.1071/WF081932doi7 a10113/451632hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aK8101 aFowler, James F.10aDevelopment of post-fire crown damage mortality thresholds in ponderosa pine  ap. 583-588.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrevious research has shown that crown scorch volume and crown consumption volume are the major predictors of post-fire mortality in ponderosa pine.

To gain a better understanding of changes in gene expression associated with development of cold tolerance in blueberry and other woody perennials, forward and reverse subtracted cDNA libraries were prepared in such a way to enrich for transcripts that are expressed at higher levels in dormant blueberry flower buds at 400 h and at 0 h of low temperature exposure, respectively. Of the clones picked and single-pass sequenced, 503 clones from the forward subtracted library and 167 clones from the reverse subtracted library had inserts and yielded high quality sequences; and of these, 291 (57.9%) and 51 (31.0%), respectively, were assigned putative identities from BLAST searches of GenBank. From contig analyses to cluster genes of like or identical sequences, 275 unigenes (unique clones) from the forward subtracted library and 99 unigenes from the reverse subtracted library were obtained. Many interesting cold and light-stress related genes were identified from the forward subtracted library and several drought-stress related genes were identified from the reverse subtracted library. Many genes, not previously characterized from blueberry or other woody perennials, encoding putative transcription factors and proteins related to signal transduction were identified from both the forward and reverse subtracted libraries. Eleven genes of interest (six from the forward subtracted library and five from the reverse subtracted library) were selected and their expression was analyzed in floral buds by quantitative real-time RT-PCR over a time course from similar to 0 to 1200 h of low temperature exposure. Expression profiles validated the quality of the libraries. 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3ablueberries 3acold tolerance 3aacclimation 3aplant response 3aplant proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3aDNA libraries 3asequence analysis 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression regulation 3acold stress 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 0asuppression subtractive hybridization1 aDhanaraj, A.L.1 aArora, R.1 aRowland, L.J.0 tPlant science.g2007 Aug., v.  173, no.  2 p.213-222x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/307413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2007.05.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090708b20090801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/08/10  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04223naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191100002200200245012400222300001300346500002400359500002400383500001500407520257100422650001902993650001603012650001503028650001503043650002203058650001703080650001603097653002403113653001603137700001803153700001503171700001603186700001703202700001303219700001403232700001503246700001903261700001503280773007703295852000903372856011203381856009203493930003303585945001303618946001303631961001303644655001203657IND2062636820221121183558.0980320e199802  mau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206263682DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.97154.x2doi7 a10113/248072hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP000 0aL300 0aF1001 aAllen-Wardell, G.14aThe potential consequences of pollinator declines on the conservation of biodiversity and stability of food crop yields  ap. 8-17.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aFollowing reports of dramatic declines in managed and feral honey bees from nearly every region of North America, scientists and resource managers from the US., Mexico, and Canada came together to review the quality of the evidence that honey bees as well as other pollinators are in long-term decline and to consider the potential consequences of these losses on the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of the yield of food crops. These experts in pollination ecology confirmed that the  last 5 years of losses of honeybee colonies in North America leave us with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the last 50 years and that the management and protection of wild pollinators is an issue of paramount importance to our food supply system. Although there are conclusive data that indicate 1200 wild vertebrate pollinators may be at risk, data on the status of most invertebrate species that act as pollination agents is lacking. The recommendations from a working group of over  20 field scientists, presented here, have been endorsed by 14 conservation and Sustainable agriculture organizations, research institutes, and professional societies, including the Society for Conservation Biology. Among the most critical priorities for future research and conservation of pollinator species are (1) increased attention to invertebrate systematics, monitoring, and reintroduction as part of critical habitat management and restoration plans; (2) multi-year assessments of the lethal  and sublethal effects of pesticides, herbicides, and habitat fragmentation on wild pollinator populations in and near croplands; (3) inclusion of the monitoring of seed and fruit set and floral visitation rates in endangered plant management and recovery plans, (4) inclusion of habitat needs for critically-important pollinators in the critical habitat designations for endangered plants, (5) identification and protection of floral reserves near roost sites along the "nectar corridors" of  threatened migratory pollinators; and (6) investment in the 'restoration and management of a diversity of pollinators and their habitats adjacent to croplands in order to stabilize or improve crop yields. The work group encourages increased education and training to ensure that both the lay public ant resource managers understand that pollination is one of the most important ecological services provided to agriculture through the responsible management and protection of wildland habitats and  their populations of pollen-vectoring animals and nectar-producing plants. 3aApis mellifera 3apollinators 3ahoney bees 3acrop yield 3afood availability 3abiodiversity 3apollination 0apopulation decrease 0afood supply1 aBernhardt, P.1 aBitner, R.1 aBurquez, A.1 aBuchmann, S.1 aCane, J.1 aCox, P.A.1 aDalton, V.1 aFeinsinger, P.1 aIngram, M.0 tConservation biology.g1998 Feb., v.  12, no.  1 p.8-17x0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/248073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.97154.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090223b20090301c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02469naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001600197245008800213300001600301500002400317500001500341520095000356650002101306650002201327650001701349650001401366650001601380650002301396650001301419650001801432650001901450650002801469650001601497650001501513653002301528653001601551773010401567852000901671856011201680856008901792930003301881945002501914946001101939961001301950655001201963IND4374296720221120210945.0050914e20031101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437429672DNAL7 a10.1016/S0168-1605(03)00065-52doi7 a10113/478252hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aX100 0aX2001 aHuang, L.H.10aDynamic computer simulation of Clostridium perfringens growth in cooked ground beef  ap. 217-227.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to develop a computer simulation algorithm to dynamically estimate and predict the growth of Clostridium perfringens in cooked ground beef. The computational algorithm was based on the implicit form of the Gompertz model, the growth kinetics of C. perfringens in cooked ground beef, and the fourth-order Runge–Kutta numerical method. This algorithm was validated using a cocktail of three strains of C. perfringens spores grown under isothermal, square-waved, linear cooling, and exponential cooling temperature profiles. In general, the results of computer simulation matched closely with the experimental data with the absolute errors less than 0.5 log10 CFU/g. This method may be a useful tool for the food industry, regulatory agencies, distributors, and retailers to predict the effect of temperature abuse on the microbial safety of C. perfringens and other foodborne pathogens in processed meat products. 3abacterial spores 3asimulation models 3acooked foods 3aequations 3aground beef 3afood contamination 3akinetics 3agrowth models 3afood pathogens 3aClostridium perfringens 3atemperature 3aalgorithms 0adynamic simulation 0afood safety0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2003 Nov. 1, v.  87, no.  3 p.217-227x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/478253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1605(03)00065-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110216b20110305c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/10/05  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03014naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003300134024002500167024004100192024002300233040001800256100006100274245008200335300001300417520140600430650004101836650001901877650001701896650001101913650001201924650001001936650001801946650001501964700002301979700001902002700003002021700001702051700002302068700002402091700001902115700002002134700001302154700002202167773010302189856011402292856008402406961000902490852000902499655001202508IND60791833220221214225026.0220901s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079183322DNAL7 a10113/79183322hdl7 a3879322aris7 a10.1111/1752-1688.130562doi7 a4323102aris_accn_no7 a3098-13610-008-000D2aris_project_no7 a3879322seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1641-007710aDevelopment of a field scale SWAT+ modeling framework for the contiguous U.S.  ap. 1-16.  aThe Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is commonly used to predict the impacts of agricultural practices on water quality and quantity. Although widely applied, the data framework used to drive SWAT in the U.S. is fragmented and inconsistent, varying by user and model interface. This research describes the development of the National Agroecosystems Model (NAM), which provides a unified field to national scale modeling computational framework for research and decision support by using the latest SWAT platform, dubbed SWAT+. NAM has sufficient detail to capture field-level processes and management actions, and spans the full extent of the contiguous U.S. NAM contains 7 million computational units, 4 million of which represent specific cultivated fields. It contains 3 million individually identifiable stream segments and more than 5,000 reservoirs. This work describes the individual data sources, assumptions, and the processing steps for their inclusion. NAM is constructed with 2,121 individual SWAT+ models which can be executed in a parallel hierarchical structure to dramatically improve runtime. This framework is tested in a case study of the Little River Watershed, Tifton, GA. NAM is developed using only publicly available data sources such that subsets of it can be shared to support research with other government agencies, universities, and others in the public domain. 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aagroecosystems 3acase studies 3arivers 3astreams 3awater 3awater quality 3awatersheds1 aArnold, Jeffrey G.1 aBieger, Katrin1 aAllen, P.

Streamflow data before and after wildfire in a 14 km2 mixed-conifer, sub-alpine watershed in south-central New Mexico were used to calibrate a distributed watershed model (AgES) for prefire and postfire conditions. Results and parameterizations from AgES and a prior PRMS modeling study in the same watershed were compared. Both AgES and PRMS accurately simulated the dramatic change in streamflow response to precipitation after fire, including a smaller precipitation threshold to induce streamflow, although AgES had substantially less bias and better performance in monthly calibrations. Only AgES was assessed at the daily scale. AgES closely simulated daily streamflow throughout the study period, with slight overestimation in the prefire period (Oct 2007 to Oct 2011, 1.2% bias, 0.90 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE]) and in the postfire period (Oct 2013 to Oct 2017, 4.4% bias, 0.54 NSE). Although each 4-year model period had nearly identical cumulative precipitation, annual streamflow increased by 170% in the postfire period compared to the prefire period. Appropriate soil and vegetation parameters were modified by the stepwise calibration process to represent the effects of fire in AgES: interception storage was decreased for rain (-99.8%) and snow (-26%), two factors influencing ET were decreased, soil depression storage was reduced (-97%), and soil field capacity was reduced (-50%). AgES demonstrated improved simulation of streamflow compared with PRMS, calibrated parameter shifts that were more consistent to interpret, and particular skill in simulating daily streamflow response to fire. 3afield capacity 3aforests 3ahydrologic models 3arain 3asnow 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3awildfires 3aNew Mexico1 aWells, Ryan Michael1 aKipka, Holm1 aGreen, Timothy R.1 aBarnard, David Michael0 tJournal of the ASABE.g, v. 65, no. 4 p.751-762wJournal:28592x2769-32877nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/79183333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13031/ja.148813Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01687naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002400140245009500164300001400259500002400273500001500297520034500312650001600657650003700673650001800710650002200728650001700750650001000767650001200777650001600789650001000805650001500815650000900830653001000839700001800849700001900867700002100886700001800907773007500925852000901000856011201009930003301121945002501154946001301179961001301192655001201205IND4425458520221121234735.0090903s2008    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND442545852DNAL7 a10113/334672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2001 aChitko-McLown, C.G.10aDevelopment of Cell Lines from the Sheep Used to Construct the CHORI-243 Ovine BAC Library  ap. 84-88.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aTwo cell lines, designated MARC.OVSM, and MARC.OKF, were initiated from the aorta and kidney, respectively, obtained from the Texel ram used to make the CHORI-243 Ovine BAC library.

The LM-pectin was produced from the HM-pectin by PME-deesterification. As a result of the viscometric analysis, the PME-deesterified LM-pectin showed quite different solution behavior from the HM-pectin. The LM-pectin had larger intrinsic viscosity ([η]) than HM-pectin when dissolved in 0.005 and 0.05 M concentrations of monovalent salts whereas HM-pectin had a higher value of [η] when dissolved in 0.2 M salt than LM-pectin. The concentration dependence of HM-pectin ηred values was fairly constant, whereas the concentration dependence of LM-pectin ηred values had a tendency to decrease as the pectin concentration approached zero. The effect of salt-type on the hydrodynamic behavior of both HM- and LM-pectin solutions was almost negligible. The precipitous drop in LM-pectin [η] upon increasing the salt concentration from 0.05 to 0.2 M is interpreted as arising from its disaggregation. This interpretation is based in part on data from HPSEC with online light scattering and viscosity detection. 3aprotein aggregates 3aaqueous solutions 3apectins 3aviscosity 3aviscometers 3asalt concentration 3aaggregate stability 3achemical structure 0ahigh-methoxy pectin 0alow-methoxy pectin 0arheological properties1 aFishman, M.L.1 aHotchkiss, A.T.

Retaining postharvest crop residues as soil surface cover is a primary method for controlling wind and water erosion; accordingly, erosion prediction models are highly sensitive to the amount of surface residue retained as soil cover. Traditionally, crop biomass calculations and erosion prediction models used expected or modeled crop yields and a fixed residue/grain index (R/G Index) value to determine residue quantity. Literature search indicated that cereal breeding efforts that emphasize yield have reduced the amount of residue for each unit of grain produced. In order to fulfill our objective of improving the relationship between grain yield and residue production, we assembled and examined a large set of regional crop yield and residue production data collected in research plot studies, on-farm field studies, and in available literature from eastern Washington and northcentral Oregon. Results of the study indicated that the R/G Index varies with yield. We also found that residue production versus grain yield for major nonirrigated crops of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cereals, as well as for annual legumes and brassicas, can be fit with a linear relationship with a positive intercept and that the slope and intercept of the line are crop specific. Parameter values for specific crops are given. Using the historical fixed R/G Index can result in overestimating residue production of high-yielding winter wheat by as much as 35% and underestimating residue production for low spring wheat yields by as much as 66%. The results provide improved residue-to-grain yield relationships for use in water and wind erosion prediction models applied to the conditions of the Inland Pacific Northwest and adjacent areas. They provide a basis for estimating crop residue production in the region, and in conjunction with carbon sequestration models, a basis for determining if and where residues can be harvested for biomass in the region. 3aenergy crops 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3avegetation cover 3acarbon sequestration 3awind erosion 3abarley 3aHordeum vulgare 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3alegumes 3aRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation 3aagricultural land 3acrop residues 3asoil 3acontrol methods 3awinter wheat 3abiomass 3aprediction 3aBrassica 3awater erosion 3aIdaho 3aOregon 0aWashington1 aMcCool, D.K.1 aRickman, R.W.0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g2012 , v. 67, no. 1 p.42-50wJournal:1947x0022-45617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/540693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.67.1.423Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/112667_Grain_yield_and_biomass_relationship.pdf  aUSDA/NRCSUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02610naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001700149245006600166300001800232500002400250520144200274650001601716650001901732650001501751653001401766653002101780653003401801700001901835700001701854700001901871773013101890852000902021856011202030930003302142945001302175946001102188961001302199655001202212IND2207488220221121175313.0001025e200009  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220748822DNAL7 a10113/248122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aL8101 aSwezey, J.L.10aLactobacillus arizonensis sp. nov., isolated from jojoba meal  ap. 1803-1809.  aIncludes references  aFive strains of simmondsin-degrading, lactic-acid-producing bacteria were isolated from fermented jojoba meal. These isolates were facultatively anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, homofermentative, rod-shaped organisms. They grew singly and in short chains, produced lactic acid but no gas from glucose, and did not exhibit catalase activity. Growth occurred at 15 and 45 degreeC. All strains fermented cellobiose, D-fructose, D-galactose, D-glucose, lactose, maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, melibiose, D-ribose, salicin, D-sorbitol, sucrose and trehalose. Some strains fermented L-(-)-arabinose and L-rhamnose. D-Xylose was not fermented and starch was not hydrolysed. The mean G+C content of the DNA was 48 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA established that the isolates were members of the genus Lactobacillus. DNA reassociation of 45% or less was obtained between the new isolates and the reference strains of species with G+C contents of about 48 mol%. The isolates were differentiated from other homofermentative Lactobacillus spp. on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence divergence, DNA relatedness, stereoisomerism of the lactic acid produced, growth temperature and carbohydrate fermentation. The data support the conclusion that these organisms represent strains of a new species, for which the name Lactobacillus arizonensis is proposed. The type strain of L. arizonensis is NRRL B-14768T (= DSM 13273T). 3anew species 3abiodegradation 3asimmondsin 0acyanogens 0agenbank/af093757 0asimmondsin degrading bacteria1 aNakamura, L.K.1 aAbbott, T.P.1 aPeterson, R.E.0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2000 Sept., v.  50, no.  pt.5 p.1803-1809x1466-50267nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/248123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04188naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152024002100171040001800192072000900210100001600219245020500235300001600440500002400456506007600480520224600556506003702802650001002839650002302849650002002872650001802892650001702910650002202927650002202949650002702971650003202998651002503030651001003055653002003065700001203085700001803097700001703115700001903132700001603151700001403167700001503181700001103196773010003207852000903307856011203316856008803428930003303516945002503549946001103574961001303585655001203598IND4442263520221207091646.0100910e20100920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.05.0132doi7 aPMC71169012pmcid7 a205704412pmid7 a10113/459642hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aDubey, J.P.10aToxoplasmosis in Sand cats (Felis margarita) and other animals in the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife in the United Arab Emirates and Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation, the State of Qatar  ap. 195-203.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Sand cat (Felis margarita) is a small-sized felid found in sand and stone deserts ranging from the north of Africa to Asia, with the Arabian Peninsula as its centre of distribution. The Sand cat captive breeding program at the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW), Sharjah, UAE, has experienced high newborn mortality rates, and congenital toxoplasmosis was recently recognized as one of the causes of this mortality. In the present study, one 18-month-old Sand cat (FM019) died of acute toxoplasmosis-associated hepatitis and pneumonitis acquired after birth; Toxoplasma gondii was demonstrated in histological sections which reacted with T. gondii polyclonal antibodies by immunohistochemistry (IHC). T. gondii DNA was found by PCR of extracted DNA from liver and lung tissues of this cat. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in serum examined in 1:1600 dilution in the modified agglutination test (MAT); its 2-year-old cage mate seroconverted (MAT titer 1:3200) at the same time. Another Sand cat (FM017) was euthanized because of ill health when 3 years old; its MAT titer was >1:3200, and T. gondii tissue cysts were found in brain, heart, ocular muscles and skeletal muscle, confirmed by IHC. Viable T. gondii was isolated by bioassays in mice inoculated with tissues of another chronically infected Sand cat (FM002); T. gondii was not found in histological sections of this cat. T. gondii antibodies were found in several species of animals tested, notably in 49 of 57 wild felids at BCEAW. A 7-year-old Sand cat (3657) from Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation (AWWP), Doha, State of Qatar died of acute visceral toxoplasmosis with demonstrable T. gondii tachyzoites by IHC, and T. gondii DNA by PCR, and a MAT titer of >3200. T. gondii antibodies were found in 21 of 27 of wild felids at AWWP. PCR-RFLP genotyping at 10 genetic loci revealed that these T. gondii isolates from Sand cat (FM002 and FM019) at BCEAW have an atypical genotype, which was previously reported in T. gondii isolates of dogs from Sri Lanka. The genotype from the cat from AWWP (3657) is a genetic Type II strain with a Type I allele at locus Apico. This is the first report of genetic characterization of T. gondii isolates from Middle East.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFelis 3aendangered species 3aanimal breeding 3atoxoplasmosis 3aacute course 3adisease incidence 3aToxoplasma gondii 3anew geographic records 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aUnited Arab Emirates 3aQatar 0aFelis margarita1 aPas, An1 aRajendran, C.1 aKwok, O.C.H.1 aFerreira, L.R.1 aMartins, J.1 aHebel, C.1 aHammer, S.1 aSu, C.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Sept. 20, v.  172, no.  3-4 p.195-203dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/459643Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.05.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20101129b20101204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/11/29  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02526naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002000134040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190072000900199100001500208245008400223300001600307500002400323520098700347650002201334650001701356650002301373650001601396650001701412650001701429650001001446650001101456650001401467650001401481650001401495650002201509650002001531700001701551700001601568700001701584773010101601852000901702856009201711856011101803930003301914945002501947946001101972961001301983655001201996IND4391573420221121114253.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439157342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2007.01345.x2doi7 a10113/23332hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF600 0aF400 0aF2001 aDunn, B.L.10aRapid phenotypic assessment of bird cherry-oat aphid resistance in winter wheat  ap. 240-243.  aIncludes references  aRhopalosiphum padi L. causes significant damage to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), even without obvious aboveground symptoms of injury.

Central features of the bioassay include root and shoot weight measurements of 3-week-old seedlings produced in seed germination pouches, a 14-day aphid exposure period, and a non-infested control treatment to establish a baseline for expected biomass per genotype. Cultivars used in bioassay development were 'Illinois Rustproof' and 'Skala', which showed smaller BCOA-induced reductions in biomass than the more susceptible genotypes, 'Patrick' and 'Scout 66'. Mean reductions in root biomass were 48% for 'Patrick' and 'Scout 66', compared with 29% for 'Illinois Rustproof' and 'Skala'.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of low-phytate maize consumption on zinc absorption. DESIGN: The participants were apparently healthy children from the Central Highlands of Guatemala. Sixty children (20 per group) were randomly assigned to be fed only the low-phytate maize or 1 of 2 control maizes, the isohybrid wild-type maize or a local maize, for a 10-wk period. During the final week, the fractional absorption of zinc for all meals was measured during 1 d with the use of zinc stable isotopes and a dual isotope ratio technique based on urine enrichment data. RESULTS: Mean (±SD) phytate intakes for the low-phytate, wild-type, and local maize groups were 1536 ± 563, 2056 ± 517, and 2253 ± 687 mg/d, respectively. Corresponding zinc intakes were 8.6 ± 2.5, 8.1 ± 2.0, and 9.7 ± 2.6 mg/d, and the dietary phytate:zinc molar ratios were 18 ± 5, 26 ± 6, and 23 ± 5. Corresponding fractional absorptions of zinc were 0.32 ± 0.07, 0.28 ± 0.07, and 0.29 ± 0.06. The respective values for total absorbed zinc were 2.72 ± 0.88, 2.30 ± 0.96, and 2.78 ± 1.04 mg/d. No significant differences in either the fractional absorption of zinc or total absorbed zinc were seen between the maize groups. CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of the present study, zinc absorption was not increased by the long-term use of low-phytate maize in children whose major dietary staple is maize. 3anutrition assessment 3achild nutrition 3aschool children 3anutrient deficiencies 3azinc 3adietary minerals 3acorn 3aphytin 3amineral metabolism 3anutrient availability 3aintestinal absorption 3along term effects 3anutritional status 3astable isotopes 2aAnthropometry 2aBiological Availability 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFood, Genetically Modified 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aPhytic Acidxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aZea maysxchemistryxgenetics. 2aZincxadministration & dosagexdeficiencyxpharmacokinetics. 2aZinc Isotopesxpharmacokinetics 3aGuatemala 0aGuatemala1 aHambidge, K.

Studies were conducted to determine the biomass production, Se accumulation, and resistance of each line to the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, an agriculturally important insect. Plants were tested using three salinity treatments: (1) control, no Se; (2) NaCl and CaCl2 salts and 1 mg l-1 Se (12.7 μM) added as sodium selenate; and (3) iso-osmotic to treatment 2 containing high concentrations of sulfate and 1 mg l-1 Se added as sodium selenate. Insect bioassays measured survival, growth, and development. Atriplex patula, A. spongiosa 415862, A. hortensis, A. hortensis 379088 and A. hortensis 379092 were among the top biomass producers and Se accumulators, yet they exhibited significantly reduced insect growth, development, and survival. High background sulfate strongly reduced Se accumulation, suggesting that phytoremediation potential is greatest in saline areas having low to moderate sulfate levels. However, these lines grew well in high salinity soils, indicating possible use as a self-seeding cover crop to improve habitat. All plant lines grown in control and high sulfate salinity treatments are acceptable oviposition sites for S. exigua, indicating that these plants would help reduce populations of this key agricultural pest. 3ainsect pests 3asoil pollution 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aphytoremediation 3apest resistance 3apolluted soils 2aAnimals 2aAtriplexxgrowth & development 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiological Assay 2aPest Control, Biological 2aSelenium 2aSoil Pollutants 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpodoptera 2aWaste Managementxmethods 0abioremediation1 aShannon, M.C.1 aBanuelos, G.S.1 aGrieve, C.M.1 aTrumble, J.T.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2002, v.  120, no.  2 p.463-473aEnvironmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)x0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/233333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0269-7491(02)00116-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20090205b20090301c00000000  aINDdRE1  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02711naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008003300029016002200062024003000084024002100114040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100002000180245007800200500002400278520114700302650002301449650001201472650001901484650001501503650001501518650002301533650001801556651001001574700001701584700001701601700001901618700001301637773031801650856011201968856008002080930003302160945002502193946001302218961001302231852000902244655001202253IND4431259320221121220954.0100115|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443125932DNAL7 a10.1061/40976(316)962doi7 a10113/377492hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aX620 0aX1001 aGowda, Prasanna10aComparing SEBAL ET with lysimeter data in the semi-arid Texas High Plains  aIncludes references  aSurface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), a spatial evapotranspiration (ET) estimation method, has been applied with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data throughout the world. However, it has never been tested for semiarid conditions of the Texas High Plains. In this study, SEBAL algorithm was applied to a Landsat TM image acquired on July 10, 2007 covering a major portion of the Texas High Plains. Performance of SEBAL was evaluated by comparing estimated ET with measured ET data on four large monolithic lysimeters at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX. Comparison of SEBAL-estimated instantaneous ET values with lysimetric measurements indicated that SEBAL may provide better ET estimates for irrigated fields. However, it performed poorly in predicting ET for fields under dryland management. This result may indicate that SEBAL might be sensitive to errors in the selection of the hot/dry pixel. Overall, SEBAL is a promising tool for mapping ET in the extensively irrigated Texas High Plains. However, more evaluation is needed for different agroclimatological conditions in the region. 3aevapotranspiration 3aLandsat 3aremote sensing 3aalgorithms 3alysimeters 3asoil water content 3adata analysis 3aTexas1 aHowell, T.A.1 aChavez, J.L.1 aCopeland, K.S.1 aPaul, G.0 tWorld Environmental  and Water Resources Congress 2008 : Ahupua'a : May 12-16, 2008, Honolulu, Hawai'i / sponsored by Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers ; edited by Roger W.

An in-home study evaluated top sirloin steaks (gluteus medius) as influenced by calcium chloride injection (injected vs. noninjected), consumer segment (beef loyalists = heavy consumers of beef, budget rotators = cost-driven and split meat consumption between beef and chicken, and variety rotators = higher incomes and education and split meat consumption among beef, poultry, and other foods), degree of doneness, cooking method, and instructions (given vs. not given). Consumers evaluated overall like, tenderness, juiciness, flavor like, and flavor amount using 10-point scales. Beef loyalists consistently rated steaks higher for overall like, juiciness, and flavor when instructions were provided (P < 0.05) and rated top sirloin steaks higher for overall like and tenderness when given instructions for grilling (P < 0.05). Budget rotators and variety rotators rated steaks differently among cooking methods (P < 0.05). Correlation and stepwise regression analyses indicated that flavor like was the most highly correlated with overall like, followed by tenderness, flavor amount, and juiciness. Calcium chloride injection had no effect on consumers' likes or dislikes or on tenderness (P < 0.05). For top sirloin steaks, it was likely that preparation played a major role in consumer satisfaction, and beef loyalists benefited the most from providing cooking instructions. 3acalcium chloride 3ajuiciness 3afood choices 3asteaks 3abeef quality 3ahome food preparation 3ainjection 3aflavor 3abeef 3acooking instruction 3apalatability 3ameat tenderness 3aconsumer satisfaction 3afood additives 2aAnimals 2aCalcium Chloride 2aCattle 2aConsumer Behavior 2aCooking 2aMeatxstandards 0atop sirlion steaks 0asensory properties1 aGoodson, K.

The coding regions of both cDNA sequences were 303 nucleotides in length; each is coded for four exons in the genome. The bovine coding region shared 82% and 70% homology with human and mouse CXCL11, respectively, and the swine coding region 84% and 72% homology, respectively. As expected the swine and bovine CXCL11 sequences showed less homology with other human and mouse C-X-C motif chemokine sequences. Each cDNA was cloned into plasmids and transfected into Pichia pastoris (yeast) and the resultant expressed protein purified. Biological activity of each purified chemokine was affirmed by chemotaxis assays. Both swine and bovine CXCL11 were chemotactic for mitogen and IL-2 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

The data sets are suitable for a variety of modeling, analysis, and decision-making activities. These products are the result of collaboration between Oregon State University's Spatial Climate Analysis Service and USDA NRCS, NOAA Office of Global Programs, NOAA National Climatic Data Center, NASA, Environment Canada, and other agencies. The development of these high-quality maps was made possible through the development and use of PRISM, a knowledge-based climate analysis system that uses point climate data, a digital elevation model, and other spatial data sets to generate gridded, GIS-compatible estimates of annual, monthly and event-based climatic elements. Mapped elements currently available for the United States include 1961-1990 mean monthly and annual precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, snowfall, heating and cooling degree days, growing degree days, median last spring and first fall frost dates, median freeze-free season length, and others. In addition, century-long gridded time series of monthly precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature for the lower 48 states will be available in 2001. Map products for other countries, including China and Canada, are nearing completion. 3atemperature 3aclimatic zones 3ageographic information systems 3aUnited States 0aprecipitation 0adata sets 0amaps1 aTaylor, G.H.1 aGibson, W.P.1 aParzybok, T.W.1 aJohnson, G.L.1 aPasteris, P.A.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2000 , v.  43, no.  6 p.1957-1962x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/270783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US  aUSDA/NRCS 7aarticle02522naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001500157245013900172500002400311500001500335520066100350650001001011650002701021650004101048650002101089650001101110650001201121650002001133650002801153650002201181650001901203650003401222650000801256650002001264650000901284650001901293650002001312650002301332650001801355650002101373650001601394650001501410650002401425650002301449650001401472651001801486653003001504700001701534700001401551700002001565773009101585852000901676856011101685930003301796945002501829946000901854961000901863655001201872IND4397031720221120071618.0071024e19991026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439703172DNAL7 a10113/67162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF832 0aD5001 aCook, R.J.10aMethods and compositions for the simultaneous control of the root diseases caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis, Rhizoctonia, and Pythium  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMethods and products useful to simultaneously control the root diseases caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis, Rhizoctonia, and Pythium in crops susceptible to these root diseases are described.

The relationship between mean spectral and yield data was strongly linear (r = 0.99). Also, a strong linear relationship between mean yield and elevation data (r = 0.92) was found.

One method for pork producers to calculate floor space allowance (A) is to convert BW into a 2-dimensional concept yielding an expression of A = k * BW[superscript 0.667]. Data on ADG, ADFI, and G:F were obtained from published peer-reviewed studies. Five data sets were created: A = grower-finisher pigs, fully slatted floors, and consistent group size; B = grower-finisher pigs and fully slatted floors (group size did not need to be consistent); C = grower-finisher pigs, partially slatted floors, and consistent group size; D = grower-finisher pigs, partially slatted floors (group size did not need to be consistent); and E = nursery pigs, fully slatted or woven wire floors (group size did not need to be consistent). Each data set was analyzed using a broken-line analysis and a linear regression. For the broken-line analyses, the critical k value, below which a decrease in ADG occurred, varied from 0.0317 to 0.0348. In all cases the effect of space allowance on ADG was significant (P < 0.05). Using the linear analyses based on data with k values of <0.030, the critical k values for the 4 grower-finisher data sets did not differ from those obtained using the broken-line analysis (0.0358 vs. 0.0336, respectively; P > 0.10); however, none of the linear regressions explained a significant proportion of the variation in ADG. The slopes for the nonplateau portion of the broken-line analyses based on percent values varied among data sets. For every 0.001 decrease in k (approximately 3% of the critical k value), ADG decreased by 0.56 to 1.41%, with an average value of 0.98% for the 5%-based analyses. The use of an allometric approach to express space allowance and broken-line analysis to establish space requirements seem to be useful tools for pig production. The critical k value at which crowding becomes detrimental to the growth of the pig is similar in full- and partial-slat systems and in nursery and grower-finisher stages. The critical point for crowding determined in these analyses approximated current recommendations to ensure the welfare of pigs. 3aanimal space requirements 3astatistical analysis 3aswine 3aswine housing 3aallometry 3aanimal welfare 3aanimal performance 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aFloors and Floorcoveringsxstandards 2aHousing, Animal 2aSwinexgrowth & development1 aBrumm, M.

These findings violate core assumptions underlying DNA sequence data obtained via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for use in molecular systematics investigations. Undetected intra-individual variation of this sort can confound phylogenetic analyses at a range of taxonomic levels. The use of a DNA extraction protocol designed to enrich mitochondrial DNA as well as an initial long PCR of approximately 40% of the grasshopper mitochondrial genome failed to control for the presence of paralogous mitochondrial DNA-like sequences within individuals. These findings constitute the first demonstration of intra-individual heterogeneity in mitochondrial DNA-like sequences in the grasshopper subfamily, Melanoplinae, and only the second report of intra-individual variation in nuclear ITS ribosomal DNA sequences in grasshoppers. The fact that intra-individual variation was detected in two independent DNA marker sets in the same organism strengthens the notion that the orthology of PCR-derived DNA sequences should be examined thoroughly prior to their use in molecular phylogenetic analyses or as DNA barcodes. 3aAcrididae 3agrasshoppers 3ainsect taxonomy 3amolecular systematics 3agenetic variation 3amitochondrial DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 0aHesperotettix viridis1 aSenior, L.B.1 aGaskin, J.F.1 aJoern, A.0 tSystematic entomology.g2007 July, v.  32, no.  3 p.420-428x1365-31137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/27083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2007.00385.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070903b20071002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/09/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02514naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001300140245007000153300001600223500002400239500001500263520124400278650002101522650002301543650001601566650000901582650002301591650002701614653002201641653002301663653002201686653002401708653001501732653001301747653000801760700001501768773008001783852000901863856011201872930003301984945001302017946001302030961001302043655001202056IND2058109920221119172817.0970630e199701  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205810992DNAL7 a10113/270822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5021 aPark, B.10aUltrasonic shear wave characterization in beef longissimus muscle  ap. 229-235.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aUltrasonic shear wave propagation through muscle tissue varied with the ultrasonic wave type and the orientation between the transmitter and the receiver. Shear wave propagated through highly attenuated meat muscle was measured and validated based on the polarity property of the shear wave propagation. This polarity property enabled us to differentiate shear wave propagation from longitudinal wave propagation. The ultrasonic shear wave characteristics such as shear velocity of meat can be measured using polarization property of shear probes. Quantitatively, the ultrasonic shear velocity decreased at a rate of 2.97 m/s per percentage point increase in fat concentration. Frequency spectral feature characteristics of shear wave were independent of the orientation of probes between the transmitter and the receiver, but varied with the type of probes. Specifically, the high frequency components were attenuated more in the longitudinal probe, whereas the low frequency components were attenuated more in the shear probe when the meat samples were scanned. As a result, the spectrum scanned by the longitudinal probe skewed to the high frequency components and the spectrum by the shear probe skewed to the low frequency components. 3ameat composition 3aprobes (equipment) 3aultrasonics 3abeef 3alongissimus muscle 3anondestructive methods 0aprobe orientation 0afrequency analysis 0alongissimus dorsi 0ashear wave velocity 0atenderness 0apolarity 0afat1 aChen, Y.R.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1997 , v.  40, no.  1 p.229-235x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/270823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03655naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131072000900149072000900158100001700167245004500184300001800229500002400247500001500271520203600286650001502322650002302337650001302360650001302373650001902386650001502405650001902420650001202439650002102451650002402472650001102496650002402507650002102531650003302552650003002585651001802615651001802633653002202651653001102673653001602684653002302700653001502723700001802738700001702756773008702773852000902860856011202869930003302981945001303014946001303027961001303040655001203053IND2197268720221120105114.0990226e199809  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219726872DNAL7 a97852442pmid7 a10113/433312hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aX1001 aPowell, R.L.10aEquity of elite cow status across states  ap. 2518-2523.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCows with superior genetic merit, based on an economic index for milk, fat, and yields (milk-fat-protein dollars), have been designated as elite by USDA. Because of the concern that adjustment for heterogeneous variance may have resulted in inequitable state representation for elite cows, the percentages of US cows with elite status were compared by state using evaluations of registered Holstein cows from 1990, 1991, and 1997. The numbers and percentages of eligible cows and the proportions of those cows that were designated as elite were determined by state from May 1997 evaluations of 772,302 registered and 1,499,729 grade Holstein cows; means and standard deviations for milk-fat-protein dollars were computed. Correlations were computed among the number of cows that were eligible for elite status, the number of cows that were designated as elite, the percentage of eligible cows that were designated as elite, and the mean and the standard deviation for milk-fat-protein dollars. Models were examined to for ability to predict the percentage of elite cows by state from mean and standard deviation for milk-fat-protein dollars. The number of elite cows for a state was highly correlated to the number of cows that were eligible for elite status. States with >1.0% of eligible cows designated as elite had mean milk-fat-protein dollars that were higher than the US mean of $44, but standard deviations were equal to or slightly lower than the US standard deviation of $71. The mean value for milk-fat-protein dollars was associated with the state percentage of elite cows, but variation of the index was not related. However, the standard deviation for milk-fat-protein dollars was important in explaining the percentage of elite cows if the model also contained the mean value. Differences in the variation of lactation records across states or adjustments for those differences did not appear to cause inequity in designating elite status. Corresponding results for grade cows supported findings for registered cows. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3avariance 3aHolstein 3amilk fat yield 3acrossbreds 3abreeding value 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aDairyingxeconomics 2aFemale 2aLactationxgenetics 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMilkxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMilk Proteinsxmetabolism 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0alivestock numbers 0aelites 0acow indexes 0astandard deviation 0amilk yield1 aWiggans, G.R.1 aNorman, H.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Sept., v.  81, no.  9 p.2518-2523x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/433313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100908b20101001c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02607naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100001800175245008100193300001400274500002400288520149000312650001301802650002701815650001901842700001501861773010301876852000901979856008501988856011202073930003302185945001302218946001302231961001302244655001202257IND2243606120221121183525.0010312e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224360612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-001-0217-z2doi7 a10113/248062hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3001 aCompton, D.L.10aLipase-catalyzed synthesis of triolein-based sunscreens in supercritical CO2  ap. 43-47.  aIncludes references  aNovozym(R) 435-catalyzed transesterification of ethyl 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy cinnamate (ethyl ferulate, EF) with triolein to form the ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing lipids monoferuloyl-monooleoyl-glycerol (FMO) and feruloyl-dioleoyl-glycerol (FDO) has been conducted using supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) batch reactions. The alcoholysis of 0.1 M EF with 0.1 M 1-octanol in SC-CO2 to form octyl ferulate was used as a model reaction to optimize pressure and temperature conditions. Conditions ranging from 45 to 80degreeC and 10.3 to 34.5 MPa (1,500 to 5,000 psi) were tested with a maximal conversion of 53% of the EF being achieved at 13.8 MPa (2,000 psi) and 80degreeC after 24 h. These optimized conditions applied to the transesterification of EF with triolein effected a combined FMO and FDO yield of 69%. Triolein exhibits higher solubilities in SC-CO2 at higher pressures; therefore, the transesterification was performed at 80degreeC over a range of pressures from 13.8 to 34.5 MPa (2,000 to 5,000 psi). Results showed that a maximal yield of 74% of FMO and FDO was reached at 80degreeC and 24.1 MPa (3,500 psi) after 48 h. Compared to the FMO and FDO synthesis conducted near or in toluene, the synthesis of the UV-absorbing lipids in SC-CO2 affords higher yields within a shorter amount of time. Therefore, the transesterification of EF with triolein in a SC-CO2 batch reaction is a viable route to UV-absorbing lipids that could be used as active ingredients in sunscreen formulations. 3atriolein 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3acarbon dioxide1 aKing, J.W.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2001 Jan., v.  78, no.  1 p.43-47x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-001-0217-z3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/248063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03278naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001900149245010500168300001800273500002400291500001500315520179900330650002102129650001802150650002602168650001302194650002402207650002002231650001602251650001702267650001902284650002202303650002202325650002202347650001302369650001702382650002002399651001302419653001002432653001202442700001702454773007202471852000902543856011202552930003302664945002502697946001302722961001302735655001202748IND4447319620221119190741.0110109e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444731962DNAL7 a10113/473182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aL5001 aNorthrup, B.K.10aDistribution of Soil Bulk Density and Organic Matter along an Elevation Gradient in Central Oklahoma  ap. 1749-1757.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNative prairie and winter wheat are among the primary forage resources used to graze cattle in Oklahoma. Understanding the spatial distribution of soil characteristics is crucial to understanding the function of managed landscapes. This study compared soil bulk density (BD) and organic matter (OM) of experimental paddocks on an upland site in central Oklahoma after 26 years (1978-2004) of different forms of sustained management. Included were grazed, conventionally tilled winter wheat, and three levels of grazing (light stocking rates over long periods, high stocking rates over short periods, and no grazing) applied to tallgrass prairie. Soil cores (25 cm depth) were collected from paddocks under each management regime at 1.5 m intervals along 150 m transects situated between a common ridge and toe slope, and divided into three sections (0-5, 5-10, and 10-25 cm depths). Soil BD and OM were determined, means were tested, and measures of variability in spatial distributions were defined. Soils in the grazed wheat paddock were denser (1.35 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.21 +/- 0.03 Mg m-3 ) and contained less OM (35 +/- 6 vs. 45 +/- 14 g kg-1 ) than soils under native prairie. Management effects on BD and OM were largely confined to the upper 10 cm of soil, with intensive management forms (wheat, high stocking rates) producing denser soils with less OM. Both OM and BD had highly variable distribution patterns in all paddocks, and exhibited patterns that indicate the presence of multiple catenae that comprised the common slope of the study site, with little similarity in distribution of BD or OM across paddocks. Results indicated that developed paddocks should be relatively homogeneous in terms of topography and soils, to improve management and develop effective experimental designs. 3arange management 3astocking rate 3along term experiments 3apastures 3asoil organic matter 3arangeland soils 3abeef cattle 3abulk density 3aforage grasses 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrazing intensity 3aspatial variation 3aaltitude 3awinter wheat 3agrassland soils 3aOklahoma 0aslope 0agrazing1 aDaniel, J.A.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v.  53, no.  6 p.1749-17577nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/473183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110119b20110205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2011/01/19  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04043naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111024002100152040001800173072000900191072000900200100001700209245011800226300001800344500002400362520180300386650001802189650003002207650001002237650002202247650001702269650001702286650001802303650002002321650002902341650002302370650002702393650005302420650002002473650002802493650008002521650002402601650003902625653002102664653002502685653001202710653001602722700002202738700002302760700002302783700002102806700002202827700003402849700002402883700002202907700002302929700002102952773007802973852000903051856011203060856009103172930003303263945002503296946001103321961001303332655001203345IND4440847820221118020356.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444084782DNAL7 a205945662pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.06.0012doi7 a10113/451462hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aKirby, James10aCloning of casbene and neocembrene synthases from Euphorbiaceae plants and expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 1466-1473.  aIncludes references  aA large number of diterpenes have been isolated from Euphorbiaceae plants, many of which are of interest due to toxicity or potential therapeutic activity. Specific Euphorbiaceae diterpenes of medical interest include the latent HIV-1 activator prostratin (and related 12-deoxyphorbol esters), the analgesic resiniferatoxin, and the anticancer drug candidate ingenol 3-angelate. In spite of the large number of diterpenes isolated from these plants and the similarity of their core structures, there is little known about their biosynthetic pathways. Other than the enzymes involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, the only diterpene synthase isolated to date from the Euphorbiaceae has been casbene synthase, responsible for biosynthesis of a macrocyclic diterpene in the castor bean (Ricinus communis). Here, we have selected five Euphorbiaceae species in which to investigate terpene biosynthesis and report on the distribution of diterpene synthases within this family. We have discovered genes encoding putative casbene synthases in all of our selected Euphorbiaceae species and have demonstrated high-level casbene production through expression of four of these genes in a metabolically engineered strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The only other diterpene synthase found among the five plants was a neocembrene synthase from R. communis (this being the first report of a neocembrene synthase gene). Based on the prevalence of casbene synthases, the lack of other candidates, and the structure of the casbene skeleton, we consider it likely that casbene is the precursor to a large number of Euphorbiaceae diterpenes. Casbene production levels of 31 mg/L were achieved in S. cerevisiae and we discuss strategies to further increase production by maximizing flux through the mevalonate pathway. 3aEuphorbiaceae 3aalkyl (aryl) transferases 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3aditerpenoids 3abiosynthesis 3agene transfer 3agene expression 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDiterpenesxmetabolism 2aEuphorbiaceaexenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphorus-Oxygen Lyasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aProtein Engineering 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 0acasbene synthase 0aneocembrene synthase 0acasbene 0aneocembrene1 aNishimoto, Minobu1 aPark, J.

Detergency studies at 0.2% concentration (300 ppm water hardness) indicated good washing ability when used alone and excellent performance in combination with soap or in soap-silicate formulations. 3asoaps 3adetergents 3asurfactants 3achemical reactions 3acrystallization 3asolids 3awater solubility 3acalcium 3awater hardness 3awashing 3asilicates 0aalkylsuccinamates 0aamphoterics 0asuccinamides1 aLinfield, W.M.1 aWeil, J.K.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1977 Mar., v.  54, no.  3 p.91-94x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028943813Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/459603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101201b20101204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/11/29  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03278naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002300149245014800172300001800320500002400338500001500362520170400377650002002081650002402101650002302125650000902148650001602157650001102173650001202184650000902196650003502205650001402240650002102254650001802275650000902293650002402302650002002326650001602346653001902362700002202381700002002403700002502423773008302448852000902531856011202540930003302652945002502685946001302710961001302723655001202736IND4446513320221120165412.0101216e198307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444651332DNAL7 a10113/467652hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT2001 aWallwork, James C.14aThe effect of interactions between dietary egg white protein and zinc on body weight, bone growth and tissue trace metals in the 30-day-old rat  ap. 1307-1320.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNine groups of 30-day-old rats were fed different diets, which contained 8, 15 or 20% egg white (equivalent to 6.0, 11.3 and 15.0% protein, respectively) each at 3 levels of zinc (6, 12 and 18 ppm zinc) for 30 days. The rats consuming the 6.0% protein, regardless of zinc intake, gained less weight than the groups fed 11.3 or 15.0% protein. Plasma zinc was not influenced by dietary egg white protein content, whereas, plasma zinc levels were lower in the rats fed 6 ppm dietary zinc compared to those fed 12 or 18 ppm zinc. Of the liver trace metals measured, only iron appeared to be influenced by an egg white protein-zinc interaction. Increasing dietary egg white protein led to increased concentrations of liver zinc and magnesium. Dietary zinc levels had no effect on the concentration of these metals in the liver. Liver calcium and copper concentrations were not significantly influenced by either dietary zinc or egg white protein. Femur weights and lengths were lower in the rats fed 6.0% than in those fed 11.3 or 15.0% protein diet but were unaffected by dietary zinc. Femur width was related to dietary protein and zinc. Dietary protein and zinc were interrelated in their affect on femur zinc levels. Femur zinc concentrations increased with increasing dietary zinc levels. Also femur zinc levels decreased with increasing dietary protein content. Other femur metal (copper, iron and calcium) concentrations were higher in rats fed the low level versus the higher levels of protein, but were not influenced by dietary zinc. These results show that dietary zinc and egg white protein are interrelated with regard to their effect on body and femur growth and tissue trace metal content. 3adietary protein 3aprotein supplements 3anutritional status 3azinc 3abody weight 3acopper 3acalcium 3airon 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3amagnesium 3adietary minerals 3aanimal models 3arats 3abone mineralization 3amineral content 3aegg albumen 0abone formation1 aJohnson, LuAnn K.1 aMilne, David B.1 aSandstead, Harold H.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1983 July, v.  113, no.  7 p.1307-1320x1541-61007nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/467653Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101228b20110101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/12/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03845naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092024002100116040001800137072000900155072000900164100002400173245006300197300001700260500002400277500001500301520232100316650002002637650002302657650001702680650002002697650002202717650001402739650001202753650001602765650001902781650002102800650001902821653002102840653002102861700002302882700002102905700002102926773010102947852000903048856011203057856007403169930003303243945002503276946001303301961001303314655001203327IND4412302020221122222340.0081106e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND441230202DNAL7 a10.1086/5904422doi7 a10113/213462hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF4001 aSherman, Timothy D.14aThe Vestigial Root of Dodder (Cuscuta pentagona) Seedlings  ap. 998-1012.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  a
Seedlings of dodder are unique among dicotyledonous plants in that they emerge as a leafless, cotyledonless shoot with only a small swollen rootlike structure at the base of the tissue. Although growth of the shoot end of the dodder seedling is dramatic, no change in "root" length occurs, and the root tip is withered and senescent within 7 d of germination. Unlike most roots, the dodder root has neither recognizable root cap nor apical meristem. Astrand of vascular tissue extends all the way to the root apex and is already differentiated into vascular elements on germination. Cortical cells swell dramatically and contain large vacuoles with a small rim of cytoplasm. Nuclei in these cortical cells are extensively lobed and are much larger than nuclei in shoot tips, indicating endopolyploidy. Microtubules are detected, although they are much less abundant than in shoot tissue of dodder or roots of other dicots, especially in roots older than 1 d postgermination. Similarly, α-tubulin protein, as detected by immunoblots, appear as faint bands in root extracts; both are easily detectable in extracts of shoot tissue. Cell walls of 1-2-d-old roots are normal in morphology and contain well-defined cellulose microfibrils and well-developed middle lamellae. In contrast, later stages of development reveal cell-wall-loosening complexes and the degradation of wall structure and loss of polysaccharides, especially those of pectin side chains, which also are lost in other senescent tissues. By 5-7 d postgermination, all of the cortical cells have degenerated, leaving the vascular strand as the last remnant of intact tissue in these roots. From these data, we conclude that the swollen appearance of the dodder root is due to the low level of microtubules, so that neither mitotic divisions nor cell elongation can occur, and the loosening/senescence of the cell wall allows for expansion, resulting in a swollen root phenotype. It is speculated that the degeneration of the root end of the dodder may allow a flow of carbon from this organ to sustain the continued growth of the shoot. Although the tuberous end is clearly differentiated from the shoot tissue, it probably should be considered a highly modified basal portion of stem tissue used as a food reserve and basal support rather than a root. 3aseedling growth 3aplant biochemistry 3aroot systems 3aimmunochemistry 3aCuscuta pentagona 3aseedlings 3arooting 3aroot growth 3aultrastructure 3aparasitic plants 3aplant proteins 0aplant physiology 0aplant morphology1 aBowling, Andrew J.1 aBarger, T.

Two one-year studies were conducted to examine fiber quality properties produced by a saw-type lint cleaner in response to variations in feed rate, saw speed, combing ratio, variety and lint moisture. One hairy-leaf and two smooth-leaf varieties were used in the studies. Lint moisture and variety were the dominant factors that affected fiber quality. The smooth-leaf variety cleaned under low lint moisture conditions had shorter fiber with higher reflectance. When operated at low saw speed conditions, the cleaner increased turnout, lowered cleaning efficiency, and decreased cleaner waste. At high combing ratio conditions, the cleaner increased cleaning efficiency and short fiber content. 3awater content 3aseed cotton 3alint cotton 3acotton ginning 3acleaning equipment 3afiber quality 3aequipment performance 3avarieties 3aGossypium hirsutum 0asaw-type lint cleaners0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2007 Mar., v.  23, no.  2 p.125-130x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/26363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070830b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/29  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03837naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024002100135040001800156100001700174245005700191300001200248500002400260500001500284520213800299650002302437650001102460650001502471650002502486650001902511650001902530650001202549650002902561650002502590650002002615650002602635650002802661650001902689650002402708650001402732650002302746653002302769653001802792653001102810653001902821653002102840653001502861773009902876852000902975856011202984856009303096930003303189945002503222946001103247961001303258655001203271IND4444579720221121060727.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444457972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2010.09.0122doi7 a10113/488262hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstell, R.E.10aCoping with shrub secondary metabolites by ruminants  ap. 1-9.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRangelands throughout the world contain varying but often substantial proportions of shrubs. Shrubs are generally heavily chemically defended, and herbivores must either contend with their plant secondary metabolites (PSM) or avoid a significant component of the available forage. Browsing ruminants are exposed to thousands of chemicals in infinite combinations and concentrations that are constantly changing both temporally and spatially. The success with which a herbivore navigates this complex environment is in part attributed to its ability to cope with PSM. Plant secondary metabolites can affect a number of physiological and metabolic processes (e.g., altered microbial activity, reduced digestion, compromised acid/base balance, toxicity), although negative consequences to the herbivore range from harmless to lethal, depending factors such as dose, animal species, plane of nutrition, and physiological state. Herbivores have a variety of intertwined mechanisms to cope with consumption of PSM, ranging from physiological (e.g., salivary proteins, detoxification pathways) to behavioral (e.g., avoidance, regulation of intake below critical threshold, cautious sampling, altering size and pattern of feeding bouts, diet switching, consuming diverse and/or complementary diets). Secondary compounds may affect requirements for nutrients (e.g., protein, minerals, and glucose) and water, and may alter basal metabolic rate. Energy requirements may also increase to accommodate increased travel to water and supplementation sites to counter these negative effects, particularly on arid rangelands. A number of management strategies exist for minimizing the negative effects of PSM consumption on livestock. Supplementation to replace nutrients depleted during detoxification (e.g., amino acids and glucose), additives such as PEG and charcoal to reduce absorption and increase excretion of PSM, maintaining animals in good body condition, and behavioral modifications (e.g., diet training) are among the potential management options for enhancing the ability of ruminants to cope with PSM when browsing shrubby ecosystems. 3aruminant nutrition 3ashrubs 3arangelands 3alivestock production 3afeed additives 3apasture plants 3agrazing 3ametabolic detoxification 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritive value 3asecondary metabolites 3aantinutritional factors 3aanimal feeding 3adietary supplements 3aruminants 3apasture management 0aliterature reviews 0acomplications 0aforage 0aforage quality 0afeeding behavior 0aadaptation0 tSmall ruminant research.g2010 Nov., v.  94, no.  1-3 p.1-9dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/488263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2010.09.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20110420b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/29  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02926naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003200113040001800145100002500163245011000188300001800298500002400316506017300340520123700513650002801750650001101778650001801789650001401807650001401821650001101835650001001846650002201856650001601878650002501894650001801919700002101937700002001958700002001978700001901998773015902017852000902176856011202185856008202297956007602379961001302455655001202468IND4462815520221118012032.0120227e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446281552DNAL7 a10113/540542hdl7 a10.1099/ijs.0.024232-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRooney, Alejandro P.10aPeptoniphilus methioninivorax sp. nov., a Gram-positive anaerobic coccus isolated from retail ground beef  ap. 1962-1967.  aIncludes references  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aStrain NRRL B-23883T was isolated from retail ground beef as part of a study on the genetic diversity of Clostridium perfringens. The strain was found to be a strictly anaerobic, Gram-positive coccus that was able to utilize peptone as a sole carbon source. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the strain was closely related to species within the genera Peptoniphilus and Anaerosphaera, but it was substantially different from the closest recognized species by nearly 10 % sequence divergence. The strain was also found to be closely related (>99 % sequence similarity) to an uncultured bacterial strain that was sequenced from a 16S rRNA gene clone library constructed to characterize the bacterial community of faeces from a captive spotted hyena. Strain NRRL B-23883T shared the peptidoglycan type A4β, l-Orn–d-Glu with members of the genus Peptoniphilus. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that strain NRRL B-23883T was able to utilize glycyl l-methionine as a sole carbon source, in contrast to other species of the genus Peptoniphilus. Therefore, it is proposed that the isolate represents a novel species, Peptoniphilus methioninivorax sp. nov.; the type strain is NRRL B-23883T ( = DSM 22461T). 3aClostridium perfringens 3aCoccus 3aDNA libraries 3aHyaenidae 3aanaerobes 3acarbon 3afeces 3agenetic variation 3aground beef 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA1 aSwezey, James L.1 aPukall, Rudiger1 aSchumann, Peter1 aSpring, Stefan0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2011 Aug., v. 61, no. 8 p.1962-1967dSociety for General Microbiologyx1466-50267nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/540543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.024232-03Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/112740_10417.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03132naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092024002100118040001800139072000900157072000900166072000900175100002100184245012700205300001800332500002400350520167100374650001202045650001402057650002502071650001002096650001302106650002802119650002002147650002302167651001802190653002302208700001702231700001802248700002402266773008102290856011202371856007602483930003302559945002502592946001102617961001302628852000902641655001202650IND4448455720221120065552.0110128e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444845572DNAL7 a10.1039/c004561f2doi7 a10113/478142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aX330 0aJ7001 aLee, James Weifu10aSustainability: the capacity of smokeless biomass pyrolysis for energy production, global carbon capture and sequestration  ap. 1695-1705.  aIncludes references  aSmokeless biomass pyrolysis for biochar and biofuel production is a possible arsenal for global carbon capture and sequestration at gigatons of carbon (GtC) scales. The United States can annually harvest over 1.3 Gt (gigaton) of dry biomass. Use of the smokeless (clean and efficient) biomass-pyrolysis technology would enable the United States to converts its 1.3 Gt of annually harvestable biomass to biochar products equivalent to 325 million tons of stable carbon plus significant amount of biofuels including syngas and bio-oils. Currently, the world could annually harvest more than 6.5 GtC y-1 of biomass. The 6.5 GtC y-1 of biomass could be converted to biochar (3.25 GtC y-1) and biofuels (with heating value equivalent to that of 6500 million barrels of crude oil). Because biochar is mostly not digestible to microorganisms, a biochar-based soil amendment could serve as a permanent carbon-sequestration agent in soils/subsoil earth layers for thousands of years. By storing 3.25 GtC y-1 of biochar (equivalent to 11.9 Gt of CO2 per year) into soil and/or underground reservoirs alone, it would offset the world's 8.67 GtC y-1 of fossil fuel CO2 emissions by about 38%. The worldwide maximum capacity for storing biochar carbon into agricultural soils (1411 million hectares) is estimated to be about 428 GtC. It may be also possible to provide a global carbon "thermostat" mechanism by creating biochar carbon energy storage reserves. This biomass-pyrolysis "carbon-negative" energy approach merits serious research and development worldwide to help provide clean energy and control global warming for a sustainable future of human civilization on Earth. 3abiomass 3apyrolysis 3acarbon sequestration 3asmoke 3abiofuels 3asustainable development 3asoil amendments 3aagricultural soils 3aUnited States 0aliterature reviews1 aHawkins, Bob1 aDay, Danny M.1 aReicosky, Donald C.0 tEnergy & environmental science.g2010 Nov., v.  3, no.  11 p.1695-17057nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/478143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c004561f3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110215b20110305c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/02/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001800157245006700175500002400242500001500266520088900281650001201170650001601182650001901198650002101217650001101238650001601249650001301265650000901278650004101287651001801328653001801346653002701364773009001391852000901481856011101490930003301601945002501634946000901659961000901668655001201677IND4397031320221120060643.0071024e19990608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439703132DNAL7 a10113/67122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aN200 0aD5001 aAnthony, W.S.10aApparatus and method for reducing fiber waste by lint cleaners  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn apparatus for cleaning cotton having a frame which rotatably supports a cylinder member having a cylindrical surface supporting a fiber-engaging structure for seizing contaminated cotton.

The primary antimicrobial compounds in these products are acetic acid and NaCl, which can alter the intracellular physiology of E. coli O157:H7, leading to cell death. For combinations of acetic acid and NaCl at pH 3.2 (a pH value typical for non-heat-processed acidified vegetables), survival curves were described by using a Weibull model. The data revealed a protective effect of NaCl concentration on cell survival for selected acetic acid concentrations. The intracellular pH of an E. coli O157:H7 strain exposed to acetic acid concentrations of up to 40 mM and NaCl concentrations between 2 and 4% was determined. A reduction in the intracellular pH was observed for increasing acetic acid concentrations with an external pH of 3.2. Comparing intracellular pH with Weibull model predictions showed that decreases in intracellular pH were significantly correlated with the corresponding times required to achieve a 5-log reduction in the number of bacteria.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetic acid 3asimulation models 3aacidification 3afood contamination 3amicrobial physiology 3amicrobial contamination 3afood pathogens 3apH 3asodium chloride 3aprocessed foods 3aEscherichia coli O157 3avegetables 3amortality 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aBreidt, Frederick Jr.1 aSmith, Charles E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Feb. 1, v.  77, no.  3 p.889-895dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02136-103Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/478153Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110215b20110305c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/02/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03928naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191072000900200072000900209100001700218245009300235300001600328500002400344500001500368520187900383650002402262650001902286650001702305650002002322650002402342650002502366650002102391650001902412650002102431650003302452650001202485650003902497650002102536650002502557650001502582650002302597650001802620650002702638650001902665650002002684651001102704653002102715653001802736653003402754653001702788700002002805700001602825773010702841852000902948856011202957856009203069930003303161945002503194946001103219961001203230655001203242IND4403306420221120153030.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440330642DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01546.x2doi7 a10113/152422hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aF900 0aW000 0aK001 0aJ2001 aLitton, C.M.12aA non-native invasive grass increases soil carbon flux in a Hawaiian tropical dry forest  ap. 726-739.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aNon-native plants are invading terrestrial ecosystems across the globe, yet little is known about how invasions impact carbon (C) cycling or how these impacts will be influenced by climate change. We quantified the effect of a non-native C₄ grass invasion on soil C pools and fluxes in a Hawaiian tropical dry forest over 2 years in which annual precipitation was average (Year 1) and ~60% higher than average (Year 2). Work was conducted in a series of forested plots where the grass understory was completely removed (removal plots) or left intact (grass plots) for 3 years before experiment initiation. We hypothesized that grass invasion would: (i) not change total soil C pools, (ii) increase the flux of C into and out of soils, and (iii) increase the sensitivity of soil C flux to variability in precipitation. In grass plots, grasses accounted for 25-34% of litter layer C and ~70% of fine root C. However, no differences were observed between treatments in the size of any soil C pools. Moreover, grass-derived C constituted a negligible fraction of the large mineral soil C pool (< 3%) despite being present in the system for >=50 years. Tree litterfall was ~45% lower in grass plots, but grass-derived litterfall more than compensated for this reduction in both years. Annual cumulative soil-surface CO₂ efflux (Rsoil) was ~40% higher in grass plots in both years, and increased in both treatments by ~36% in the wetter Year 2. Despite minimal grass-derived mineral soil C, > 75% of Rsoil in grass plots was of C₄ (i.e. grass) origin. These results demonstrate that grass invasion in forest ecosystems can increase the flux of C into and out of soils without changing total C pools, at least over the short term and as long as the native tree canopy remains intact, and that invasion-mediated changes in belowground C cycling are sensitive to precipitation. 3asoil organic carbon 3atropical soils 3agas exchange 3aleaf area index 3aPennisetum setaceum 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil respiration 3acarbon dioxide 3ainvasive species 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3agrasses 3asoil-plant-atmosphere interactions 3atropical forests 3asoil water potential 3aunderstory 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest litter 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3abiodegradation 3aenergy transfer 3aHawaii 0asoil carbon flux 0aprecipitation 0aKaupulehu Dry Forest Preserve 0aplant litter1 aSandquist, D.R.1 aCordell, S.0 tGlobal change biology.g2008 Apr., v.  14, no.  4 p.726-739dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/152423Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01546.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080530b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/27  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02478naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092024002100137040001800158072000900176072000900185100002000194245009200214300001600306500002400322500001500346520101500361650002401376650001901400650001801419650001101437650002601448650002001474650001401494650002101508650002601529650002001555650001201575653001001587700001901597773008201616852000901698856011201707856009501819930003301914945002501947946001101972961001301983655001201996IND4372429720221121231310.0050719e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437242972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2004.12.0052doi7 a10113/377472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE710 0aQ0051 aBennedsen, B.S.10aPerformance of a system for apple surface defect identification in near-infrared images  ap. 419-431.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis paper reports the development and testing of machine vision systems for sorting apples for surface defects, including bruises. The system operated on apples, which were oriented with the stem/calyx axis perpendicular to the imaging camera. Grey-scale images in the visible wavebands were used to verify orientation. Images for detection of defects were acquired through two optical filters at 740 and 950 nm, respectively. Defects were detected using a combination of three different threshold segmentation routines and one routine based on artificial neural networks and principal components. The paper reports quantitative measurement of the performance of the system for verification of orientation and a combination of the four segmentation routines. The routines were evaluated using eight different apple varieties. The ability of the routines to find individual defects and measure the area ranged from 77 to 91% for the number of defects detected, and from 78 to 92.7% of the total defective area. 3aautomatic detection 3aimage analysis 3afood surfaces 3aapples 3aquantitative analysis 3aproduct defects 3avarieties 3abruising (plant) 3aequipment performance 3aMalus domestica 3asorting 0apeels1 aPeterson, D.L.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2005 Apr., v.  90, no.  4 p.419-431x1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/377473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2004.12.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03144naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100002200175245014800197300001600345500002400361520166700385650001402052650002502066650001302091650001502104650002202119650001202141650001402153650002202167653002402189653002902213653004202242700002602284773010002310852000902410856011202419856008502531930003302616945002502649946001102674961001302685655001202698IND4431242220221121231419.0100114e20050430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443124222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sab.2005.03.0072doi7 a10113/377482hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3001 aYanes, Enrique G.10aParallel path nebulizer: Critical parameters for use with microseparation techniques combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  ap. 555-561.  aIncludes references  aFour different, low flow parallel path Mira Mist CE nebulizers were evaluated and compared in support of an ongoing project related to the use of microseparation techniques interfaced to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the quantification of cobalamin species (Vitamin B12). For the characterization of the different Mira Mist CE nebulizers, the nebulizer orientation as well as the effect of methanol on analytical response was the focus of the study. The position of the gas outlet on the nebulizer which consistently provided the maximum signal was when it was rotated to the 11 o'clock position when the nebulizer is viewed end-on. With this orientation the increased signal may be explained by the fact that the cone angle of the aerosol is such that the largest percentage of the aerosol is directed to the center of the spray chamber and consequently into the plasma. To characterize the nebulizer's performance, the signal response of a multielement solution containing elements with a variety of ionization potentials was used. The selection of elements with varying ionization energies and degrees of ionization was essential for a better understanding of observed increases in signal enhancement when methanol was used. Two different phenomena contribute to signal enhancement when using methanol: the first is improved transport efficiency and the second is the "carbon enhancement effect". The net result was that as much as a 30-fold increase in signal was observed for As and Mg when using a make-up solution of 20% methanol at a 15 microliter/min flow rate which is equivalent to a net volume of 3 microliter/min of pure methanol. 3aatomizers 3alaboratory equipment 3aaerosols 3aionization 3achemical analysis 3aarsenic 3amagnesium 3amass spectrometry 0aatomic spectrometry 0aparallel path nebulizers 0ainductively coupled mass spectrometry1 aMiller-Ihli, Nancy J.0 tSpectrochimica acta.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether changes in the amount and the chemical form of selenium would affect DNA methylation and whether this effect would be modified by arsenic. Caco-2 cells, a human colon cancer cell line, were exposed to 0, 1 or 2 micromol supplemental selenite/L and 0, 1 or 2 micromol supplemental arsenite/L for 7 d. DNA isolated from Caco-2 cells not treated with selenite was significantly (P < 0.0001) hypomethylated compared with that from cells treated with 1 or 2 micromol selenite/L. DNA isolated from Caco-2 cells not treated with arsenite was significantly (P < 0.0001) hypomethylated compared with DNA isolated from cells treated with 1 or 2 micromol arsenite/L. In addition, methylation of the p53 promoter region of Caco-2 cells decreased when cells were cultured in the absence of selenite and in the absence of arsenite. Sixty weanling male Fischer 344 rats were fed a torula yeast-based diet supplemented with 0, 0.1 or 2 mg selenium/kg diet as either selenite or selenomethionine in the presence or absence of 5 mg arsenic/kg diet as arsenite for 6 wk. Similar to the results with Caco-2 cells, rats fed selenium-deficient diets had significantly (P < 0.0001) hypomethylated liver and colon DNA compared with rats fed 0.1 or 2.0 microgram selenium/g diets as either selenite or selenomethionine. Thus, alterations in DNA methylation may be a potential mechanism, whereby deficient dietary selenium increases liver and colon tumorigenesis. 3aselenium 3acytosol 3acell lines 3ahomocysteine 3aDNA 3ablood plasma 3adietary mineral supplements 3acolon 3aarsenic 3anutrient deficiencies 3aadenosylmethionine 3arats 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahepatocytes 3aliver 3aDNA methylation 3anutritional status 3aadenosylhomocysteine 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aanimal models 3adietary minerals 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxpharmacology 2aArsenicxpharmacology 2aArsenitesxpharmacology 2aCaco-2 Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aColonxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Methylationxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aSeleniumxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSelenomethioninexpharmacology 2aSodium Selenitexpharmacology 0ablood 0aintake 0atrace element deficiencies 0adiet1 aUthus, Eric O.1 aFinley, John W.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2000 Dec., v.  130, no.  12 p.2903-2909x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/459493Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101129b20101204c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03262naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100001700193245006000210300001800270500002400288520163800312650002001950650001401970650001401984650001601998650001102014650001502025650001802040650002102058650001502079650001302094650001402107650002102121650002702142650003702169651001202206700001302218700001502231700001602246700001702262700001602279700001602295773008302311852000902394856008502403856011202488930003302600945002502633946001302658961001302671655001202684IND4375639920221119213035.0051031s2005    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND437563992DNAL7 a10.1080/019041605002024832doi7 a10113/303272hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF600 0aF2001 aMorris, D.R.10aLeaf phosphorus diagnosis of sugarcane on organic soils  ap. 1511-1523.  aIncludes references  aMost of the sugarcane (interspecific hybrids of Saccharum sp.) production in Florida is on organic soils. Supplemental phosphorus (P) fertilizer is often applied for optimum yields, but producers are required to reduce P levels in farm drainage waters. The objectives of this study were to relate optimum leaf P tissue concentration with yield in organic soil, and to determine optimum leaf sampling dates during the summer. Eight genotypes were planted at two locations, eight additional genotypes were planted at a third location, and eight more genotypes were planted at a fourth location. Crops were grown for three years. Measurements of leaf P concentration were repeated during growth seasons and over crop years for a total of six sampling dates at each location. Three fertilizer P treatments (0, 24, and 48 kg ha(-1) yr-1) were applied to all genotypes at each location. Leaf samples were partitioned into early-, mid-, and late-summer dates. Early-leaf samples had the widest range in leaf P concentrations compared with mid- and late-season leaf samples. Correlation analyses of yield vs. leaf P concentration across all treatments in early- and mid-summer were statistically significant (P < 0.05), but coefficients were low (r = 0.14 and 0.26, respectively). No consistent relationship across locations described the effect of leaf P tissue concentration on yield. Leaf P concentrations could not provide accurate P fertilization rates that will give maximum sugarcane yields and prevent over-fertilization of P. The highest potential for relating leaf P concentrations with yield appears to be from early leaf samples. 3aplant nutrition 3aSaccharum 3asugarcane 3asugar crops 3aleaves 3aphosphorus 3aorganic soils 3anutrient content 3acrop yield 3asampling 3acultivars 3afertilizer rates 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aFlorida1 aGlaz, B.1 aPowell, G.1 aDeren, C.W.1 aSnyder, G.H.1 aPerdomo, R.1 aUlloa, M.F.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2005, v.  28, no.  9 p.1511-1523x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041605002024833Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/303273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090623b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04028naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111024002100145040001800166072000900184072000900193100001800202245014600220300001800366500002400384500001500408520117700423650002201600650001801622650002201640650001301662650002601675650002201701650003201723650002801755650002601783650002201809650002001831650005201851650001101903650002801914650001301942650001501955650001101970650002401981650002802005650001902033650001602052650003302068650002602101650002502127650002802152650003002180650001902210650002102229650002802250650002402278650004202302650005302344650002502397650005202422650002302474650003402497653001402531653002202545653003002567653001502597700001502612700002102627700002002648700001602668700001302684700001902697700001502716700001702731773007702748852000902825856008402834856011202918930003303030945002503063946001303088961001303101655001203114IND4412462520221122200429.0081108e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441246252DNAL7 a189434592pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-98-10-11262doi7 a10113/213292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF8311 aPuthoff, D.P.10aAnalysis of Expressed Sequence Tags from Uromyces appendiculatus Hyphae and Haustoria and Their Comparison to Sequences from Other Rust Fungi  ap. 1126-1135.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aHyphae, 2 to 8 days postinoculation (dpi), and haustoria, 5 dpi, were isolated from Uromyces appendiculatus infected bean leaves (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Pinto 111) and a separate cDNA library prepared for each fungal preparation. Approximately 10,000 hyphae and 2,700 haustoria clones were sequenced from both the 5' and 3' ends. Assembly of all of the fungal sequences yielded 3,359 contigs and 927 singletons. The U. appendiculatus sequences were compared with sequence data for other rust fungi, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, Uromyces fabae, and Puccinia graminis. The U. appendiculatus haustoria library included a large number of genes with unknown cellular function; however, summation of sequences of known cellular function suggested that haustoria at 5 dpi had fewer transcripts linked to protein synthesis in favor of energy metabolism and nutrient uptake. In addition, open reading frames in the U. appendiculatus data set with an N-terminal signal peptide were identified and compared with other proteins putatively secreted from rust fungi. In this regard, a small family of putatively secreted RTP1-like proteins was identified in U. appendiculatus and P. graminis. 3asequence analysis 3arust diseases 3acomplementary DNA 3aPhaeolus 3aUromyces viciae-fabae 3agenomic libraries 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aPhakopsora pachyrhizi 3aPuccinia graminis 3agene expression 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ahyphae 3aUromyces appendiculatus 3agenomics 3aproteomics 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBasidiomycotaxgenetics 2aContig Mapping 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenome, Fungal 2aHyphaexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aRNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0ahaustoria 0aPhaeolus vulgaris 0afungal diseases of plants 0asecretomes1 aNeelam, A.1 aEhrenfried, M.L.1 aScheffler, B.E.1 aBallard, L.1 aSong, Q.1 aCampbell, K.B.1 aCooper, B.1 aTucker, M.L.0 tPhytopathology.g2008 Oct., v.  98, no.  10 p.1126-1135x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-10-11263Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/213293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081112b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03671naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001700149245006800166300001600234500002400250500002400274520215400298650001302452650001502465650002202480650002102502650001502523650001502538650001402553650001502567650001202582650002202594650001202616651001702628653002202645653002002667653002202687653001202709653004002721700002202761700001702783700001702800700002002817773008802837852000902925856011202934930003303046945001303079946001303092961001203105655001203117IND2325658320221122040509.0020227e200109  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232565832DNAL7 a10113/343662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aX6001 aJensen, M.E.10aSpatial modeling of rangeland potential vegetation environments  ap. 528-536.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aPotential vegetation environments (e.g., habitat types, range sites, ecological sites) are important to land managers because they provide a conceptual basis for the description of resource potentials and ecological integrity. Efficient use of potential vegetation classifications in regional or subregional scale assessments of ecosystem health has been limited to date, however, because traditional ecological unit mapping procedures often treat such classifications as ancillary information in the map unit description. Accordingly, it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe the precise location, patch size, and spatial arrangement of potential vegetation environments from most traditional ecological unit maps. Recent advances in remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), terrain modeling, and climate interpolation facilitate the direct mapping of potential vegetation through a predictive process based on gradient analysis and ecological niche theory. In this paper, we describe how a predictive vegetation mapping process was used to develop a 30 m raster-based map of 4 grassland, 5 shrubland, and 6 woodland habitat types across the Little Missouri National Grasslands, North Dakota. Discriminant analysis was used in developing this potential vegetation map based on 6 primary geographic information system themes. Geoclimatic subsections and remotely sensed vegetation lifeform maps were used in predictive model stratification. Terrain indices, LANDSAT satellite imagery, and interpolated climate information were used as independent (predictor) variables in model construction. A total of 616 field plots with known habitat type membership were used as dependent variables and assessed by a jackknife discriminant analysis procedure. Accuracy values of our map ranged from 54 to 77% in grasslands, 62 to 100% in shrublands, and 70 to 100% in woodlands dependent on geoclimatic subsection setting. Techniques are also described for generalizing the 30 m pixel resolution habitat type map to appropriate ecological unit maps (e.g., landtype associations) for use in ecosystem health assessments and land use planning. 3ahabitats 3aprediction 3aplant communities 3aclimatic factors 3atopography 3agrasslands 3awoodlands 3ashrublands 3agrazing 3aland use planning 3aLandsat 3aNorth Dakota 0asatellite imagery 0arange condition 0asatellite surveys 0amapping 0alittle missouri national grasslands1 aDibenedetto, J.P.1 aBarber, J.A.1 aMontagne, C.1 aBourgeron, P.S.0 tJournal of range management.g2001 Sept., v.  54, no.  5 p.528-536x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/343663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091007b20091106c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle04475naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002000177245014800197300001800345500002400363520175500387650002102142650002402163650001502187650001302202650002102215650002502236650002002261650001902281650002502300650001502325650003502340650001402375650000902389650001802398650002702416650002302443650001202466650001702478650001602495650007402511650001202585650004202597650002302639650004102662650004802703650004402751650005402795650002002849650005802869650000902927650004802936650002702984650002203011650004803033650002303081650002403104650003203128650003503160650000903195650000903204650002203213650003903235650005103274700001903325773008403344852000903428856011203437930003303549945002503582946001303607961001303620655001203633IND4446506320221120192315.0101215e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444650632DNAL7 a129493862pmid7 a10113/467582hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aDavis, Cindy D.10aDietary Folate and Selenium Affect Dimethylhydrazine-Induced Aberrant Crypt Formation, Global DNA Methylation and One-Carbon Metabolism in Rats  ap. 2907-2914.  aIncludes references  aSeveral observations suggest a role for DNA methylation in cancer pathogenesis. Although both selenium and folate deficiency have been shown to cause global DNA hypomethylation and increased cancer susceptibility, the nutrients have different effects on one-carbon metabolism. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of dietary selenium and folate. Weanling, Fischer-344 rats (n = 23/diet) were fed diets containing 0 or 2.0 mg selenium (as selenite)/kg and 0 or 2.0 mg folate/kg in a 2 x 2 factorial design. After 3 and 4 wk of a 12-wk experiment, 19 rats/diet were injected intraperitoneally with dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 25 mg/kg) and 4 rats/diet were administered saline. Selenium deficiency decreased (P < 0.05) colonic DNA methylation and the activities of liver DNA methyltransferase and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase and increased plasma glutathione concentrations. Folate deficiency increased (P < 0.05) the number of aberrant crypts per aberrant crypt foci, the concentration of colonic S-adenosylhomocysteine and the activity of liver cystathionine synthase. Selenium and folate interacted (P < 0.0001) to influence one-carbon metabolism and cancer susceptibility such that the number of aberrant crypts and the concentrations of plasma homocysteine and liver S-adenosylhomocysteine were the highest and the concentrations of plasma folate and liver S-adenosylmethionine and the activity of liver methionine synthase were the lowest in rats fed folate-deficient diets and supplemental selenium. These results suggest that selenium deprivation ameliorates some of the effects of folate deficiency, probably by shunting the buildup of homocysteine (as a result of folate deficiency) to glutathione. 3adietary minerals 3avitamin supplements 3afolic acid 3aselenium 3aoxidative stress 3aantioxidant activity 3aDNA methylation 3acarcinogenesis 3avitamin deficiencies 3aDNA damage 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aweanlings 3arats 3aanimal models 3achromosome aberrations 3amethyltransferases 3abetaine 3ahomocysteine 3aglutathione 2a5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarcinogensxadministration & dosage 2aColonxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCystathionine beta-Synthasexmetabolism 2aDNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferasesxmetabolism. 2aDNA Methylation 2aDeficiency Diseasesxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aDiet 2aDimethylhydrazinesxadministration & dosage 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aDrug Interactions 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aGlutathionexblood 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aLiverxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aS-Adenosylhomocysteinexmetabolism 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosagexdeficiency.1 aUthus, Eric O.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 Sept., v.  133, no.  9 p.2907-2914x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/467583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20130425b20130503c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/12/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02987naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100002500187245015600212300001800368500002400386500001500410520151500425650002301940650002301963650002201986650001502008650002302023650001502046653001802061700002302079700001502102700003002117773010302147852000902250856011202259856008802371930003302459945002502492946001102517961001302528655001202541IND4443480920221121042041.0101015e20101022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444348092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2010.05.0122doi7 a10113/459562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aH0001 aKoesukwiwat, Urairat10aHigh throughput analysis of 150 pesticides in fruits and vegetables using QuEChERS and low-pressure gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry  ap. 6692-6703.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA higher monitoring rate is highly desirable in the labs, but this goal is typically limited by sample throughput. In this study, we sought to assess the real-world applicability of fast, low-pressure GC-time-of-flight MS (LP-GC/TOFMS) for the identification and quantification of 150 pesticides in tomato, strawberry, potato, orange, and lettuce samples. Buffered and unbuffered versions of QuEChERS (which stands for "quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe") using dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) and disposable pipette extraction (DPX) for clean-up were compared for sample preparation. For clean-up of all sample types, a combination of 150mg MgSO₄, 50mg primary secondary amine (PSA), 50mg C₁₈, and 7.5mg graphitized carbon black (GCB) per mL extract was used. No significant differences were observed in the results between the different sample preparation versions. QuEChERS took <10min per individual sample, or <1h for two chemists to prepare 32 pre-homogenized samples, and using LP-GC/TOFMS, <10min run time and <15min cycle time allowed >32 injections in 8h. Overall, >126 analytes gave recoveries (3 spiking levels) in the range of 70-120% with <20% RSD. The results indicate that LP-GC/TOFMS for GC-amenable analytes matches UHPLC-MS/MS in terms of sample throughput and turnaround time for their routine, concurrent use in the analysis of a wide range of analytes in QuEChERS extracts to achieve reliable quantification and identification of pesticide residues in foods. 3afood contamination 3apesticide residues 3amass spectrometry 3avegetables 3agas chromatography 3apesticides 0afruits (food)1 aLehotay, Steven J.1 aMiao, Shui1 aLeepipatpiboon, Natchanun0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 Oct. 22, v.  1217, no.  43 p.6692-6703dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/459563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.05.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20101129b20101204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/11/29  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02583naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002200193245009800215300001600313500002400329500001500353520085500368650002301223650002101246650002401267650002701291650002201318650001201340650002101352650002101373650002301394650001701417651001001434653001401444653001501458653002601473700002601499700002401525700002201549700002101571700002501592700001601617773008101633852000901714856008501723856011201808930003301920945002501953946001301978961001401991655001202005IND4443350320221121022651.0101013s201009  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444335032DNAL7 a10.2979/NPJ.2010.11.3.2752doi7 a10113/488162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aF140 0aF2001 aSmith, Forrest S.10aNotice of release of Webb Germplasm whiplash pappusgrass: selected class of natural germplasm  ap. 275-280.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA selected germplasm of whiplash pappusgrass (Pappophorum vaginatum Buckley [Poaceae]) has been released for rangeland seeding, saline soil revegetation, and wildlife habitat restoration plantings in south Texas.

Both polyploidy and hybridization have been documented in the Tridentatae. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and fluorochrome banding were used to detect and analyze ribosomal DNA changes linked to polyploidization in this group by studying four diploid-polyploid species pairs. In addition, genome sizes and heterochromatin patterns were compared between these populations. The linked 5S and 35S rRNA genes are confirmed as characteristic for Artemisia, and a pattern at the diploid level of three rDNA loci located at telomeric positions proved to be typical. Loss of rDNA loci was observed in some polyploids, whereas others showed additivity with respect to their diploid relatives. Genome downsizing was observed in all polyploids. Banding patterns differed depending on the pair of species analysed, but some polyploid populations showed an increased number of heterochromatic bands. FISH and fluorochrome banding were useful in determining the systematic position of Artemisia bigelovii, for which a differential pattern was found as compared with the rest of the group. Additionally, FISH was used to detect the presence of the Arabidopsis-type telomere repeat for the first time in Artemisia. 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3aArtemisia 3aribosomal RNA 3aloci 3adiploidy 3atelomeres 3aribosomal DNA 3aautopolyploidy 3agenes 3aheterochromatin 3arepetitive sequences 0afluorochrome banding 0agenome 0apolyploidy1 aGarnatje, Teresa1 aPellicer, Jaume1 aMcArthur, E.

A plausible reason for this association is that expression of genes encoding important antimicrobial proteins depends on concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 produced by activated immune cells at sites of infection, and that synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 is dependent on the availability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 . Thus, increasing the availability of 25(OH)D 3 for immune cell synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 at sites of infection has been hypothesized to aid in clearance of the infection. This report details the treatment of an acute intramammary infection with infusion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 to the site of infection. Ten lactating cows were infected with in one quarter of their mammary glands. Half of the animals were treated intramammary with 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 . The 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 treated animal showed significantly lower bacterial counts in milk and showed reduced symptomatic affects of the mastitis. It is significant that treatment with 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 reduced the severity of an acute bacterial infection. This finding suggested a significant non-antibiotic complimentary role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 in the treatment of infections in compartments naturally low in 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 such as the mammary gland and by extension, possibly upper respiratory tract infections.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3atuberculosis 3arisk 3aplate count 3amilk 3amastitis 3amammary glands 3alactation 3ainfluenza 3agene expression 3acows 3ablood serum 3aantimicrobial proteins 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aantimicrobial proteins 3acalcitriol 3acows 3agene expression 3ainfection 3ainfluenza 3alactation 3amammary glands 3amastitis 3amilk 3aplate count 3arisk 3atuberculosis 3avitamin deficiencies 3avitamin supplements1 aReinhardt, Timothy A.1 aSacco, Randy A.1 aNonnecke, Brian J.1 aNelson, Corwin D.1 aSchauber, Jürgen0 tPloS one.g, v. 6, no. 10dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/540433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00254793Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/112711_2011_PLoS_ONE_6_10_e25479.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03120naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002000120040001800140072001700158100001600175245015100191300001600342500002400358520156600382650003801948650001801986650001802004650002202022650002302044650002202067650002102089650001902110650001202129650001602141651001502157653003702172700002302209700001702232700001602249773009102265852000902356856007802365856011102443930003302554945002502587946001302612961001302625655001202638IND4378598220221119075845.0060308e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437859822DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-90-02332doi7 a10113/12992hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHayes, R.J.10aHost resistance to Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus and Lettuce big-vein associated virus and virus sequence diversity and frequency in California  ap. 233-239.  aIncludes references  aBig vein is an economically damaging disease of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) caused by the Olpidium brassicae-vectored Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus (MLBVV). Lettuce big-vein associated virus (LBVaV) is also frequently identified in symptomatic plants, but no causal relationship has been demonstrated. Although big vein is a perennial problem in the United States, the extent of MLBVV and LBVaV infection and diversity is unknown. Lettuce cultivars partially resistant to big vein reduce losses, but do not eliminate disease. While Lactuca virosa does not develop big vein symptoms, it has not been tested for infection with MLBVV or LBVaV. Lettuce cultivars Great Lakes 65, Pavane, Margarita, and L. virosa accession IVT280 were evaluated for big vein incidence and virus infection in inoculated greenhouse trials. Additional lettuce samples were collected from field sites in California, classified for symptom severity, and evaluated for virus infection. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing were used to determine infection with MLBVV and LBVaV, and sequence diversity among viral isolates, respectively. Infections with MLBVV and MLBVV/LBVaV were dependent on big vein symptom expression in California production areas, and isolates were closely related to those found in Europe and Japan. Partial big vein resistance was identified in Margarita and Pavane; however, MLBVV infection was found in asymptomatic plants. L. virosa IVT280 remained symptomless and virus free, suggesting that it is immune to MLBVV and LBVaV. 3aLettuce big-vein associated virus 3aplant viruses 3acoat proteins 3agenetic variation 3adisease resistance 3adisease incidence 3adisease severity 3aLactuca sativa 3alettuce 3ahost plants 3aCalifornia 0aMirafiori lettuce big-vein virus1 aWintermantel, W.M.1 aNicely, P.A.1 aRyder, E.J.0 tPlant disease.g2006 Feb., v.  90, no.  2 p.233-239wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-90-02333Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/12993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02434naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151100002000169245014400189300001600333500002400349506017300373520075400546650001501300650001201315650001601327650001901343650001801362650002201380650001901402650001501421650001501436650002101451651003101472700001901503700001801522700001901540773009901559856011201658856008801770956010801858961001301966852000901979655001201988IND4462778220221118012053.0120222e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446277822DNAL7 a10.1080/14498596.2010.4878532doi7 a10113/540442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaliberte, A.S.10aHierarchical object-based classification of ultra-high-resolution digital mapping camera (DMC) imagery for rangeland mapping and assessment  ap. 101-115.  aIncludes references  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aUltra-high-resolution digital aerial imagery has great potential to complement or replace ground measurements of vegetation cover for rangeland monitoring and assessment. This research investigated object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques for classifying vegetation in southwestern USA arid rangelands with 4 cm resolution digital aerial imagery. We obtained high r-square values for the regressions relating ground- to image-based measures of percent cover (r-square values: 0.82–0.92). OBIA enabled us to automate the classification process and demonstrated potential for quantifying fine-scale land cover attributes with ultra-high-resolution imagery. This approach exhibits promise for nationwide application for monitoring grazing lands. 3aarid lands 3acameras 3acartography 3adigital images 3agrazing lands 3aground vegetation 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3arangelands 3avegetation cover 3aSouthwestern United States1 aBrowning, D.M.1 aHerrick, J.E.1 aGronemeyer, P.0 tJournal of spatial science.g2010 June, v. 55, no. 1 p.101-115wJournal:12293x1449-85967nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/540443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14498596.2010.4878533Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/112710_Laliberte_HierarchicalObject_2010_101.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181100001700190245008900207300001600296500012700312500002400439500001500463520105300478650002301531650002301554650001601577650001501593650001701608650001001625650002201635650002501657650002001682650001501702650001201717650002501729650001201754650001201766650001801778650001001796650003501806650003601841650004801877653001701925653002301942653002701965773010401992852000902096856008102105856011202186930003302298945002502331946001302356961001302369655001202382IND4417726320221119035607.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441772632DNAL7 a192764332pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2008-003362doi7 a10113/291602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aSpackman, E.14aThe ecology of avian influenza virus in wild birds: What does this mean for poultry?  ap. 847-850.  aIn the special section: Avian influenza: Vectors, vaccines, public health and product marketability / edited by G.R. Huff.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAs natural hosts for avian influenza virus (AIV), wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, are the primary reservoir for transmission of AIV to domestic poultry. Therefore, understanding the dissemination and maintenance of AIV in wild birds is important for understanding the factors that contribute to transmission of AIV from wild birds to poultry. However, relatively little is known about the ecology of the virus in wild birds, and the depth of data are inconsistent worldwide. Also, the biology of the virus itself is very important, because AIV is highly adaptable to different hosts and likely to the environment as well. Some insight may be gained from the Asian H5N1 highly pathogenic AIV lineage, because surveillance for this virus has increased considerably in wild birds worldwide since 2005. Also, numerous species that have not previously been represented in AIV testing have been included in surveillance for the Asian H5N1 highly pathogenic AIV, allowing for a more complete understanding of the distribution of AIV in wild birds. 3adisease reservoirs 3avertebrate viruses 3awater birds 3ahost range 3afood animals 3ahosts 3aInfluenza A virus 3adisease transmission 3aavian influenza 3awild birds 3astrains 3adisease surveillance 3apoultry 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wild 2aBirds 2aDisease Reservoirsxveterinary 2aInfluenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype 2aInfluenza in Birdsxtransmissionxvirology. 0aepidemiology 0aliterature reviews 0aInfluenza A virus H5N10 tPoultry science.g2009 Apr., v.  88, no.  4 p.847-850dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2008-003363Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/291603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02537naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002000124040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100001300189245024700202300001800449500002400467520088100491650001201372650001901384650002801403650001701431650001901448650001701467650001801484650001801502650003701520653003401557700001501591700001401606700002001620700001801640773010101658852000901759856008201768856011101850930003301961945002501994946001102019961001302030655001202043IND4394970520221116152758.0070913e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439497052DNAL7 a10.1002/ejoc.2003006692doi7 a10113/33442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL600 0aL0011 aMori, K.10aSynthesis of the Four Stereoisomers of 6-Acetoxy-19-methylnonacosane, the Most Potent Component of the Female Sex Pheromone of the New World Screwworm Fly, with Special Emphasis on Partial Racemization in the Course of Catalytic Hydrogenation  ap. 1089-1096.  aIncludes references  aStarting from the enantiomers of citronellal and 1-octyn-3-ol, all four stereoisomers of 6-acetoxy-19-methylnonacosane were synthesized with sufficiently high stereochemical purities (more than 90% ee at C-6; about 97% ee at C-19) for their biological testing as the female sex pheromone of the screwworm fly (Cochliomyia hominivorax). All four isomers showed strong pheromone activity even at 1 microgram, and no significant difference was observed in their potency. Adams platinum oxide was found to cause partial racemization of enantiomerically pure secondary propargylic alcohols in the course of their catalytic hydrogenation to saturated and secondary alcohols, while palladium-charcoal was less potent in causing partial racemization. A new HPLC-based discrimination of chiral and secondary alcohols proved to be useful in following such a subtle partial racemization. 3amyiasis 3ainsect control 3aCochliomyia hominivorax 3ainsect pests 3asex pheromones 3ahydrocarbons 3astereoisomers 3ahydrogenation 3astructure-activity relationships 0a6-acetoxy-19-methylnonacosane1 aOhtaki, T.1 aOhrui, H.1 aBerkebile, D.R.1 aCarlson, D.A.0 tEuropean journal of organic chemistry.g2004 Mar., v.  2004, no.  5 p.1089-1096x1099-06907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejoc.2003006693Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/33443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070917b20071002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/09/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03499naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001700191245007900208300001600287500008300303500002400386500001500410520166300425650002302088650003302111650002302144650002502167650001302192650001002205650001802215650002802233650002802261650002202289650001002311651001702321653002302338653002102361653002902382653002002411700001702431700001802448700001702466700002002483700001602503773009002519852000902609856008302618856011202701930003302813945002502846946001302871961001302884655001202897IND4392526020221118113611.0070619e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439252602DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2006.01332doi7 a10113/145372hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ700 0aJ200 0aF1201 aHanson, J.D.10aDynamic Cropping Systems: Increasing Adaptability Amid an Uncertain Future  ap. 939-943.  aPaper presented at a symposium held November 6-10, 2005, Salt Lake City, Utah.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aFuture trends in population growth, energy use, climate change, and globalization will challenge agriculturists to develop innovative production systems that are highly productive and environmentally sound. Furthermore, future agricultural production systems must possess an inherent capacity to adapt to change to be sustainable. Given this context, adoption of dynamic cropping systems is proposed to meet multiple agronomic and environmental objectives through the enhancement of management adaptability to externalities. Dynamic cropping systems are a form of agricultural production that relies on an annual strategy to optimize the outcome of (i) production, (ii) economic, and (iii) resource conservation goals using ecologically-based management principles. Dynamic cropping systems are inherently complex, possessing larger crop portfolios and greater crop diversity and sequencing flexibility as compared with monoculture and fixed-sequence cropping systems. Greater crop diversity and sequencing flexibility within dynamic cropping systems may result in reduced weed and disease infestations, greater nutrient- and precipitation-use efficiency, decreased requirements of exogenous inputs, and lower production risk. The multiple interactions among management components of dynamic cropping systems demand greater management intensity than monoculture and fixed-sequence cropping systems. Further development of dynamic cropping systems is important for managing crop production systems in a sustainable manner. These systems can ultimately assist land managers to develop new and improved land-use strategies to the benefit of generations to come. 3atemporal variation 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asoil water content 3awater use efficiency 3aland use 3aweeds 3acrop rotation 3anutrient use efficiency 3asustainable agriculture 3acropping sequence 3acrops 3aNorth Dakota 0aliterature reviews 0acropping systems 0adynamic cropping systems 0acrop management1 aLiebig, M.A.1 aMerrill, S.D.1 aTanaka, D.L.1 aKrupinsky, J.M.1 aStott, D.E.0 tAgronomy journal.g2007 , v.  99, no.  4 p.939-943wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2006.01333Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/145373Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080516b20080606c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02537naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002500149245007900174300001600253500002400269520126900293650002101562650002001583650002901603650002201632650001501654650002901669650002401698651001301722653002101735700002101756700002501777700002201802773007201824856011201896930003302008945002502041946001302066961001502079852000902094655001202103IND4412274420221122163543.0081104s200809  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND441227442DNAL7 a10113/213212hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP000 0aL5001 aThiemann, Gregory W.10aTrans fatty acids provide evidence of anthropogenic feeding by black bears  ap. 183-193.  aIncludes references  aBears (Ursus spp.) that become conditioned to anthropogenic food sources pose a risk to human safety and generally need to be relocated, rehabilitated, or destroyed. Identifying food-conditioned bears may be difficult if the animal is not captured or killed while immediately engaged in the nuisance behavior. Fatty acid signature analysis has been used to examine the dietary habits of bears and other carnivores and is based on the predictable incorporation of ingested fatty acids into the consumer's fat stores. Unusual fatty acids that are available in only a few food types may be particularly useful dietary markers. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that trans fatty acids present in many processed foods could serve as markers of anthropogenic foraging by black bears (Ursus americanus). Among 13 bears that were killed in western and central Colorado, trans fatty acids were more abundant in conflict bears than in non-conflict bears. Further, the abundance of trans fatty acids in bear fat appeared to be correlated with the intensity of bear-human conflict. We conclude that the trophic transfer of trans fatty acids can provide valuable insights into the ecological, demographic, and anthropogenic factors that contribute to bear-human conflict. 3aUrsus americanus 3aprocessed foods 3aanthropogenic activities 3atrans fatty acids 3abiomarkers 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3awildlife management 3aColorado 0anuisance animals1 aStahl, Randal S.1 aBaruch-Mordo, Sharon1 aBreck, Stewart W.0 tHuman-Wildlife Conflicts.g2008 Fall, v.  2, no.  2 p.183-1937nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/213213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/11/10  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111024002100145040001800166072000900184072000900193100001500202245008700217300001800304500002400322500001500346520153200361650002401893650001401917650002501931650001901956650001701975650001801992650002702010650002502037650002202062650006402084650002602148650001402174650002402188650006302212650003102275651001102306651001502317651001102332651001502343653001602358653003002374653002702404700001902431700001902450773007702469852000902546856008402555856011202639930003302751945002502784946001302809961001302822655001202835IND4412462320221122163541.0081108e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441246232DNAL7 a189434572pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-98-10-11072doi7 a10113/213222hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aX1001 aGent, D.H.10aSpatial and Temporal Stability of the Estimated Parameters of the Binary Power Law  ap. 1107-1117.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe incidence of hop powdery mildew on leaves, caused by Podosphaera macularis, collected from 1,606 transects in 77 commercial hop yards in Oregon and Washington over 9 years was used to assess variability in heterogeneity of disease and the estimated binary power law parameters. Spatial analyses of data sets were conducted at the level of individual rows (row level) and multiple rows within a yard (yard level). The binary power law provided a good fit to all data sets, with R² values ranging from 0.933 to 0.993. At the row level, the intercept parameter ln(A(x)) was >0 for 8 years, but was not significantly greater than 0 in 2006. The parameter b was greater than 1 for all row-level data sets collected from 1999 to 2005, but was <1 in 2006 and not significantly different from 1 in 2007. Covariance analysis indicated the factor 'region' affected ln(A(x)) in 3 years, and b in 2 years. 'Cultivar' had an effect on ln(A(x)) in 3 years and b in year. At the yard level, ln(A(x)) was greater than 0 for 6 years, but in 2006 and 2007, ln(A(x)) was not significantly different from 0. The slope parameter b was greater than 1 in 6 years, but was not significantly different from 1 in 2006 and 2007. Differences in b among years were large enough to have practical implications for sample sizes and precision of fixed and sequential sampling. Although the binary power law parameter tended to be relatively stable, variability of the estimated parameters may have practical consequences for sampling precision and costs. 3aPodosphaera aphanis 3aequations 3aspatial distribution 3apowdery mildew 3aspatial data 3adata analysis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3astatistical analysis 3adisease incidence 2aAscomycotaxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBinomial Distribution 2aIncidence 2aModels, Statistical 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiologyxstatistics & numerical data. 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 3aOregon 0aWashington 0aOregon 0aWashington 0aPodosphaera 0aquantitative epidemiology 0aSphaerotheca macularis1 aTurechek, W.W.1 aMahaffee, W.F.0 tPhytopathology.g2008 Oct., v.  98, no.  10 p.1107-1117x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-10-11073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/213223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04018naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152024002100171040001800192072000900210100002500219245015000244246003300394500001500427506007600442520169800518592002802216506003702244650002602281650002202307650001302329650001802342650001102360650003002371650002302401650002102424650001902445650002602464650001402490650001402504650002702518650001802545650002302563650000902586650003202595650002202627650001302649650002002662650003302682651001802715651001302733651001402746653001002760653001402770653001302784653001502797700001302812700002002825700002702845700002902872700001802901773007302919852000902992856011203001856008803113930003303201945002503234961001303259655001203272IND4438283920221207142541.0100610e20100507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443828392DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00105362doi7 aPMC28663222pmcid7 a204798692pmid7 a10113/451332hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aHalterman, Dennis A.10aCompetition between Phytophthora infestans Effectors Leads to Increased Aggressiveness on Plants Containing Broad-Spectrum Late Blight Resistance3 aIpiO Effector/RB Interaction  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe destructive plant disease potato late blight is caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary. This disease has remained particularly problematic despite intensive breeding efforts to integrate resistance into cultivated potato, largely because of the pathogen's ability to quickly evolve to overcome major resistance genes. The RB gene, identified in the wild potato species S. bulbocastanum , encodes a protein that confers broad-spectrum resistance to most P. infestans isolates through its recognition of highly conserved members of the corresponding pathogen effector family IPI-O. IpiO is a multigene family of effectors and while the majority of IPI-O proteins are recognized by RB to elicit host resistance, some variants exist that are able to elude detection (e.g. IPI-O4). In the present study, analysis of ipiO variants among 40 different P. infestans isolates collected from Guatemala, Thailand, and the United States revealed a high degree of complexity within this gene family. Isolate aggressiveness was correlated with increased ipiO diversity and especially the presence of the ipiO4 variant. Furthermore, isolates expressing IPI-O4 overcame RB-mediated resistance in transgenic potato plants even when the resistance-eliciting IPI-O1 variant was present. In support of this finding, we observed that expression of IPI-O4 via Agrobacterium blocked recognition of IPI-O1, leading to inactivation of RB-mediated programmed cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana . In this study we definitively demonstrate and provide the first evidence that P. infestans can defeat an R protein through inhibition of recognition of the corresponding effector protein.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3aAgrobacterium 3ablight 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3amultigene family 3awild relatives 3aSolanum bulbocastanum 3aapoptosis 3apathogens 3aPhytophthora infestans 3apathogenicity 3amicrobial genetics 3aloci 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3atransgenic plants 3abreeding 3afungal proteins 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aUnited States 3aThailand 3aGuatemala 0agenes 0aipiO gene 0aproteins 0aipiO locus1 aChen, Yu1 aSopee, Jiraphan1 aBerduo-Sandoval, Julio1 aSánchez-Pérez, Amilcar1 aYang, Haibing0 tPloS one.g, v. 5, no. 5dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/451333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00105363Available from publisher's Web site  a20101105b20101204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/11/05  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03381naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008003300029016002200062024002100084040001800105072000900123100001900132245008800151500002400239520198200263650001802245650001302263650001102276650002202287650001802309650002902327650002402356650001302380650002002393650002102413650001902434650000802453653001902461700001902480700002002499773021102519852000902730856011202739930003302851945002502884946001302909961001302922655001202935IND4410581920221120221819.0080925|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND441058192DNAL7 a10113/205542hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aWoodbury, B.L.10aNitrogen management of a feedlot runoff control system with vegetative filter strip  aIncludes references  aRunoff from beef cattle feedlots is usually stored in holding ponds. These ponds can be a concentrated source for contaminating surface and groundwater. Vegetative filter strips (VFS) can be effective in protecting surface and groundwater by reducing diffuse contamination. The objectives of this project were to evaluate the contaminant control by the system, and to determine the sustainability of the VFS for nutrient and runoff water control. A runoff control system for a small feedlot was constructed to utilize a VFS for water and nutrient control. To reduce contamination load, a debris basin was constructed to collect and store suspended solids. The basin provided 5 - 8 minute hydraulic retention, before evenly discharging the water across the VFS. Over a three year period, the debris basin effectively reduced the mass of total and volatile suspended solids, and chemical oxygen demand by 80, 67, and 59%, respectively. Significant contaminant reductions in the runoff water were measured as it passed through the system for most precipitation events. No water was measured exiting the VFS during the three year study period by either infiltration below the root zone or by direct release from the site; therefore, the discharge water from the basin was effectively used for hay crop production. The estimated total nitrogen load in the discharge water entering the VFS was equivalent to or less than the total nitrogen removed by the crop. Two-dimensional electromagnetic induction maps have been generated beginning before the VFS was put in operation and have continued to the present. These maps were used to illustrate zones within the VFS where salt and nutrient loading are occurring. The apparent electrical conductivity of the VFS in the region of the debris basin discharge tubes have been disproportional increased due to salt and nutrient loading. Surface soil nitrate-nitrogen levels, particularly closest to the discharge tubes, have also increased. 3acattle manure 3afeedlots 3arunoff 3apollution control 3afilter strips 3aanimal manure management 3anutrient management 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient offtake 3aforage grasses 3ahay 0arunoff control1 aNienaber, J.A.1 aEigenberg, R.A.0 tAnimal, Agricultural and Food Processing Wastes IX : proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium, 12-15 October, 2003, Raleigh, North Carolina.dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineers, c2003.7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/205543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081016b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/08  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03506naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111024002100145040001800166072000900184100001600193245011900209300001800328500002400346520145300370650002201823650002401845650001101869650003301880650002001913650002001933650001801953650001501971650002701986650000702013650002902020650002102049650001502070650001102085650001202096650005802108650006202166650002602228650002402254650003102278650002402309650003202333650004202365650002502407650003302432700002002465700001702485773007702502852000902579856008402588856011202672930003302784945002502817946001302842961001302855655001202868IND4412462620221122163620.0081108e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441246262DNAL7 a189434602pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-98-10-11362doi7 a10113/213232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8321 aPusey, P.L.10aAntibiosis and Acidification by Pantoea agglomerans Strain E325 May Contribute to Suppression of Erwinia amylovora  ap. 1136-1143.  aIncludes references  aPantoea agglomerans strain E325, a commercially available antagonist for fire blight of apple and pear, was originally selected through screening based on suppression of Erwinia amylovora on flower stigmas, but specific mechanisms of antagonism were unknown. Bacterial modification of pH was evaluated as a possible mechanism by analyzing stigma exudates extracted from 'Gala' apple stigmas. The pH values for field samples were only slightly lower than controls, but indicated a range (pH 5 to 6) conducive for antibiotic activity according to subsequent assays. Under low-phosphate and low-pH conditions, an antibacterial product of E325 with high specificity to E. amylovora was effective at low concentrations. A minimum of 20 to 40 ng of a ninhydrin-reactive compound purified using RP-HPLC caused visible inhibition in assays. Activity was heat stable and unaffected by amino acids, iron, or enzymes known to affect antibiotics of P. agglomerans. Antibiosis was diminished, however, under basic conditions, and with increasing phosphate concentrations at pH 6 and 7. Inhibition was not observed in media containing phosphate concentrations commonly used in antibiosis assays. We propose that E325 suppresses the fire blight pathogen not only by competing for nutrients on the stigma, but by producing an antibiotic specific to E. amylovora. Further work is necessary to substantiate that the compound is produced and active on flower stigmas. 3aErwinia amylovora 3aPantoea agglomerans 3ablight 3abacterial diseases of plants 3adisease control 3aMalus domestica 3aacidification 3aantibiosis 3abiochemical mechanisms 3apH 3aantibacterial properties 3ahost specificity 3aphosphates 3astigma 3aflowers 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxbiosynthesisxtherapeutic use. 2aErwinia amylovoraxdrug effectsxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aFlowersxmicrobiology 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMalusxmicrobiology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPantoeaxdrug effectsxpathogenicity. 2aPhosphatesxanalysis 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology1 aStockwell, V.O.1 aRudell, D.R.0 tPhytopathology.g2008 Oct., v.  98, no.  10 p.1136-1143x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-10-11363Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/213233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03907naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152024002100171040001800192072000900210100001600219245012000235246002700355500001500382506007600397520166700473592002802140506003702168650000902205650001902214650001002233650001202243650001702255650002502272650003502297650001702332650002102349650002302370650001002393650001802403650001102421650002202432650002502454650001802479650002502497650002602522653001902548653001102567700001702578700002202595700002102617700001802638700002002656700001802676700002002694700001902714700001902733700002602752700002202778700002002800773007302820852000902893856011202902856008803014930003303102945002503135961001303160655001203173IND4438280120221207144025.0100610e20100524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443828012DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00107802doi7 aPMC28753942pmcid7 a205207272pmid7 a10113/451342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aZhao, Keyan10aGenomic Diversity and Introgression in O. sativa Reveal the Impact of Domestication and Breeding on the Rice Genome3 aGenetic Diversity Rice  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe domestication of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) was a complex process punctuated by episodes of introgressive hybridization among and between subpopulations. Deep genetic divergence between the two main varietal groups (Indica and Japonica) suggests domestication from at least two distinct wild populations. However, genetic uniformity surrounding key domestication genes across divergent subpopulations suggests cultural exchange of genetic material among ancient farmers. In this study, we utilize a novel 1,536 SNP panel genotyped across 395 diverse accessions of O. sativa to study genome-wide patterns of polymorphism, to characterize population structure, and to infer the introgression history of domesticated Asian rice. Our population structure analyses support the existence of five major subpopulations (indica , aus , tropical japonica , temperate japonica and GroupV) consistent with previous analyses. Our introgression analysis shows that most accessions exhibit some degree of admixture, with many individuals within a population sharing the same introgressed segment due to artificial selection. Admixture mapping and association analysis of amylose content and grain length illustrate the potential for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in domesticated plant populations. Genes in these regions control a myriad of traits including plant stature, blast resistance, and amylose content. These analyses highlight the power of population genomics in agricultural systems to identify functionally important regions of the genome and to decipher the role of human-directed breeding in refashioning the genomes of a domesticated species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arice 3aplant genetics 3aseeds 3aamylose 3aOryza sativa 3acarbohydrate content 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ametagenomics 3aagronomic traits 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3aintrogression 3alength 3agenetic variation 3apopulation structure 3adomestication 3aartificial selection 3agenetic recombination 0aplant breeding 0agenome1 aWright, Mark1 aKimball, Jennifer1 aEizenga, Georgia1 aMcClung, Anna1 aKovach, Michael1 aTyagi, Wricha1 aAli, Md.

Best management practices (BMP) for intensive irrigated cropping systems of the NCP are based on large nitrogen (N) applications without accounting for N budgets. There are concerns that non-scientific based BMPs may be impacting underground water resources. We conducted the first study in this region, located at the Luancheng Experimental Research Station that measured the effects of N fertilizer rates on nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching losses. From October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2004, we used a water balance approach with a neutron probe, weighing lysimeter, and suction cups located at 1.8 m depths on a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-corn (Zea mays L.) rotation to monitor NO3-N leaching. Residual soil NO3-N, yields, and N uptake by aboveground biomass were also measured. Corn received two surface broadcast applications every year of 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg urea-N ha(-1) for the N-200, N-400, N-600, and N-800 treatments, respectively. The first broadcast application was at seeding and the second at tassel. Similarly, winter wheat received two surface broadcast applications, initially as a pre-plant and a second application at the jointing stage of growth in spring. We monitored NO3-N leaching losses for the N-200, N-400, and N-800 treatments. Average NO3-N leaching losses during wheat-corn season were 6, 58, and 149 kg NO3-N ha(-1) year(-1) for the 200, 400, and 800 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) treatments, respectively. The NO3-N leaching increased with N applications (P < 0.05) and were in agreement with the NO3-N concentrations of 12, 74, and 223 mg NO3-N L-1 for soil water at 1.8 m depths for the 200, 400, and 800 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) treatments, respectively. Higher than needed N fertilizer applications increased the NO3-N leaching losses and reduced the N use efficiency (NUE) without yield increases. We propose that there is a need for a new scientifically based BMP approach for the NCP based on N budgets that credits soil NO3-N before planting, N mineralization from soil organic matter, and other potential N sources as a key mitigation alternative to increase NUE and reduce NO3-N leaching in this region. 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3anutrient use efficiency 3asoil water balance 3aevapotranspiration 3anutrient uptake 3agrain yield 3asoil chemical properties 3anutrient management 3abest management practices 3aChina1 aHu, C.1 aDelgado, J.A.1 aZhang, Y.1 aOuyang, Z.0 tAgricultural water management.g2007 Apr. 16, v.  89, no.  1-2 p.137-147x0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/303223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2006.12.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090623b20090703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/04/11  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01828naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001900148245004800167500002400215520067000239650001600909650001300925650001200938650001300950650002800963650002200991650002701013650001201040650000901052651001801061700001901079700001501098773009701113852000901210856011101219930003301330945002501363946000901388961000901397655001201406IND4397536720221120100922.0071105e20021112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439753672DNAL7 a10113/71292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aD5001 aLeathers, T.D.10aPenicillium isolates for modifying alternan  aIncludes references  aFour new Penicillium spp. isolates (NRRL 21966, NRRL 21967, NRRL 21968, and NRRL 21969) are capable of essentially quantitative conversion of native alternan to a polymeric modified form having a lower apparent molecular weight than native alternan.

The trap design was based on whitefly adult behavioral attraction to yellow color, flight orientation to sky light when leaving host plants, and walking to shade when landing on a new host for feeding and egg laying. The trap does not use sticky materials or bait. It can be placed in greenhouses or fields for extended periods without saturation catches of whitefly adults. The trap does not catch many other insect types and avoids dust contamination. It is washable, reusable, inexpensive, and easy to use. Whiteflies caught can be counted against a dark background without the aid of a microscope. It may also have potential for supplementary adult whitefly control in greenhouses where parasites are released for the control of whitefly nymphs since it does not catch many Eretmocerus spp. parasites. The trap can also be used as a research tool for studying whitefly activity in the field. 3aBemisia 3ainsect traps 3adesign 3anew products 3amonitoring 3asampling 3ainsect control 3agreenhouses1 aHenneberry, T.J.0 tJournal of cotton science.g1998, v.  2, no.  3 p.104-109aJournal of cotton science (Online)wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/343613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091008b20091106c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03639naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194100002300203245009100226300001800317500002400335520171400359650002302073650001502096650002102111650001502132650001902147650001902166650002202185650001802207650001202225650002202237650001802259650001202277650004702289650002802336650006702364650001402431650004002445650002902485650001302514651001202527651001202539700004402551700001602595700002102611773010302632852000902735856011202744856008502856930003302941945002502974946001302999961001303012655001203025IND4412948820221119172623.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441294882DNAL7 a184464072pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-008-9110-x2doi7 a10113/270552hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aX6201 aBooth, D.

It is also the center of ongoing debate over USDI Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) adjudication of land uses. Monitoring resource use is a BLM responsibility, but conventional monitoring is inadequate for the vast areas encompassed in this and other public-land units. New monitoring methods are needed that will reduce monitoring costs. An understanding of data-set relationships among old and new methods is also needed. This study compared two conventional methods with two remote sensing methods using images captured from two meters and 100 meters above ground level from a camera stand (a ground, image-based method) and a light airplane (an aerial, image-based method). Image analysis used SamplePoint or VegMeasure software. Aerial methods allowed for increased sampling intensity at low cost relative to the time and travel required by ground methods. Costs to acquire the aerial imagery and measure ground cover on 162 aerial samples representing 9000 ha were less than $3000. The four highest correlations among data sets for bare ground--the ground-cover characteristic yielding the highest correlations (r)--ranged from 0.76 to 0.85 and included ground with ground, ground with aerial, and aerial with aerial data-set associations. We conclude that our aerial surveys are a cost-effective monitoring method, that ground with aerial data-set correlations can be equal to, or greater than those among ground-based data sets, and that bare ground should continue to be investigated and tested for use as a key indicator of rangeland health. 3aaerial photography 3arangelands 3avegetation cover 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aimage analysis 3acomputer software 3acost analysis 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aAnimals, Wild 2aBiomass 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxeconomicsxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aGeography 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aSatellite Communications 2aSoftware 3aWyoming 0aWyoming1 aCox, Samc(Natural resource specialist)1 aMeikle, Tim1 aZuuring, Hans R.0 tEnvironmental management.g2008 Dec., v.  42, no.  6 p.1091-1100dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/270553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-008-9110-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04858naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024002100141040001800162072000900180072000900189072000900198100001700207245005700224300001800281500002400299500001500323520255600338650001602894650001202910650001702922650001402939650001402953650001202967650001202979650001202991650001203003650002203015650001103037650002303048650002003071650002003091650001503111650001703126650001603143650002603159650003003185650001203215650002203227650001303249650003303262650002103295650001103316650002403327650001403351650001903365650000903384650002203393650001203415650001103427650001603438650001703454650001203471650002803483650002503511653001803536653001003554700001603564700001603580700001803596773010503614852000903719856008003728856011203808930003303920945002503953946001303978961001303991655001204004IND4403097420221122053937.0080320e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440309742DNAL7 a174684212pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-7582doi7 a10113/152322hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL500 0aL2101 aGrings, E.E.10aBeef heifer development within three calving systems  ap. 2048-2058.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aA 3-yr study was conducted to evaluate the effects of calving system, weaning age, and postweaning management on growth and reproduction in beef heifers. Heifer calves (n = 676) born in late winter (average birth date = February 7 +/- 9 d) or early spring (average birth date April 3 +/- 10 d) were weaned at 190 or 240 d of age, and heifers born in late spring (average birth date May 29 +/- 10 d) were weaned at 140 or 190 d of age. Heifers were managed to be first exposed to breeding at approximately 14 mo of age. After weaning, the calves were randomly assigned to treatments. Heifers on the constant gain treatment were fed a corn silage- and hay-based diet. Heifers on delayed gain treatments were placed on pasture but were fed grass hay or a supplement, or both, depending on the forage conditions. Three months before their respective breeding seasons, delayed gain heifers were moved to drylot and fed a corn silage- and barley-based diet (late winter or early spring) or moved to spring rangeland (late spring). The data were analyzed using mixed model procedures with calving system, weaning age, and postweaning management options creating 12 treatments. Average daily gain was 0.36 +/- 0.05 (SED) kg/d less (P < 0.001) for delayed gain heifers during the initial phase, whereas these heifers gained 0.44 +/- 0.03 kg/d more (P < 0.001) than constant gain heifers during the last 90 d before breeding. Body weights at the beginning of the breeding season did not differ (P = 0.97) between constant gain and delayed gain heifers but were affected by calving system and weaning age, reflecting some of the differences in initial BW. Prebreeding BW for heifers weaned at 190 d of age were 36 +/- 6.4 kg heavier (P < 0.001) for those born in late winter and early spring compared with late spring and were 388, 372, and 330 kg for heifers weaned in October at 240, 190, or 140 d of age (linear effect, P < 0.001). The proportion of heifers exhibiting luteal activity at the beginning of the breeding season was not affected (P = 0.57) by treatment. Approximately half of the heifers were randomly selected for breeding. Treatment had no effect (P = 0.64) on pregnancy rates. In conclusion, heifers from varied calving systems and weaning strategies can be raised to breeding using either constant or delayed gain strategies without affecting the percentage of heifers cycling at the beginning of the breeding season. These results suggest that producers have multiple options for management of heifer calves within differing calving systems. 3acow feeding 3aheifers 3acalving rate 3aweanlings 3abeef cows 3agrazing 3acalving 3aweaning 3aseasons 3acattle production 3aforage 3aseasonal variation 3aliveweight gain 3aanimal breeding 3aanimal age 3agrass silage 2aAge Factors 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBody Constitution 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aPoaceaexmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aRain 2aRandom Allocation 2aSeasons 2aSilage 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWeaning 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 2aZea maysxmetabolism 0ayoung animals 0afeeds1 aGeary, T.W.1 aShort, R.E.1 aMacNeil, M.D.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Aug., v.  85, no.  8 p.2048-2058wJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-7583Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/152323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080820b20080905c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/05/07  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03570naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100002200197245007600219300001600295500002400311500001500335520160700350650002101957650002801978650001802006650001102024650002202035650001402057650001502071650001302086650001302099650002002112650002202132650001702154650001302171650001402184650002002198650001702218650002102235650002402256650004302280650002102323650000702344650001802351650001902369650001602388653002502404700002102429700002002450700002602470773010802496852000902604856011202613856008902725930003302814945002502847946001102872961001302883655001202896IND4438052720221123014557.0100604e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443805272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.04.0082doi7 a10113/433122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aW000 0aJ5001 aVaughn, Steven F.10aLesquerella press cake as an organic fertilizer for greenhouse tomatoes  ap. 164-168.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLesquerella press cake is a co-product generated during the processing of the new oilseed crop lesquerella [Lesquerella fendleri (A. Gray) S. Wats.]. Developing commercial uses for the press cake would increase the profitability of growing lesquerella. The press cake contains levels of nutrients which should make it an excellent organic fertilizer for container-grown plants. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. ‘Red Robin') plants were grown in potting mix supplemented with a standard chemical fertilizer mix or either lesquerella press cake or cottonseed meal at rates of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0% (w/w). Both of the organic fertilizers had only minor effects on the physical properties (bulk density, total porosity percentage, total solids percentage, pH, EC) of the potting mixes with increasing rates, although there was substantially less shrinkage of media amended with 5 and 10% press cake than with the same rates of cottonseed meal. At rates of 10.0% for press cake and 5.0% for cottonseed meal (which supplied similar substrate nitrogen levels), plant heights, total tomato yield per plant and number of fruit per plant were equal to that of the chemically fertilized control. There were no differences among treatments for average fruit weight. Chlorophyll content was generally similar among the treatments during the course of the experiments, with a trend towards lower values for the 2.5% rates of press cake and cottonseed meal near the conclusion of the experiments. From these results it appears that lesquerella press cake may be a useful organic fertilizer for container-grown tomatoes. 3anutrient content 3aelectrical conductivity 3aprofitability 3asolids 3aPhysaria fendleri 3aoil crops 3acrop yield 3atomatoes 3aporosity 3avegetable crops 3awaste utilization 3abulk density 3aoilseeds 3afruit set 3acottonseed meal 3aplant growth 3aprocessing waste 3aorganic fertilizers 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3afertilizer rates 3apH 3aoilseed cakes 3asoilless media 3achlorophyll 0aLesquerella fendleri1 aDeppe, Nathan A.1 aBerhow, Mark A.1 aEvangelista, Roque L.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2010 Sept., v.  32, no.  2 p.164-168dElsevier Sciencex0926-66907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/433123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03225naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001900148245006300167300001600230500002400246500001500270520192000285650001702205650001902222650002002241650002102261650001302282650002402295650001102319653001502330653001802345653001302363700001602376700001902392700001602411700002002427700001802447773007402465852000902539856011102548930003302659945002502692946001302717961001302730655001202743IND4387337520221116193810.0070129e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438733752DNAL7 a10113/14532hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aL1001 aPurswell, J.L.10aAir exchange rate in a horse trailer during road transport  ap. 193-201.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aHorses traveling by road commonly experience heat stress conditions and poor air quality, which may be caused by insufficient ventilation; however, there are few estimates of air exchange in a horse trailer during transport. Air exchange rate was measured at ten locations within a four-horse trailer (internal volume 18.5 m3) using tracer gas decay measurement to assess the adequacy of ventilation. Three vehicle speeds (13, 48, and 97 km h(-1)) and three window configurations (all windows and roof vents closed, all windows open, all windows open and roof vents open forward) were tested with and without animals present in the trailer. External air temperature ranged from 22.3 degrees C to 28.3 degrees C with an average of 25.3 degrees C, and internal air temperature ranged from 29.9 degrees C to 34.8 degrees C with an average of 31.3 degrees C with animals present. Air exchange rate increased with vehicle speed and open window and vent area. The average air exchange rate over all vehicle speeds and ventilation configurations was 0.52 min(-1) with animals present and 0.76 min(-1) without animals. Without animals present, the maximum mean exchange rate was 1.42 min(-1) at 97 km h(-1) at the rear left window with all windows and vents open; the lowest mean exchange rate was 0.12 min(-1) at 13 km h(-1) with all windows and vents closed at the lower position of the rearmost stall divider. With animals present, the maximum air exchange rate observed was 0.84 min(-1) with all windows and vents open and traveling at 97 km h(-1). Ventilation in the trailer was not adequate when compared to recommendations for stabled horses for any combination of vehicle speed or ventilation configuration. Increasing open vent area, either by increasing the number and size of roof vents or the size of windows in the sidewall, would be the most cost-effective means of increasing air exchange in a horse trailer. 3agas exchange 3aanimal welfare 3aair temperature 3aanimal transport 3aair flow 3anatural ventilation 3ahorses 0atracer gas 0avehicle speed 0avehicles1 aGates, R.S.1 aLawrence, L.M.1 aJacob, J.D.1 aStombaugh, T.S.1 aColeman, R.J.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 Jan., v.  49, no.  1 p.193-2017nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/14533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070813b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/11  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02852naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072001700173072001700190072001700207072001700224100001700241245014300258300001600401500002400417500001500441520115400456650002601610650001901636650001901655650003401674650002501708650001701733650002401750650001701774650001001791650001101801650001501812650001901827650001301846653002401859653001801883700001601901773009601917852000902013856009202022856011202114930003302226945002502259946001302284961001302297655001202310IND4367818220221119060138.0050322s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436781822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.2004.00630.x2doi7 a10113/395212hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The preharvest drench was not effective in controlling the development of SS in fruit returned to RA storage following 7 months CA storage. Application of a 1750-p.p.m. ethoxyquin line spray (without TBZ) following 5 months CA storage effectively extended the control of SS to 2 months under RA conditions. The 1750 p.p.m. ethoxyquin line spray was effective in controlling SS for 1 month RA storage following an additional 2 months CA storage period. This represents a 36% reduction in the amount of ethoxyquin currently used on fruit stored for short periods of time. Minor, noncommercial amounts of pithy brown core (PBC) developed during storage, demonstrating that 1% O 2 and 1% CO 2 in a flow-through system can be safely utilized for the storage of pears. Growing location (Oregon vs. Washington) made no difference in the sensitivity to CO 2 injury and packing and handling damage. 3apostharvest treatment 3acarbon dioxide 3aPyrus communis 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3apostharvest diseases 3afood storage 3aambient temperature 3astorage time 3apears 3aoxygen 3aethoxyquin 3ascald diseases 3aspraying 0aregular air storage 0afruits (food)1 aDrake, S.R.0 tJournal of food quality.g2004, v.  27, no.  6 p.471-482wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2004.00630.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/395213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100318b20100403c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/04  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01899naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002100120040001800141100001400159245013800173300001600311500002400327520061400351650001600965650001700981650001500998650001201013650001201025650001901037653001601056700001401072700001501086700001401101700001501115773007801130852000901208856011201217856007801329930003301407945001301440946001101453961001301464655001201477IND2040130920221120042944.0940608s1993    au |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND204013092DNAL7 a10.1007/BF013137852doi7 a10113/129862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, H.S.10aEnhanced replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus in a homogeneous subpopulation of MA-104 cell line  ap. 477-483.  aIncludes references  aTwo different cell populations, high- (MARC-145) and low-permissive cell clones (L-1) to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus, were derived from MA-104 cell line (parent cell: P) by cell cloning.

Reproduction of F₁ ewes in spring mating seasons  ap. 2743-2751.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjectives were to estimate effects of sire breed (Dorset, Finnsheep, Romanov, Texel, and Montadale), dam breed [Composite III (CIII) and northwestern whiteface (WF)], mating season (March and May), and their interactions on reproductive traits of mature F₁ ewes in spring mating seasons. A total of 1,099 F₁ ewes produced 1,754 litters of 2,995 lambs from exposures to Suffolk rams during March and May mating seasons in 1995 through 1999. Fertility rate and ewe longevity were measured. Number born and litter birth weight were recorded, and number and weight at weaning and 20 wk of age were analyzed separately for dam- and nursery-reared litter mates. Total productivity from 4 to 6 yr of age for each ewe entering the breeding flock was calculated as the sum of 20-wk weights for dam-reared lambs and separately for nursery-reared lambs. Interactions of sire breed x mating season, ewe age x mating season, and ewe age x dam breed were often significant. Interactive effects of sire breed and mating season on fertility rate (P < 0.001) were primarily due to differences in magnitude. Fertility rates of sire breeds for March and May matings, respectively, were 92 and 89% for Romanov, 91 and 72% for Finnsheep, 90 and 52% for Texel, 88 and 52% for Montadale, and 83 and 62% for Dorset. Sire breed x mating season also affected number born (P < 0.03); March and May values were 2.12 and 2.05 for Romanov, 2.00 and 1.94 for Finnsheep, 1.39 and 1.41 for Texel, 1.37 and 1.51 for Montadale, and 1.37 and 1.55 for Dorset, respectively. Interaction of sire breed x dam breed on fertility rate (P < 0.01) was due to change in rank as well as magnitude. Romanov- and Dorset-sired ewes out of CIII dams had greater fertility rates than Romanov- and Dorset-sired ewes out of WF dams. The opposite situation existed for ewes by Finnsheep, Texel, and Montadale sires. Differences between dam breeds (CIII and WF) in total productivity of dam-reared lambs were not detected, whereas ewes exposed in March (78 kg) were more productive (P < 0.01) than those exposed in May (68 kg). Means of sire breeds for total productivity of dam-reared lambs were 47, 65, 70, 70, and 111 kg for Texel, Montadale, Dorset, Finnsheep, and Romanov, respectively (P < 0.001). Superior reproduction of Romanovsired ewes was primarily due to greater fertility rate and prolificacy at each mating season and ewe age. Use of Romanov-crossbred ewes would increase fertility during spring mating, an important constraint of the sheep industry. 3asires 3alivestock production 3aanimal reproduction 3aRomanov 3adams (mothers) 3aTexel 3afemale fertility 3aspring 3areproductive traits 3acrossing 3aDorset (sheep breed) 3aFinnsheep 3aewes 0aComposite III (sheep breed) 0aMontadale (sheep breed) 0aNorthwestern Whiteface (sheep breed) 0aseasons 0aanimal breeding 0asheep breeds1 aFreking, B.

It was recently established that the new bacterium “Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum” is associated with carrot psyllid and plants affected by this insect. No other pathogens have so far been associated with T. apicalis-affected carrots, despite symptoms resembling those caused by phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas. Potential association of these pathogens with symptomatic carrots was investigated. Carrot samples and psyllids were collected in southern Finland and tested for phytoplasmas, spiroplasmas, and liberibacter by PCR. Liberibacter was detected in 5.5, 31.3, and 80% of asymptomatic samples, plants with leaf curling only, and plants with both leaf curling and discoloration, respectively. Liberibacter was also detected in 70% of the carrot psyllid samples. Only aster yellows phytoplasma (16SrI-A) was detected in 20% of carrot samples showing both leaf curling and discoloration. No phytoplasma was detected in the carrot psyllid samples. Mixed infection of both phytoplasma and liberibacter was detected in 20% of symptomatic plants. No spiroplasma was detected in plants or insects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of aster yellows phytoplasma in carrot in Finland and mixed infection of liberibacter and phytoplasma in carrot. 3aCandidatus Liberibacter 3ainsect pests 3aPsyllidae 3aAster yellows phytoplasma 3adiscoloration 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3aDaucus carota 3aSpiroplasma 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aTrioza 3apathogens 3aleaves 3amicrobial detection 3acarrots 3amixed infection 3abacteria 3aFinland 0aHemiptera 0aplants1 aLemmetty, A.1 aNissinen, A.I.1 aSengoda, V.G.1 aFisher, T.W.0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2011, v. 93, no. 3 p.697-700dEdizioni ETSx1125-46537nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/540413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4454/jpp.v93i3.12373Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/112701_Munyaneza_et_al_2011_Liberibacter_Phytoplasmas_in_carrots.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02806naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002200193245010100215300001600316500002400332500001500356520096600371650002301337650001201360650001601372650002401388650001901412650002401431650002101455650002201476650002201498650002101520650002301541650002201564650001001586650002401596651001001620653001401630653004601644700002201690700002401712700002101736700002201757700002501779700001601804773008101820852000901901856008501910856011201995930003302107945002502140946001302165961001402178655001202192IND4443349820221121125058.0101013s201009  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444334982DNAL7 a10.2979/NPJ.2010.11.3.2692doi7 a10113/488152hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aF140 0aF2001 aSmith, Forrest S.10aNotice of release of Zapata Germplasm Rio Grande clammyweed: selected class of natural germplasm  ap. 269-273.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA selected germplasm of Rio Grande clammyweed (Polanisia dodecandra (L.)

Zapata Germplasm Rio Grande clammyweed is a warm-season annual forb originating from seed collected from native plants in Dimmitt and Zapata counties of south Texas. Collections were selected based on high proportion of full seed, low levels of seed dormancy, and high seed production potential. Zapata Germplasm is a fastestablishing native plant in rangeland plantings, provides excellent habitat to butterflies and other pollinators, and produces seed eaten by a variety of game birds.

Recently, APP has been shown to bind zinc and copper, and this binding has been suggested to control APP conformation and stability. In vitro studies show that zinc ions cause β-amyloid protein to form plaques resembling the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This suggests a role for zinc and/or copper in the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (100 ± 10 g) were fed diets containing 5, 35, or 350 μg zinc/g diet, and 1.5, 3 or 6 μg copper/g diet for 6 weeks. Brain APP expression was determined by using Western blots. Proteins were separated on 8.5% SDS-PAGE, and the APP immunoreactive species were detected by using anti-Alzheimer precursor protein A4 clone 22C11. Alterations in dietary zinc and copper significantly (P < 0.05) affected ceruloplasmin, red blood cell and extracellular superoxide dismutase activities, and tissue mineral concentrations. Although brain zinc concentrations were 13% lower (P < 0.005) in animals fed low dietary zinc than in animals fed high dietary zinc, and brain copper concentrations were 11% lower (P < 0.0001) in animals fed low dietary copper than in animals fed high dietary copper, there were no significant differences in the expression of APP among the different dietary treatments. Therefore, it seems that dietary zinc and copper do not affect APP expression in the rat brain. 3azinc 3acopper 3afood intake 3abrain 3aanimal proteins 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aenzyme activity 3arats 3aAlzheimer disease 0abeta-amyloid precursor protein0 tJournal of trace elements in experimental medicine.g1997, v.  10, no.  4 p.249-258x1520-670X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-670X(1997)10:4<249::AID-JTRA6>3.0.CO;2-43Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/451233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101105b20101204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/11/05  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03744naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001800158245011300176300001600289500002400305500001500329520205500344650001402399650002702413650001802440650003002458650001202488650001202500650002302512650002402535650002002559650001902579650001702598650002202615650001202637650001602649650002002665653002402685653002602709653001802735653001102753653002402764653001602788700002502804700001502829700002202844773007302866852000902939856011202948930003303060945002503093946001103118961001303129655001203142IND4447324920221119190611.0110110e200211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444732492DNAL7 a10113/472892hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF110 0aF4001 aScorza, Ralph10aTesting a microsatellite marker for selection of columnar growth habit in peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch]  ap. 285-289.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTree fruit breeding requires large numbers of seedlings in the field for selection. These trees occupy large land areas and are expensive to maintain. Most seedlings are discarded, thus the investment in these trees is lost. Selection in the greenhouse would spare much of this expense. Marker-assisted selection offers this possibility. A microsatellite marker was tested for selection of columnar (also termed “pillar" or “broomy”) growth habit (brbr). Columnar trees are being tested for highdensity production systems. Seventy-five genotypes were used for this study. These included compact (CT), dwarf (DW), standard (ST), and 2 sources of columnar; showy-flowered (SFP) with small, melting-, white-flesh fruit, and non-showy flowered (NSP) with large, non-melting-, yellow-flesh fruit. The microsatellite marker pchgms1 has been previously assigned a position 12.5 cM from the br locus in SFP trees. Using pchgms1 in this study, 2 fragments were obtained. One fragment was present only in SFP trees, the other was present in all other trees, including NSP. Hybrids of SFP with NSP and with all other growth habits contained both fragments. These results indicate that trees heterozygous for SFP can be selected, using pchgms1. At the seedling stage, prior to field planting, ST seedlings (BrBr) cannot be readily distinguished from trees heterozygous for br based on morphological traits. The efficiency of breeding programs developing brbr (columnar) or heterozygous Brbr (upright) trees could be improved by discarding ST trees prior to field planting. Using pchgms1, trees carrying the columnar trait, homozygous or heterozygous, could be selected from crosses using SFP as a parent. While this study demonstrates the usefulness of a satellite marker for selecting columnar growth habit in peach, the AFRS breeding program is utilizing NSP for cultivar development because of its higher fruit quality. The development of a microsatellite marker specifically for NSP or for both SFP and NSP sources of columnar growth habit is underway. 3acultivars 3amicrosatellite repeats 3atree breeding 3amarker-assisted selection 3ahybrids 3apeaches 3aplant architecture 3agenetic improvement 3agene expression 3aPrunus persica 3agrowth habit 3agenetic variation 3adensity 3afruit trees 3agenetic markers 0abroomy growth habit 0acolumnar growth habit 0afruits (food) 0atraits 0apillar growth habit 0atree fruits1 aMelnicenco, Ludmilla1 aDang, Phat1 aAbbott, Albert G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 592 p.285-289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/472893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110118b20110205c00000000  aINDdLYNe2011/01/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04059naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132024002100164040001800185100001600203245010300219300002000322500002400342506007600366520127400442506003701716650002801753650002301781650001401804650002201818650002501840650001101865650001801876650001401894650002401908650001201932650003401944650002301978650003302001650003702034650007302071650005102144650003702195650001802232650004702250650003002297650001002327650001202337650002802349650004502377650003402422650002202456650008502478650002302563650003402586650002402620653001202644653002802656700001602684700001502700700001802715700001602733700001802749700001902767700001702786700001602803773014702819852000902966856008202975856011203057930003303169945001303202946001303215961001303228655001203241IND2331709120221207065208.0030401e20021126dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233170912DNAL7 a124386852pmid7 aPMC1377222pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2523395992doi7 a10113/137822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeeusen, T.10aIdentification in Drosophila melanogaster of the invertebrate G protein-coupled FMRFamide receptor  ap. 15363-15368.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe here describe the cloning and characterization of the functionally active Drosophila melanogaster (Drm) FMRFamide receptor, which we designated as DrmFMRFa-R. The full-length ORF of a D. melanogaster orphan receptor, CG 2114 (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project), was cloned from genomic DNA. This receptor is distantly related to mammalian thyroid-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone receptors and to a set of Caenorhabditis elegans orphan receptors. An extract of 5,000 central nervous systems from the related but bigger flesh fly, Neobellieria bullata (Neb), was used to screen cells expressing the orphan receptor. Successive purification steps, followed by MS, revealed the sequence of two previously uncharacterized endogenous peptides, APPQPSDNFIRFamide (Neb-FIRFamide) and pQPSQDFMRFamide (Neb-FMRFamide). These are reminiscent of other insect FMRFamide peptides, having neurohormonal as well as neurotransmitter functions. Nanomolar concentrations of the Drm FMRFamides (DPKQDFMRFamide, TPAEDFMRFamide, SDNFMRFamide, SPKQDFMRFamide, and PDNFMRFamide) activated the cognate receptor in a dose-dependent manner. To our knowledge, the cloned DrmFMRFa-R is the first functionally active FMRFamide G protein-coupled receptor described in invertebrates to date.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aSarcophaga bullata 3areceptors 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamides 3aneuropeptides 3abioassays 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCalcium Signalingxphysiology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxphysiology 2aGenes, Insect 2aInsect Hormonesxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aInvertebratesxphysiology 2aLarva 2aLigands 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeuropeptidesxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aOrgan Specificity 2aReceptors, Invertebrate Peptidexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 0aligands 0amolecular sequence data1 aMertens, I.1 aClynen, E.1 aBaggerman, G.1 aNichols, R.1 aNachman, R.J.1 aHuybrechts, R.1 aLoof, A. de.1 aSchoofs, L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Nov. 26, v.  99, no.  24 p.15363-15368x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2523395993Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/137823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02387naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003000110024002100140040001800161072000900179072000900188100001700197245007300214300001800287500020700305500002400512520062400536650001301160650001801173650001601191650001401207650002001221650002301241650002401264650001401288650002101302650001201323650001301335650004601348650006701394650001901461650001401480653001301494773007701507852000901584856008001593856011201673930003301785945001301818946001301831961001301844655001201857IND2196875320221120105705.0990205e199808  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219687532DNAL7 a97060902pmid7 a10.1093/ps/77.8.11972doi7 a10113/343532hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aWitter, R.L.10aControl strategies for Marek's disease: a perspective for the future  ap. 1197-1203.  aPaper presented at the symposium "Infectious Poultry Diseases" held August 2-3, 1997, in Athens, Georgia, sponsored by the Poultry Science Association and the American Association of Avian Pathologists.  aIncludes references  aMarek's disease virus is an evolving pathogen, acquiring virulence in response to increasingly effective vaccines.

Various conditions prevail that currently limit the potential to develop suitable long-term solutions. A new paradigm based on reduction of early exposure, multiple levels of host resistance, and improved cooperation among stakeholders is proposed for consideration. 3achickens 3aMarek disease 3avaccination 3avirulence 3adisease control 3astrain differences 3avaccine development 3abiosafety 3apoultry industry 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aHerpesviridaeximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aMarek Diseaseximmunologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aViral Vaccines 2aVirulence 0aefficacy0 tPoultry science.g1998 Aug., v.  77, no.  8 p.1197-1203x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/77.8.11973Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/343533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091007b20091106c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02939naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100002200196245008800218300001800306500002400324520136500348650002301713650002501736650003101761650001801792650001801810650002101828650002701849650001401876650003201890650002101922650001101943651000901954653002601963700001801989700002202007773011402029852000902143856011202152856008802264930003302352945002502385946001102410961001202421655001202433IND4406178420221120204332.0080530e20080615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440617842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2008.01.0572doi7 a10113/213112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aX100 0aK5901 aPourreza, Morteza10aSustainability of wild pistachio (Pistacia atlantica Desf.) in Zagros forests, Iran  ap. 3667-3671.  aIncludes references  aWild pistachio (Pistacia atlantica Desf.) is the most economically important tree species in many rural areas in the west of Iran. The species produces resin used for a wide variety of traditional uses. Because the resin can be harvested non-destructively, the trees are maintained until mortality occurs from natural causes. The result is that natural, managed stands include a variety of age classes. In recent years, a lack of smaller size classes has been observed in the Qalajeh forest, which is located in the Zagros Mountain region of western Iran. We established a series of plots in an area typical of Qalajeh forest to characterize the diameter distribution of the wild pistachio component. We confirmed a deficit of stems <30cmdbh, based in the expectation that the landscape-level diameter distribution should be characterized by a negative exponential curve. For trees >=30cmdbh, de Liocourt's equation closely fit the diameter distribution (r ² =0.93), translating to a q-factor of 1.34. We used this curve to estimate the deficit number of stems in diameter classes <30cm. We estimate that this forest should have 19-24wildpistachiotrees/ha in the 5-25cm classes, as compared to about 5trees/ha found currently. Based on local conditions, we recommend that at least 30seedlings/ha should be planted to allow 6-8 trees to reach to the 5cm class. 3aPistacia atlantica 3asustainable forestry 3asustained yield management 3aforest stands 3aage structure 3astand management 3auneven-aged management 3aequations 3atree and stand measurements 3aforest inventory 3aresins 3aIran 0adiameter distribution1 aShaw, John D.1 aZangeneh, Hoshang0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 June 15, v.  255, no.  11 p.3667-3671dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/213113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.01.0573Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/10  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03370naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001900149245016300168300001800331500002400349520179600373650002502169650002002194650001102214650002602225650002202251650002302273650001602296650001002312650001702322650000902339700001502348700002102363700002702384700001502411700003502426700001802461700002202479700002002501700002402521773010202545856011202647930003302759945002502792946001302817961001302830852000902843655001202852IND4444204920221118020506.0101028e199711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444420492DNAL7 a10113/451242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aT3001 aLynch, Sean M.10aVascular superoxide dismutase deficiency impairs endothelial vasodilator function through direct inactivation of nitric oxide and increased lipid peroxidation  ap. 2975-2981.  aIncludes references  aNitric oxide (NO) and superoxide are both constitutive products of the endothelium. Because NO is readily inactivated by superoxide, the bioactivity of endothelium-derived NO (EDNO) is dependent on local activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). We examined the effects of chronic inhibition of copper-zinc SOD (CuZnSOD) using a rat model of dietary copper restriction. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a Cu-deficient diet and received either no Cu replacement (Cu-deficient) or Cu in the drinking water (Cu-sufficient). Compared with Cu-sufficient animals, Cu-deficiency was associated with a 68% reduction in CuZnSOD activity and a 58% increase in vascular superoxide as estimated by lucigenin chemiluminescence (both P<.05). Compared with Cu-sufficient animals, arterial relaxation in the thoracic aorta from Cu-deficient animals was 10-fold less sensitive to acetylcholine, a receptor-dependent EDNO agonist, but only 1.5-fold less sensitive to A23187, a receptor-independent EDNO agonist, and only 1.25-fold less sensitive to authentic NO (all P<.05). In contrast, acute inhibition of CuZnSOD with 10 mM diethyldithiocarbamate produced a more uniform reduction in sensitivity to acetylcholine (8-fold), A23187 (10-fold), and NO (4-fold; all P<.001). Cu-deficient animals demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in plasma-esterified F2-isoprostanes, a stable marker of lipid peroxidation, that correlated inversely with arterial relaxation to acetylcholine (R=-.83; P<.0009) but not A23187 or authentic NO. From these findings, we conclude that chronic inhibition of CuZnSOD inhibits EDNO-mediated arterial relaxation through two mechanisms, one being direct inactivation of NO and the other being lipid peroxidation that preferentially interrupts receptor-mediated stimulation of EDNO. 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aenzyme activity 3acopper 3anutrient deficiencies 3along term effects 3alipid peroxidation 3aendothelium 3aaorta 3avasodilation 3arats1 aFrei, Balz1 aMorrow, Jason D.1 aRoberts, L.

Exogenously provided abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA) promoted mycelial growth, suggesting the ability of the pathogen to metabolize plant hormones. ABA, IAA, JA, and SA were found endogenously in the mycelium and in the fruiting body of the pathogen. The pathogen contained high amounts of SA in the mycelium (0.5±0.04 μg g-1 DW) and IAA (2±0.6 μg g-1 DW) in the basidiocarps. Growth of the mycelium in the presence of host leaves for 10 days did not affect ABA or JA content of the leaves but IAA and SA increased 2.5- and 11-fold, respectively. The amounts of IAA and SA in infected leaves increased beyond the levels of the uninfected leaves and suggest a synergistic response to host-pathogen interaction. The ability of M. perniciosa to produce and sustain growth in the presence of elevated endogenous IAA and SA levels during colonization indicates that these phytohormones contribute to its pathogenicity. 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ajasmonic acid 3aTheobroma cacao 3apathogenicity 3awitches' broom 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asalicylic acid 3aabscisic acid 3aMoniliophthora perniciosa 3aindole acetic acid 2aBasidiomycotaxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aCacaoxmicrobiology 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 0aauxins 0aMoniliophthora1 aBailey, B.A.1 aHasenstein, K.H.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2007 Sept., v.  274, no.  2 p.238-2447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/27753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00837.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/09/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02241naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168072000900177100001700186245010400203300001600307500002400323500001500347520072000362650002501082650001501107650001001122650001801132650003001150650002301180650001001203650002101213650002601234650001901260650001501279653002001294653001601314653001101330700001401341700001601355773007201371852000901443856008701452856011201539930003301651945001301684946001301697961001301710655001201723IND2202485520221120235255.0000210e199907  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220248552DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.1999.76.4.5732doi7 a10113/233112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ2041 aDowell, F.E.10aPredicting scab, vomitoxin, and ergosterol in single wheat kernels using near-infrared spectroscopy  ap. 573-576.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aNear-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to detect scab damage and estimate deoxynivalenol (DON) and ergosterol levels in single wheat kernels. Results showed that all scab-damaged kernels identified by official inspectors were correctly identified by NIRS. In addition, this system identified more kernels with DON than did a visual inspection. DON and ergosterol were predicted with standard errors of approximately equal to 40 and 100 ppm, respectively. All samples with visible scab had single kernels with DON levels > 120 ppm, and some kernels contained > 700 ppm of DON. This technology may provide a means of rapidly screening samples for potential food safety and quality problems related to scab damage. 3aFusarium graminearum 3aergosterol 3aseeds 3afood analysis 3afungal diseases of plants 3afood contamination 3awheat 3afood composition 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3adeoxynivalenol 3aprediction 0aGibberella zeae 0afood safety 0adamage1 aRam, M.S.1 aSeitz, L.M.0 tCereal chemistry.g1999 , v.  76, no.  4 p.573-576x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.1999.76.4.5733Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/233113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090205b20090301c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03149naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002000149245009400169300001600263500002400279500001500303520173200318650002002050650001102070650001002081650001202091650002302103650002202126650001902148650001702167650001202184650001002196650001602206650001202222653002102234653001702255653002502272653002402297653001602321700001802337773007302355852000902428856011202437930003302549945002502582946001102607961001302618655001202631IND4447325020221119190621.0110110e200211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444732502DNAL7 a10113/472902hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF4001 aMiller, Stephen10aTraining and performance of pillar, upright, and standard form peach trees--early results  ap. 391-399.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPeach production in the U.S. relies on standard size trees on vigorous, seedling rootstocks grown at low-densities (<or= 297 trees/ha). Production per hectare is low. Peach tree growth habits, such as pillar (P) (columnar canopy shape) and upright (U), can be planted in high-density systems with the potential for increased production per hectare. Pillar and upright, advanced breeding selections, and standard (S) (‘Harrow Beauty’) trees on ‘Lovell’ rootstock were planted at 4 densities (135 trees/ha to 1112 trees/ha) and trained to a central leader (CL) or multiple leader (ML) form. Trees were dormant pruned and trained, then summer pruned (SP) in the first growing season after fall planting. One-half of the trees were SP in the second growing season after dormant pruning. Growth habit affected trunk and canopy size after two growing seasons. SP reduced canopy spread. Dormant CL training after one growing season required more time than ML training for all growth habits, however, the difference was greater for U and P trees (110% more time) than for S trees (39%). Branch spreading with training aids contributed to the greater training time for CL trees. Summer pruning increased light levels in the lower canopy with the greatest effect in S and U trees. Yields in the second leaf were greater for ML trained trees than CL trees. SP reduced the yield of U trees but not S or P trees. Based on these data and observations of U and P peach trees growing on a deep, well-drained fertile site, it appears that pruning and training of P and U trees to conform to a specific form may result in excessive tree vigor. Reduced early training to allow for expression of the natural growth habit may be preferable. 3acrop production 3acanopy 3avigor 3apeaches 3aplant architecture 3atraining (plants) 3aPrunus persica 3agrowth habit 3apruning 3ashape 3afruit trees 3adensity 0afruit production 0aplant growth 0aupright growth habit 0apillar growth habit 0atree fruits1 aScorza, Ralph0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 592 p.391-399x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/472903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110118b20110205c00000000  aINDdLYNe2011/01/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02946naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100001900205245006800224300001800292500002400310500001500334520119000349650001701539650001901556650001301575650003201588650002401620650001801644650003001662650002001692650002201712650002101734650001901755650002301774653001501797653003001812653001501842653001401857653002001871700001701891700002401908700002001932773011401952852000902066856011202075856008802187930003302275945002502308946001102333961001202344655001202356IND4406786120221120214536.0080613e20080630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440678612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2008.03.0402doi7 a10113/213142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF300 0aK250 0aX1001 aChen, Han Y.H.10aRelative size and stand age determine Pinus banksiana mortality  ap. 3980-3984.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aTree mortality is a poorly understood process in the boreal forest. While large disturbances reset succession by killing all or most trees, background tree mortality was hypothesized to be affected by competition, ageing, and stand composition. We tested these hypotheses on jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) mortality using data from long-term repeatedly measured permanent sample plots collected between 1952 and 1989 in Ontario, Canada. The probability of mortality over a 5-year period was modeled using logistic regression with the maximum likelihood estimation employed for parameter estimation. Relative competitiveness measured as the ratio of individual tree diameter at breast height (DBH) to mean stand DBH explained more variation in mortality than stand age did. Mortality increased rapidly with decreasing DBH ratio. A U-shaped mortality pattern with stand age was found while stand composition had no effect on mortality. Developed by using a residual sequential regression approach, our final mixed-effects model with a 81% model correctness of mortality prediction conclusively demonstrated that relative competitiveness is the key determinant for jack pine mortality. 3aforest trees 3aboreal forests 3atree age 3atree and stand measurements 3aregression analysis 3aforest stands 3ainterspecific competition 3aPinus banksiana 3astand composition 3astand basal area 3atree mortality 3astatistical models 0asenescence 0adiameter at breast height 0abasal area 0astand age 0acompetitiveness1 aFu, Songling1 aMonserud, Robert A.1 aGillies, Ian C.0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 June 30, v.  255, no.  12 p.3980-3984dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/213143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.03.0403Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/07  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03228naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138072000900156100002100165245009400186300001800280500002300298520177700321592002802098650001102126650002602137650001702163650001702180650001602197650001802213650001702231650000902248653002102257653001502278700002102293700002302314700002302337773014302360852000902503856011202512856007502624930003302699945002502732961001302757655001202770IND4446630320221120202740.0101221e20081017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444663032DNAL7 a10.1139/H08-0912doi7 a10113/467432hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aFalcone, Jeff C.10aEndothelial cell-derived nitric oxide mobilization is attenuated in copper-deficient rats  ap. 1073-1078.  aSummary in French.  aThe attenuation of endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO) mediated vasodilation is a consistent finding in both conduit and resistance vessels during dietary copper (Cu) deficiency. Although the effect is well established, evidence for the mechanism remains circumstantial. This study was designed to determine the relative amount of NO produced in and released from the vascular endothelium. Using the fluorescent NO indicator, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM), we now demonstrate the effect of a Cu-deficient diet on the production of NO from the endothelium of resistance arterioles. In one group of experiments, control and Cu-chelated lung microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) were used to assay NO production and fluorescence was observed by confocal microscopy. Weanling Sprague–Dawley rats were fed purified diets that were either Cu adequate (6.3 micrograms Cu per gram of food) or Cu deficient (0.3 micrograms Cu per gram of food) for 4 weeks. In the second series of experiments, first-order arterioles were microsurgically isolated from the rat cremaster muscle, cannulated, and pressurized with (3[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid) physiologic salt solution (MOPS-PSS). DAF-FM (5 µmol·L–¹) was added in the lumen of the vessel to measure NO release. Baseline DAF-FM fluorescence was significantly lower in Cu-chelated ECs than in controls. In response to 10⁻⁶ mol·L–¹ acetylcholine, fluorescent intensity was significantly less in chelated ECs and in the lumen of Cu-deficient arterioles. The results suggest that production and release of NO by the vascular endothelium is inhibited by a restriction of Cu. This inhibition may account for the attenuated vasodilation previously reported in Cu-deficient rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3anutrient deficiencies 3anitric oxide 3abiosynthesis 3aendothelium 3ablood vessels 3avasodilation 3arats 0amicrocirculation 0aarterioles1 aLominadze, David1 aJohnson, W.

The coat protein gene of GLRaV 2 was cloned into a protein expression vector pMAL-c2x and the recombinant protein, consisting of the maltose binding protein (MBP) and GLRaV 2 coat protein (CP), was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant MBP-CP was used to raise a high quality antiserum. When used in Western blot analysis, the anti-MBP-CP antiserum produced specific reaction to the recombinant protein as well as to the viral coat protein of GLRaV 2. In Immunosorbent electron microscopy study, the anti-MBP-CP antibodies strongly decorated the GLRaV 2 virions. Using the newly developed antiserum, an indirect plate-trapped antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was developed and successfully implemented for virus detection. A field survey was conducted to evaluate the virus infection status by GLRaV 2 and GLRaV 3 using antibodies developed against their respective recombinant coat proteins. 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aClosterovirus 3aelectron microscopy 3aVitis vinifera 3aWestern blotting1 aZhu, H.-Y.1 aPetrovic, N.1 aGonsalves, D.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2007 Feb., v.  155, no.  2 p.65-69dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2007.01179.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/29143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070816b20070902c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02295naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002100120040001800141072000900159072000900168100001700177245008200194300001600276500002400292500001500316520088400331650001601215650001901231650001301250650001401263650001401277650001101291650001101302650001801313653002701331653002901358653003201387700001801419773010501437852000901542856011201551856007801663930003301741945002501774946001301799961001301812655001201825IND8104852320221121051849.0810528e198104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND810485232DNAL7 a10.1007/BF025415932doi7 a10113/263252hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aQ1001 aKoritala, S.10aSelective conjugation of soybean esters to increase hydrogenation selectivity  ap. 553-556.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPolyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters of soybean oil (MeSBO) were selectively conjugated as a means of increasing the linolenate selectivity of various homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. Kinetics of the conjugation reaction in various solvents indicated that linolenate conjugated 5-8 times faster than linoleate. Selective conjugation of MeSBO with potassium t-butoxide in dipolar solvents resulted in an increase in linolenate hydrogenation selectivity to 7-8 with Ni and Pd heterogeneous catalysts, and to 7-10 with homogeneous and heterogeneous chromium carbonyl catalysts. Trans-unsaturation in the hydrogenated products was only 1-3% with the chromium carbonyl catalysts, in contrast to 30-39% with the heterogeneous metal catalysts. Triglycerides were readily converted to partial glycerides and t-butyl esters with the potassium t-butoxide reagent. 3asoybean oil 3alinolenic acid 3asoybeans 3acatalysts 3apalladium 3aesters 3anickel 3ahydrogenation 0afatty acid conjugation 0afatty acid methyl esters 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aKrankel, E.N.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1981 Apr., v.  58, no.  4 p.553-556x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/263253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF025415933Available from publisher's Web site  a20090309b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/03/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02444naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111024002100151040001800172072000900190100001600199245005800215300001800273500002400291520105700315650001901372650002901391650002001420650001501440650001201455650004701467650004101514650001201555650002901567700001801596773010101614852000901715856011201724856009001836930003301926945002501959946001301984961001301997655001202010IND4425298620221121002739.0090828e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529862DNAL7 a193948172pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.03.0712doi7 a10113/333892hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aSzogi, A.A.10aProspects for phosphorus recovery from poultry litter  ap. 5461-5465.  aIncludes references  aLand disposal of poultry litter is an environmental concern often associated to excess phosphorus (P) in soils and potential water pollution in regions with intense poultry production. Although poultry litter can be moved off the farm and traded as fertilizer, its transportation becomes less economical with increasing distances from the farm. Thus, new litter management alternatives are needed to reduce the environmental impact of P litter application to land. This paper summarizes established and emerging alternative technologies in the U.S. that facilitate handling, concentration, and transporting of litter P. Furthermore, it examines the potential integration of technologies into poultry litter management systems that could reduce poultry litter volume and increase P content in litter byproducts. The adoption of alternative technologies may encourage new opportunities to produce bio-energy, fertilizer, and other valuable P byproducts from poultry litter while reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainable poultry production. 3apoultry manure 3aanimal manure management 3awaste treatment 3aphosphorus 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aPhosphorusxisolation & purification 2aPoultry 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods1 aVanotti, M.B.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Nov., v.  100, no.  22 p.5461-5465dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/333893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.03.0713Available from publisher's Web site  a20090921b20091106c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/09/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02784naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001500149245009800164300001300262500002400275500001500299520102200314650001801336650001601354650001601370650002501386650000901411650001301420650000901433650001401442650002001456650001001476650001601486650000801502650001601510650005301526650001601579650002501595650002301620650001501643650001901658650001701677651001801694653001001712653004001722653001101762653002001773653000901793653001901802700001801821700001301839773008901852852000901941856011201950930003302062945001302095946001302108961001302121655001202134IND2164173820221121020336.0980921s1997    dcu|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND216417382DNAL7 a10113/291402hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT3001 aEnns, C.W.10aTrends in food and nutrient intakes by adults: NFCS 1977-78, CSFII 1989-91, and CSFII 1994-95  ap. 2-15.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aEvaluations of diet quality and tracking changes in the diet over time have many useful applications, including policy formation, program planning, and targeting appropriate nutrition education messages.

However, the impacts of pyrolysis biochar on the soil system need to be assessed before initiating large scale biochar applications to agricultural fields. We compared CO2 respiration, nitrous oxide (N2O) production, methane (CH4) oxidation and herbicide retention and transformation through laboratory incubations at field capacity in a Minnesota soil (Waukegan silt loam) with and without added biochar. CO2 originating from the biochar needs to be subtracted from the soil–biochar combination in order to elucidate the impact of biochar on soil respiration. After this correction, biochar amendments reduced CO2 production for all amendment levels tested (2, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60% w/w; corresponding to 24–720 t ha -1 field application rates). In addition, biochar additions suppressed N2O production at all levels. However, these reductions were only significant at biochar amendment levels >20% w/w. Biochar additions also significantly suppressed ambient CH4 oxidation at all levels compared to unamendedsoil. The addition of biochar (5% w/w) to soil increased the sorption of atrazine and acetochlor compared to non-amended soils, resulting in decreased dissipation rates of these herbicides. The recalcitrance of the biochar suggests that it could be a viable carbon sequestration strategy, and might provide substantial net greenhouse gas benefits if the reductions in N2O production are lasting. 3aatrazine 3asoil amendments 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil respiration 3agas emissions 3asilt loam soils 3aapplication rate 3acarbon dioxide 3asoil pollution 3asoil microorganisms 3aoxidation 3aacetochlor 3awood chips 3adenitrification 3aadsorption 3anitrous oxide 3aherbicide residues 3amethane 3apyrolysis 2aAdsorption 2aAtrazinexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCarbon Dioxidexchemistry 2aCharcoalxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGasesxchemistry 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aHerbicidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMethanexchemistry 2aNitrous Oxidexchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSoil 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aToluidinesxchemistryxmetabolism. 3aMinnesota 0aMinnesota 0acharcoal1 aKoskinen, W.C.1 aBaker, J.M.1 aReicosky, D.C.0 tChemosphere.g2009 Oct., v.  77, no.  4 p.574-581x0045-65357nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/377223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.06.0533Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/22  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01995naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013700169300001600306520061300322592002800935596005700963596005301020650002501073650001701098650001501115650001101130650001201141650001301153650001301166650001901179650001401198650002201212651001501234700005801249700001701307700002001324700002201344773011501366856008301481852000901564655001201573IND60767713020221119093057.0220221e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076771302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-021-01593-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManome, Teruhisa10aThannilignan glucoside and 2-(β-glucopyranosyl)-3-isoxazolin-5-one derivative, two new compounds isolated from Terminalia bellirica  ap. 482-489.  aTwo new compounds, thannilignan 9-O-β-glucoside (1) and 2-(β-glucopyranosyl)-3-isoxazolin-5-one derivative (2), and seven known compounds were isolated from the methanol extract of Terminalia bellirica leaves, collected in Bangladesh.

UBR5 is highly upregulated in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), whereas its expression decreases with differentiation, suggesting a role for UBR5 in ESC function. However, little is known about how UBR5 regulates ESC identity. Here, we define the protein interactome of UBR5 in ESCs and find interactions with distinct components of the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, which is required for proper maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Notably, loss of UBR5 induces an abnormal accumulation of rRNA processing intermediates, resulting in diminished ribosomal levels. Consequently, lack of UBR5 triggers an increase in p53 levels and a concomitant decrease in cellular proliferation rates. Thus, our results indicate a link between UBR5 and rRNA maturation.  aPublisher supplied data  aCECADcDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aVI742/1‐2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3abiogenesis 3acell proliferation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aribonucleoproteins 3aribosomal RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aGerbracht, Jennifer V.1 aKoyuncu, Seda1 aLee, Hyun Ju1 aHorn, Moritz1 aKroef, Virginia1 aDenzel, Martin S.1 aDieterich, Christoph1 aGehring, Niels H.1 aVilchez, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0801-07430 tFEBS letters.g2020 Jan., v. 594, no. 1 p.175-188dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005300164300001600217520117400233592002801407650002501435650001701460650001501477650003301492650001101525650001301536700001401549700001601563700001801579700001701597700001801614773014301632856008101775852000901856655001201865IND60465777020221122231201.0151123e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046577702DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-015-0009-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jingwei14aThe processes of graft union formation in tomato  ap. 569-574.  aDespite the long and widespread use of grafting in tomato cultivation, the structural changes that occur at the graft union during the early stages of the union remain poorly understood. In this study, the structural development of the graft union in tomato plants was examined 3, 5, 8, 11 and 14 days after grafting (DAG) using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a paraffin sectioning technique. The paraffin-sectioned images of the transection revealed that parenchymal cells from the graft union divided and proliferated in most combinations, and these cells could be detected at various stages of development. The SEM images of the scion and rootstock longitudinal sections showed that many interconnecting structures appeared at 8 DAG and were followed by a vascular rearrangement that did not connect the scion and rootstock. Vascular bundle bridges appeared at 11 DAG and connected the scion and rootstock. The connection of graft union between rootstock and scion is influenced by the plant growth condition. In our managed environment, period for formation of the connection structure formation between the rootstock and scion was 7-14 days after grafting.  aPublisher supplied data 3adevelopmental stages 3aplant growth 3arootstocks 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ascions 3atomatoes1 aYang, Rui1 aLi, Xiaoman1 aZhao, Wenchao1 aZhao, Fukuan1 aWang, Shaohui0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 56, no. 5 p.569-574dKorean Society for Horticultural Sciencex2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-015-0009-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05790naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012100165500001900286520370600305592002804011650002004039650001204059650002104071650002004092650001404112650001804126650002504144650001604169650001004185650002604195650001604221650001304237650001104250650003304261650001104294650001304305650001304318650001204331650001304343650001804356650001104374650001304385650001304398650001104411650001704422650001604439650001004455650002104465650001604486651001104502651001004513651001004523651001004533651001604543651000904559651001304568651001504581651001104596651001104607653001404618653002304632653001304655700001304668700001704681700001504698700001404713700001904727700005404746773010404800856008304904852000904987655001204996IND60719241520221118011435.0201201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071924152DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-02-20-0305-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSigillo, L.10aFirst Report of Pythium spinosum as a Causal Agent of Crown and Root Rot in Greenhouse Cucumber Cultivation in Italy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe origin of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) has been attributed to Africa, China, India, or the Near East. Cucumbers are now grown throughout the world using fields or greenhouse culture. In Italy, cucumbers are mainly cultivated in Sicily and central-northern Italy. During the spring of 2019, in the province of Latina (central Italy), mature cucumber plants of variety Ekron F1 grown in a greenhouse showed symptoms of yellowing and wilting of the leaves and brown necrosis on roots. The estimated severity of the disease in the greenhouse was 15% of plants. Fragments of symptomatic tissues cut from the root lesions were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 50 ppm of chloramphenicol and 50 ppm of streptomycin at 24 ± 2°C incubation temperature. A Pythium species was consistently isolated from semiselective medium with heavy aerial mycelia, and three pure cultures were obtained by hyphal tip transfers on PDA for further investigations. Main hyphae were nonseptate, globose or limoniform, thin-walled, ranging in size from 2.7 to 4.8 μm in diameter with terminal and intercalary hyphal swellings. Hyphae occasionally had two to three digitate protuberances. Oogonia were produced terminally, globose, and 15 to 20 μm in diameter. Oospores were plerotic, rarely aplerotic, thin-walled, and 16 to 19 μm wide. On the basis of morphological features, the isolates were identified as Pythium spinosum Sawada (Sawada and Chen 1926). The identity was confirmed by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence with 99% homology with KU208359 and by cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene with 99% homology with HQ708835 GenBank sequence. The sequences of the three isolates (CREADC-Om303, 304, and 305) were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MN988848, MN988849, and MN988850 and numbers MN990462, MN990463, and MN990464 for ITS and COI, respectively. Pathogenicity tests were conducted in the greenhouse on variety Ekron F1 plants at the third to fourth leaf stage (Sinclair and Dhingra 1985). For each isolate, 10 plants were inoculated with a 5-mm mycelial plug cut from the margins of actively growing 4-day-old PDA cultures. Plugs were inserted through the epidermis to the phloem at the collar level and wrapped in parafilm to prevent dehydration and contamination. Five plants were used as controls and inoculated as described above using a sterile PDA plugs. Inoculated plants were kept under controlled conditions (humidity of 70%; 12-h/12-h day/night photoperiod) in a greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C. After 1 week all inoculated plants showed stem necrotic streaks extending downward to the crown and roots. Most of the plants died, after developing symptoms like those originally observed on plants naturally infected, thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates. Control plants remained symptomless. Oomycete colonies isolated from the lesions and cultured on PDA morphologically resembled the inoculated isolates. P. spinosum has been shown to cause damping-off and root rot of many plants. It was originally isolated from snapdragon seedlings in Taiwan (Sawada and Chen 1926). It is a cosmopolitan species. It has been associated with damping-off of watermelon in the United States (Middleton 1943), on pumpkin in Queensland, Australia (Teakle 1960), and with vine decline of cucumber in Oman (Al-Sadi et al. 2011). More recently, P. spinosum has been associated with root rot of chili in Pakistan (Nawaz et al. 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. spinosum as the causal agent of crown and root rot of cucumber plants in Italy. More careful water management in the greenhouse would avoid the occurrence of Pythium root rot in this crop system production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aLatinos 3aPythium spinosum 3achloramphenicol 3acucumbers 3aculture media 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adamping off 3agenes 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3ahumidity 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amycelium 3anecrosis 3aoogonia 3aoospores 3apathogenicity 3aphloem 3apumpkins 3aroot rot 3aspring 3astreptomycin 3atemperature 3avines 3awater management 3awatermelons 3aAfrica 3aChina 3aIndia 3aItaly 3aMiddle East 3aOman 3aPakistan 3aQueensland 3aSicily 3aTaiwan 0aoomycetes 0apathogen detection 0acucumber1 aPane, C.1 aGaraguso, I.1 aLuongo, L.1 aGalli, M.1 aValente, M.

This novel method enables the controlled synthesis of any given diastereomer of the 1,3-diamine scaffold from a simple set of starting materials in a highly modular manner. The disclosed approach is based on the reaction of an enamide with an in situ generated N-acylimine followed by a subsequent trapping of the generated intermediate with a suitable nucleophile. By careful choice of starting materials, reagents, and reaction conditions, each stereocenter can be constructed in a highly selective fashion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3achemical reactions 3adiastereomers 3aorganic compounds 3atrapping1 aBolte, Michael1 aBats, Jan1 aManolikakes, Georg0 tOrganic letters.g2017 Feb. 03, v. 19, no. 3 p.674-677dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.orglett.6b038413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008500172300001200257520148700269592002801756650002301784650001401807650002301821650002001844650001201864650002701876650002001903650001401923650001501937650000901952650002201961650001801983650001802001650003002019650002002049650001602069650001102085650001202096653001202108653001802120653000902138653001602147653001602163700002502179773010802204856008702312852000902399655001202408IND60614421920221120041028.0200503e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061442192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrassard, Julie13aAn efficient recovery method for enteric viral particles from agricultural soils  ap. 1-5.  aEnteric viruses have been recognized as the leading cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis and hepatitis outbreaks around the world. Understanding their prevalence and persistence in the environment is important for the effective control of these infections. The aim of this study was to develop an efficient recovery procedure for viral infectious particles from agricultural soils. Samples (25 g) of soil (black earth soil, loamy soil, and sandy soil) were spiked with murine norovirus (MNV) and feline calicivirus (FCV), mixed with five different buffers and viral genetic material was extracted by 3 commercial kits. The combination consisted by the modified Eagle’s medium buffer followed by Dynabeads nucleic acid extraction kit, when the detection is conducted by molecular biology, has been identified as being the most effective procedure to preserve the viral particle infectivity and also to remove PCR inhibitors. The recovery percentages of infectious MNV for the 3 types of soils were 54.3%, 54.4%, and 56.9%. In contrast, the titres of the FCV varied depending on the type of soil, and the recovery percentages were 47.8% in the black soil, 15.6% in the loamy soil, and 17.7% in the sandy soil. Also, the results presented in this study highlight the importance of using an internal process control such as artificial inoculation with MNV at known concentrations during detection by molecular methods, in order to avoid the occurrence of false negative reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFeline calicivirus 3aNorovirus 3aagricultural soils 3aanalytical kits 3abuffers 3afalse negative results 3agastroenteritis 3ahepatitis 3aloam soils 3amice 3amolecular biology 3anucleic acids 3apathogenicity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprocess control 3asandy soils 3avirion 3aviruses 0aViruses 0aRapid methods 0aSoil 0aFood safety 0aAgriculture1 aGagné, Marie-Josée0 tJournal of virological methods.g2018 Nov., v. 261 p.1-5dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008800161300001600249520130900265592002801574650000801602650002001610650002201630650001201652650000901664650002301673650001201696650000901708650001701717650000901734651001101743700001901754773012901773856007401902852000901976655001201985IND60662119120221120131311.0190904e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066211912DNAL7 a10.1039/c3em30864b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolnár, Péter,10aContribution to PM₂.₅ from domestic wood burning in a small community in Sweden  ap. 833-838.  aBiomass burning for domestic heating has increased in many countries with cold climates in recent years. This paper presents and compares two ways of estimating the contribution of particulate matter (PM₂.₅) to ambient air from local domestic wood burning, using daily stationary parallel PM₂.₅ measurements in a wood-burning area and at a reference location. In the first method (based on air mass back trajectories), daily gravimetric PM₂.₅ mass differences were compared between the two stations for days with low contributions from regional sources. In the second method, 28 filters from each location were chemically analysed, and source contributions were calculated using positive matrix factorisation (PMF). The trajectory method estimated the extra local contribution from domestic wood burning in the wood-burning area to be 0.7–1.1 μg m⁻³, while the PMF method gave a contribution of 0.64 μg m⁻³. With the PMF method, the total contribution to ambient air from local domestic wood burning was estimated to be 25% of the total PM₂.₅ mass. The estimated mass contribution using the trajectory method gave a result similar to that of the PMF method, and the method can therefore be a time- and cost-effective first step, especially when no chemical analysis is possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass burning 3achemical analysis 3aclimate 3acold 3acost effectiveness 3afilters 3aheat 3aparticulates 3awood 3aSweden1 aSallsten, Gerd0 tEnvironmental science.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 15, no. 4 p.833-838dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em30864b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245006600173300001100239500001100250520113800261592002801399596008601427650001201513650001701525650001301542650001201555700006101567773011201628856008301740852000901823655001201832IND60767713420221119093051.0220315e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076771342DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-021-00251-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeercy, Bradford E.,10aDo oscillations in pancreatic islets require pacemaker cells?  ap. 14.  aReview  aThe pancreatic islets of Langerhans are biomedically important because they are home to the beta cells that secrete insulin and are hence important for understanding diabetes. They are also an important case study for the mechanisms of bursting oscillations and how these oscillations emerge from the electrical coupling of highly heterogeneous cells. Early work has pointed to a voting/democratic paradigm, where the islet properties are a nonlinear average of the cell properties, with no ‘conductor leading the orchestra’. Recent experimental work has uncovered new facets of this heterogeneity, and has identified small world networks dominated by a small subset of cells with a high degree of functional connectivity, assessed via correlations of calcium oscillations. It has also been suggested that these connectivity hubs act as pacemakers necessary for islet oscillations. We reviewed modeling studies that have confirmed the existence of small worldness, and we did not find evidence for obligatory pacemakers. We conclude that democracy rather than oligarchy remains the most likely organizing principle of the islets.  aPublisher supplied data  aZ01 DK013027-14cNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 3acalcium 3acase studies 3adiabetes 3ainsulin1 aSherman, Arthur S1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8372-59410 tJournal of biosciences.g2022 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.14-14dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-021-00251-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003000144245018000174300001600354520139200370592002801762650002501790650002701815650002701842650003101869650002901900650001601929650001601945650002501961650003801986650001902024650001302043650003702056650000902093651002102102653002702123653002902150653001302179653002902192653001902221700002802240700003002268700002102298700001902319773011302338856007902451852000902530655001202539IND60610068720221120163458.0180831e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061006872DNAL7 a10.2478/aopf-2018-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathirana, Hansani N.K.S.10aAntibacterial activity of lime (Citrus aurantifolia) essential oil and limonene against fish pathogenic bacteria isolated from cultured olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)  ap. 131-139.  aThe antibacterial activity of lime (Citrus aurantifolia) essential oil (LEO) and limonene was tested against seven Gram-negative and nine Gram-positive fish pathogenic bacteria isolated from cultured olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (Temminck & Schlegel) in Korea. Limonene was >99% concentrated and LEO consisted of eleven chemical compounds including 56.22% of limonene. Disk diffusion assay, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) tests were done. LEO and limonene inhibited the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. LEO and limonene (MBC/MIC= 2-8) were both bactericidal and bacteriostatic for the strains tested. In every fish pathogenic bacteria, the inhibition zone diameter (IZD) increased in proportion to the oil concentration and the maximum effect was found at 100% (V/V) concentrations of LEO and limonene. The antibiogram pattern indicated that all the bacterial strains, excluding three strains of S. iniae (S186, S530, and S131), showed resistance to one or more antibiotics. The percentage of the relative inhibition zone diameter (RIZD %) exhibited high values at higher concentrations of all the agents. Since antibacterial activities of LEO and limonene were considerably effective against fish pathogenic bacteria, they could be used as alternatives to treat bacterial infections in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3abacterial infections 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3aessential oils 3alimonene 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoils 3aKorean Peninsula 0aantibacterial activity 0alime essential oil (LEO) 0alimonene 0afish pathogenic bacteria 0aolive flounder1 aWimalasena, Sudu H.M.P.1 aDe Silva, Benthotage C.J.1 aHossain, Sabrina1 aHeo, Gang-Joon0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2018 June 01, v. 26, no. 2 p.131-139dSciendowJournal:2133x2083-61397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aopf-2018-00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245018900174300001500363520163800378592002802016650002002044650002002064650000902084650002602093650003102119650001102150650002902161650001502190651001002205700002702215700002202242773009502264856008402359852000902443655001202452IND60113068820221121031112.0141111e20130419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011306882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.02.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGago-Ferrero, Pablo10aMulti-residue method for trace level determination of UV filters in fish based on pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatography–quadrupole-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry  ap. 93-101.  aSo far, the very few studies addressing the occurrence of UV filters (UV F) in biota showed important limitations in the analysis of the so complex biological matrices. In order to improve the knowledge on the bioaccumulation of UV F by fish, a simple and highly sensitive method was successfully developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of eight extensively used UV F and transformation products with a wide range of physicochemical properties. The present study demonstrated that liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) using a QqLIT mass analyser was applicable to the simultaneous analysis of UV F in fish. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) was chosen for the sample pretreatment due to the good extraction efficiency provided. An additional SPE clean-up step was added in order to minimize matrix effects and to improve the sensitivity. The method allowed recovery efficiencies in the range 70–112% for most compounds at the three spike levels. The low limits of detection (MLOD) achieved (0.1–6.0ng/g dw) allowed the reliable quantification of UV F residues in fish samples. The developed methodology was applied to assess the occurrence of UV F in different fish species from the Guadalquivir river basin (Spain). Results confirmed the bioaccumulation of benzophenone-3 (BP3), ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and octocrylene (OC) in the fish samples. The maximum concentration of 240ng/g dw corresponded to EHMC, which was also the most ubiquitous compound. The reported concentrations constitute the first occurrence data of UV F residues in fish from Iberian rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3adetection limit 3afish 3aliquid chromatography 3aphysicochemical properties 3arivers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awatersheds 3aSpain1 aDíaz-Cruz, M.

This paper reports the development, validation and application of an enzyme immunoassay to quantify A. versicolor antigens. A sandwich ELISA was developed using polyclonal antibodies that recognize a broad range of A. versicolor proteins present in fungal spores and in mycelia fragments. To validate the new method, A. versicolor antigens were quantified in samples collected from homes with visible mould growth, including dust from vacuumed walls and bulk samples of building materials. Antigen concentrations were compared to the results of a commercial ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies (AveX ELISA, Indoor Biotechnologies, Charlottesville, USA) and correlated with colony forming units (CFU) of A. versicolor. The A. versicolor ELISA was very sensitive with a lower detection limit of 120 pg ml⁻¹. The assay also showed some reactivity to other moulds with strongest reactions with other Aspergillus species (1–3% reactivity). The new assay detected A. versicolor antigens in a much higher percentage of dust samples (88% vs. 27%) and bulk samples (89% vs. 24%) than the AveX assay. A significant correlation (r = 0.67, and p < 0.0001) was found between antigen concentrations and CFU of A. versicolor. Based on its low detection limit and good correlation with the culture-based method, this new immunoassay seems to be a useful tool for the measurement of A. versicolor exposure levels and a reliable complement to the traditional monitoring techniques, such as mould cultivation or microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus versicolor 3aadverse effects 3aconstruction materials 3adetection limit 3adust 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afungal antigens 3afungal spores 3ahumans 3amicroscopy 3amonitoring 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amycelium 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aproteins1 aKespohl, Sabine1 aSander, Ingrid1 aSchies, Ursula1 aKhosravie-Hohn, Janett1 aLorenz, Wolfgang1 aEngelhart, Steffen1 aKolk, Annette1 aSchneider, Gerd1 aBrüning, Thomas,1 aRaulf-Heimsoth, Monika0 tEnvironmental science.g2013 May 29, v. 15, no. 6 p.1162-1171dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em30870g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01815naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005900171300001800230520057600248536009200824592002800916596002000944650001900964650000900983650001600992650001601008650001301024650002301037650002301060653002001083653001601103653002401119653001401143653001501157700002201172773012801194856008601322852000901408655001201417IND60761349620221120130142.0220709e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076134962DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2021.19912402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPećina, Mateja10aCandidate genes and fatty acids in beef meat, a review  ap. 1716-1729.  aThis article reviews current knowledge on candidate genes and fatty acids in beef meat.

However, there has been no proteomic study on Cd toxicity, including any low Cd-accumulating species. Here, we investigate the response of a low Cd-accumulating species, Solanum torvum, to Cd toxicity at the root proteomic level using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE). The root 2-DGE map consisted of at least 927 reproducible protein spots, of which 45 were classified as differentially expressed proteins based on three replicated separations. MALDI-TOF MS analysis identified 19 of these spots, and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis identified 8 of the spots. The eight proteins identified were two S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetases, actin, an ATP synthase subunit, two tubulin proteins, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and 14-3-3 protein 4. These proteins are involved in phytohormone synthesis, defense responses, energy metabolism, and cytoskeleton construction. Thus, our proteomic analysis revealed that Cd stress promotes an increase in the abundance of proteins involved in antioxidant defenses and anti-stress protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3aSolanum torvum 3aactin 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aantioxidants 3aenergy metabolism 3aligases 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3aroots 3atoxicity 3atubulin 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aGe, Qing1 aZhang, Jingqiang1 aZhou, Jianjun1 aXu, Jin0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.485-491dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-012-0515-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245009400158300001800252520151000270592002801780650001901808650001501827650001801842650001701860650002201877650001701899650002201916650000901938650001801947650001601965650002201981650000902003650001302012650003902025650001502064650001202079650001202091650002402103700001902127700001902146700001902165700001602184773009602200856007802296852000902374655001202383IND60082145820221118050942.0141016e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008214582DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2009007272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeo, Seok10aMass spectrometrical analysis of the mitochondrial carrier Aralar1 from mouse hippocampus  ap. 1813-1821.  aAralar1 is a mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier and a key component of the malate–aspartate NADH shuttle system. An analytical approach to obtain high sequence coverage is important to predict conformation, identify splice variants and binding partners or generate specific antibodies. Moreover, a method allowing determination of Aralar1 from brain samples is a prerequisite for evaluating a biological role. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was applied to enrich native membrane protein fractions and these were run on blue‐native PAGE, followed by multidimensional gel electrophoresis. Spots from the third‐dimensional gel electrophoresis were in‐gel digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin and subtilisin. Subsequently, peptides were analyzed by nano‐ESI‐LC‐MS/MS using collision‐induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation modes. Modiro™ v1.1 along with Mascot v2.2 software was used for data handling. Aralar1 could be clearly separated, unambiguously identified and characterized from protein extracts of mouse hippocampus by the use of the multidimensional gel electrophoretic steps. The combined sequence coverage of Aralar1 from trypsin, chymotrypsin and subtilisin digestions was 99.85%. The results provide the basis for future studies of Aralar1 at the protein chemical rather than at the immunochemical level in the brain and thus challenge and enable determination of Aralar1 levels required for understanding biological functions in health and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aantibodies 3aaspartic acid 3achymotrypsin 3acomputer software 3adissociation 3aelectron transfer 3agels 3aglutamic acid 3ahippocampus 3amembrane proteins 3amice 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asubtilisin 3asucrose 3atrypsin 3aultracentrifugation1 aKang, Sung Ung1 aOehler, Rudolf1 aPollak, Arnold1 aLubec, Gert0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 June, v. 31, no. 11 p.1813-1821dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2009007273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009000161300001600251500001500267520202000282592002802302650002502330650001402355650002302369650002202392650001202414650001602426650001202442650002002454650002202474650001702496650002102513650001102534650002002545650003502565650002502600650002002625650001802645650002002663650001302683650001502696650002502711651001002736653001702746700001502763700001402778700001602792773014302808856008102951852000903032655001203041IND60465778020221122055549.0151123e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046577802DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-015-0074-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Ping10aEffects of drought stress on the antioxidant systems in three species of Diospyros L.  ap. 597-605.  a2019-12-06  aDrought stress is a limiting factor for plant cultivation in many areas of China and persimmon has good capacity to withstand water shortage. Three species of Diospyros (three accession of Diospyros lotus, referred to as accession No. 824, 846, and 847; one accession of Diospyros kaki var. sylvestris referred to as 869; and one accession of Diospyros virginiana referred to as 844) were chosen for drought stress analysis. We withheld water from healthy two-year-old potted seedlings for 20 days, and compared the effects of water stress on malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide free radical (O₂ .⁻), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), antioxidative enzyme, glutathione (GSH), and ascorbic acid (AsA) levels in the leaves of the three species. In the treatment group, water stress increased the membrane lipid peroxidation in the three species, but a more significant increase was observed in the D. kaki var. sylvestris 869 than in the D. virginiana 844. Moreover, accumulation of O₂ .⁻ and H₂O₂ was faster in weakly drought-resistant hybrids than in the highly drought- resistant hybrids. Though the activities of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant contents were increased in the three species under drought stress, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase were stimulated to a greater extent in D. virginiana 844 than in D. lotus and D. kaki var. sylvestris 869. In addition, the GSH, AsA, and relative water contents were increased significantly in D. virginiana 844, but not in D. kaki var. sylvestris 869. In the control group, no significant changes in lipid peroxidation and relevant antioxidant parameters were detected among the three species. These results indicated that changes of MDA, O₂ .⁻, and H₂O₂ content, antioxidative enzyme activities, and GSH and AsA concentrations were correlated to drought resistance in the different species. D. virginiana 844 had a higher antioxidation capacity in response to drought than the other two species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aseedlings 3alipid peroxidation 3adrought tolerance 3adrought 3aglutathione 3ahybrids 3amalondialdehyde 3ahydrogen peroxide 3awater stress 3asuperoxide anion 3aleaves 3aDiospyros lotus 3aDiospyros kaki var. sylvestris 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aenzyme activity 3aascorbic acid 3awater shortages 3acatalase 3apersimmons 3aDiospyros virginiana 3aChina 0aantioxidants1 aYang, Yong1 aWang, Fei1 aChen, Hejie0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 56, no. 5 p.597-605dKorean Society for Horticultural Sciencex2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-015-0074-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013800167300001400305520120800319592002801527650002101555650003301576650002001609650001501629650001601644650003801660650002701698650002501725650002501750650001401775650001001789653000801799653002901807653001201836653000801848700001401856700002101870700005501891700001701946700001201963700001201975700001601987700001702003700001602020700001702036700001302053700001702066700001602083700001602099773011002115856008702225852000902312655001202321IND60614422220221120062054.0181222e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061442222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yimei10aIndirect ELISA using a multi-epitope recombinant protein to detect antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype O in pigs  ap. 26-31.  aFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a devastating animal disease. A previously developed multi-epitope protein B4 vaccine of the FMD virus (FMDV) serotype O provides safety advantages over inactivated vaccines and could be used to prevent and control FMD in pigs. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for assessing vaccine efficacy are available for the inactivated vaccines but not for the multi-epitope protein vaccine. In this study, multi-epitope protein B4 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) was developed to detect antibodies against FMDV serotype O in pigs. The specificity and sensitivity were 96.7% and 95.9%, respectively. B4-vaccinated pigs yielded B4 I-ELISA serum values that were positively correlated with clinical protection against challenge with FMDV serotype O. The I-ELISA’s ability to detect antibodies from animals vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine was also evaluated, and the B4 I-ELISA values were significantly positively correlated with liquid-phase blocking ELISA (LPBE) titers (r = 0.6708, p < 0.0001); thus, the I-ELISA was also suitable for detection of antibodies from swine vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aanimal diseases 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3ainactivated vaccines 3arecombinant proteins 3aserotypes 3aswine 0aFMD 0aMulti-epitope protein B4 0aI-ELISA 0aPig1 aZhou, Wei1 aXing, Xiangchuan1 aZhang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4965-70761 aFu, Yuanfang1 aLi, Kun1 aSun, Pu1 aLi, Pinghua1 aBai, Xingwen1 aMa, Xueqing1 aBao, Huifang1 aLi, Dong1 aChen, Yingli1 aLu, Zengjun1 aLiu, Zaixin0 tJournal of virological methods.g2018 Dec., v. 262 p.26-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03901naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011400176300001800290520209400308536021102402592002802613596001202641596000802653650001702661650002102678650002202699650001402721650001802735650001702753653002302770653002702793653002202820653002502842700002202867700001702889700002402906700002002930700002102950700002102971700002302992700002003015700002203035700002303057700002303080700002403103700002103127773012803148856008603276852000903362655001203371IND60761350020221122040937.0220709e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076135002DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2021.19930942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIaffaldano, Nicolaia10aItalian semen cryobank of autochthonous chicken and turkey breeds: a tool for preserving genetic biodiversity  ap. 2022-2033.  aThe creation of genetic resource cryobanks provides a crucial link between in situ and ex situ techniques to improve the efficiency of conservation programs. Aim of the present review is to describe all the activities developed for the implementation of the first Italian Semen Cryobank of Autochthonous Chicken and Turkey Breeds. These activities can be classified into three main topics: (1) identification of species-specific semen freezing/thawing reference procedures; (2) drafting Standard Operative Procedures (SOP) for the implementation of the semen cryobank; (3) storage of semen doses from Italian chicken and turkey breeds to establish the cryobank. Several trials have been developed to identify a specie-specific semen cryopreservation protocol for chickens and turkeys. The major results are reviewed and a final reference protocol described. Taking into consideration the FAO guidelines for cryoconservation of animal genetic resources, SOP were drafted with the aim to provide technical guidance and logistical support on the choice of priority breeds, selection of birds for semen production, infrastructures and storage sites, birds and semen management, cryopreservation process and doses traceability. Lastly, the Italian Semen Cryobank was created. A total of 112 semen doses from 22 cockerels of three breeds, and 74 doses from 12 turkey males of three breeds were stored in the Cryobank. Breed specific semen quality parameters assessed before and after cryopreservation are reported. The described activities provide information and tools useful for the implementation of semen cryobanking in avian species and might be transferred also to other species after appropriate adaptations.HIGHLIGHTSImplementation of the first Italian Semen Cryobank of Autochthonous Chicken and Turkey Breeds Drafting Standard Operative Procedures provides technical guidance and logistical support on the design and establishment of the cryobank Semen cryobank is a precious genetic reservoir and could be useful to safeguard genetic variability in small population in vivo conserved  aThis study was funded by Ministry of Agricultural, Food, Forestry and Tourism Policies [PSRN 2014-2020 Sottomisura 10.2 Biodiversità/Comparto avicoli – TuBAvI project n. 54250333926, with FEASR support].  aPublisher supplied data  aPSRNa-  a926 3abiodiversity 3acryopreservation 3agenetic variation 3aprotocols 3asemen quality 3atraceability 0aGamete cryobanking 0aItalian poultry breeds 0agenetic resources 0aconservation program1 aDi Iorio, Michele1 aRusco, Giusy1 aAntenucci, Emanuele1 aZaniboni, Luisa1 aMadeddu, Manuela1 aMarelli, Stefano1 aSchiavone, Achille1 aSoglia, Dominga1 aBuccioni, Arianna1 aCassandro, Martino1 aCastellini, Cesare1 aMarzoni, Margherita1 aCerolini, Silvia0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2021 Jan. 1, v. 20, no. 1 p.2022-2033dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2021.19930943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245008900167300001800256520125500274592002801529650001201557650002401569650001001593650001501603650001701618650001301635650001601648650003001664650003501694700002901729700001801758700002001776700002201796700001901818773009601837856007801933852000902011655001202020IND60082145920221118050953.0141016e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008214592DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2009006642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Omar Abdul10aAnalysis of a polymorphic microRNA target site in the purinergic receptor P2RX7 gene  ap. 1790-1795.  aThe recent discovery of post‐transcriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) drew our attention to SNPs of putative miRNA target sites in candidate genes of depression‐related psychiatric disorders. The P2RX7 (purinergic receptor P2X, ligand‐gated ion channel, 7) gene has been suggested as a candidate for major depressive and bipolar disorder, because of repeated associations with the rs2230912 (Gln460Arg) polymorphism. As this polymorphism is located at the end of the coding region, we considered a possible linkage with SNP(s) in putative miRNA target sites of the 3′ untranslated region. Based on our in silico search, the rs1653625 fulfilled this criterion. This SNP, however, is surrounded with polycytosine and polyadenine tracts, which hindered its analysis until now. In this study, we describe a readily applicable genotyping method for rs1653625 by applying a primer that introduces mismatched nucleotides to create a restriction enzyme cleavage site. The resulting allele‐specific products with 19 base pair difference were separated by both traditional horizontal agarose gel electrophoresis and multicapillary gel electrophoresis. The developed genotyping method was applied in our depression‐related association study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3agenotyping 3aion channels 3amicroRNA 3anucleotides 3arestriction endonucleases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aSasvari‐Szekely, Maria1 aSzekely, Anna1 aFaludi, Gábor,1 aGuttman, András,1 aNemoda, Zsofia0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 June, v. 31, no. 11 p.1790-1795dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2009006643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011600170300001600286520102000302592002801322650002601350650001501376650001101391650000901402650001201411650002301423650002101446650002201467650001601489650002201505700001601527700002301543773010201566856008601668852000901754655001201763IND60578292620221122180501.0170812e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057829262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b016392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalabaev, N.

The melt macroscopic and structural characteristics were analyzed for the third up to the eighth generation dendrimers for the systems consisting of 8 and 27 dendrimer molecules in the simulation box. For every system, averaging was performed over 8 independent simulation runs and along equilibrium time trajectories of up to 5 ns. Calculated values of the thermal expansion coefficients, heat capacity, and self-diffusion coefficients are in a good agreement with experimental observations. Analysis of the molecular mass dependence of the gyration radius and shape factor, detailed radial density distributions of dendrimer structural units, mobility of the branching points, and intermolecular interaction energy allowed to shed light on the basics of distinction in behavior of low and high generation dendrimer melts and formulate the directions of further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3adendrimers 3aenergy 3aheat 3amelting 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular weight 3asimulation models 3atemperature 3athermal expansion1 aMazo, M.

Concomitant radiochemotherapy has become the standard clinical treatment for malignant glioma, but there are two critical challenges to overcome in order to increase efficacy. First, glioma is known to have increased resistant to radiation due to its intra-tumoral hypoxia. In addition, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the distribution of the chemotherapeutic agent to the brain. Therefore, we developed a hypoxic radiosensitizer-prodrug liposome (MLP), in order to deliver DOX to the tumor and to overcome the above challenges, achieving a synergistic chemo-/radiotherapy treatment of malignant glioma. In this study, hypoxic radiosensitizer nitroimidazoles were conjugated with lipid molecules with a hydrolysable ester bond to form MDH. MDH was mixed together with DSPE-PEG2000 and cholesterol to make MLP liposomes, which were found to have strong radiosensitivity and to promote cargo release under hypoxic conditions, due to the properties of nitroimidazoles under hypoxic conditions. MLP/DOX was found to have distinct advantages, including precise and stealthy pharmacokinetics and efficient passive uptake by the tumor. Furthermore, the combination of MLP/DOX and radiotherapy (RT) significantly inhibited glioma growth as assessed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. These findings suggest that MLP is a promising candidate as a DOX delivery system to enhance the antitumor treatment effects on glioma, owing to synergistic chemo-/radiotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abioluminescence 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acholesterol 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3ahypoxia 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasms 3anitroimidazoles 3apharmacokinetics 3aradiotherapy 0aHypoxia-triggered 0aHypoxic radiosensitization liposome 0aSynergetic chemo-/radio-therapy 0aGlioma1 aXie, Yandong1 aZhang, Yafei1 aCai, Yifan1 aLi, Baiyang1 aMao, Honglin1 aLiu, Yingguo1 aLu, Jun1 aZhang, Longzhen1 aYu, Rutong0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Mar., v. 121 p.130-143dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100006300143242013300206245010300339300001300442520202600455592002802481650001702509650003002526650001002556650001102566650001302577650002102590650002002611650003002631650001602661650001102677650001502688650001202703650001102715650001002726650001202736651001902748653004402767653002902811653002002840653002602860653002702886653003902913700002602952773011202978856007703090852000903167655001203176IND60671554320221119175322.0191003e20190725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067155432DNAL7 a10.1093/condor/duz0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreeman, Benedictus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0895-495210aExhaustivité des connaissances numériques accessibles sur les oiseaux de l'Afrique de l'Ouest: priorités pour les inventaires10aCompleteness of digital accessible knowledge of the birds of western Africa: Priorities for survey  ap. 1-10.  aOpen-source primary biodiversity data, or digital accessible knowledge (DAK), are widely used in biodiversity informatics to understand the status of global biodiversity, model lspecies' ecological niches and geographic distributions, and inform biodiversity conservation decisions. However, these datasets are often unavailable, incomplete, or unevenly distributed across regions. We examined DAK for the birds of western Africa, obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and eBird, to identify gaps in the current knowledge of birds of western Africa, which can be used to guide future avian surveys across the region. We cleaned and standardized the data, resulting in >430,000 records, with 91% from eBird. From these we calculated inventory completeness indices for all grid cells at 0.5°, 0.3°, and 0.1° spatial resolutions across the region. We defined well-surveyed grid cells as those with completeness indices >80% and with >200 associated DAK records. We found marked spatial, seasonal, environmental, and temporal (historical) biases and information gaps in coverage. We identified 59 well-surveyed cells at 0.1°, 55 at 0.3°, and 50 at 0.5° resolution, with well-surveyed sites clustered around points of access such as major cities and national reserves or parks. Our results identified remarkably distinct areas in environmental space with diverse climatic conditions to be given priority for future avian surveys and conservation. The distinctiveness in the climatic conditions of these areas compared to well-surveyed sites is an indication that these areas when sampled could provide new insights into western African bird diversity. Lastly, we show the underrepresentation of traditional biodiversity data (e.g., museums, herbaria collections) compared to citizen science–enabled data (e.g., eBird), which demonstrates the potential of citizen science in documenting and monitoring biodiversity in western Africa, and by extension other poorly known regions of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3abirds 3acities 3acleaning 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3ageographical distribution 3ainventories 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amuseums 3aniches 3aparks 3asurveys 3aWestern Africa 0abiodiversity data accessibility and use 0abiodiversity informatics 0acitizen science 0aconservation priority 0ainventory completeness 0aspatial and temporal sampling gaps1 aPeterson, A.

A newly developed groundwater and EK flow and reactive transport numerical model was used to conduct two‐dimensional scenario simulations of the coverage of an injected oxidant, permanganate, and the oxidation of a typical organic contaminant (tetrachloroethene, PCE). For linear configurations of vertical electrodes, the spacing of same‐polarity electrodes is recommended to be about one‐third to one‐quarter of the anode–cathode spacing. Greater coverage could also be achieved by locating additional oxidant injection wells at the divergence of the electric field in linear electrode configurations. Horizontal electrodes allowed greater contact between the injected permanganate and PCE and resulted in faster degradation of PCE compared to vertical electrodes. Pulsed oxidant injection, closer electrode spacing, and electric field reversal also resulted in faster EK‐ISCO remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3agroundwater 3amathematical models 3aoxidation 3aremediation 3asediments 3aspatial distribution 3atetrachloroethylene 3awells1 aReynolds, David A.1 aFourie, A.

Calumenin, stress‐induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), and translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) were assigned to mitotic arrest and selected for further experiments using immunoblotting and subcellular fractionation. Calumenin translocated from membranes to the cytosol during mitotic arrest and late apoptosis, but was significantly reduced in the cytosol during apoptosis. Translocation of STIP1 to the nucleus was observed at apoptosis and to the cytoskeleton at late apoptosis. TCTP increased in the cytosol at mitotic arrest and in membranes at apoptosis. In addition, the quantitative time courses of Bim isoforms revealed differences between BimL and BimS in comparison with BimEL. In summary, temporal proteome profiling of HeLa cells incubated with taxol allowed the assignment of proteins to certain processes and additional experiments with complementary approaches enabled a more comprehensive understanding of spatial changes of selected proteins during mitotic arrest and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acytoskeleton 3acytosol 3aelectrophoresis 3afractionation 3aimmunoblotting 3apaclitaxel 3aphosphoproteins 3aproteome 3atherapeutics 3atranslation (genetics)1 aFargestad, Ellen M.1 aStrozynski, Margarita1 aThiede, Bernd0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 June, v. 31, no. 11 p.1873-1885dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2009007803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010800178300001400286520133200300592002801632650001401660650002301674650001301697650001301710650001201723650002101735650001101756650001701767650001901784650001101803650001401814700002301828700002101851700001901872773010001891856008601991852000902077655001202086IND60578292820221122180440.0170812e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057829282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b018912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRonellenfitsch, Mathias10aImproving 1-Hexene Incorporation of Highly Active Cp–Chromium-Based Ethylene Polymerization Catalysts  ap. 35-43.  aSingle-site chromium catalysts for olefin polymerization with donor functionalized cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands have been modified in order to improve their incorporation ability for the comonomer 1-hexene into the polymer chain under maintenance of their very high catalytic activities. A trimethylsilyl substituent in combination with a fused thiophene ring at the Cp ligand has been identified as the best ligand so far, leading to a doubling in 1-hexene incorporation and polyethylene (PE) with up to 27% 1-hexene content (by weight) has been obtained. The complexes lead to PE with molecular weight in the range of 50 000 to 800 000 g mol–¹ when used in homogeneous solution, however after supporting the complex on silica ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) is formed with 9.9% of 1-hexene incorporated into the chain. Although other known catalysts incorporate even more 1-hexene, the presented system is different as it combines considerable α-olefin incorporation with very high polymer molecular weights and very high catalytic activity. These improved single-site chromium catalysts maintain their advantageous properties on silica as solid support which makes them good candidates for their application in industrial processes for the synthesis of polyethylene materials with advanced properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achromium 3aethylene 3aligands 3amolecular weight 3aolefin 3apolyethylene 3apolymerization 3asilica 3athiophene1 aGehrmann, Thorsten1 aWadepohl, Hubert1 aEnders, Markus0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 50, no. 1 p.35-43dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b018913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001800197245013200215300001600347506007600363520133900439592002801778506003701806650002001843650001401863650002301877650001701900650001001917650001801927650001101945650001201956650002201968650000901990650002401999650002602023650001602049653002202065653002302087653001502110653003502125653003602160700002102196700001702217700001602234700001802250700001402268700002002282773007802302856009002380852000902470655001202479IND60561083020221207124227.0170626e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056108302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.0032doi7 aPMC53155722pmcid7 a280880772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwak, So-Jung10aRhoA knockdown by cationic amphiphilic copolymer/siRhoA polyplexes enhances axonal regeneration in rat spinal cord injury model  ap. 155-166.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpinal cord injury (SCI) results in permanent loss of motor and sensory function due to developmentally-related and injured-induced changes in the extrinsic microenvironment and intrinsic neuronal biochemistry that limit plasticity and axonal regeneration. Our long term goal is to develop cationic, amphiphilic copolymers (poly (lactide-co-glycolide)-g-polyethylenimine, PgP) for combinatorial delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs) and drugs targeting these different barriers. In this study, we evaluated the ability of PgP to deliver siRNA targeting RhoA, a critical signaling pathway activated by multiple extracellular inhibitors of axonal regeneration. After generation of rat compression SCI model, PgP/siRhoA polyplexes were locally injected into the lesion site. Relative to untreated injury only, PgP/siRhoA polyplexes significantly reduced RhoA mRNA and protein expression for up to 4 weeks post-injury. Histological analysis at 4 weeks post-injury showed that RhoA knockdown was accompanied by reduced apoptosis, cavity size, and astrogliosis and increased axonal regeneration within the lesion site. These studies demonstrate that PgP is an efficient non-viral delivery carrier for therapeutic siRhoA to the injured spinal cord and may be a promising platform for the development of combinatorial TNA/drug therapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal injuries 3aapoptosis 3acomposite polymers 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aneurons 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3aspinal cord 0aAxon regeneration 0aSpinal cord injury 0aRhoA siRNA 0aNon-viral nucleic acid carrier 0aCationic amphiphilic co-polymer1 aMacks, Christian1 aJeong, Da Un1 aKindy, Mark1 aLynn, Michael1 aWebb, Ken1 aLee, Jeoung Soo0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Mar., v. 121 p.155-166dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245007900204300001800283520097800301592002801279650003401307650001601341650002101357650001501378650001701393650001701410650001301427650001801440650001401458650001201472650001301484700001901497700006501516700006701581773014701648856007601795852000901871655001201880IND60644518120221121232204.0190516e20190417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064451812DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b014422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherbo, Rebecca S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2376-633510aEfficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation with a Palladium Membrane Reactor  ap. 7815-7821.  aWe report here the benefits of using a palladium membrane reactor to drive hydrogenation chemistry with electricity while bypassing the formation of gaseous H₂. This technique uses a palladium membrane to physically separate the electrochemical and hydrogenation chemistry. As a result, hydrogenation can be performed electrochemically with protons but in any organic solvent. In this article, we outline a series of experiments showing how hydrogenation in the palladium membrane reactor proceeds at faster reaction rates and with much higher voltage efficiency than hydrogenation at an electrode. Moreover, the organic reaction chemistry in the membrane reactor can be performed in organic solvents and without contamination by electrolytes. The physical separation of the hydrogenation compartment from the electrolysis compartment therefore broadens the scope of electrolytically-driven reactions that are available, and simplifies reagent handling and purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectricity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3apalladium 3aprotons 3asolvents1 aKurimoto, Aiko1 aBrown, Christopher M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4877-60461 aBerlinguette, Curtis P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6875-849X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Apr. 17, v. 141, no. 19 p.7815-7821dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b014423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245008200179300001400261520122900275592002801504650001501532650001401547650002401561650001301585650001101598650001601609650001301625700003501638700001701673773012201690856008601812990002301898852000901921655001201930IND60093729320221120095837.0141103e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009372932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2011.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Martín, Raúl10aMultiplicative algorithm for computing D-optimum designs for pVT measurements  ap. 20-27.  aMultifactor models are present in industry and in biological experiments; therefore optimum designs are a valuable tool for experimenters, leading to estimators of the parameters with minimum variance. A generalization of the Multiplicative algorithm to find locally D-optimum designs for multifactor models as Tait-like equations is here proposed. The method consists of transforming a conceived set of design points over a finite interval into proportions of the design interval defined by the sub-intervals between successive points. Examples for different modifications of the Tait equation are here presented: a three parameter model under isothermal conditions with pressure as the independent variable and two different modifications of an eight parameter model (Rackett equation) with pressure and temperature as design variables. Optimum design for the first example is equally supported at three points while the two-factor modifications of the Tait equation show designs with more support points than unknown parameters and different weights for each point. Efficiencies of real experimental designs are computed and suitable more efficient experimental designs, satisfying experimental demands are also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aequations 3aexperimental design 3aindustry 3amodels 3atemperature 3avariance1 aRodríguez-Aragón, Licesio J.1 aTorsney, Ben0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 111, no. 1 p.20-27dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2011.10.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011900169300001800288520108500306592002801391650002701419650002201446650001701468650002101485650001901506650001701525650001901542700001501561700001301576700001501589700005401604700005301658700006001711773012801771856008401899852000901983655001201992IND60686318120221120170205.0200317e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068631812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c005062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Tian-Bing10aEngineering a Reversible Fluorescent Probe for Real-Time Live-Cell Imaging and Quantification of Mitochondrial ATP  ap. 4681-4688.  aReal-time imaging and quantification of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fluctuation in cells are significant for understanding the relationship between energy metabolism and cell functions. However, few synthetic fluorescent probes have been reported to tackle this challenge due to lack of accurate fluorescence readout and suitable response concentration. Herein we designed and synthesized a ratiometric fluorescent probe (Rh6G–ACFPN) for quantitatively detecting the fluctuation of mitochondrial ATP in living cells. Rh6G–ACFPN selectively and reversibly responds to ATP with an ideal dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.65 mM (3–10 mM: the range of mitochondrial ATP concentrations). Live-cell imaging allows us to directly monitor the dynamic changes of mitochondrial ATP in high temporal resolution. Moreover, for the first time, mitochondrial ATP in normal and cancer cells lines was successfully quantified and discriminated. These results demonstrate the versatility of Rh6G–ACFPN as a useful imaging tool to elucidate the function of mitochondrial ATP in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aenergy metabolism 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells1 aWen, Si-Yu1 aWang, Lu1 aLü, Peng,1 aXiong, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1575-59541 aYuan, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1015-53191 aZhang, Xiao-Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4010-00280 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 92, no. 6 p.4681-4688dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c005063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245009800161500001400259520138200273592002801655650001801683650001201701650001001713650001001723650001201733650001401745650001001759700001901769700002001788700001901808700002201827700002101849700002201870700002301892773012101915856007502036852000902111655001202120IND60715203920221119075324.0201026e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071520392DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101018892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDirksen, Neele 10aHow Can Cattle Be Toilet Trained? Incorporating Reflexive Behaviours into a Behavioural Chain  aNAL-light  aUntrained cattle do not defecate or urinate in defined locations. The toilet training of cattle would allow urine and faeces to be separated and stored, reducing climate-damaging emissions and improving animal health. In a proof-of-concept study, we evaluated a novel protocol for toilet training in cattle. Five heifer calves (and yoked controls) were trained in the voluntary (operant) behaviours of a toileting chain. Then, reflexive urinating responses were incorporated into the chain, with toileting signalled by a tactile (vibratory) stimulus. On 95% of occasions, the calves inhibited/interrupted urination when receiving the stimulus, and on 65% of these occasions, reinitiated urination in the latrine. Furthermore, during 63% of urinations in the latrine, the calves oriented to the reward location before any food was delivered, providing additional evidence that calves can be successfully toilet trained with food rewards. Yoked controls failed to learn most of the operant elements and all the reflexive responses of toilet training. The results show that reflexive behaviours can be incorporated into voluntary toileting sequences with cattle and extend the range of species that can be toilet trained. Future refinement of the protocol to allow training under practical farm conditions offers the potential to mitigate climate damage and improve animal health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3aclimate 3afarms 3afeces 3aheifers 3aurination 3aurine1 aLangbein, Jan 1 aSchrader, Lars 1 aPuppe, Birger 1 aElliffe, Douglas 1 aSiebert, Katrin 1 aRöttgen, Volker 1 aMatthews, Lindsay 0 tAnimals.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101018893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143242006400167245006000231300001300291520147400304592002801778650002601806650001901832650001601851650001001867650001501877650002501892650001501917650001401932650002101946650001601967650001701983650001302000651001502013651001302028653000902041653002002050653002202070653001102092653001402103653001302117700002102130700002702151773011202178856007702290852000902367655001202376IND60671554720221119175342.0191003e20190826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067155472DNAL7 a10.1093/condor/duz0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, Andrea K.10aUrbanización y colesterol elevado en Corvus brachyrhynchos10aUrbanization and elevated cholesterol in American Crows  ap. 1-10.  aAlthough urban areas can be sources of abundant food for wildlife, anthropogenic foods may be lower in quality than natural food sources, with possible consequences for birds. We examined how urbanization and anthropogenic food were linked to cholesterol levels, condition, and survival of American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). We collected cholesterol and landscape data from 140 crow nestlings along an urban-to-rural gradient in Davis, California, USA. We also ran a supplementation experiment with high-cholesterol fast food (McDonald's cheeseburgers) on 86 nestlings in a rural population in Clinton, New York, USA. Plasma cholesterol increased with percentage of impervious surface along the urban-to-rural gradient. Cholesterol levels were sensitive to anthropogenic foods: crows supplemented with fast food cheeseburgers had higher cholesterol levels than unsupplemented crows. Elevated cholesterol levels had no detectable effects on survival and were associated with higher indices of body condition, although urbanization itself was linked to lower survival. Elevated cholesterol levels could indicate access to high-calorie, high-fat anthropogenic foods, which might, in some contexts, improve body condition, potentially offsetting other negative effects of urbanization. Observations over a longer time scale, assessing additional indices of health and fitness, are needed to evaluate long-term costs or benefits of elevated cholesterol for urban crows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorvus brachyrhynchos 3abody condition 3acholesterol 3acrows 3afast foods 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alandscapes 3anestlings 3arural population 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awildlife 3aCalifornia 3aNew York 0adiet 0aecological trap 0aevolutionary trap 0ahealth 0anutrition 0asurvival1 aStaab, Hannah A.1 aBarker, Christopher M.0 tCondor.g2019 Aug. 26, v. 121, no. 3 p.1-10dUniversity of California PresswJournal:19632x1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/condor/duz0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002000147245010900167300001800276500000900294520149300303592002801796650001201824650001601836650002201852650001401874650002701888650003101915650002001946650002301966650001401989650003002003650002302033650001402056650001602070650002302086650003502109650003702144650002202181650001302203650001902216650002302235700001402258700002002272700001702292773012302309852000902432856008402441655001202525IND4398440020221118104011.0191228e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439844002DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2006.11.07112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMissaoui, A.

Merr., across the USA. The Rcs3 gene provides resistance to all known races of C. sojina To provide resources for efficient marker-assisted selection (MAS) of Rcs3, we developed and evaluated several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertions or deletions (InDels) markers linked to Rcs3 We surveyed 13 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences that were anchored with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers Satt244 and Satt547 along with the two SSRs containing clones in six soybean cultivars (Davis, Cook, and Young that have the Rcs3 allele and Blackhawk, Bragg, and Lee that have the rcs3 allele) for SNPs. A total of 19 SNPs/InDels were identified and validated, but only 11 mapped near Rcs3 in a F₂ population of Davis × Blackhawk. The Rcs3 gene was positioned near Satt244 and 0.50 cM from SNPs AZ573TA150 and AZ573CA393. None of the SNPs or InDels identified appeared to contribute directly to the Rcs3 phenotype, but 11 mapped within a 3-cM interval surrounding Rcs3 These 11 markers were further validated for association with Rcs3 and for their potential in MAS in 64 lines and cultivars. Our results suggest that the two markers AZ573TA150 and AZ573CA393 could be used in MAS for Rcs3. Allele specific oligonucleotide probes specific for MAS were developed for a direct hybridization assay on a Luminex 100 flow cytometry platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3afield crops 3aCercospora sojina 3aleaf spot 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3anucleic acid hybridization 3agenetic markers 3agenetic resistance 3aphenotype 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3achromosome mapping 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3agenetic variation 3asoybeans 3aflow cytometry 3alinkage (genetics)1 aHa, B.

Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared region (NIR-II, 1000–1700 nm) has gained increasing attention for observation in living organisms, but a viscosity-activatable fluorescent probe emitting at this region remains a vacancy. Herein, we report the first panel of a viscosity-activated NIR-II emissive fluorescent probe WD-X. By embedding different substituents into the WD-X platform and screening, we obtained an ideal probe, WD-NO₂, which displayed the best combination of properties, including a 31-fold fluorescence enhancement in response to viscosity, insensitivity to environments (pH, polarity), and relatively high quantum yield (1.6% in glycerol). WD-NO₂ was successfully applied to track the variation of viscosity in diabetes-induced liver injury in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aglycerol 3aimage analysis 3aliver 3apH 3ascreening 3aviscosity1 aHuang, Weijing1 aXiang, Yunhui1 aLi, Songjiao1 aLiu, Zhihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1500-93420 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Mar. 04, v. 92, no. 6 p.4177-4181dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c006343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009100163300001600254500001900270520122600289592002801515650001601543650000801559650001401567650002301581650001701604650003001621650002201651650001601673650001801689650001301707650001401720650001101734650002001745653001601765653002201781653002601803653001901829700001601848700001501864700001301879700001901892700001801911700001701929700001401946700001501960700001801975773012201993856008302115852000902198655001202207IND60727462520221121030618.0210320e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072746252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao10aHydroxyl-terminated carbon dots for efficient conversion of cyclohexane to adipic acid  ap. 281-289.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAdipic acid (HOOC(CH₂)₄COOH, AA) is a crucial chemical in industrial manufactures and mainly produced by the oxidation of cyclohexane with air and nitric acid via a homogeneous two step path in industry. However, the conventional industrial method inevitably results in the generation of nitrous oxide (N₂O, etc.), which is the main cause of the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion. Herein, we engineered five kinds of carbon dots (CDs) with different oxygen-containing functional groups on their surfaces, which were directly used as catalysts over the selective catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane. Among the five CDs, the hydroxyl-terminated CDs show the best catalytic activity with the conversion of cyclohexane ~ 29.43% and selectivity to AA ~ 95.89% under 130 °C, 20 atm with oxygen as oxidant. With the CDs directly as catalyst, the one-step efficient catalytic oxidation reaction for cyclohexane to AA was realized to replace the two-step routes. In addition, the density functional theory (DFT) computational results were performed to further prove that the more quantity of hydroxyl on CDs and the higher O₂ pressure can boost the higher catalytic activity of CDs over oxidation of cyclohexane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipic acid 3aair 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acyclohexanes 3adensity functional theory 3agreenhouse effect 3anitric acid 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aozone depletion 0aCarbon dots 0aFunctional groups 0aCyclohexane oxidation 0aOne-step route1 aBian, Wenyi1 aMa, Yurong1 aLiu, Yan1 aWang, Zhenzhen1 aShi, Chunfeng1 aLin, Haiping1 aLiu, Yang1 aHuang, Hui1 aKang, Zhenhui0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 June, v. 591 p.281-289dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245007300165300001800238520126800256592002801524650000801552650000801560650002101568650001701589650001201606650002901618650001401647650001601661650002901677700005701706773014601763856007601909852000901985655001201994IND60644518320221122003114.0190516e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064451832DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b015502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgarwal, Siddharth10aEnzyme-Driven Assembly and Disassembly of Hybrid DNA–RNA Nanotubes  ap. 7831-7841.  aLiving cells have the ability to control the dynamics of responsive assemblies such as the cytoskeleton by temporally activating and deactivating inert precursors. While DNA nanotechnology has demonstrated many synthetic supramolecular assemblies that rival biological ones in size and complexity, dynamic control of their formation is still challenging. Taking inspiration from nature, we developed a DNA-RNA nanotube system whose assembly and disassembly can be temporally controlled at physiological temperature using transcriptional programs. Nanotubes assemble when inert DNA monomers are directly and selectively activated by RNA molecules that become embedded in the structure, producing hybrid DNA–RNA assemblies. The reactions and molecular programs controlling nanotube formation are fueled by enzymes that produce or degrade RNA. We show that the speed of assembly and disassembly of the nanotubes can be controlled by tuning various reaction parameters in the transcriptional programs. We anticipate that these hybrid structures are a starting point to build integrated biological circuits and functional scaffolds inside natural and artificial cells, where RNA produced by gene networks could fuel the assembly of nucleic acid components on demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aartificial cells 3acytoskeleton 3aenzymes 3agene regulatory networks 3ananotubes 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics)1 aFranco, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1103-26680 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 May 01, v. 141, no. 19 p.7831-7841dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b015503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009100167300001600258520155500274592002801829650002401857650001501881650001401896650004901910650001801959650000901977650001301986650000901999650001302008650001102021650002402032700001902056700001802075700002002093773010202113856008602215852000902301655001202310IND60578293020221120092550.0170812e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057829302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b019422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSono, Masayo10aSpin-Trapping Analysis of Thermal Degradation Reaction of Poly(butylene terephthalate)  ap. 254-263.  aPoly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), and its oligomer, were doped with the spin-trapping reagent, 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP), by a solution-casting method in order to detect the short-lived radical intermediates during thermal degradation. In the case of PBT, two types of spin adduct were observed by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy upon stepwise heating from room temperature to 200 °C and during annealing at 130 °C; the ESR spectrum exhibited an isotropic three-line signal, with a hyperfine coupling constant (hfcc) aN ≈ 0.8 mT, as well as an anisotropic component. These adducts were present on the order of 10–⁵ mol/L. The isotropic component was assigned to arise uniquely from the benzoyl radical, •CO-ϕ. The anisotropic component was carefully investigated by ESR spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS), using low-molecular-weight model compounds such as n-butyl benzoate (BB), di-n-butyl terephthalate (DBT), and deuterated DBT (d-DBT). The newly observed ESR components, six lines for DBT and nine lines for d-DBT, were assigned to the α-carbon radicals, −O–•CH– and −O–•CD–, respectively. The existence of these spin adducts was also confirmed directly by MS analysis (as protonated ions). We conclude that the thermal degradation of PBT begins by hydrogen abstraction from the α-methylene group of PBT at low temperature (110 °C), with subsequent main chain decomposition through β-scission of the ester linkages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanisotropy 3aannealing 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afree radicals 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3aions 3aisotropy 3amodels 3athermal degradation1 aKinashi, Kenji1 aSakai, Wataru1 aTsutsumi, Naoto0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 50, no. 1 p.254-263dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b019423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01577naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007400165300001800239520065300257592002800910650001600938650002000954650001800974650001500992650001301007650001501020700002601035700001901061773009601080856007801176852000901254655001201263IND60082146620221118051159.0141016e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008214662DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2009007712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslinger, Markus10aFree‐flow electrophoresis in the proteomic era: A technique in flux  ap. 1754-1763.  aSince its introduction five decades ago, free‐flow electrophoresis (FFE) has been mainly employed for the isolation and fractionation of cells, cell organelles and protein mixtures.

The toxicity of dilbit to fish embryos, which are immobile and thus at a high risk of exposure to oil in the event of a spill, remains largely unknown for most species. This study assessed the toxicity of water accommodated fractions (WAF) and chemically enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAF) of two winter dilbit blends, Access Western Blend (AWB) and Cold Lake Blend (CLB), to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos. The TPH-F EC50s for malformations were 834 and 1058 μg/L for AWB WAF and CEWAF, respectively, and 500 and 715 μg/L for CLB WAF and CEWAF, respectively. Levels of cyp1a mRNA increased up to 46- and 69-fold, respectively, reflecting increasing exposure to polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in AWB and CLB. Similarly, levels of gst mRNA were elevated up to 3.8-fold and 2.7-fold with increasing total concentrations of PACs in AWB and CLB, respectively. However, there were no significant changes in mRNA levels of p53, sod, cat, and gsr. These results suggest that the expression of cyp1a and gst may serve as biomarkers for dilbit exposure in fathead minnow, furthering our understanding of dilbit-responsive indicators of toxicity in fish species native to North America. This study is important as it utilizes the same exposure methodology to examine the toxicity of two commonly used Canadian dilbits, facilitating comparison of dilbit toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPimephales promelas 3aabnormal development 3aaromatic compounds 3abiomarkers 3abitumen 3acondensates 3afish 3aindigenous species 3amessenger RNA 3aoil sands 3aoils 3apolycyclic compounds 3arisk 3atoxicity 3awinter 3aCanada 0aDilbit 0aAccess Western Blend 0aCold Lake Blend 0aPolycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) 0aBlue sac disease 0aOxidative Stress1 aMadison, B.N.1 aBrown, R.S.1 aHodson, P.V.1 aLanglois, V.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6281-58010 tAquatic toxicology.g2018 Nov., v. 204 p.107-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245011600170300001600286520141700302592002801719650002501747650001301772650002901785650001301814650002301827650002801850650003101878650002001909650001901929650001301948650001601961650001301977650001501990650001302005650001102018650003002029650002402059650001302083653003002096653001502126653001402141653002802155653001302183653001202196700001502208700001502223700001302238700001502251700001302266700001402279700001902293700001302312773009302325856009102418852000902509655001202518IND60561083420221120085421.0181010e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056108342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Qin10aTailoring polymeric hybrid micelles with lymph node targeting ability to improve the potency of cancer vaccines  ap. 105-113.  aIt has been widely accepted that lymph nodes (LNs) are critical targets of cancer vaccines and particles sized between 10 and 100 nm with a neutral or negative surface charge are preferred for lymphatic transfer after subcutaneous or intradermal injection. However their limited uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and inadequate retention within LNs undoubtedly restrains their strength on activating T cell immunity. Here, we address this issue by tailoring the physicochemical properties of polymeric hybrid micelles (HMs), which are self-assembled from two amphiphilic diblock copolymers, poly-(ethylene glycol) phosphorethanolamine (PEG-PE) and polyethylenimine-stearic acid conjugate (PSA) via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. We successfully encapsulate melanoma antigen peptide Trp2 and Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR-9) agonist CpG ODN into HMs with a size of sub-30 nm. Their surface characteristics which are found closely related to their in vivo kinetics can be modulated by simply adjusting the molar ratio of PEG-PE and PSA. Our results demonstrated the optimized HMs with an equal mol of PEG-PE and PSA can potently target proximal LNs where their cargos are efficiently internalized by DCs. Furthermore, HMs mediated Trp2/CpG delivery system greatly expands antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and offers a strong anti-tumor effect in a lung metastatic melanoma model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 9 3aagonists 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aantigens 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxic T-lymphocytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunity 3alymph nodes 3amelanoma 3ametastasis 3amicelles 3amodels 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apolyethylene glycol 3avaccines 0aPolymeric hybrid micelles 0aLymph node 0aTargeting 0aCytotoxic T lymphocytes 0aMelanoma 0aVaccine1 aLi, Hanmei1 aJiang, Hao1 aYu, Jiao1 aWang, Ying1 aKe, Huan1 aGong, Tao1 aZhang, Zhirong1 aSun, Xun0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Apr., v. 122 p.105-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009300167300001400260500002000274520094400294592002801238596002201266596003801288650001601326650002501342650001601367650001301383650001401396650001501410650002101425650001501446650001401461650001401475650001401489650001501503650002501518650002001543700002301563700002201586700002101608700001701629700002301646700002101669700002101690700002001711700002801731700002101759700002501780700001701805700002301822700002401845700002401869700002001893700005701913773011101970856008002081852000902161655001202170IND60786910520221121121910.0220806e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078691052DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.135792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamberti, Giorgia10aLAMTOR/Ragulator regulates lipid metabolism in macrophages and foam cell differentiation  ap. 31-42.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLate endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and MAPK and mTOR activator (LAMTOR/Ragulator) is a scaffold protein complex that anchors and regulates multiprotein signaling units on late endosomes/lysosomes. To identify LAMTOR‐modulated endolysosomal proteins, primary macrophages were derived from bone marrow of conditional knockout mice carrying a specific deletion of LAMTOR2 in the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage. Affymetrix‐based transcriptomic analysis and quantitative iTRAQ‐based organelle proteomic analysis of endosomes derived from macrophages were performed. Further analyses showed that LAMTOR could be a novel regulator of foam cell differentiation. The lipid droplet formation phenotype observed in macrophages was additionally confirmed in MEFs, where lipidomic analysis identified cholesterol esters as specifically downregulated in LAMTOR2 knockout cells. The data obtained indicate a function of LAMTOR2 in lipid metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data  cMUI Start Program  aP26682_B21cAustrian Science Fund 3abone marrow 3acell differentiation 3acholesterol 3adroplets 3aendosomes 3afoam cells 3alipid metabolism 3alipidomics 3alysosomes 3amonocytes 3aphenotype 3aproteomics 3ascaffolding proteins 3atranscriptomics1 aDe Smet, Cedric H.1 aAngelova, Mihaela1 aKremser, Leopold1 aTaub, Nicole1 aHerrmann, Caroline1 aHess, Michael W.1 aRainer, Johannes1 aTancevski, Ivan1 aSchweigreiter, Rüdiger1 aKofler, Reinhard1 aSchmiedinger, Thomas1 aVietor, Ilja1 aTrajanoski, Zlatko1 aEjsing, Christer S.1 aLindner, Herbert H.1 aHuber, Lukas A.1 aStasyk, Taras1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0568-68410 tFEBS letters.g2020 Jan., v. 594, no. 1 p.31-42dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016400163300001100327520170000338592002802038650002002066650001702086650002502103650002002128650001402148650001602162650002202178650001202200650001102212650001502223650002202238650001102260650001902271650001102290650001102301650001102312650002302323651000902346700002202355700001902377700001802396700002102414773009002435856008102525852000902606655001202615IND60465779620221122123300.0151225e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046577962DNAL7 a10.1186/s40663-015-0051-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmiri, Neda10aEstimation of conservation value of myrtle (Myrtus communis) using a contingent valuation method: a case study in a Dooreh forest area, Lorestan Province, Iran  ap. 30.  aBACKGROUND: Around 2000 plant species occur naturally in Lorestan Province of which 250 species are medicinal and myrtle is one of them. Myrtle is a shrub whose leaves and fruits have medicinal value and thus, if managed and harvested properly, could produce sustained economic benefits. In recent years, however, over half of the myrtle site areas was destroyed, due to inappropriate management and excessive harvesting practices. Thus, coming up with a practical harvesting approach along with identifying those factors damaging the sites, seems to be very crucial. METHODS: In our investigation, we calculated the conservation value per hectare of myrtle in the Dooreh forest area in Lorestan Province. Using the Contingent Valuation (CV) and Double Bounded Dichotomous Choice (DBDC) methods, we determined the willingness to pay (WTP) for myrtle conservation. The WTP was estimated with a logit model for which indices were obtained based on a maximum precision criterion. RESULTS: The results showed that 86.67 per cent of people were willing to pay for the conservation of these myrtle sites. Average monthly WTP per family was calculated as $0.79. The annual conservation value in terms of WTP for the preservation of the myrtle sites in Dooreh was estimated as $102,525. Among the variables of the model presented, education had a positive impact, while the amount proposed for payment and family size had a negative impact on the WTP. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimate of the value of myrtle conservation should provide justification for policy makers and decision making bodies of natural resources to implement policies in order to conserve the natural sites of this species more effectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyrtus communis 3acase studies 3acontingent valuation 3adecision making 3aeducation 3afamily size 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3afruits 3aharvesting 3aissues and policy 3aleaves 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3apeople 3ashrubs 3awillingness to pay 3aIran1 aEmadian, Seyed F.1 aFallah, Asghar1 aAdeli, Kamran1 aAmirnejad, Hamid0 tForest Ecosystems.g2015 Dec., v. 2, no. 1 p.30-30dBeijing Forestry University7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40663-015-0051-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245015500167300001800322520116800340592002801508650001301536650003001549650001601579650001101595650001501606650001601621650002601637650002901663700002801692700001901720700002001739700002401759773009601783856007801879852000901957655001201966IND60082146820221118051131.0141016e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008214682DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2009006902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesiderio, Claudia10aAnalysis of arginine and methylated metabolites in human plasma by field amplified sample injection capillary electrophoresis tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 1894-1902.  aA CE ion trap tandem MS method was optimised for the analysis of arginine, monomethyl‐ and (symmetric and asymmetric) dimethylarginines in human plasma after a very reduced sample pretreatment step involving a simple protein precipitation with ACN. Several parameters affecting the analytes MS ionization and the capillary electrophoretic separation were carefully studied and optimised. The complete separation of arginine, monomethylarginine and symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine was obtained in formic acid BGE in short analysis time with high specificity due to MS² detection of specific analytes fragments. In order to achieve the detection sensitivity suitable for the analysis of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine in human plasma, the field amplified sample injection was applied. Due to stacking effects, this methodology allowed to operate a consistent on‐line preconcentration of the analytes before running the electrophoresis. The method was validated for linearity, repeatability, recovery and accuracy and applied to the quantitative analysis of arginine, monomethyl‐ and dimethylarginines in human plasma of healthy subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aformic acid 3ahumans 3aionization 3ametabolites 3aquantitative analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aRossetti, Diana Valeria1 aMessana, Irene1 aGiardina, Bruno1 aCastagnola, Massimo0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 June, v. 31, no. 11 p.1894-1902dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2009006903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245013400213520102700347592002801374650001901402650000801421650002201429650001301451650002001464650002001484650001401504650001001518650001501528650001701543650001301560650001401573651001101587653001601598653002001614653000801634653001001642653002501652700006301677773009601740856009001836852000901926655001201935IND60767714720221119093123.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076771472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1063822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Daryl D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7714-245910aMolecular data confirm Triatoma pallidipennis Stål, 1872 (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) as a novel cryptic species complex  aTriatoma pallidipennis constitues one of the most important Chagas disease vector in Mexico. Previous studies based on molecular data suggest T. pallidipennis as a complex of cryptic species. For that reason, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of T. pallidipennis using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial ND4 gene and the ITS-2 gene. In addition, the divergence times were estimated, and possible new taxa were delimited with three species delimitation methods. Finally, genetic distances and possible connectivity routes based on shared haplotypes were obtained among the T. pallidipennis populations. Five haplogroups (possible cryptic species) were found, based on delimitation methods and genetic distances. Haplogroup divergence began about 3 Ma, in the Pleistocene. Moreover, none of the haplogroups showed potential connectivity routes between them, evidencing lack of gene flow. Our results suggest the existence of a new cryptic species complex within what is currently recognized as a T. pallidipennis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aDNA 3aPleistocene epoch 3aTriatoma 3acryptic species 3adisease vectors 3agene flow 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3anew taxa 3aphylogeny 3aMexico 0aTriatomines 0aCryptic species 0aND4 0aITS-2 0aSpecies delimitation1 aArellano, Elizabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8709-95140 tActa tropica.g2022 May, v. 229 p.106382-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1063823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008400163300001300247520095100260592002801211650001701239650002601256650001301282650004101295700001901336700001901355700001401374773009301388856008401481852000901565655001201574IND60113069820221121020540.0141111e20130426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011306982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.07.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCela, R.10aChemometric-assisted method development in reversed-phase liquid chromatography  ap. 2-22.  aThe computer-assisted development of separation procedures in liquid chromatography (LC), which has involved the adaptation of diverse chemometric techniques and the incorporation of successive advances in informatics and computing over a period of more than four decades, has provided chromatographers with commercial and academic tools of great utility.

However, a limiting feature of DIA methods is the sensitivity of detection of low abundant proteins and depth of coverage, which other mass spectrometry approaches address by two-dimensional fractionation (2D) to reduce sample complexity during data acquisition. In this study, we developed a 2D-DIA method intended for rapid- and deeper-proteome analysis compared to conventional 1D-DIA analysis. First, we characterized 96 individual fractions obtained from the protein standard, NCI-7, using a data-dependent approach (DDA), identifying a total of 151,366 unique peptides from 11,273 protein groups. We observed that the majority of the proteins can be identified from just a few selected fractions. By performing an optimization analysis, we identified six fractions with high peptide number and uniqueness that can account for 80% of the proteins identified in the entire experiment. These selected fractions were combined into a single sample which was then subjected to DIA (referred to as 2D-DIA) quantitative analysis. Furthermore, improved DIA quantification was achieved using a hybrid spectral library, obtained by combining peptides identified from DDA data with peptides identified directly from the DIA runs with the help of DIA-Umpire. The optimized 2D-DIA method allowed for improved identification and quantification of low abundant proteins compared to conventional unfractionated DIA analysis (1D-DIA). We then applied the 2D-DIA method to profile the proteomes of two breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, quantifying 6,217 and 6,167 unique proteins in basal- and luminal- tumors, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of high-throughput quantitative proteomics using a novel 2D-DIA method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3adata collection 3afractionation 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis1 aClark, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0527-84691 aSchnaubelt, Michael1 aTeo, Guo Ci1 aLeprevost, Felipe da Veiga1 aBocik, William1 aBoja, Emily S.1 aHiltke, Tara1 aNesvizhskii, Alexey I.1 aZhang, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8726-70980 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 14, v. 92, no. 6 p.4217-4225dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b044183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01361naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245014200167300001600309520032300325592002800648650002100676650002300697650002900720650002200749650001200771700001800783700003100801700001800832773010300850856008500953852000901038655001201047IND60579336220221116164719.0170816e20170203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057933622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b000432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Zhushan,10aRhodium(III)-Catalyzed Ortho Halogenations of N-Acylsulfoximines and Synthetic Applications toward Functionalized Sulfoximine Derivatives  ap. 726-729.  aRhodium(III)-catalyzed ortho brominations and iodinations of N-acylsulfoximines by C–H bond activations have been developed.

Herein, the antimicrobial and proteomic dynamics of RJ stored under different conditions were comprehensively investigated to identify consistent and sensitive markers of RJ degradation. We confirmed the negative correlation between antimicrobial properties and increased the storage temperature and duration in RJ. Using surface plasmon resonance, we showed the protein degradation-induced conformation changes in RJ, which reflected the overall variation in RJ proteins caused by the storage conditions. Further proteomic and western blotting analyses demonstrated the sensitivity and reliability of major RJ protein 4 (MRJP4) as a measure of temperature- and time-dependent RJ changes. Based on these results, we developed a colloidal gold immunoassay strip for MRJP4 detection, providing a reliable, simple, and rapid method for the evaluation of RJ freshness.  aPublisher supplied data  a31970428cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aCAAS-ASTIP-2015-IARcChinese Academy of Agricultural Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005196  aCARS-45cEarmarked Fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research Systemdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009997 3afood chemistry 3afreshness 3agold 3ahealth promotion 3aimmunoassays 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arapid methods 3aroyal jelly 3astorage temperature 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aroyal jelly 0aantimicrobial 0aproteomics 0afreshness marker 0acolloidal gold immunoassay strip1 aWei, Qiaohong1 aSun, Zhihua1 aZhang, Xufeng1 aMa, Juan,1 aFeng, Mao1 aMeng, Lifeng1 aLi, Jianke1 aHan, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6974-86990 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 69, no. 36 p.10731-10740dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c028433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009700167300001200264520118000276592002801456596006001484596010601544650002201650650001301672650001801685650001001703650001701713650001601730650001401746650003001760650001401790650002201804650001401826651001001840700002301850700001801873700002201891700001901913700001901932700001801951700005501969773012802024856008302152852000902235655001202244IND60773985820221118042603.0220511e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077398582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-022-02865-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorat, Vipool10aHydrogenophaga crocea sp. nov. associated with cyanobacterial mat isolated from farmland mud  ap. 265.  aA catalase and oxidase-positive strain BA0156ᵀ was isolated from a cyanobacterial mat collected from the farmland mud cultivated with sugarcane from Ahmednagar, India. The 16S rRNA gene of strain BA0156ᵀ showed the highest percent sequence similarity with Hydrogenophaga borbori LMG 30805ᵀ (98.5%), followed by H. flava DSM 619ᵀ (98.3%) and H. intermedia DSM 5680ᵀ (98.2%).

(RAMPtp) were effective to eliminate intramammary infection in cows. The present study was designed to investigate the immunomodulatory activity of RAMPtp in mouse splenocytes. Splenocyte proliferation, natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity, productions of NO and cytokines, transcription factor activity as well as the signal pathways and receptor were examined. The results showed that RAMPtp significantly promoted splenocyte proliferation and made the cells enter S and G2/M phases, increased ratios of T/B cells, boosted NK cytotoxicity, enhanced transcriptional activities of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1), and stimulated secretions of NO, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and multiple cytokine families (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-γ, TNF-α, G-CSF, GM-CSF, KC, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES and Eotaxin). In addition, all the speciﬁc inhibitors against the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-κB significantly suppressed the IL-6 production induced by RAMPtp. Moreover, splenocytes from Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) deficient mouse responded equally to RAMPtp stimulation as the wild-type. Therefore, RAMPtp might induce splenocytes activation at least in part via the TLR4-independent MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways. The present results would be useful to further understand the immunomodulatory mechanisms of RAMPtp in elimination of intramammary infection in cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptor 4 3acattle diseases 3achemokine CCL3 3achemokine CCL4 3achemokine CCL5 3acows 3acytotoxicity 3agranulocyte colony-stimulating factor 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunomodulators 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-1alpha 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-3 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3apolysaccharides 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3asplenocytes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAtractylodis macrocephalae Koidz. 0aPolysaccharides 0aImmunomodulaton 0aSignaling pathway 0aLymphocytes1 aFang, Sijia1 aCui, Xuemei1 aGuan, Ran1 aWang, Yong1 aShi, Fushan1 aHu, Songhua0 tMolecular immunology.g2019 July, v. 111 p.19-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245010500189300001400294520179500308592002802103650002802131650001002159650001302169650001102182650002402193650001402217650001502231650002402246650001102270650001202281651001202293651001402305651001102319651001102330651001302341651002602354651001002380653002802390653001702418653002702435653001402462653002302476700001902499773013802518856010302656852000902759655001202768IND60127407820221119021649.0151124e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012740782DNAL7 a10.1648/0273-8570(2002)073[0038:DAAOSP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorman, Leah R.10aDistribution and abundance of Snowy Plovers in eastern North America, the Caribbean, and the Bahamas  ap. 38-52.  aSnowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) are small, partially migrant shorebirds that are broadly distributed across North America. Snowy Plover distribution west of the Rocky Mountains has been well described. However, distribution and abundance east of the Rocky Mountains has not received much attention despite current status and ESA listing concerns for Snowy Plovers in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. Thus, a first step in developing a monitoring program for Snowy Plovers is to understand the species' distribution. We summarize information on distribution and abundance of Snowy Plovers in the eastern United States, Caribbean, and Bahamas. Breeding and winter distribution maps for the continental United States were generated from a database of 3563 records from 388 sites in continental North America constructed from International Shorebird Survey (ISS), Christmas Bird Count (CBC), unpublished field data, and published accounts. Comparison of maximum counts per site (1980–present) indicated the number of breeding Snowy Plovers was greatest in Kansas and Oklahoma, while the greatest number of wintering birds occurred in the Laguna Madre of Texas and Mexico. Snowy Plovers concentrate at sites in Oklahoma and Texas during migration, with higher concentrations on the upper Texas coast in spring compared to fall migration. Data regarding historic abundance and trends are limited but suggest that Snowy Plovers in the eastern United States may have experienced regional population declines and may have suffered a range contraction in Texas. Serious concerns about the conservation status of Snowy Plovers in the eastern United States, the Caribbean, and the Bahamas indicate an immediate need for systematic surveys and up-to-date population estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharadrius alexandrinus 3abirds 3abreeding 3acoasts 3aconservation status 3adatabases 3amonitoring 3apopulation dynamics 3aspring 3asurveys 3aBahamas 3aCaribbean 3aKansas 3aMexico 3aOklahoma 3aRocky Mountain region 3aTexas 0aCharadrius alexandrinus 0adistribution 0aEndangered Species Act 0ashorebird 0athreatened species1 aHaig, Susan M.0 tJournal of field ornithology.g2002 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.38-52dNortheastern Bird-Banding AssociationwJournal:19351x0273-85707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1648/0273-8570(2002)073[0038:DAAOSP]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245011100159300002000270520094000290592002801230650001501258650001301273650001901286650001101305650001001316650001401326650001901340650001501359653003701374653004001411653001301451700001501464700005101479700001801530700001801548773015001566856008001716852000901796655001201805IND60750498320221117225534.0210915e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075049832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c028682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Ying10aElimination or Removal of Ethylene for Fruit and Vegetable Storage via Low-Temperature Catalytic Oxidation  ap. 10419-10439.  aEthylene acts as an important hormone to trigger the ripening and senescence of fruits and vegetables (F&V). Thus, it is essential to eliminate trace ethylene and prevent F&V losses effectively. There are several technologies currently applying to control the ethylene concentration in the storage and transportation environment, including adsorption, gene modification, oxidation, etc. These protocols will be compared, and special attention will be paid to the low-temperature catalytic oxidation that has already been applied to practical production in this review. The active sites, supports, and reaction and deactivation mechanism of the catalysts for the low-temperature ethylene oxidation will be discussed and evaluated systematically to provide new insights for the development of effective catalysts, along with the suggestion of some perspectives for future research on this important catalytic system for F&V preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aethylene 3afood chemistry 3afruits 3agenes 3aoxidation 3atransportation 3avegetables 0afruit and vegetable preservation 0alow-temperature catalytic oxidation 0acatalyst1 aLi, Chunli1 aLi, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4151-07071 aYang, Huaming1 aGuan, Junfeng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 69, no. 36 p.10419-10439dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c028683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245013500171300001400306520072800320592002801048650000801076650005201084650002301136650001701159651001101176653006501187653004901252653002701301653003201328653000901360653000701369653000801376653000801384653000901392653000601401653000601407653000601413653000901419653000801428653000801436653000701444653000701451653000901458653001001467653000701477700001801484700001601502700001901518700001901537700001901556700005801575773014501633856009001778852000901868655001201877IND60792447720221122164405.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079244772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2022.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Bolin,12aA collaborative study to establish the national standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) in Taiwan  ap. 31-37.  aThe conventional PCR remains a valuable method to detect the newly emergent coronavirus rapidly and accurately.

Here we study thermally induced reactions of FA on a single-crystalline and nanocrystalline anatase TiO₂(101). We employ a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and density functional theory (DFT) to follow the FA surface intermediates and reaction products above room temperature. We find that the primary reaction products desorbing at about 300, 480, and 515 K are molecular water, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde, respectively. Bidentate (BD) formate and bridging hydroxyl (HOb) are identified as central intermediates in the FA transformations. Bridging oxygen vacancies (VO) are also likely participants despite their low stability at the surface. Furthermore, the parallel studies on single crystals and faceted TiO₂(101) nanoparticles reveal the spectroscopic commonalities of surface species and of the thermal conversion of molecular and deprotonated forms of FA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3acarbon monoxide 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3aformaldehyde 3aformates 3aformic acid 3ananocrystals 3aoxygen1 aWang, Yang1 aWen, Bo1 aWu, Yiqing1 aMa, Runze1 aDahal, Arjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0530-919X1 aGao, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8450-34191 aRousseau, Roger1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1947-04781 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8460-74101 aKimmel, Greg A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4447-24401 aSelloni, A.q(Annabella),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5896-31581 aDohnálek, Zdenek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5999-78670 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Apr. 05, v. 125, no. 14 p.7686-7700dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c005713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006900146245017200215300002000387520118600407592002801593650001801621650001301639650002701652650001501679650004801694650001701742650002801759650001901787650002201806653002901828653002901857653002001886653001701906653001501923653002401938653004901962700006502011700006402076700006502140700006302205700001802268773015002286856008002436852000902516655001202525IND60750498420221117225540.0210915e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075049842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c028732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsquivel-Alvarado, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3557-256210aSynthesis of Fluorescent Proanthocyanidin-Cinnamaldehydes Pyrylium Products for Microscopic Detection of Interactions with Extra-Intestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli  ap. 10700-10708.  aSynthesis of proanthocyanidin-cinnamaldehydes pyrylium products (PCPP) was achieved by the condensation reaction of proanthocyanidins (PAC) with cinnamaldehyde and four cinnamaldehyde derivatives. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) spectra of PCPP show masses that correspond to (epi)catechin oligomers attached to single, double, or triple moieties of cinnamaldehydes. Synthesized PCPP exhibited fluorescence at higher excitation and emission wavelengths than PAC. Results indicate that PCPP were more bioactive for agglutinating extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) compared to PAC. Scanning electron microscopy indicates that PCPP interact with ExPEC surface structures and suggests that PCPP have a higher affinity with the fimbriae-like structures of ExPEC than PAC. Fluorescent microscopy performed on in vitro and in vivo agglutination assays show that PCPP were entrapping ExPEC in a web-like network, thus demonstrating agglutination of ExPEC. This study demonstrated the potential of PCPP to improve our understanding of the temporal and dynamic interactions of PAC in in vitro and in vivo studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagglutination 3acatechin 3acondensation reactions 3adesorption 3aextraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afood chemistry 3aproanthocyanidins 0aA-type interflavan bonds 0aB-type interflavan bonds 0acinnamaldehydes 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0amicroscopy 0aagglutination assay 0aextra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli1 aAlfaro-Viquez, Emilia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8320-60171 aPolewski, Michael A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8759-26641 aKrueger, Christian G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4242-95961 aVestling, Martha M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2902-36661 aReed, Jess D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 69, no. 36 p.10700-10708dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c028733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012700167520173300294592002802027650001602055650002002071650001802091650001402109650002102123650001902144650001402163650002402177650001902201650001302220650001502233650001202248650002302260650001602283650002602299650001802325650002902343650002202372650004402394650001602438653002002454653002902474653002002503653001602523653001602539700001302555700001702568700001802585773010702603856008502710852000902795655001202804IND60680704720221120123159.0200819e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068070472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1139472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Li-Lian10aInfluence of non-dechlorinating microbes on trichloroethene reduction based on vitamin B12 synthesis in anaerobic cultures  aIn this study, the YH consortium, an ethene-producing culture, was used to evaluate the effect of vitamin B₁₂ (VB₁₂) on trichloroethene (TCE) dechlorination by transferring the original TCE-reducing culture with or without adding exogenous VB₁₂. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was applied to detect the concentrations of VB₁₂ and its lower ligand 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) in the cultures. After three successive VB₁₂ starvation cycles, the dechlorination of TCE stopped mostly at cis-dichloroethene (cDCE), and no ethene was found; methane production increased significantly, and no VB₁₂ was detected. Results suggest that the co-cultured microbes may not be able to provide enough VB₁₂ as a cofactor for the growth of Dehalococcoides in the YH culture, possibly due to the competition for corrinoids between Dehalococcoides and methanogens. The relative abundances of 16 S rRNA gene of Dehalococcoides and reductive dehalogenase genes tceA or vcrA were lower in the cultures without VB₁₂ compared with the cultures with VB₁₂. VB₁₂ limitation changed the microbial community structures of the consortia. In the absence of VB₁₂, the microbial community shifted from dominance of Chloroflexi to Proteobacteria after three consecutive VB₁₂ starvation cycles, and the dechlorinating genus Dehalococcoides declined from 42.9% to 13.5%. In addition, Geobacter, Clostridium, and Desulfovibrio were also present in the cultures without VB₁₂. Furthermore, the abundance of archaea increased under VB₁₂ limited conditions. Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina were the predominant archaea in the culture without VB₁₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aDehalococcoides 3aDesulfovibrio 3aGeobacter 3aMethanobacterium 3aMethanosarcina 3acoculture 3acommunity structure 3adechlorination 3aethylene 3ahydrolases 3aligands 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3aribosomal RNA 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atrichloroethylene 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3avitamin B12 0aTrichloroethene 0aReductive dechlorination 0aDehalococcoides 0aMethanogens 0aVitamin B121 aLi, Yaru1 aZhu, Lizhong1 aZhao, He-Ping0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Apr., v. 259 p.113947-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1139473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01661naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011100173500002200284520053300306592002800839650001500867650001200882650002300894650002100917650003300938653001700971653001800988653001201006653001901018653002501037700002301062700002201085700002301107773006401130856008401194852000901278655001201287IND60585341220221120124811.0171109s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058534122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.10.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaloney, T.

OFMSW consists of food waste, vegetable waste and yard trimming. An organic loading between 40 and 120kgVS/m3 was applied in different runs of the bioreactor. The study was aimed to focus on the effects of various factors, such as pH, moisture content (MC), total volatile solids (TVS), volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and CH4 fraction on biogas production. OFMSW witnessed high CH4 yield as 346.65LCH4/kgVS added. A target of 60–70% of CH4 fraction in biogas was set as an optimized condition. The experimental results were statistically optimized by application of ANN model using free forward back propagation in MATLAB environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3abioreactors 3adigestion 3afood waste 3amethane 3amunicipal solid waste 3aneural networks 3apH 3avegetables 3avolatile fatty acids 3awater content 3ayard wastes 0aAnaerobic bioreactor 0aMethane 0aTotal volatile solid 0aArtificial neural network 0aOptimization1 aDhar, Hiya1 aKumar, Sunil1 aThalla, Arun Kumar1 aMukherjee, Somnath1 aWong, Jonathan W.C.0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Oct., v. 217 p.90-99dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01706naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010100166300001800267520081500285592002801100650001501128650001801143650001101161650002401172773015401196856008101350852000901431655001201440IND60627393420221119002333.0190128e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062739342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0973-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinogradov, A.10aFatigue limit and crack growth in ultra-fine grain metals produced by severe plastic deformation  ap. 1797-1808.  aThe experimental results on fatigue resistance of ultra-fine grain metals produced by severe plastic deformation (SPD) are reviewed with regard to two major characteristics of cyclic damage initiation and failure—fatigue limit and fatigue crack growth rate. The fatigue limit benefits considerably from grain refinement down to submicrocrystalline scale. Factors affecting the fatigue limit are discussed in the light of SPD-processing and resultant ultra-fine grain structure. Contrasting with the fatigue limit, the fatigue crack growth threshold deteriorates after SPD in comparison to that of ordinary polycrystals. Possible mechanisms of fatigue crack initiation and propagation are discussed and the guidelines for manufacturing are provided towards enhancement and optimization of fatigue performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguidelines 3amanufacturing 3ametals 3aplastic deformation0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 Mar., v. 42, no. 5 p.1797-1808dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-0973-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245013500167300002000302520107500322592002801397650001901425650001801444650001601462650002301478650002801501650001901529650001601548650001201564650002101576650001801597650001601615650000901631650003901640650001801679653002301697653001901720653001401739653003201753653002601785653004101811700002801852700002201880700002101902700002101923700006201944700006502006773015102071856008002222852000902302655001202311IND60750498520221117225518.0210915e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075049852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c030222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoachie, Ruth T.10aβ-Glucan Interaction with Lentil (Lens culinaris) and Yellow Pea (Pisum sativum) Proteins Suppresses Their In Vitro Digestibility  ap. 10630-10637.  aIn this study, β-glucan interaction with lentil and yellow pea proteins and the effect on in vitro protein digestibility were investigated. Proteins were mixed with β-glucan at mass ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2. The interaction between β-glucan and the proteins was demonstrated by the decrease in transmittance and surface charge and the increase in particle size of the complexes. Bright-field microscopy showed the formation of aggregates between the biopolymers, although increased molecular size was not observed by discontinuous native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that β-glucan formed aggregates with lentil proteins, while the interaction with yellow pea proteins appeared as distinct phases of protein within the β-glucan network. The in vitro protein digestibility of lentil and pea protein decreased by 27.3 and 34.5%, respectively, in the presence of a β-glucan mass ratio of 1:2. The findings confirm the possibility to modulate protein digestibility by changing the physical characteristics of a food matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens culinaris 3aPisum sativum 3abiopolymers 3adigestible protein 3afluorescence microscopy 3afood chemistry 3afood matrix 3alentils 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size 3apea protein 3apeas 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atransmittance 0ayellow pea protein 0alentil protein 0aβ-glucan 0aprotein−fiber interaction 0aprotein digestibility 0asimulated gastrointestinal digestion1 aCommandeur, Mieke M.

However, epidemiological studies showed controversial results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the association between residential exposure to PICs and the risk of leukemia incidence, focusing on exposure-response effects. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published before September 1st, 2019. Observational studies investigating residential exposure to PICs and the risk of leukemia were included. The outcome of interest was the incidence of leukemia comparing to reference groups. Relative risk (RR) was used as the summary effect measure, synthesized by characteristics of populations, distance to PICs, and calendar time in meta-regression. We identified 7 observational studies, including 2322 leukemia cases and substantial reference groups, in this meta-analysis. Residential exposure to PICs within a maximal 8-km distance had a 36% increased risk of leukemia (pooled RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.14–1.62) compared to controls, regardless of sex and age. In terms of leukemia subtypes, residential exposure to PICs was associated with the risks of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, pooled RR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.12–2.31) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, pooled RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.11–6.42). In meta-regression, the positive association occurred after 10 years of follow-up with a pooled RRs of 1.21 (95% CI = 1.02–1.44) and then slightly increased to 1.77 (95% CI = 1.35–2.33) at 30 years after follow-up. No effect modification was found by sex, age, and geographic locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3adatabases 3aepidemiological studies 3aionizing radiation 3alymphocytic leukemia 3ameta-analysis 3amyeloid leukemia 3aobservational studies 3aparticulates 3arelative risk 3asystematic review1 aHsu, Yu-Tien1 aBrown, Kristen D.1 aPokharel, Bibhaw1 aWei, Yaguang1 aChen, Szu-Ta0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Mar., v. 258 p.113476-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01334naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245015300163300001800316520023100334592002800565650002000593650003600613650002300649650002300672650001200695650001300707650002800720700002000748700002400768773013300792856007400925852000900999655001201008IND60660166720221122030831.0190823e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066016672DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc01262c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhmura, Toshimichi10aIridium-catalysed borylation of sterically hindered C(sp³)–H bonds: remarkable rate acceleration by a catalytic amount of potassium tert-butoxide  ap. 6333-6336.  aThe C(sp³)–H bonds located on the methyl groups of an isopropyl group participate in iridium-catalysed C–H borylation with bis(pinacolato)diboron via a significant rate acceleration caused by a catalytic amount of t-BuOK.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron compounds 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3airidium 3amoieties 3apotassium tert-butoxide1 aTorigoe, Takeru1 aSuginome, Michinori0 tChemical communications.g2014 May 20, v. 50, no. 48 p.6333-6336dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc01262c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300001600285520166700301592002801968650001601996650001302012650002002025650003102045650001802076650001002094650001602104650002802120650001802148650001002166650003002176650004302206650002802249650005202277650001402329650001402343650002002357650002002377650001102397650002002408650001602428653001302444653001602457653003302473653001102506653001302517700001902530700001602549700001402565700001402579700001802593700001402611773012102625856008402746852000902830655001202839IND60589581220221122022115.0180223e20180530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058958122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Wenchao10aAnalysis of digital gene expression profiling in the gonad of male silkworms (Bombyx mori) under fluoride stress  ap. 127-134.  aFluorine is an essential element, but excessive fluoride can cause serious effects on the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. Fluorine has been suggested to cause reproductive toxicity in vertebrates, but its potential to reproductively affect invertebrates remains unknown. In the present study, the lepidopteran model insect Bombyx mori was used to assess the reproductive toxicity of NaF. The underlying molecular mechanisms were explored by RNA sequencing, and we investigated the testes transcriptomic profile of B. mori treated with NaF via a digital gene expression (DGE) analysis. Among 520 candidate genes, 297 and 223 were identified as significantly upregulated or downregulated, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were carried out on all genes to determine their biological functions and associated processes. The results indicated that numerous differentially expressed genes are involved in the stress response, detoxification, antibacterial, transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome. The reliability of the data was confirmed by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The changed Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and glutathione (GSH) content in the NaF-treated groups were increased and reduced respectively. This study reveals that using RNA-sequencing for the transcriptome profiling of B. mori testes can lead to better comprehension of the male reproductive toxicity effects of NaF. Furthermore, we expect that these results will aid future molecular studies on the reproductive toxicity of NaF in other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3afluorine 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3ainvertebrates 3amales 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areproductive toxicology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomes 3asilkworms 3asodium fluoride 3astress response 3atestes 3atranscriptomics 3avertebrates 0aFluoride 0aBombyx mori 0aDifferential gene expression 0aTestes 0aToxicity1 aXiao, Yuanyuan1 aLi, Guannan1 aZheng, Xi1 aYin, Yaru1 aWang, Lingyan1 aZhu, Yong0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 May 30, v. 153 p.127-134dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001800169245007700187300001400264520090900278592002801187650002301215650001301238650002001251650001801271650001001289650001901299651001001318653002801328653001201356653001901368653001601387653001201403653002201415653001601437700002201453773013801475856010301613852000901716655001201725IND60127408520221119021949.0151124e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012740852DNAL7 a10.1648/0273-8570(2002)073[0086:TBOBVI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertran, Joan10aTerritorial behavior of Bearded Vultures in response to Griffon Vultures  ap. 86-90.  aGriffon Vultures (Gyps fulvus) are responsible for most cases of usurpation of nests of Bearded Vultures (Gypaetus barbatus). However, little is known about how both species interact during reproduction. We studied territorial behaviour during the breeding season in four Bearded Vulture pairs in the eastern Pyrenees of northeastern Spain. Frequency of agonistic behavior was positively correlated with Griffon Vulture colony size. However, no significantly higher frequency of aggressive interactions was found that suggested actual competition for nest sites between these species. Nonetheless, Bearded Vulture pairs maintained a continuous defence of the area immediately surrounding their nests throughout the breeding season. Our data suggest that the Bearded Vulture's territorial behavior was more closely associated with defence of breeding space than with specific defence of actual nest sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonistic behavior 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3anesting sites 3anests 3aterritoriality 3aSpain 0aaggressive interactions 0aattacks 0abreeding space 0acompetition 0adefence 0aGypaetus barbatus 0aGyps fulvus1 aMargalida, Antoni0 tJournal of field ornithology.g2002 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.86-90dNortheastern Bird-Banding AssociationwJournal:19351x0273-85707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1648/0273-8570(2002)073[0086:TBOBVI]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006200173300001400235520070100249592002800950650001400978650001200992650002101004650001301025650001301038651001701051653000801068653000801076653000801084653003601092653002501128653001101153700002001164700002001184773009601204856008601300852000901386655001201395IND60635840920221120171430.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063584092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2019.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChisadza, Carolyn10aRace and gender biases in student evaluations of teachers  ap. 66-71.  aStudent ratings of teaching (SETs) are vital for academic career trajectories of higher education lecturers. Although student bias against female lecturers is noted in previous studies, mostly in the developed world, the extent to which race affects such ratings has received limited attention. To better understand the role of race and gender bias in SETs, we conduct an experiment in South Africa, where racial bias is highly prevalent. Students are randomly assigned to follow video lectures with identical narrated slides and script but given by lecturers of different race and gender. We find that black lecturers receive lower ratings than white lecturers, particularly from black students.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3afemales 3ahigher education 3astudents 3ateachers 3aSouth Africa 0aI23 0aJ15 0aJ16 0aStudent evaluations of teaching 0aGender and race bias 0aAfrica1 aNicholls, Nicky1 aYitbarek, Eleni0 tEconomics letters.g2019 June, v. 179 p.66-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2019.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002100169245006100190300001400251520084300265592002801108650001001136650002701146650001101173650001801184650001001202650000901212650001301221650001401234650001301248650001101261651001101272653002101283653002101304653001001325653002801335700002201363773013801385856010301523852000901626655001201635IND60127408620221119023125.0151124e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012740862DNAL7 a10.1648/0273-8570(2002)073[0091:FSOGAA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillson, Mary F.10aFishing success of gulls at a southeast Alaska smelt run  ap. 91-96.  aWe observed foraging behavior and success of gulls (Larus spp.) at spawning runs of eulachon (Thaleichthyes pacificus; Osmeridae) in Berners Bay, Alaska, in spring 1996–1998. Adults foraged more effectively (≥56% of dives were successful) than immatures (≤56%) when diving for fish, but there was little difference in the effectiveness of piracy (≤23% success for all gull species and age classes). The hypothesis that larger birds would be better pirates and less likely to lose prey to pirates was not well supported, although smaller species seldom attacked larger ones. Age classes less successful at foraging were more likely to act as pirates, but this relationship did not hold among species or between years.

The stable self-assembled chemisorbed layers, providing protection to metal surface against electrooxidation and capable of blocking propylene carbonate (PC) electroreduction and Li electrodeposition were produced. Reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) indicated cleavage of the S–H bond upon adsorption of species 1–3 with the formation of S–Ag bonds on the metal surface. By cyclic voltammetry, it was found that the primary adsorbate formed on a Au electrode at Eₐd (between −0.2 and −1.2 V vs. SCE) underwent reductive desorption at E < −1.3 V vs. SCE.

In humans and animals, primary bile acids are formed from cholesterol in the liver, converted in the intestine into various secondary bile acids by the intestinal microbiota and reabsorbed in the terminal ileum, and partially returned to the liver. A universal high-throughput workflow, including a simple workup, was applied as a tool for bile acid analysis in animal studies. The complex bile acid profiles in various tissues, organs, and body fluids from different animals were mapped using a newly developed comprehensive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method. The method can also be used in screening food to obtain information about the nutritional content of bile acids. This could be relevant to investigations on various animal diseases and on the bioavailability of bile acids that pass through the gastric tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile 3abile acids 3abioavailability 3acholelithiasis 3acholesterol 3aemulsifying 3afood chemistry 3aileum 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3anutrient content 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aUHPLC-ESI-LC-MS/MS 0atargeted metabolite profiling 0abile acid distribution 0aanimal tissue1 aDunkel, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4445-61441 aDawid, Corinna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5342-26001 aHofmann, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4057-71650 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Sept. 07, v. 69, no. 36 p.10572-10580dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c034333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245009700215300001600312506007600328520071500404592002801119506003701147650001901184650002001203650001601223650001401239650001401253650001501267650001701282700002101299700002401320773008301344856008401427852000901511655001201520IND60553956920221207143658.0161023e20140605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055395692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2014.05.0152doi7 aPMC41036912pmcid7 a249050052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEaswaran, Hariharan10aCancer Epigenetics: Tumor Heterogeneity, Plasticity of Stem-like States, and Drug Resistance  ap. 716-727.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe existence of subpopulations of cells in cancers with increased tumor-initiating capacities and self-renewal potential, often termed “cancer stem cells,” is a much discussed and key area of cancer biology. Such cellular heterogeneity is very important because of its impact on therapy and especially states of treatment resistance. A major question is whether there is plasticity for evolution of these cell states during tumorigenesis that can involve movement between cell populations in a reversible fashion. In this review, we discuss the possible role of epigenetic abnormalities as well as genetic alterations in such dynamics and in the creation of cellular heterogeneity in cancers of all types.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarcinogenesis 3adrug resistance 3aepigenetics 3aevolution 3aneoplasms 3astem cells 3atherapeutics1 aTsai, Hsing-Chen1 aBaylin, Stephen B.,0 tMolecular cell.g2014 June 05, v. 54 p.716-727dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245007800208300001800286520191900304592002802223650001302251650001602264650001402280650002602294650001702320650002402337650001102361650001202372650001502384650001402399650001102413650002302424650001102447651001402458700006102472700006002533700005502593700005702648700002302705773010702728856008302835852000902918655001202927IND60773986720221118042751.0220420e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077398672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-021-01823-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaydon, Trent D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7492-575710aTemporal Variation in the Microbiome of Tropical and Temperate Octocorals  ap. 1073-1087.  aBacterial members of the coral holobiont play an important role in determining coral fitness. However, most knowledge of the coral microbiome has come from reef-building scleractinian corals, with far less known about the nature and importance of the microbiome of octocorals (subclass Octocorallia), which contribute significantly to reef biodiversity and functional complexity. We examined the diversity and structure of the bacterial component of octocoral microbiomes over summer and winter, with a focus on two temperate (Erythropodium hicksoni, Capnella gaboensis; Sydney Harbour) and two tropical (Sinularia sp., Sarcophyton sp.; Heron Island) species common to reefs in eastern Australia. Bacterial communities associated with these octocorals were also compared to common temperate (Plesiastrea versipora) and tropical (Acropora aspera) hard corals from the same reefs. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, bacterial diversity was found to be heterogeneous among octocorals, but we observed changes in composition between summer and winter for some species (C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp.), but not for others (E. hicksoni and Sarcophyton sp.). Bacterial community structure differed significantly between all octocoral species within both the temperate and tropical environments. However, on a seasonal basis, those differences were less pronounced. The microbiomes of C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp. were dominated by bacteria belonging to the genus Endozoicomonas, which were a key conserved feature of their core microbiomes. In contrast to previous studies, our analysis revealed that Endozoicomonas phylotypes are shared across different octocoral species, inhabiting different environments. Together, our data demonstrates that octocorals harbour a broad diversity of bacterial partners, some of which comprise ‘core microbiomes’ that potentially impart important functional roles to their hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcropora 3aSarcophyton 3aSinularia 3abacterial communities 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3acorals 3aislands 3amicrobiome 3aphylotype 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3aAustralia1 aSuggett, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5326-25201 aSiboni, Nachshon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6082-09491 aKahlke, Tim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9762-65731 aCamp, Emma F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1962-13361 aSeymour, Justin R.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2022 May, v. 83, no. 4 p.1073-1087dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01823-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010700169500001900276520105400295592002801349650001801377650001901395650002101414650002601435650002101461650001501482650001501497650001501512650002101527650001401548653002301562653004801585653002401633700001401657700001901671700001801690773010601708856008701814852000901901655001201910IND60714093920221121054251.0210219e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071409392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1241342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xiaoqi10aTriclosan in contact with activated sludge and its impact on phosphate removal and microbial community  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTriclosan (TCS) is applied in a wide range of pharmaceutical and personal care products to prevent or reduce bacterial growth. In this study, the effects of TCS on phosphate removal and bacterial community shifts of activated sludge, especially on functional bacteria variation, were investigated. Compared with the control group (R-control), the treatment group (R-TCS) with 100 μg/L TCS inhibited the microbial growth. In addition, the phosphorus removal efficiency of PO₄³⁻-P and total phosphorus removal rates declined by 15.99% and 7.81%, respectively. Proteobacteria gradually dominated the microorganisms. The growths of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were inhibited when 150 μg/L of TCS was added. Moreover, the differences in the microbial community structures of the R-control and R-TCS groups gradually expanded, no obvious difference was observed in the final stage, and the interrelationships of microbes in the latter weakened. The long-term addition of TCS impairs the growth of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aProteobacteria 3aactivated sludge 3abacterial communities 3abacterial growth 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3atechnology 3atotal phosphorus 3atriclosan 0aPhosphorus removal 0aPolyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) 0aMicrobial community1 aHe, Yuzhe1 aPeng, Xingxing1 aJia, Xiaoshan0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Jan., v. 319 p.124134-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1241343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008000157300001800237500002000255520196900275592002802244650002102272650002002293650002502313650002902338650002102367650001302388650001502401650001802416650001802434650001302452650001302465650001802478650001902496650001202515650001502527651001602542700002002558700001902578700002002597700001802617773013202635856007302767852000902840655001202849IND60587580520221117035056.0180102e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058758052DNAL7 a10.1890/09-1110.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotter, J. D.10aDenitrification and total nitrate uptake in streams of a tropical landscape  ap. 2104-2115.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRapid increases in nitrogen (N) loading are occurring in many tropical watersheds, but the fate of N in tropical streams is not well documented. Rates of nitrate uptake and denitrification were measured in nine tropical low‐order streams with contrasting land use as part of the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment II (LINX II) in Puerto Rico using short term (24‐hour) additions of K¹⁵NO₃ and NaBr. Background nitrate concentrations ranged from 105 to 997 μg N/L, and stream nitrate uptake lengths were long, varying from 315 to 8480 m (median of 1200 m). Other indices of nitrate uptake (mass transfer coefficient, Vf [cm/s], and whole‐stream nitrate uptake rate, U [μg N·m⁻²·s⁻¹]) were low in comparison to other regions and were related to chemical, biological, and physical parameters. Denitrification rates were highly variable (0–133 μg N·m⁻²·min⁻¹; median = 15 μg N·m⁻²·min⁻¹), were dominated by the end product N₂ (rather than N₂O), and were best predicted by whole‐stream respiration rates and stream NO₃ concentration. Denitrification accounted for 1–97% of nitrate uptake with five of nine streams having 35% or more of nitrate uptake via denitrification, showing that denitrification is a substantial sink for nitrate in tropical streams. Whole‐stream nitrate uptake and denitrification in our study streams closely followed first‐order uptake kinetics, indicating that NO₃ uptake is limited by delivery of substrate (NO₃) to the organisms involved in uptake or denitrification. In the context of whole‐catchment nitrogen budgets, our finding that in‐stream denitrification results in lower proportional production of N₂O than terrestrial denitrification suggests that small streams can be viewed as the preferred site of denitrification in a watershed in order to minimize greenhouse gas N₂O emissions. Conservation of small streams is thus critical in tropical ecosystem management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell respiration 3adenitrification 3aecosystem management 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alotic systems 3amass transfer 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3asodium bromide 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aPuerto Rico1 aMcDowell, W.

While Brd4 is considered to be a general transcriptional regulator, pharmacological inhibition of BET proteins shows therapeutic activity in a variety of different pathologies, particularly in models of cancer and inflammation. Such effects have been attributed to a specific set of downstream target genes whose expression is disproportionately sensitive to pharmacological targeting of BET proteins. Emerging evidence links the transcriptional consequences of BET inhibition to the association of Brd4 with enhancer elements, which tend to be involved in lineage-specific gene regulation. Furthermore, Brd4 engages in direct regulatory interactions with several DNA-binding transcription factors to influence their disease-relevant functions. Here we review the current understanding of molecular mechanisms that underlie the promising therapeutic effects of BET bromodomain inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatin 3aenhancer elements 3agenes 3ainflammation 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aVakoc, Christopher R.,0 tMolecular cell.g2014 June 05, v. 54 p.728-736dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001800287520070700305592002801012650001301040650001901053650001901072650001801091650002601109650001601135650001301151650001901164650001601183650002101199650001601220700002101236700002501257700001701282700002001299700002301319700002301342700002801365773012101393856008201514852000901596655001201605IND60627394320221119002346.0220414e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062739432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-2335-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaputo, Gianvito10aDetermination of surface properties of various substrates using TiO2 nanorod coatings with tunable characteristics  ap. 3474-3480.  aWe present a novel approach to cover different substrates with thin light-sensitive layers that consist of organic-capped TiO₂ nanorods (NRs).

This behaviour is reversed under long dark storage. Infrared spectroscopy measurements reveal that light-driven wettability changes are accompanied by a progressive hydroxylation of the TiO₂ surface.

Imputation of missing values was traditionally performed after an observation period, which cannot effectively support water resources management in time. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with the missing data online. Moreover, traditional imputation methods usually consider only one observation variable and generate one set of imputations, which cannot describe the imputation uncertainty. Thus, a multiple-imputation method is proposed in this paper by integrating chain equations and random forest, namely, MICE-RF, to deal with the hydro-meteorological missing values. MICE-RF first simulates multiple imputation series to obtain the optimal imputations using the evaluation results of multiple imputation series. The traditional linear imputation, mean imputation, spline imputation, and k nearest neighbor imputation are compared to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of the MICE-RF. According to the results, the MICE-RF provides the best imputation accuracy and can be easily implemented online.  aPublisher supplied data  a51679186cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019JLZ-15cNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education  a2017JQ5076cNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education  a2019JLZ-16cNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education  a17JK0558cSpecial Scientific Research Program of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department 3aadministrative management 3ahydrometeorology 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3awater1 aLuo, Jungang1 aWang, Jingmin1 aZuo, Ganggang1 aWei, Na0 tWater resources management.g2022 Mar., v. 36, no. 4 p.1159-1173dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-03037-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013300174300001600307520131000323592002801633650001901661650002501680650001501705650001701720650002901737650001501766650002001781650002301801650001501824650002101839650001301860650002501873651001101898653001701909653001701926653001701943653002101960653001801981653003501999700002702034700002002061700002002081700002202101773012102123856008402244852000902328655001202337IND60589581720221120113103.0180223e20180530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058958172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.01.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreitwieser, Marine10aSpatial and temporal impacts of the Skjervøy harbour diesel spill on native population of blue mussels: A sub-Arctic case study  ap. 168-174.  aThis work was designed to investigate biological impacts on blue mussels (Mytilus edulis spp) after being exposed to diesel spill. On December 2013, an 180,000-litre accidental acute diesel spill was reported in a small harbour of northern Norway (Skjervøy). In order to assess the biological effects on the wild population of blue mussels, bivalves were collected at three different locations: at the oil-spill spot, at the other side of the harbour (opposite the oil-spill area), and in an uncontaminated site. Body burden and seawater samples were collected from a few days up to five months after the diesel spill. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and immunological effects were assessed in the blue mussels digestive glands. Our findings reported significant modulation of GST (detoxification), SOD (antioxidant response) and MDA (lipid peroxidation) in bivalves exposed to diesel with a similar response at two and five months after the spill. Laccase-type enzyme also highlighted an important aspect in terms of biomarker response of the immune function. Overall, our study demonstrated that some biomarkers returned to basal levels a few months after the diesel spill. Consequently, it highlighted the usefulness of normalised tools and guidelines for biomonitoring strategies after a diesel spill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3acase studies 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aguidelines 3aimmune response 3alipid peroxidation 3aoil spills 3aoxidative stress 3aseawater 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aNorway 0aBlue mussels 0aDiesel spill 0aHydrocarbons 0aOxidative stress 0aPhenoloxidase 0aHarbour's pollution monitoring1 aThomas-Guyon, Hélène1 aHuet, Valérie,1 aSagerup, Kjetil1 aGeraudie, Perrine0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 May 30, v. 153 p.168-174dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009400172500002200266520060200288592002800890650002300918650002300941650002300964650002100987650004401008650001301052650002201065653002501087653002301112653002101135653002101156653002301177700001701200700002101217773006401238856008401302852000901386655001201395IND60585342020221120084007.0171109s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058534202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.10.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiraga, Yoshikazu10a13C NMR spectroscopic studies of the behaviors of carbonyl compounds in various solutions  aPre-press version  a13C NMR spectroscopic studies were performed for carbonyl compounds having a hydroxyl group, a carboalkoxy group, an acetoxy group, or a carboxyl group in various solvents with different polarities for observation of their behaviors of 13C NMR chemical shifts of carbonyl carbons in solutions.

In the conditions of Southern Uzbekistan, the growth of introduced species takes place in early, more favorable spring terms and is characterized by higher intensity. With the onset of the extreme period (early June), the vast majority of species stop growing. Most species studied have a short growth period. The strategy of adaptation of introduced plants is expressed in reduction of growth period and increase of its rate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprovenance 3aseasonal growth 3aspring 3aUzbekistan1 aShohista, Samatova1 aMuhayyo, Buronova0 tBIO web of conferences.g2021, v. 30 p.04010-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202130040103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245009400214300001600308520087900324592002801203650003101231650001501262650001501277650001201292650001601304650001701320650001301337650002601350650001701376650001901393650001101412650001201423650001101435650001101446653001601457653003001473653001901503653001501522653001101537700002001548700002001568700002901588700002801617700001801645773010601663856008701769852000901856655001201865IND60526726620221119072806.0190409e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052672662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristopher, Meera1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3117-758110aDetoxification of acidic biorefinery waste liquor for production of high value amino acid  ap. 270-275.  aThe current study evaluates the detoxification of acid pretreatment liquor (APL) using adsorbent (ADS 400 & ADS 800) or ion-exchange (A-27MP & A-72MP) resins and its potential for amino acid production.

Of the four resins compared, ADS 800 removed approximately 85% and 60% of furfural and HMF, respectively. ADS 800 could be reused for up to six cycles after regeneration without losing its adsorption properties. The study was further extended by assessing the fermentability of detoxified APL for l-lysine production using wild and mutant strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum.

As for the runoff series with unstable, poor periodicity and non-obvious tendency, this paper solves the problem that the general traditional models are not suitable for the short and medium-term prediction of such runoff series. To describe the nonhomogeneous characteristics of runoff series, a novel prediction model is established based on a nonhomogeneous Markov chain (NHMC-RPM). In this model, the probability distribution function of weekly runoff is obtained and the predicted value is calculated using the expected state. Taking the Yellow River as a case, the prediction results show that the NHMC-RPM is more accurate than other traditional models. The model presented in this work may be used to deal with similar runoff or other series data, as well as provide a practical approach for river managers to predict short and medium-term runoff.  aPublisher supplied data  a61873084cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aZD2017016cthe Foundation of Hebei Education Department 3aMarkov chain 3aadministrative management 3amodels 3aperiodicity 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3arivers 3arunoff 3aYellow River1 aWang, Xiaosheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6034-98431 aPang, Shujiang1 aGuo, Haiying0 tWater resources management.g2022 Mar., v. 36, no. 4 p.1431-1442dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03091-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245009500201300002000296520082800316592002801144650001601172650001901188650001901207650001401226650001901240650001001259650002801269650002201297650001601319653003001335653002701365653002501392700006001417700001801477700001501495700002001510773015101530856008001681852000901761655001201770IND60750499320221117225416.0210915e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075049932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c034962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shilei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3784-199X10aNitrile Hydratases: From Industrial Application to Acetamiprid and Thiacloprid Degradation  ap. 10440-10449.  aThe widespread application of neonicotinoid insecticides (NEOs) in agriculture causes a series of environmental and ecological problems. Microbial remediation is a popular approach to relieve these negative impacts, but the associated molecular mechanisms are rarely explored. Nitrile hydratase (NHase), an enzyme commonly used in industry for amide production, was discovered to be responsible for the degradation of acetamiprid (ACE) and thiacloprid (THI) by microbes. Since then, research into NHases in NEO degradation has attracted increasing attention. In this review, microbial degradation of ACE and THI is briefly described. We then focus on NHase evolution, gene composition, maturation mechanisms, expression, and biochemical properties with regard to application of NHases in NEO degradation for bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetamiprid 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3aevolution 3afood chemistry 3agenes 3aindustrial applications 3anitrile hydratase 3athiacloprid 0aneonicotinoid insecticide 0aindustrial application 0amaturation mechanism1 aZhou, Jiangsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8822-45801 aJiang, Jihong1 aDai, Yijun1 aSheng, Miaomiao0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 69, no. 36 p.10440-10449dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c034963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03674naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012200171300001600293520184800309592002802157650001902185650001502204650001602219650001802235650002102253650003502274650002302309650001402332650002202346650001502368650002002383650001002403650002802413650001802441650004302459650005202502650001102554650002002565650002102585650002902606650001602635650001602651653001602667653001602683653001502699653001402714653003002728700002502758700003102783700002102814700003502835773012102870856008402991852000903075655001203084IND60589581820221120113126.0180223e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058958182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Monica,10aBisphenol A (BPA) modulates the expression of endocrine and stress response genes in the freshwater snail Physa acuta  ap. 132-138.  aBisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) that can mimic the action of oestrogens by interacting with hormone receptors, is potentially able to influence reproductive functions in vertebrates and invertebrates. The freshwater pulmonate Physa acuta is a sensitive organism to xenobiotics appropriate for aquatic toxicity testing in environmental studies. This study was conducted to explore the effects of BPA on the Gastropoda endocrine system. The effects following a range of exposure times (5–96h) to BPA in P. acuta were evaluated at the molecular level by analysing changes in the transcriptional activity of the endocrine-related genes oestrogen receptor (ER), oestrogen-related receptor (ERR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR), as well as in genes involved in the stress response, such as hsp70 and hsp90. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that BPA induced a significant increase in the mRNA levels of ER, ERR, and RXR, suggesting that these receptors could be involved in similar pathways or regulation events in the endocrine disruptor activity of this chemical at the molecular level in Gastropoda. Additionally, the hsp70 expression was upregulated after 5 and 72h of BPA exposures, but hsp90 was only upregulated after 5h of BPA exposure. Finally, we assessed the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity after BPA treatment and found that it was affected after 48h. In conclusion, these data provide, for the first time, evidences of molecular effects produced by BPA in the endocrine system of Gastropoda, supporting the potential of ER, ERR and RXR as biomarkers to analyse putative EDCs in ecotoxicological studies. Moreover, our results suggest that P. acuta is an appropriate sentinel organism to evaluate the effect of EDCs in the freshwater environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysella acuta 3abiomarkers 3abisphenol A 3aecotoxicology 3aendocrine system 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogens 3aexposure duration 3afreshwater 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asnails 3astress response 3atoxicity testing 3atranscription (genetics) 3avertebrates 3axenobiotics 0aPhysa acuta 0aBisphenol A 0aHeat shock 0aHsp genes 0aGlutathione-S-Transferase1 aMartínez-Paz, Pedro1 aSánchez-Argüello, Paloma1 aMorcillo, Gloria1 aMartínez-Guitarte, José Luis0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 May 15, v. 152 p.132-138dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006000163300001800223520072300241592002800964650001300992650002301005650001901028650002201047700001701069700001601086700001701102773012101119856008201240852000901322655001201331IND60627394520221119002054.0220414e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062739452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-2336-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapozza, R.10aBoundary-lubricated friction in presence of a nano-well  ap. 3435-3440.  aThe advantage of surface macro- and micro-scopic patterning has been recently proved for improving tribological performances of mechanical sliding contacts. The effects of scaling down the texturing dimensions to the nanoscale have not yet been investigated to a comparable extent. By means of classical Molecular Dynamics simulations, we show that the frictional behavior of a thin film in boundary-lubricated regime is significantly affected by the presence of nanoscale superficial patterning of the moving confining walls, leading to a significant suppression of the high dissipative stick-slip dynamics and a consequent friction reduction. We believe these findings to be relevant for nanotechnology applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3amolecular dynamics 3ananotechnology 3asimulation models1 aFasolino, A.1 aVanossi, A.1 aFerrario, M.0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 May, v. 43, no. 10 p.3435-3440dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-007-2336-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010300170300001600273520197500289592002802264650001202292650001802304650001102322650001702333650004102350650002102391650004402412650001402456650000902470650002602479650001402505650002002519650001102539650001602550650002102566650001502587653001402602653003102616653002002647653001202667653000802679700003202687700001902719700001802738700002102756773012402777856008302901852000902984655001202993IND60635841820221120171413.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063584182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2019.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmer, Mohammad W.10aCharacterization of Jordanian oil shale and variation in oil properties with pyrolysis temperature  ap. 219-226.  aMarine oil shale from the Sultani mine was characterized (ultimate and proximate analysis, 13C NMR, differential thermogravimetry (DTG)). The 13C NMR indicated that the shale is highly aliphatic, and the concentration of carbonyl carbon is small. DTG indicated a total weight loss of 21 wt% to 550 °C. The shale was pyrolysed to different final temperatures in the range 360–540 °C under N2 and the shale oils produced characterized by utilization parameters (API, heating value, boiling point distribution) and by chemical properties (1H-NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC–MS) as a function of final pyrolysis temperature. Previous studies have only investigated the utilization properties of marine-shale oil at one temperature. The average oil yield increased with pyrolysis temperature to a maximum at 520 °C, and then fell. The oil density was higher at 440–520 °C than at 360–400 °C (0.99–1.00, 0.96−0.97 g/cm3 respectively). Unexpectedly, oil heating value (39.7–40.0 MJ/kg in 360–540 °C) and sulfur content (11.25 wt% in 360–520 °C) were independent of pyrolysis temperature. Oil distillation indicated that up to 90 vol% was in the diesel fraction.1H-NMR implied that the oil produced at all temperatures was highly aliphatic. GC/MS for the oil indicated the presence of long chain hydrocarbons (C11-C32), both normal and branched, some substituted benzenes, and high concentrations of sulfur compounds, mainly substituted thiophenes with same benzothiophenes. The average molecular weight of the sulfur compounds and proportion of heavier oil were higher at 520 °C than at 460 °C, so that the increased yield of oil at higher temperatures would have to be balanced against the lower quality of the crude shale oil produced. The results emphasized the importance of studying oil properties as a function of pyrolysis temperature, as differences which could be important in practice were noted.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3aboiling point 3acarbon 3adistillation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoil shale 3aoils 3aproximate composition 3apyrolysis 3astable isotopes 3asulfur 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3athiophenes 0aOil shale 0aBoiling point distribution 0aCalorific value 0aGC–MS 0aNMR1 aAljariri Alhesan, Jameel S.1 aMarshall, Marc1 aAwwad, Akl M.1 aAl-Ayed, Omar S.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2019 June, v. 140 p.219-226dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2019.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009700161300002000258520120900278592002801487650002101515650002801536650001201564650001801576650001701594650001901611650002201630650001801652650001401670650001601684650001701700650001701717650001501734650001101749650001301760653003101773653001901804653001201823653001501835653001001850700001401860700001601874700001601890700001701906700001601923700005701939700001701996700005302013773015102066856008002217852000902297655001202306IND60750499420221117225401.0210915e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075049942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c035332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBu, Yushan10aComparative Metabolomics Analyses of Plantaricin Q7 Production by Lactobacillus plantarum Q7  ap. 10741-10748.  aPlantaricin Q7 is a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum Q7 with food preservation potential. Low yield is one of the bottlenecks of the wide application of plantaricin Q7. Nontargeted metabolomics was performed to reveal the mechanism of plantaricin Q7 biosynthesis. The results showed that the composition and abundance of intracellular metabolites varied significantly at key time points of plantaricin Q7 synthesis. Differential metabolic pathways were purine metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; amino acid biosynthesis; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; and ABC transporters. Differential metabolites were xanthine, deoxyadenosine, uracil, 5-methylcytosine, α-ketoglutarate, γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, glutamine, and tryptophan. Based on metabolomics information, the putative metabolic synthesis pathway of plantaricin Q7 was proposed. Glutamine, glutamate, and 5-methylcytosine could be critical metabolites and simulate plantaricin Q7 biosynthesis significantly (P < 0.05). Bacteriocin production was investigated by comparative metabolomics in this report, which could help to achieve higher plantaricin Q7 yield by metabolic regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5-methylcytosine 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aalanine 3aaspartic acid 3abiosynthesis 3afood chemistry 3afood preservation 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aplantaricins 3atryptophan 3auracil 3axanthine 0aLactobacillus plantarum Q7 0aplantaricin Q7 0apathway 0ametabolite 0ayield1 aYang, Hui1 aLi, Jianxun1 aLiu, Yinxue1 aLiu, Tongjie1 aGong, Pimin1 aZhang, Lanwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3459-29751 aWang, Shumei1 aYi, Huaxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8968-42630 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Sept. 03, v. 69, no. 36 p.10741-10748dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c035333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245012300165300001800288500002000306520183400326592002802160650001702188650002402205650002002229650000902249650001902258650002502277650001502302650000902317650001402326650001302340650002602353650001402379650001502393650002502408650001202433650001602445651002302461651001102484700002102495700002202516700001702538773013202555856007302687852000902760655001202769IND60587580820221117034640.0180102e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058758082DNAL7 a10.1890/09-0611.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAinsworth, Cameron H.12aA statistical approach for estimating fish diet compositions from multiple data sources: Gulf of California case study  ap. 2188-2202.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTrophic ecosystem models are one promising tool for providing ecosystem‐based management advice. Diet and interaction rate parameters are critical in defining the behavior of these models, and will greatly influence any predictions made in response to management perturbations. However, most trophic ecosystem models must rely on a patchwork of data availability and must contend with knowledge gaps and poor quantification of uncertainty. Here we present a statistical method for combining diet information from field samples and literature to describe trophic relationships at the level of functional groups. In this example, original fieldwork in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico, provides gut content data for targeted and untargeted fish species. The field data are pooled with diet composition information from FishBase, an online data repository. Diet information is averaged across stomachs to represent an average predator, and then the data are bootstrapped to generate likelihood profiles. These are fit to a Dirichlet function, and from the resulting marginal distributions, maximum‐likelihood estimates are generated with confidence intervals representing the likely contribution to diet for each predator–prey combination. We characterize trophic linkages into two broad feeding guilds, pelagic and demersal feeders, and explore differentiation within those guilds. We present an abbreviated food web for the northern Gulf of California based on the results of this study. This food web will form the basis of a trophic dynamic model. Compared to the common method of averaging diet compositions across predators, this statistical approach is less influenced by the presence of long tails in the distributions, which correspond to rare feeding events, and is therefore better suited to small data sets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3adiet 3adynamic models 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3afish 3afood webs 3amoieties 3anutrition information 3apredators 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 3astomach 3auncertainty 3aGulf of California 3aMexico1 aKaplan, Isaac C.1 aLevin, Phillip S.1 aMangel, Marc0 tEcological applications.g2010 Dec., v. 20, no. 8 p.2188-2202dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-0611.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009300155300001800248500002000266520124500286592002801531650002401559650001101583650002901594650001201623650001701635650001201652651002101664700001901685700001601704700002301720773013201743856007301875852000901948655001201957IND60587580920221117034555.0180102e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058758092DNAL7 a10.1890/09-1818.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBryan, Jane10aImpact of logging on aboveground biomass stocks in lowland rain forest, Papua New Guinea  ap. 2096-2103.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGreenhouse‐gas emissions resulting from logging are poorly quantified across the tropics. There is a need for robust measurement of rain forest biomass and the impacts of logging from which carbon losses can be reliably estimated at regional and global scales. We used a modified Bitterlich plotless technique to measure aboveground live biomass at six unlogged and six logged rain forest areas (coupes) across two ∼3000‐ha regions at the Makapa concession in lowland Papua New Guinea. “Reduced‐impact logging” is practiced at Makapa. We found the mean unlogged aboveground biomass in the two regions to be 192.96 ± 4.44 Mg/ha and 252.92 ± 7.00 Mg/ha (mean ± SE), which was reduced by logging to 146.92 ± 4.58 Mg/ha and 158.84 ± 4.16, respectively. Killed biomass was not a fixed proportion, but varied with unlogged biomass, with 24% killed in the lower‐biomass region, and 37% in the higher‐biomass region. Across the two regions logging resulted in a mean aboveground carbon loss of 35 ± 2.8 Mg/ha. The plotless technique proved efficient at estimating mean aboveground biomass and logging damage. We conclude that substantial bias is likely to occur within biomass estimates derived from single unreplicated plots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alogging 3arain forests 3atropics 3aPapua New Guinea1 aShearman, Phil1 aAsh, Julian1 aKirkpatrick, J.

According to FAO the average consumption of foods of vegetable origin in people’s diet is increasing. Due to inadequate conditions during storage of foods of vegetable origin, there is possibility of contamination by mold that produces mycotoxins. Since the intake of these products in organism has been increased, there is a risk of exposure to mycotoxins and their harmful effect on the consumers’ health. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of aflatoxin B1 in products of vegetable origin (cereals, nuts and spices). Aflatoxin B1 was determined by enzyme-imunochemical method (ELISA), using commercial kit. 38 samples were tested. In 25 analyzed samples, the content of aflatoxin B1 was higher than 1 μg/kg (1 μg/kg is limit of detection). Out of the total number of tested samples, in 18 samples the content of aflatoxin B1 was determined higher than the allowed amount for this product group by the current regulations (2 μg/kg for cereals, 2 μg/kg for nuts and 5 μg/kg for spices).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaflatoxin B1 3adetection limit 3adiet 3ahuman nutrition 3apeople 3arisk 3avegetables 0aaflatoxin B1 0afoodstuffs of vegetable origin 0aELISA 0asafety1 aGrujić, Radoslav D.1 aIvanović, Marko M.1 aMarjanović-Balaban, Željka R.1 aVujadinović, Dragan P.1 aVukić, Milan S.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2017, v. 2017, no. 133 p.29-35dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x2406-08287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN1733029G3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245012000214300001600334506007600350520122100426592002801647506003701675650001501712650001401727650001301741650001601754650001201770650001201782650001301794650001401807650002001821650001301841650001501854700001601869700002501885700002601910700002401936700002201960773008301982856008402065852000902149655001202158IND60553957520221207141120.0161023e20140717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055395752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2014.05.0212doi7 aPMC41040282pmcid7 a249549042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDooley, Hannah C.10aWIPI2 Links LC3 Conjugation with PI3P, Autophagosome Formation, and Pathogen Clearance by Recruiting Atg12–5-16L1  ap. 238-252.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMammalian cell homeostasis during starvation depends on initiation of autophagy by endoplasmic reticulum-localized phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) synthesis. Formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that engulf cytosolic components requires the LC3-conjugating Atg12–5-16L1 complex. The molecular mechanisms of Atg12–5-16L1 recruitment and significance of PtdIns(3)P synthesis at autophagosome formation sites are unknown. By identifying interacting partners of WIPIs, WD-repeat PtdIns(3)P effector proteins, we found that Atg16L1 directly binds WIPI2b. Mutation experiments and ectopic localization of WIPI2b to plasma membrane show that WIPI2b is a PtdIns(3)P effector upstream of Atg16L1 and is required for LC3 conjugation and starvation-induced autophagy through recruitment of the Atg12–5-16L1 complex. Atg16L1 mutants, which do not bind WIPI2b but bind FIP200, cannot rescue starvation-induced autophagy in Atg16L1-deficient MEFs. WIPI2b is also required for autophagic clearance of pathogenic bacteria. WIPI2b binds the membrane surrounding Salmonella and recruits the Atg12–5-16L1 complex, initiating LC3 conjugation, autophagosomal membrane formation, and engulfment of Salmonella.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3aautophagy 3abacteria 3ahomeostasis 3amammals 3amutants 3amutation 3apathogens 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3astarvation1 aRazi, Minoo1 aPolson, Hannah E.J.1 aGirardin, Stephen E.1 aWilson, Michael I.1 aTooze, Sharon A.0 tMolecular cell.g2014 July 17, v. 55 p.238-252dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2014.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010500162300001800267520099100285592002801276650002101304650002201325650001901347650001501366650000901381650001301390650001401403650001101417650001401428650001301442650001101455650001201466700002001478700001501498700002101513700001701534773012101551856008201672852000901754655001201763IND60627394820221119002502.0220414e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062739482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-2402-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaz, A.

Various test patterns (squares and lines) were deposited for electrical characterization of the films, using 2- and 4-terminal measurements. Tests with parallel Pt lines were also carried out, and considerable leakage was detected for the interline distances in the sub-micron range. We investigated two ways to decrease the leakage current: inducing surfaces roughness and using an oxygen plasma after patterns deposition. A method of dielectrophoresis with an AC electric field was applied to align and deposit metallic multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) between pre-fabricated metal, gold, and palladium electrodes with a micron-scale separation. Further, using focused electron and ion beam-deposited Pt contacts in two different configurations (“Pt-on-CNT” and “CNT-on-Pt”), 4-terminal measurements have been performed to evaluate intrinsic nanotube resistances.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3asilica 3asilicon1 ada Silva, M.

For example, the exploitation fraction for the northern stock of Pacific sardine in the Northeastern Pacific is a function of sea-surface temperature (SST). The functional relationship changes, however, because our perception of the environmental effects on sardine recruitment is based on assessment models that are periodically updated with new input data and assumptions. In this paper, we use data from recent stock assessments to re-examine previously identified correlations of sardine recruitment success (the logarithmic ratio of recruitment and spawning stock biomass) with indices of SST off Southern California and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We show that the earlier correlation with SST is likely invalid, and the persistent correlation with the PDO is weaker. Because many environmental stock-recruitment relationships fail upon re-examination, environmental proxies for fish productivity might not always prescribe the correct amount of fishing mortality and should be avoided. Alternatively, for species assessed periodically, dynamic fishing mortalities could be based on measurements of recent stock productivity inferred directly from surveys, or from the results of analytical assessments based on those observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSardinops sagax 3abiomass 3aenvironmental impact 3amodels 3amortality 3apelagic fish 3asardines 3aspawning 3asurface water temperature 3asurveys 3aCalifornia 0aRecruitment 0aPrediction 0aEnvironment 0aManagement1 aDemer, David A.0 tFisheries research.g2019 Aug., v. 216 p.120-125dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014900168300001500317520161500332592002801947650001501975650001601990650001402006650001202020650000902032650001402041650000902055650002002064650002302084650001802107650002502125651001002150653001802160653001802178653003102196653002202227653003402249700001302283700001302296700001602309700001602325700001702341700001602358773012002374856008402494852000902578655001202587IND60589582020221120113058.0180223e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058958202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ming-hong10aPollution patterns and underlying relationships of benzophenone-type UV-filters in wastewater treatment plants and their receiving surface water  ap. 98-103.  aThe environmental behaviors of emerging pollutants, benzophenone-type UV filters (BP-UV filters) and their derivatives were investigated in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their receiving surface waters in Shanghai. The concentration level of selected BP-UV filters in the WWTPs was detected from ngL⁻¹ to μgL⁻¹. BP (621–951ngL⁻¹) and BP-3 (841-1.32 × 10³ngL⁻¹) were the most abundant and highest detection frequency individuals among the target BP-UV filters in influents, whereas BP (198–400ngL⁻¹), BP-4 (93.3–288ngL⁻¹) and BP-3 (146–258ngL⁻¹) were predominant in effluents. BP-UV filters cannot be completely removed and the total removal efficiency varied widely (−456% to 100%) during the treatment process. It can be inferred that the usage of BP and BP-3 are higher than other BP-UV filters in the study area. The lowest and highest levels were BP-2 (ND-7.66ngL⁻¹) and BP-3 (68.5-5.01 × 10³ng L⁻¹) in the receiving surface water, respectively. Interestingly, the seasonal variation of BP-3 is larger than those of other BP-UV filters in surface water from Shanghai. There is no obvious pollution pattern of BP-UV filters in the surface water from the cosmetic factory area. The correlation analysis of BP-UV filters between WWTPs effluents and nearby downstream water samples suggested that BP-UV filters emitted from some WWTPs might be the main source of receiving surface water. Preliminary risk assessment indicated that the levels of BP-UV filters detected by the effluent posed medium to high risk to fish as well as other aquatic organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3acorrelation 3aeffluents 3afilters 3afish 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aBP-UV filters 0aSurface water 0aWastewater treatment plant 0aCosmetics factory 0aEnvironmental risk assessment1 aLi, Jian1 aXu, Gang1 aMa, Luo-dan1 aLi, Jia-jun1 aLi, Jin-song1 aTang, Liang0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2018 May 15, v. 152 p.98-103dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017500168300001800343520181800361592002802179650001202207650001402219650001802233650001302251650002102264650001202285650001602297650002402313650002402337650001402361650001502375650001802390650001202408650001602420650001502436650001702451650002002468650002202488650001202510650001302522650001502535700002002550700001902570700002102589700005502610773010702665856008302772852000902855655001202864IND60773987320221118042649.0220420e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077398732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-021-01818-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVora, Siddhi M.10aAlterations of Primary Metabolites in Root Exudates of Intercropped Cajanus cajan–Zea mays Modulate the Adaptation and Proteome of Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) fredii NGR234  ap. 1008-1025.  aLegume-cereal intercropping systems, in the context of diversity, ecological function, and better yield have been widely studied. Such systems enhance nutrient phytoavailability by balancing root-rhizosphere interactions. Root exudates (RE) play an important role in the rhizospheric interactions of plant-plant and/or plant-microbiome interaction. However, the influence of the primary metabolites of RE on plant-rhizobia interactions in a legume-cereal intercrop system is not known. To understand the plant communication with rhizobia, Cajanus cajan-Zea mays intercropped plants and the broad host range legume nodulating Ensifer fredii NGR234 as the model plants and rhizobium used respectively. A metabolomics-based approach revealed a clear separation between intercropped and monocropped RE of the two plants. Intercropped C. cajan showed an increase in the myo-inositol, and proline, while intercropped Z. mays showed enhanced galactose, D-glucopyranoside, and arginine in the RE. Physiological assays of NGR234 with the RE of intercropped C. cajan exhibited a significant enhancement in biofilm formation, while intercropped Z. mays RE accelerated the bacterial growth in the late log phase. Further, using label-free proteomics, we identified a total of 2570 proteins of NGR234 covering 50% annotated protein sequences upon exposure to Z. mays RE. Furthermore, intercropped Z. mays RE upregulated bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP), putative nitroreductase, IlvD, LeuC, D (branched-chain amino acid proteins), and chaperonin proteins GroEL2. Identification offered new insights into the metabolome of the legume-cereal intercrop and proteome of NGR234-Z. mays interactions that underline the new molecular candidates likely to be involved in the fitness of rhizobium in the intercropping system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnsifer 3aRhizobium 3aSinorhizobium 3aarginine 3abacterial growth 3abiofilm 3achaperonins 3acontinuous cropping 3aecological function 3agalactose 3ahost range 3aintercropping 3alegumes 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3amyo-inositol 3anitroreductases 3aphytoaccumulation 3aproline 3aproteome 3aproteomics1 aAnkati, Sravani1 aPatole, Chhaya1 aPodile, Appa Rao1 aArchana, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1134-82240 tMicrobial ecology.g2022 May, v. 83, no. 4 p.1008-1025dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01818-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015100171300001600322520136200338592002801700650001201728650002501740650002001765650001001785650002201795650001301817650001501830650003301845650001701878650002501895650001801920650001201938650001301950700002201963700002101985773011102006856008102117852000902198655001202207IND50066589520221116212459.0161105e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006658952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10152-012-0326-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfaya, José E.

To characterize its genetic diversity, population structure and recent demographic history, we conducted the first genetic survey on this species, using sequence data for the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI), 16S rRNA (16S) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2). Only four different ITS2 genotypes were found in the whole sample, and the two main haplotypes identified in the mitochondrial dataset were present among all localities with a diversity ranging from 0.583 to 0.939. Nucleotide diversity was low (π = 0.001–0.002). No significant genetic structure was detected between populations, and mismatch distribution patterns and neutrality tests results are consistent with a population in expansion or under selection. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the largest level of variance observed was due to intrapopulation variation (100, 100 and 94.39 % for 16S, COI and ITS2, respectively). F ₛₜ values were also non-significant. The observed lack of population structure is likely due to high levels of genetic connectivity in combination with the lack or permeability of biogeographic barriers and episodes of habitat modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanopea 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adata collection 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3ahaplotypes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apermeability 3apopulation structure 3aribosomal RNA 3asurveys 3avariance1 aBigatti, Gregorio1 aMachordom, Annie0 tHelgoland marine research.g2013 June, v. 67, no. 2 p.407-412dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1438-387X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10152-012-0326-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012300171300001600294520103300310592002801343650001401371650001901385650001401404650001501418650001301433650002301446650000901469650001401478650001301492650001401505650002001519650001601539650001101555700002401566773009601590856008401686852000901770655001201779IND60113067220221120204639.0141111e20130419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011306722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.02.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruno, Thomas J.10aMethod and apparatus for pyrolysis—Porous layer open tubular column—Cryoadsorption headspace sampling and analysis  ap. 192-199.  aIn previous work, dynamic headspace vapor collection on short, porous layer open tubular (PLOT) capillary columns maintained at low temperature was introduced. In this paper, that metrology is extended with the introduction of a small in situ pyrolysis platform that provides for rapid heating and rapid vapor capture for a wide variety of samples. The new approach is referred to as pyro-PLOT-cryo. The pyrolysis platform is made from two small copper lead wires that hold a basket formed from small diameter, high resistance stainless steel or NiCr wire. The basket is formed to accept a small sample, the mass of which can typically range from 0.2 to 0.05mg. The pyrolysis is performed by use of a resistor capacitor circuit of the type used in spot welders. We have provided examples of the application of this technique with the analysis of facial cosmetics, plastic explosives, organometallic gasoline additives, polymers, and in micro scale chemical reactions. Additional modifications and future work are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3achromatography 3acosmetics 3aexplosives 3agasoline 3aheadspace analysis 3aheat 3ametrology 3apolymers 3apyrolysis 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3avapors1 aNichols, Jessica E.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Apr. 19, v. 1286 p.192-199dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.02.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245005000159300001600209520126700225592002801492650001001520650001201530650002301542650001201565650002101577650001301598650001701611651001101628700001601639773010801655856007401763852000901837655001201846IND60082142220221118051017.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008214222DNAL7 a10.1111/agec.121202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeinerman, Eli10aPerennial crops under stochastic water supply  ap. 757-766.  aPerennial crops require substantial initial investment in groundwork and planting, as well as a multiyear gestation period without commercial yield. Therefore, a crop's cycle (from planting to felling) should be long enough in order to cover the fixed cost and become profitable. The problem becomes involved when the cycle's duration is stochastic due to occurrence of uncertain event that terminates the cycle prematurely. Studying orchard management under stochastic drought events, we show that to each perennial crop that is profitable without drought hazard, there exists a critical drought hazard above which the crop turns loss making. We refer to this critical drought hazard as the crop's drought vulnerability index and show that it increases with the length of the gestation period, the ratio of fixed cost to average annual profit and the interest rate, and decreases with the natural (uninterrupted) cycle length. We then investigate the economic value of a stable water source, such as recycled water, that stabilizes the water supply and diminishes the drought hazard. An empirical application in northern Israel reveals that the stabilization value of recycled water due to its role in eliminating the drought hazard far exceeds its supply cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3adrought 3aeconomic valuation 3afelling 3agestation period 3aplanting 3awater supply 3aIsrael1 aTsur, Yacov0 tAgricultural economics.g2014 Nov., v. 45, no. 6 p.757-766dElsevierwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.121203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013500171300001600306520164700322592002801969650001801997650001402015650001102029650001402040650002702054650001702081700001702098700001902115700001302134700002002147773012402167856008602291990002302377852000902400655001202409IND60093726420221123024911.0141103e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009372642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2011.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qinghua10aDetermination and resolution of non-UV–visible absorptive component during a kinetic process with modified soft modeling methods  ap. 131-138.  aSoft modeling (SM) methods can be used to resolve spectroscopic data from complicated reaction processes with unknown kinetics, with the exception of data containing a component for which there is no spectroscopic information available, such as an intermediate that does not absorb in the UV–visible region. In this work, modified SM methods were developed to resolve these undetectable components. Based on the mass balance principle, the mass balance error (MBE) method was first applied to determine whether the undetectable component existed. Next, the evolving error analysis (EEA) method was developed to search the local mass balance region (LMBR) where the concentration of the non-absorptive component was low enough to be neglected. In the LMBR, the concentration profiles of all absorptive components were scaled according to least squares regression. Subsequently, more reliable results were obtained using the evolving time region iteration (ETRI) method. Based on the mass balance principle, the concentration profile of the undetectable component was resolved for the entire time period. Both simulated and experimental data from an autocatalytic reaction were used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. In the autocatalytic oxidation of sodium oxalate by acidic potassium permanganate, the product Mn(II) was determined to be non-absorptive. Using the methods described above, the pure spectra of three other absorptive components and the scaled concentration profiles of four Mn species, including two intermediates, were all resolved. As a result, the mechanism of the reaction was more clearly described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aleast squares 3amanganese 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apotassium permanganate 3aspectroscopy1 aFeng, Xinwei1 aZhang, Dezhun,1 aZhao, Yi1 aZhu, Zhongliang0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 109, no. 2 p.131-138dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2011.08.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013000163300001600293520104400309592002801353650002201381650002401403650001101427650001501438650001101453650001701464650002101481653001201502653004501514653003001559653004401589653001901633700001901652700001301671700002001684700001701704700001601721700002001737773009501757856008501852852000901937655001201946IND60562812820221122134106.0180831e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056281282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Dong10aEffects of total solids content on performance of sludge mesophilic anaerobic digestion and dewaterability of digested sludge  ap. 188-193.  aThe role of total solids (TS) content on sludge mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) was investigated in batch reactors. A range of TS below 10% was evaluated with two replicates. The volumetric biogas production rate (VBPR) increased with increasing initial TS. On day 5, VBPR increased from 133.2±11.2mLL⁻¹d⁻¹ at TS 2% to 1111.7±58.1mLL⁻¹d⁻¹ at TS 10%. The ultimate biogas yield (P) firstly increased and then decreased with the increasing TS. The greatest P was 246.8mLg⁻¹-VSadded at TS 8%. The corresponding free ammonia nitrogen (FAN) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) were 84.0±16.1 and 1163.0±108.6mgL⁻¹, respectively. Normalized capillary suction time (NCST) and solid content of thickened sludge obtained by centrifuging sludge increased with increasing TS. On day 49, NCST were 1.2±0.2 (TS=2%) and 13.2±1.1 (TS=10%)sg⁻¹-TS. Meanwhile, solid content of thickened sludge was 7.5±0.5 (TS=2%) and 15.4±0.0% (TS=10%).

Rheological studies were applied to investigate the viscosity and viscoelastic properties of complex coacervates. The viscoelastic properties were investigated by dynamic oscillatory tests and static tests (creep and recovery). The coacervates exhibited the shear-thinning behavior of non-Newtonian fluid, and the frequency sweep test revealed magnitude of elastic modulus (G′) higher than loss modulus (G″) at high frequency due to the formation of compact network structure with elastic dominant property (solid-like behavior). Arrhenius model was able to estimate the relationship between viscosity and temperature, and the high temperature caused molecular expansion and increase in intermolecular distances, leading to decrease on the viscosity. The energy of activation (Eₐ) was 25.24 and 20.74 kJ mol⁻¹ for WPI/GEO-10/CH and WPI/GEO-20/CH, respectively. The highest Eₐ value for WPI/GEO-10/CH indicated the formation of more strength and structured network matrices for GEO protection. Creep and recovery data were well fitted by Burger model and exponential decay function, respectively, and obtaining R² higher than 0.98. The percentage recovery (%R) was 16.67% and 9.52% for WPI/GEO-10/CH and WPI/GEO-20/CH, respectively, indicating that WPI/GEO-10/CH had greater capacity for structural recovery and the most suitable to be applied in food product that industrially requires large stress, high temperature and long-time processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a306489/2018-0cconselho nacional de desenvolvimento científico e tecnológico  a17/2551-0000915-0cfundação de amparo à pesquisa do estado do rio grande do sul 3achitosan 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aessential oils 3afoods 3agarlic 3aloss modulus 3ameasurement 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity 3awhey protein isolate1 aNoreña, Caciano Pelayo Zapata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1618-68020 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2022 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.295-306dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-021-01162-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245006600165300002000231520135200251592002801603650002201631650001101653650001201664650001701676650001101693650002001704650003401724650002101758650002401779650003701803650001001840650000901850650002201859650001401881650000701895650001601902700002301918700002701941700002201968700002301990700004402013700002302057773012602080856007502206852000902281655001202290IND60795168920221122210556.0221001e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079516892DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra04828k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadinović, Kristina10aLow Au-content CoAu electrodes for environmental applications  ap. 26134-26146.  aSix cobalt gold (CoAu) electrodes were prepared by electroless deposition using different gold-containing solutions (acidic and weakly acidic) and different Au deposition times. Characterization of CoAu electrodes was done by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, N₂-sorption, and X-ray powder diffraction techniques. The possibility of using the prepared electrodes in environmental applications, i.e., for the electrochemical sensing of a trace amount of arsenic(iii) in weakly alkaline media was assessed. Employing the CoAu electrode (prepared by immersing Co/Cu into 1 mM HAuCl₄ (pH 1.8) at 30 °C for 30 s) under optimized conditions (deposition potential −0.7 V and deposition time of 60 s), a low limit of detection of 2.16 ppb was obtained. Finally, this CoAu electrode showed activity for arsenic oxidation in the presence of Cu(ii) as a model interferent as well as in real samples. Furthermore, the use of CoAu electrode as an anode in fuel cells, namely, direct borohydride – hydrogen peroxide fuel cells was also assessed. A peak power density of 191 mW cm⁻² was attained at 25 °C for DBHPFC with CoAu anode at a current density of 201 mA cm⁻² and cell voltage of 0.95 V, respectively. The peak power density further increased with the increase of the operating temperature to 55 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3aarsenic 3aborohydrides 3acobalt 3adetection limit 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afuels 3agold 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3apH 3atemperature1 aMilikić, Jadranka1 aBalčiūnaitė, Aldona1 aSukackienė, Zita1 aBošković, Marko,1 aTamašauskaitė-Tamašiūnaitė, Loreta1 aŠljukić, Biljana0 tRSC advances.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 12, no. 40 p.26134-26146dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra04828k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01656naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099024003600116040001800152100001900170245008500189300001600274520034100290592002800631650001800659650002000677650001200697650004600709650006300755650003500818650002800853650000900881650005600890650001100946650005700957650000901014700001901023700001801042773010601060852000901166856008301175655001201258991632049180742620221118181406.0181010e197705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790939262DNAL7 a8830862pmid7 a10.1177/0300985877014003062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiggins, R.

Electron microscopic observations showed that, in the epidermis, differentiation of chromoplasts started from leucoplasts, while mesophyll chromoplasts originated from chloroplasts. During petal maturation, fibrils accumulated in the plastids, often arranging in a parallel fashion to form compact birefringent bundles. Immediately before flower opening, these fibrillar bundles started to disorganise, and, at anthesis, most chromoplasts contained widely spaced fibrils which were irregularly dispersed through the plastid interior. During chromoplast differentiation, fibrils were commonly observed to protrude from plastoglobules, suggesting the possible site of their formation. Western analysis indicated that a protein antigenically related to fibrillin from pepper chromoplasts participates in the constitution of fibrils in Chelidonium petals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelidonium majus 3abiogenesis 3achloroplasts 3achromoplasts 3acorolla 3aelectron microscopy 3aflowering 3amesophyll 3apepper1 aWrischer, Mercedes0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2006 June 30, v. 75, no. 2 p.107-112dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2006.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013400163300001400297520085400311592002801165650001701193650002201210650001401232650001901246650001601265650001101281650001701292650001401309650001601323650002001339653005301359653003901412653002201451653001001473653001401483653006501497700001601562700001501578700001401593700001601607700001401623773009301637856008501730852000901815655001201824IND60562813020221122233704.0180831e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056281302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Jun10aCharacterization and inventory of PBDD/F emissions from deca-BDE, polyethylene (PE) and metal blends during the pyrolysis process  ap. 84-90.  aThe thermal treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is regarded as the largest potential contributor to the environmental release of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs).

While some studies have failed to detect significant amounts of corticosterone, in other species high amounts have been recorded, such as in a recent study of southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome. However, attention has been drawn recently to the fact that many antibodies for corticosterone measurement cross-react with other steroids present in the yolk. In particular, progesterone and related substances can occur in yolk in high concentrations, such that also low cross-reactions of corticosterone assays may lead to measurement errors. We thus performed high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analyses of yolk extracts and determined the concentration of immunoreactive corticosterone, as well as cross-reacting progesterone and cortisol in egg yolks of southern rockhopper penguins and imperial shags Phalacrocorax atriceps albiventer. We found that high gestagen concentrations in the yolk result in large measurement errors for yolk corticosterone, even when the cross-reactivity seems small. This was observed for both species. We further found species-specific differences in the actual corticosterone amounts present in the egg yolks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEudyptes 3aPhalacrocorax 3aantibodies 3acorticosterone 3acortisol 3across reaction 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apenguins 3aprogesterone 3aseabirds 3asteroids1 aPoisbleau, Maud1 aParenteau, Charline1 aTrouvé, Colette1 aDemongin, Laurent1 avan Noordwijk, Hendrika J.1 aMöstl, Erich0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 173, no. 1 p.11-14dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.05.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245010000170300001600270520148000286592002801766653001201794653004901806653003901855653000801894653000901902653001301911653001601924700002201940700002001962773012801982856007802110852000902188655001202197IND60516961220221119042646.0160327e20130311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051696122DNAL7 a10.1139/cjpp-2012-04252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Kawshik K.10aInteraction of antioxidants and exercise on insulin sensitivity in healthy and prediabetic rats  ap. 570-577.  aMeal-induced insulin sensitization (MIS) describes the augmented postprandial response to insulin through action of the hepatic insulin sensitizing substance (HISS). HISS-action is impaired in insulin resistance associated with aging and type 2 diabetes, but could be preserved by the antioxidant cocktail SAMEC, along with voluntary exercise. In this study, we tested whether antioxidant supplementation during voluntary training would interact with the effects of exercise on HISS-mediated glucose uptake in healthy and prediabetic rats. The 7-day voluntary running-wheel training was used as an exercise intervention. SAMEC supplementation was provided only during the 7-day training session. The rapid insulin sensitivity test (RIST) was conducted to determine insulin- and HISS-dependent glucose uptake in 14-week-old healthy rats, and sucrose-induced insulin-resistant rats, with or without exercise in the presence or absence of SAMEC supplementation. The postprandial insulin sensitivity was increased by exercise, primarily through enhancement of the HISS-dependent glucose uptake, which remained unaffected by SAMEC. SAMEC supplementation did not either harm or add benefit to the positive effects of exercise on insulin sensitivity in healthy or prediabetic rats. While SAMEC alone was a demonstrated preventive against the progressive loss of HISS action in previous studies, short-term supplementation in this study did not reverse the established disease state.  aPublisher supplied data 0ainsulin 0ahepatic insulin sensitizing substance (HISS) 0ameal-induced insulin sensitization 0aage 0adiet 0aexercise 0aantioxidant1 aLegare, Dallas J.1 aLautt, W.

In response to this call, we have developed an issues-based laboratory module that uses guided inquiry to integrate the concepts of animal behavior and population biology into an issue of both local and global relevance. The issue associated with this module is “What should be done about invasive crayfish?” Students investigate plausible reasons why crayfish are often successful invasive species through hypothesis testing, collection of behavioral data on live crayfish, and quantitative reasoning. Students also consider economic and environmental impacts of invasive species on local and global ecosystems. We implemented this module in a large introductory biology course and conducted survey research to evaluate the module's potential to serve as an interesting and valuable learning experience for undergraduate biology students.  aPublisher supplied data 0aInvasive species 0abehavioral ecology 0aanimal behavior 0acrayfish 0asocietal issues1 aKayes, Lori J.1 aHubert, David1 aChouinard, Adam0 tAmerican biology teacher.g2014 , v. 76, no. 9 p.609-914dUniversity of California PresswJournal:19725x0002-76857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525/abt.2014.76.9.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245013800179300001600317520133300333592002801666650002501694650002701719650001201746650001801758650002401776653002801800653002701828653002901855653003501884653003601919700002601955700002101981773011302002856008602115852000902201655001202210IND60567249820221122021453.0180831e20170710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056724982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Vinícius P.10aMeasuring the implementation of ecodesign management practices: A review and consolidation of process-oriented performance indicators  ap. 293-309.  aEcodesign plays an important role in manufacturing companies’ quest for improved sustainability performance. However, many ecodesign efforts are geared towards tackling single-issue discrete improvements, in contrast to operationalizing, measuring and acting upon the consistent improvement of ecodesign implementation and management. To enable a systematic and streamlined integration of ecodesign practices into the product development processes, adequate mechanisms are needed to capture and measure performance improvements, and thereby achieve consistent improvements in a company’s efforts towards enhanced sustainability performance. In face of this challenge, this paper aims at providing organizations with a set of process-oriented indicators to supporting and enhancing ecodesign implementation and management. This research was grounded on a 2-phase approach to (i) cross-analyze performance indicators from literature against ecodesign practices at the process level and (ii) propose, evaluate and consolidate new indicators. After being subjected to the evaluation of 8 experts in ecodesign, a repository is presented with 27 indicators from literature and a set of 114 newly proposed indicators for companies to customize, adapt, mix and derive according to their needs, strategic drivers and overall context.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adesign for environment 3aexperts 3amanufacturing 3aproduct development 0aPerformance measurement 0aPerformance indicators 0aEcodesign implementation 0aEcodesign management practices 0aSustainable product development1 aPigosso, Daniela C.A.1 aMcAloone, Tim C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 July 10, v. 156 p.293-309dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011000167300001400277520138100291592002801672650002301700650001501723650001501738650001601753650001201769650001101781650002001792650001701812650001601829650001101845650002201856650001201878650001501890650001701905650001101922653002901933653002301962653000901985653001401994700001702008700001402025700001402039700001702053700001502070773010902085856008302194852000902277655001202286IND60562813220221123022119.0180831e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056281322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.01.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Tingting10aFluorescence enhancement of CdTe quantum dots by HBcAb-HRP for sensitive detection of H2O2 in human serum  ap. 16-20.  aA simple, high selective, ultra-sensitive and stable biosensor based on hepatitis B core antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HBcAb-HRP) induced fluorescent enhancement of CdTe QDs for recognition of H2O2 have been constructed. In this assay, sulfurs in HBcAb-HRP, which possess a strong affinity towards Cd²⁺, can improve greatly the recombination fluorescence of CdTe QDs by creating more radiative centers at CdTe/Cd-SR complex. Then, H2O2 oxidizes Cd-S bonds in CdTe QDs to organic disulfide product (RS-SR), causing thioglycolic acid (TGA) and HBcAb-HRP detach from surface of CdTe QDs and thus leading to fluorescence quenching. Just with the addition of HBcAb-HRP, sensitivity of the new biosensor has been improved by near one order of magnitude as compared with CdTe QDs probe. Detection limit of HBcAb-HRP-CdTe QDs biosensor for determination of H2O2 was 6.9×10⁻⁸mol L⁻¹ (3σ/slope), and the excellent linear range was 1.0×10⁻⁷~1.5×10⁻⁴molL⁻¹. By using sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and NH4OH as masking agents of Ag⁺, Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺, H2O2 can be selectively detected in coexistence with Ag⁺, Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺, and the biosensor has been used to detect H2O2 in human serum with satisfactory results. The superior properties of this biosensor showed great potential usage in more chemical and biological researches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium hydroxide 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acadmium 3acopper 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahepatitis B 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amercury 3aperoxidase 3aquantum dots 3asilver 0aFluorescence enhancement 0aHBcAb-HRP-CdTe QDs 0aH2O2 0aBiosensor1 aLiu, Junfeng1 aWu, Yiwei1 aXiao, Yao1 aWang, Xuehan1 aYuan, Siqi0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 June 15, v. 92 p.16-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.01.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007600167300001600243500001500259520169700274592002801971650001601999650002602015650001202041650002002053650001402073650001302087650001402100650000802114650002802122650001202150650002002162650001002182650001702192650002102209650002202230650002302252650001402275653001002289700001502299700002102314700001902335700002002354700003002374700002202404700002202426700002302448700002202471700002102493700002002514773011302534856008302647990002302730852000902753655001202762IND60099123320221119101947.0141105e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009912332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoerjan, Bart10aLocust phase polyphenism: Does epigenetic precede endocrine regulation?  ap. 120-128.  a2019-12-06  aThe morphological, physiological and behavioural differences between solitarious and gregarious desert locusts are so pronounced that one could easily mistake the two phases as belonging to different species, if one has no knowledge of the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity. A number of phase-specific features are hormonally controlled. Juvenile hormone promotes several solitarious features, the green cuticular colour being the most obvious one. The neuropeptide corazonin elicits the dark cuticular colour that is typical for the gregarious phase, as well as particular gregarious behavioural characteristics. However, it had to be concluded, for multiple reasons, that the endocrine system is not the primary phase-determining system. Our observation that longevity gets imprinted in very early life by crowding of the young hatchlings, and that it cannot be changed thereafter, made us consider the possibility that, perhaps, epigenetic control of gene expression might be, if not the missing, a primary phase-determining mechanism. Imprinting is likely to involve DNA methylation and histone modification. Analysis of a Schistocerca EST database of nervous tissue identified the presence of several candidate genes that may be involved in epigenetic control, including two DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). Dnmt1 and Dnmt2 are phase-specifically expressed in certain tissues. In the metathoracic ganglion, important in the serotonin pathway for sensing mechanostimulation, their expression is clearly affected by crowding. Our data urge for reconsidering the role of the endocrine system as being sandwiched in between genetics and epigenetics, involving complementary modes of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3aphenotypic plasticity 3alocusts 3aDNA methylation 3alongevity 3ahistones 3aserotonin 3aDNA 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aganglia 3agene expression 3acolor 3aSchistocerca 3aendocrine system 3ajuvenile hormones 3amethyltransferases 3adatabases 0agenes1 aSas, Filip1 aErnst, Ulrich R.1 aTobback, Julie1 aLemière, Filip1 aVandegehuchte, Michiel B.1 aJanssen, Colin R.1 aBadisco, Liesbeth1 aMarchal, Elisabeth1 aVerlinden, Heleen1 aSchoofs, Liliane1 aDe Loof, Arnold0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 173, no. 1 p.120-128dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04088naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245016300186300001600349520201100365592002802376650005602404650001002460650002102470650001402491650001302505650001802518650001202536650002602548650001002574650000902584650001702593650001202610650001602622650001502638650001202653650001102665650000902676650001402685650009602699650009302795650001502888650002202903650002602925650006402951650001203015650003903027650001003066651001303076651002803089700002003117700002603137700002303163700002403186700002903210700003003239773011203269856004803381852000903429655001203438IND50063178120221116172505.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006317812DNAL7 a230653942pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-012-0288-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTummaruk, Padet10aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus detection in Thailand during 2005–2010 in relation to clinical problems, pig types, regions, and seasons  ap. 771-779.  aThe objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in Thailand between 2005 and 2010. The study was conducted by retrospectively investigating the detection of PRRSV from different pig types including boars, sows, piglets, nursery pigs, and fattening pigs from six regions of Thailand, i.e., the northern, eastern, northeastern, central, western, and southern parts. The data were obtained from cases submitted to the Chulalongkorn University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for PRRSV detection between 2005 and 2010. Frequency analyses and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the prevalence of PRRSV in relation to various factors. In total, 2,273 tissues (n = 636), semen (n = 210) and serum (n = 1,427) samples were included. PRRSV was detected in 32.6 % (740/2,273) of the pigs. The virus was found in 43.1 %, 15.7 %, and 30.3 % in the tissues, semen, and serum samples, respectively (P < 0.001). The prevalence of PRRSV was highest in 2005 (43.6 %) and lowest in 2009 (23.6 %) (P < 0.001). The prevalence of PRRSV was highest in nursery pigs (43.7 %) and lowest in boars (15.4 %) (P < 0.001). The prevalence of PRRSV in the hot season (34.9 %) was higher than that found in the cool season (28.1 %, P = 0.018) but did not differ significantly compared to rainy season (34.0 %, P = 0.486). The strain of PRRSV isolated in the present study was genotype 2 (54.5 %), genotype 1 (31.0 %), and mixed genotypes (14.5 %). It can be concluded that PRRSV was detected in the tissue samples more frequently than the semen and serum samples. The prevalence of PRRSV was high in the nursery pigs. A high prevalence of PRRSV was found in the hot season, indicating that climatic factors may also contribute to the prevalence of PRRSV in Thailand. Of all the PRRSV detected, 31.0 %, 54.5 %, and 14.5 % belonged to genotype 1, genotype 2, and mixed genotypes, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aboars 3aclimatic factors 3afinishing 3agenotype 3alinear models 3apiglets 3aretrospective studies 3asemen 3asows 3auniversities 3aviruses 3awarm season 3awet season 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPhylogeny 2aPorcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndromexepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxphysiopathology. 2aPorcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPrevalence 2aRNA, Viralxblood 2aRetrospective Studies 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSeasons 2aSequence Analysis, RNAxveterinary 2aSwine 3aThailand 0aThailandxepidemiology.1 aSurapat, Pannin1 aSriariyakun, Sutharat1 aSeemakram, Oraphan1 aOlanratmanee, Em-on1 aTantilertcharoen, Rachod1 aThanawongnuwech, Roongroj0 tTropical animal health and production.g2013 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.771-779dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-012-0288-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117040001800134100003500152245010400187300001200291506017300303520177000476650003602246650001802282650001402300650002102314650002702335650002002362650003002382650001802412650002502430650002902455650002002484650002502504650002402529650001502553650001302568650001502581651001002596700001702606773010802623856011402731956008302845961000902928852000902937655001202946IND60647730920221214224723.0180905e20180827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064773092DNAL7 a10113/64773092hdl7 a3520472aris  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrausbaugh, C.

To identify sugar beet germplasm lines with resistance to BNYVV and storage rots, 42 lines from the USDA-ARS Ft. Collins sugar beet program and five check cultivars were screened. The lines were grown in a sugar beet field infested with BNYVV during the 2017 growing season in a randomized complete block design with 6 replications. At harvest on 11 October 2017, roots were dug and evaluated for rhizomania symptoms and also placed in an indoor commercial sugar beet storage building. After 132 days in storage, samples were evaluated for the percentage of root surface area covered by fungal growth or rot. Rhizomania symptom development in the field was uniform and other disease problems were not evident in the plot area. The BNYVV susceptible check plots had 97 to 100% foliar symptoms and high root disease severity ratings. The three resistant checks had 0 to 6% foliar symptoms and low root ratings. Based on root ratings, all entries except entry 20151043PF had some level of resistance since they were all better than the susceptible checks. However, 20141018 was the only entry that performed well for all variables. 20161023PF also had a good root rating, but had considerable foliar symptoms. 20151044PFHO and 20151046PFHO had no foliar symptoms and very little storage rot, so the poor root rating may be related to inherently poor root shape and not a lack of BNYVV resistance. Twenty-six of the entries had resistance to fungal rots in storage, because they were not different from 20161014HO and Check 3. Some entries may serve as a starting point for identifying additional sources of resistance to BNYVV and storage rots. 3aBeet necrotic yellow vein virus 3aBeta vulgaris 3acultivars 3adisease severity 3adisease susceptibility 3afoliar diseases 3afungal diseases of plants 3agenetic lines 3agermplasm evaluation 3aplant disease resistance 3aplant germplasm 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest storage 3arhizomania 3aroot rot 3asugar beet 3aIdaho1 aFenwick, Ann0 tPlant disease management reports.g2018 Aug. 27, v. 12, no.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is often inadequate to detect myocardial disease induced by chemotherapy. Tissue Doppler and bidimensional-strain imaging could detect LV myocardial dysfunction earlier than LVEF. In drug-induced cardiotoxicity, torsional and longitudinal LV deformations [LV twist (LVtw), radial strain (GRS), global longitudinal strain (GLS)] are damaged. We assessed whether a new index, GLS×LVtw, could predict future anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography, troponin, and natriuretic peptide determination were prospectively performed in 74 patients before and after 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks of anthracycline treatment. These patients were treated for breast cancer, Hodgkin’s or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukaemia, or osteosarcoma. At 6 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, isovolumic relaxation time, systolic mitral annular velocity, LVGLS, LVGRS, LV apical rotation, LVtw, and GLS×LVtw deteriorated, and troponin levels became elevated (all p < 0.05 by ANOVA) before LVEF decreased. The receiver operating characteristic curves identified early deterioration of GLS×LVtw as the best predictor of later cardiotoxicity (area under curve = 0.93), followed by GLS (0.84) and LV apical rotation (0.81) deterioration. In conclusion, early change in the GLS×LVtw index seems to be a good predictor of future development of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aanthracycline-mediated cardiomyopathy 0aleft ventricular function 0aleft ventricular ejection fraction 0abidimensional-strain imaging 0aleft ventricular deformation 0aglobal longitudinal strain 0atwist1 aPetrescu, Lucian0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 11, v. 91, no. 8 p.601-607dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2012-03983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010800179300001600287520133700303592002801640650001401668650002701682650001401709650001501723650002501738650003001763650002601793650001101819650001801830650001601848653003801864653001601902653001301918653002001931653000801951700001601959700002201975700002301997700001802020700003402038700002202072773011302094856008602207852000902293655001202302IND60567250120221119172925.0180831e20170710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056725012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHäfliger, Ian-Frederic10aBuildings environmental impacts' sensitivity related to LCA modelling choices of construction materials  ap. 805-816.  aThe assessment of the environmental performance of buildings is now commonly using a life cycle approach, based on a growing number of databases and methods in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Recent studies have, however, highlighted the problems related to uncertainties in the LCA results. The aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity of construction materials to the different modelling choices in order to highlight their consequences at the building scale. In particular, we focused on the different modelling options in terms of database choices, system boundary definitions and replacement scenarios of building materials during the whole service life of the buildings. The assessment of uncertainties was conducted at two levels: the material or element level and the building level. The results clearly show the importance of these modelling choices. Variations on the overall assessment of buildings are significant, but the details at the material scale show that not all materials are similarly sensitive to these choices. We identified those materials that have a large contribution to the environmental impact of the buildings and which are also sensitive to different modelling choices. This can help for a better understanding of these modelling choices and can be used in upcoming regulations or public policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aconstruction materials 3adatabases 3adurability 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3apublic policy 3auncertainty 0aEnvironmental product declaration 0aUncertainty 0aModule D 0aSystem boundary 0aLCA1 aJohn, Viola1 aPasser, Alexander1 aLasvaux, Sebastien1 aHoxha, Endrit1 aSaade, Marcella Ruschi Mendes1 aHabert, Guillaume0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 July 10, v. 156 p.805-816dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013900173300001800312520119600330536022501526592002801751650001701779650002401796650002301820650001701843650002101860650001401881650003701895650001701932650001401949650001601963650001401979650001301993653003102006653002802037653002402065653002402089653002502113700001902138700001702157700002302174700002102197773012602218856008602344852000902430655001202439IND60792911520221119173930.0220919e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079291152DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2021.20083872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwain, Shasank S.10aAntituberculosis, antioxidant and cytotoxicity profiles of quercetin: a systematic and cost-effective in silico and in vitro approach  ap. 4757-4761.  aThe ineffectiveness and the slowdown of newer anti-TB drug approval rates directly indicate searching for potential alternative agents. However, validation of isolated phytochemicals through hit-and-trial experiments is more expensive and time-consuming. Simultaneously, cost-effective computational tools can recognize most potential candidates at an initial stage. The present study selected seven plant-derived polyphenols, then verified anti-TB and drug-ability profiles using advanced computational tools before the experimental study. Among all, the quercetin showed a potential docking-score within −8 to −11 kcal/mol than the standard isoniazid and ofloxacin, −5 to −10 kcal/mol. Additionally, quercetin exhibited a higher drug-ability score of 0.53 than isoniazid 0.19. Further, quercetin exhibited the minimum inhibitory concentration at 6 and 8 μg/mL, while ofloxacin showed at 2 μg/mL against InhA, and katG mutated Mtb-strains, respectively. Parallelly, quercetin showed promising free-radical-scavenging activity from nitric-oxide assay at IC₅₀ = 14.92 µg/mL, and lesser-cytotoxicity from cultured HepG2 cell lines at IC₅₀ = 159 µg/mL, respectively.  aThis work is supported by the ‘ICMR-Post Doctoral Research Grant awarded to Dr. Shasank S.

Herein, an ultra-thin trinity coating (∼33 nm) for unparalleled molecular separation is first built via covalent bond (CB)/coordination bond (COB) competitive reactions. The COBs generated among various polyphenols (PPhs), amino substances (ASs) and transition metal ions (TMIs) can limit Michael addition or Schiff base reactions for CB formation between PPhs and ASs during the mussel-inspired ternary coating process so as to elegantly engineer the trinity coating architecture on the porous substrate with ultra-thin thickness, excellent structural integration, high hydrophilicity and outstanding smoothness. Our molecular separation nanoporous membrane demonstrates ultra-high permeance (114 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ for Bromothymol Blue (BTB) and 104 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ for Congo Red (CR)) with complete rejection, which is much superior to that of state-of-the-art membranes and can realize the lower energy consumption of the membrane separation process. The CB/COB competitive reactions drastically enhanced the permeance of the trinity coated membrane by 533%, 238%, and 93% compared to that of the unary (pDA) and binary (pDA/PEI or pDA/Co²⁺) coated membranes. Meanwhile, the novel membrane with the perfectly tuned architecture by CB/COB competitive reactions possesses extraordinary dye/salt selectivity, tremendous acid/alkali–base stability and excellent anti-pollution capacity simultaneously. The new strategy for building an outstanding trinity coating via competitive reactions can pave a realistic way for fabricating unparalleled next-generation separation membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3acoatings 3acobalt 3adyes 3aenergy 3ahydrophilicity 3aindustrial applications 3ametal ions 3ananopores 3apolyphenols 3aschiff bases1 aMa, Jun1 aShao, Lu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Mar. 10, v. 8, no. 10 p.5078-5085dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta12670h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245006600166300001400232520101700246592002801263653002601291653001201317653002201329653002701351653002101378700001901399700001701418773012701435856007901562852000901641655001201650IND60124609620221119060946.0150427e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012460962DNAL7 a10.1525/abt.2015.77.1.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuttick, Gillian12aA Study of the Literature on Lab-Based Instruction in Biology  ap. 12-18.  aWe analyzed the practitioner literature on lab-based instruction in biology in The American Biology Teacher between 2007 and 2012. We investigated what laboratory learning looks like in biology classrooms, what topics are addressed, what instructional methods and activities are described, and what is being learned about student outcomes. The practitioner literature reveals a focus on novel and innovative labs, and gaps in some biology topics. There is little description of student learning, but motivation and engagement are a primary concern of authors. There is little evidence of students addressing the nature of science in laboratories, and too few opportunities for authentic exploration of phenomena. We suggest that biology instruction can be strengthened by more rigorous practitioner research through increased professional collaboration between teachers and education researchers, increased focus on the synergy between content and teaching practice, and more rigor in reporting student outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLab-based instruction 0ainquiry 0ascience practices 0aresearch collaboration 0astudent learning1 aDrayton, Brian1 aCohen, Eliza0 tAmerican biology teacher.g2015 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.12-18dUniversity of California PresswJournal:19725x0002-76857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525/abt.2015.77.1.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009100162300002000253520126200273592002801535650001901563650001801582650002301600650001201623650001501635650001501650650000901665650001301674650001801687650001501705700001801720700001901738700002201757700002001779773012501799856007501924852000901999655001202008IND60780223020221117222844.0220617e20220613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078022302DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra07943c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEze, Valentine C.10aSynthesis of cyclic α-pinane carbonate – a potential monomer for bio-based polymers  ap. 17454-17465.  aThis work reports the first known synthesis of α-pinane carbonate from an α-pinene derivative. Pinane carbonate is potentially useful as a monomer for poly(pinane carbonate), which would be a sustainable bio-based polymer. α-Pinene is a major waste product from the pulp and paper industries and the most naturally abundant monoterpene in turpentine oil. α-Pinene is routinely converted to pinene oxide and pinanediol, but no study has yet demonstrated the conversion of pinanediol into α-pinane carbonate. Here, α-pinane carbonate was synthesised via carboxylation of α-pinanediol with dimethyl carbonate under base catalysis using triazabicyclodecene guanidine (TBD). 81.1 ± 2.8% α-pinane carbonate yield was achieved at 98.7% purity. The produced α-pinane carbonate was a white crystalline solid with a melting point of 86 °C. It was characterised using FTIR, NMR, GCMS and a quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer. The FTIR exhibited a CO peak at 1794 cm⁻¹ confirming the presence of a cyclic carbonate. GCMS showed that the α-pinane carbonate fragments with loss of CO₂, forming pinene epoxide. Base hydrolysis of the α-pinane carbonate using NaOH/ethanol/water regenerated the pinanediol with formations of Na₂CO₃.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3acatalytic activity 3aethanol 3aguanidines 3ahydrolysis 3aoils 3apolymers 3aspectrometers 3aturpentine1 aRehman, Abdul1 aPatel, Manthan1 aAḥmad, Sajjād,1 aHarvey, Adam P.0 tRSC advances.g2022 June 13, v. 12, no. 27 p.17454-17465dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra07943c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011500169300001600284500001500300520157600315592002801891650002201919650002001941650002201961650002801983650001402011650001202025650002002037650000902057650002802066650001802094650002102112650001602133650000802149650002402157650001302181650001602194650001502210650002302225653002302248653002102271653002002292653002402312653002802336653000802364653002602372653001302398653001802411653001102429653001602440700001702456700002002473700002702493700001602520773013102536856008702667852000902754655001202763IND50060620820221116172535.0190318e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006062082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCepeda, J.F.10aModeling cooling of ready-to-eat meats by 3D finite element analysis: Validation in meat processing facilities  ap. 450-461.  a2019-12-06  aA three-dimensional (3D) finite element model for simulating heat transfer during cooling of irregular-shaped ready-to-eat meat products was developed and validated. The heat transfer model considered conduction as the governing equation, subject to convection, radiation and moisture evaporation boundary conditions. A 3D finite element algorithm developed in Java™ was used to solve the model. The algorithm generated solutions for meshes containing 4-node tetrahedral volume elements and 3-node triangular boundary elements. Product geometries were generated from CT-scan images of the meat products. The model was adapted to receive input parameters that can be easily provided by a meat processors including air relative humidity, air temperature, air velocity, type of casing, duration of water shower, product weight, and estimated core temperature of product prior to entering the cooling chamber. Model validation was conducted in four commercial facilities, under normal processing conditions. Temperatures predicted by the model were in agreement with observed values. Average root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 1.19±0.54°C for core temperatures, 1.73±0.48°C for temperatures 0.05m from core to surface, and 2.01±1.01°C for surface temperatures. The developed heat transfer model was integrated with predictive microbiology models through a food safety website: numodels4safety.unl.edu. The integration can be useful for estimating the severity of cooling deviations and resulting microbiological safety caused by unexpected cooling process disruptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3ameat processing 3arelative humidity 3afinite element analysis 3aequations 3acooling 3aair temperature 3ameat 3amicrobiological quality 3aheat transfer 3amodel validation 3aevaporation 3aair 3asurface temperature 3aInternet 3afood safety 3aalgorithms 3aready-to-eat foods 0aThermal processing 0aJAVA programming 0aMeat processing 0aComputer simulation 0aPredictive microbiology 0aFEA 0aFinite element method 0aChilling 0aHeat transfer 0ainputs 0aFood safety1 aWeller, C.L.1 aThippareddi, H.1 aNigahbān, Muḥammad,1 aSubbiah, J.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2013 May, v. 116, no. 2 p.450-461dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245008000201300001600281520145100297592002801748650002101776650002501797650001701822650001301839650001501852650001401867650002501881650001201906650001801918650001801936650001501954650001201969650001601981650000901997650000702006650001302013650003302026650001602059650001102075700001702086700001602103700001602119700001802135773013202153856008302285852000902368655001202377IND60763717220221118053138.0220121e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076371722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-021-01164-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3368-235410aPreparation and properties of antioxidant peptides from wampee seed protein  ap. 410-419.  aThe antioxidant peptides from wampee seed protein (WSP) were prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis, and the hydrolysis parameters were optimized by response surface methodology.

The obtained peptides contained 16 kinds of amino acids and were rich in asparagine, glutamic acid, leucine, arginine, and valine. The EC₅₀ values of DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging effect of antioxidant peptides were 2.29 and 1.66 mg/mL, respectively, displaying an excellent antioxidant activity. Compared with WSP, the WHC and FS of antioxidant peptides decreased, but the OHC, EAI, ESI, and FC increased. The antioxidant peptides exhibited a rough and uneven surface morphology with irregular pores. The obtained peptides’ secondary structure was the mainly random coil, suggesting a transformation process from the WSP’s ordered structure to the peptides’ disordered structure. These results indicated that the antioxidant peptides could be used as a potential antioxidant in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClausena lansium 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aarginine 3aasparagine 3aemulsions 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymes 3afood industry 3aglutamic acid 3ahydrolysis 3aleucine 3ameasurement 3aoils 3apH 3apeptides 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3avaline1 aXie, Yu-Ping1 aMa, Xiu-Yun1 aLiu, Lin-Na1 aKe, Yong-Jian0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2022 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.410-419dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-021-01164-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01709naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245016400167300001600331520058000347592002800927650001300955650001000968650002300978650001401001650001301015650001101028650003301039650001001072651001101082700002001093700002201113773013801135856007701273852000901350655001201359IND60524030820221120072533.0160701e20070629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052403082DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2007.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciejewska, Irmina10aSEM observations of pollen grains, fruits and seeds of the Pieniny Mountains (South Poland) endemic species Erysimum pieninicum (Zapał.)

Aquaponics – the co-production of fish and produce in a water-circulating system where fish naturally fertilize the plants, which in turn filter the water for the fish – offers a potential solution to sustainable aquaculture. Despite the ecological promise of aquaponics, relatively little is known about the impact of this novel production method on fish composition, sensory properties, and consumer acceptance. In this research, we offered a unique, interdisciplinary perspective to examine the market potential of aquaponics by conducting a series of multidisciplinary studies to compare yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from a combined Recirculating Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture System (RIMTAS) with fish from traditional production methods (i.e., wild-caught and farm-raised). Our quality parameter and macronutrient analyses showed that aquaponic perch were comparable to their wild-caught and farm-raised counterparts in texture, moisture content, total fat, and total protein. We also demonstrated that aquaponic perch were as liked as wild-caught perch in a consumer sensory evaluation. Furthermore, in a consumer perception and acceptance study, we found that providing information about the environmental benefits of aquaponics significantly increased consumer tastiness perception, healthiness perception, and purchase intention to a level at or exceeding that of wild-caught perch. With proper messaging strategies, aquaponic fish can compete in the market with wild-caught fish. Our findings offer insights to stakeholders in the aquaculture value chain as they explore and establish RIMTAS aquaponics as an environmentally and economically sustainable seafood production source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerca flavescens 3aaquaponics 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer attitudes 3amarkets 3aperch 3aprotein content 3aseafoods 3asensory evaluation 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3atexture 3awater content 0aIMTA 0aSustainability 0aSensory evaluation 0aConsumer perception 0aPurchase intention1 aWeisstein, Fei1 aMeyer, Jeffrey1 aNeves, Kevin1 aAnderson, Dawn1 aKershaw, Jonathan0 tAquaculture.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 552 p.737953-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7379533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245015100166520145000317592002801767650002401795650003101819650001601850650001301866650001401879650001401893650001001907650000901917650001701926650001301943650001401956650001101970650001401981650002501995650004002020700001902060700002602079700002802105773012602133856007802259852000902337655001202346IND60748473920221120201733.0210827e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074847392DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100812362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathias, Maxwell 10aNeonatal Extracellular Superoxide Dismutase Knockout Mice Increase Total Superoxide Dismutase Activity and VEGF Expression after Chronic Hyperoxia  aBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common lung disease affecting premature infants that develops after exposure to supplemental oxygen and reactive oxygen intermediates. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) is an enzyme that processes superoxide radicals and has been shown to facilitate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) signaling in vascular endothelium. We utilized a mouse model of neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and SOD3 knockout (KO) mice to evaluate its function during chronic hyperoxia exposure. Wild-type age-matched neonatal C57Bl/6 (WT) and SOD3⁻/⁻ (KO) mice were placed in normoxia (21% FiO₂, RA) or chronic hyperoxia (75% FiO₂, O₂) within 24 h of birth for 14 days continuously and then euthanized. Lungs were harvested for histologic evaluation, as well as comparison of antioxidant enzyme expression, SOD activity, VEGF expression, and portions of the NO signaling pathway. Surprisingly, KO-O₂ mice survived without additional alveolar simplification, microvascular remodeling, or nuclear oxidation when compared to WT-O₂ mice. KO-O₂ mice had increased total SOD activity and increased VEGF expression when compared to WT-O₂ mice. No genotype differences were noted in intracellular antioxidant enzyme expression or the NO signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that SOD3 KO mice can survive prolonged hyperoxia without exacerbation of alveolar or vascular phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abronchopulmonary dysplasia 3aendothelium 3agenotype 3ahistology 3ahyperoxia 3alungs 3amice 3anitric oxide 3anormoxia 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphenotype 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aTaylor, Joann 1 aMendralla, Elizabeth 1 aPérez Sánchez, Marta,0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100812363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01349naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245014500172300001600317520042000333592002800753650004600781650001800827650001800845650000900863650001500872651001200887773010300899856004801002852000901050655001201059IND50068807520221118011211.0130827e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006880752DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674130301662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmel’yanyuk, L.

In this work, PU/EG/HQ composites with highly effective flame retardancy were fabricated by adding two kinds of flame retardants, expandable graphite (EG) and 10-(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-10-hydro-9-oxa-10-phosphorylphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO-HQ), during the synthesis of polyurethane. Thermal stability and flammability were evaluated using the limiting oxygen index (LOI), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UL-94 vertical flame results, and cone colorimeter tests. The as-synthesized PU/EG/HQ composites showed a high LOI value, a maximum peak heat release rate (PHRR) value which was decreased by 58.5% and an increased char yield at 800 °C. They also achieved UL-94 V-0 classification. SEM and Raman spectra indicated that the “worm-like” intumescent char layer with a graphitized structure and the formed viscous liquid film were vital factors in the enhancement of the flame retardancy of polyurethane foam in the condensed phase. TG-IR results show that the release of toxic volatiles and flammable gases from the PU/EG/HQ samples was remarkably decreased compared with the release from pure PU. This work associates a gas–solid biphase flame retardancy mechanism with the incorporation of two types of flame retardant and presents an effective method for the synthesis of bi-phase flame-retardant polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acolorimetry 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3afoams 3agases 3agraphene 3aheat 3ainsulating materials 3aliquids 3aoxygen 3apolyurethanes 3arisk 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity1 aJiang, Saihua1 aZhu, Jingyi1 aLi, Guohui1 aPeng, Xiangfang0 tRSC advances.g2018 Mar. 12, v. 8, no. 18 p.9985-9995dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra13315d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245012600208300001600334520114500350592002801495650001501523650001401538650002301552650002501575650001101600650001601611650001301627650001301640650001301653653002901666653002201695653002801717653003001745653002701775653002901802700005401831700006001885700006701945700005802012700002202070773010202092856008302194852000902277655001202286IND60717812920221118011641.0210305e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071781292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakasao, Gentoku1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0502-302010aInsight into structural distribution of heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalyst from non-empirical structure determination  ap. 299-306.  aA structural distribution is an intrinsic nature of TiCl₄-capped MgCl₂ nanoplates, and its comprehension would uncover the origin of distributions in the primary structure of polyolefins produced by Ziegler–Natta catalysts. Such fundamental understanding is one of the prerequisites of the systematic design of catalysts. Here, we performed a series of machine learning-aided structure determination for TiCl₄-capped MgCl₂ nanoplates of different sizes and chemical compositions. Structural and electronic distributions of TiCl₄ were analyzed on the basis of 10⁶ structures, which were obtained in the course of the structure determination. Such a systematic investigation revealed that i) TiCl₄ tends to adsorb on {110} surfaces as mononuclear species, while adsorption on {100} is not negligible, and that ii) even within the same mononuclear species on {110} surfaces, the steric environment and charge state of TiCl₄ are distributed. A preliminary examination on ethylene insertion suggested that the TiCl₄ distribution would generate the polymer primary structure distribution obtained by Ziegler–Natta catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical composition 3adesign 3aenvironment 3aethylene 3apolymers 3asurfaces 0aZiegler–Natta catalyst 0aGenetic algorithm 0aStructure determination 0aDensity functional theory 0aSurface reconstruction 0aActive site distribution1 aWada, Toru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9219-13071 aThakur, Ashutosh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9089-95601 aChammingkwan, Patchanee1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0715-63341 aTerano, Minoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3135-47441 aTaniike, Toshiaki0 tJournal of catalysis.g2021 Feb., v. 394 p.299-306dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245009300179300001600272520097200288592002801260596007301288596007401361650002001435650001301455650001501468650001601483650001501499650001101514650001501525650001501540650001001555651001401565700002401579700002901603700002901632700003901661773014401700856008201844852000901926655001201935IND60637301920221119125649.0190417e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063730192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-019-02584-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrondona, Sebastián Iván10aAssessment of Organochlorine Pesticides in Phreatic Aquifer of Pampean Region, Argentina  ap. 544-549.  aThis work evaluates the factors affecting the presence of organochlorine pesticides in Pampeano aquifer in the Quequén Grande River watershed, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Eighteen sampling sites were selected in order to have representatives of different type of wells and types of soil. Among the analyzed compounds, endosulfan showed the highest concentrations (4.75 ng l⁻ ¹ mean), which could be related to use in the recent past. Others important pesticides groups detected were HCHs (1.1 ng l⁻ ¹ mean) and heptachlors (2.17 ng l⁻ ¹mean). The analysis of the results show that the thickness of the unsaturated zone is the main factor related to the concentrations of pesticides and there were no differences according to wells or soil types. Although agricultural use of most OCPs has been banned in Argentina from more than 30 years ago, their residues are still detected in groundwater of the region, indicating their high persistence.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT-07/390cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aPICT-11/0768cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aaquifers 3aendosulfan 3agroundwater 3aheptachlor 3arivers 3asoil types 3awatersheds 3awells 3aArgentina1 aGonzález, Mariana,1 aMartínez, Daniel Emilio1 aMassone, Héctor Enrique1 aMiglioranza, Karina Silvia Beatriz0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2019 Apr., v. 102, no. 4 p.544-549dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-019-02584-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245020000161300002000361500001100381520093700392592002801329650001101357650003301368650001401401650001301415650001001428651001001438700002001448700001601468700001601484700002701500700001801527700002101545773015501566856008301721852000901804655001201813IND60772965520221120170423.0220411e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077296552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-18814-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Mina10aDoes foreign private investment affect the clean industrial environment?

Moreover, this study investigates an association among FPI, CO2 emission, energy consumption, trade openness, and sustainable economic growth. This study uses random effects and generalized least squares (GLS) and panel VAR estimators for data analysis. The results show that China’s economy has a great positive impact on the location and choice of investment in domestic markets in emerging countries and developed countries. In addition, investment in emerging and developed economies has increased the contribution of domestic enterprises and environmental sustainability to the national economy. The further results show that foreign private investment and gross domestic investment have positive impact on sustainable economic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenvironmental sustainability 3apollution 3aresearch 3atrade 3aChina1 aKannaiah, Desti1 aLi, Junrong1 aKhan, Nasir1 aShabbir, Malik Shahzad1 aBilal, Kanwal1 aTabash, Mosab I.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Apr., v. 29, no. 18 p.26182-26189dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18814-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011900157300002000276520130800296592002801604650001101632650001301643650003401656650002101690650001701711650002201728650001701750650002201767650001801789650001401807650001401821650001601835650001901851700001601870700001501886700001701901700002701918773014401945856007402089852000902163655001202172IND60670860320221119123547.0191002e20141111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067086032DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta04465g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuhang10aAqueous Li-ion cells with superior cycling performance using multi-channeled polyaniline/Fe₂O₃ nanotube anodes  ap. 20177-20181.  aWe developed a Fe₂O₃-decorated polyaniline (PANI/Fe₂O₃) multi-channeled nanotube structure as aqueous rechargeable lithium-ion battery (ARLIB) anode using polymerized aniline–Mo₃O₁₀ (ANI–Mo₃O₁₀) nanowires as the template. The removal of MoOₓ from the intercalated layered MoOₓ/PANI structures results in a multi-channeled nanotube structure, and the subsequent hydrothermal growth of Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles on PANI surface can simultaneously re-dope PANI into a highly conductive form. The multi-channeled nanotube structure allows for sufficient electrolyte impregnation and efficient one-dimensional electron transport, and the decorated Fe₂O₃ surface layer offers a much extended voltage window of the electrode and improves chemical and electrochemical stability. As a proof-of-concept, the initial discharge and charge capacities of the PANI/Fe₂O₃ multi-channeled nanotube anode are 60.5 and 54.2 mA h g⁻¹ at a current rate of 150 mA g⁻¹, respectively. When fabricated as an ARLIB full cell with the PANI/Fe₂O₃ multi-channeled nanotube anode and a LiMn₂O₄ cathode, an initial discharge capacity of 50.5 mA h g⁻¹ is obtained at the current rate of 150 mA g⁻¹, with superior capacity retention of 73.3% after over 1000 charge/discharge cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3aferric oxide 3alithium batteries 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3ananowires 3apolyaniline 3apolymerization1 aWang, Yehua1 aTang, Jing1 aXia, Yongyao1 aZheng, G.q(Gengfeng),0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Nov. 11, v. 2, no. 47 p.20177-20181dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta04465g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01353naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011100171300001400282520030700296592002800603650001400631650001800645650001100663653000800674653000800682653000800690653000800698653002700706653001400733653001900747653001600766700002000782773009500802856008500897852000900982655001200991IND60607283220221120233718.0180730e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060728322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2016.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaimzada, Ahmad10aEndogenous evolution of heterogeneous consumers preferences: Multistability and coexistence between groups  ap. 22-26.  aWe propose an exchange economy evolutionary model with agents heterogeneous in the structure of preferences.

In N. alpina, stomatal opening response to red light switch-on was stronger in IUW-set and U-set, than in C-set. The addition of medium blue light into the red (stomatal opening) induction light increased the stomatal response, and the stomata also responded sensitively to weak blue light in the IUW- and U-sets. The addition of green light into the red induction light did not change the stomatal response in any set. Yet in the U-set, the addition of green light into the red+(medium) blue or weak blue induction light decreased the stomatal response. Thus, vegetational shade had increased the photosynthesis-mediated stomatal light response, activated an additional stomatal response through blue light receptors, and let stomata insensitive to green light. The attenuated UV irradiance had the same effects as vegetational shade on the stomatal photosynthesis-mediated response and the additional blue light receptors-mediated response, but it also activated the green light reversal of blue light response. The stomata of leaves grown under decreased irradiance exhibited the same stomatal responses as the full-light-grown leaves. In B.pendula, stomatal responses to all the different types of light were remarkably weaker than those in N.alpina, and did not differ between themselves or between the different shade treatments. Thus, the modulation of stomatal light sensitivity participates in shade acclimation in shade-tolerating, but not in shade-avoiding deciduous tree(s).  aPublisher supplied data 3astomatal movement 3aNothofagus 3asolar radiation 3ashade tolerance 3aseedlings 3agreen light 3aacclimation 3alight intensity 3atrees 3ablue light 3aBetula pendula 3ared light 3areceptors 3aultraviolet radiation 3astomata 0aStomatal acclimation 0aleaves 0aStomatal light response 0aVegetational shade 0aNothofagus alpina 0aLight quality1 aAphalo, Pedro José0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2016 Jan., v. 121 p.94-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2015.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009900163300001800262520076500280592002801045650001001073650001201083650002301095650002201118650001601140700001701156700001701173773010301190856004801293852000901341655001201350IND4483857820221118052722.0120715e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448385782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4611-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, WenZe10aGas-liquid phase coexistence and finite-size effects in a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones system  ap. 2773-2779.  aThe gas-liquid phase coexistence in a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones system is investigated using Maxwell construction method together with molecular dynamics simulations.

Performing simulations on systems with different sizes, we find that a finite size effect is more significant than those shown in most of the previous results, and a lower critical temperature is obtained when the full extent of this finite size effect is considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3agases 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models 3atemperature1 aXu, ShengHua1 aSun, Zhiwei,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Sept., v. 56, no. 26 p.2773-2779dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4611-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01370naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245012500191300001600316520034200332592002800674653001800702653001500720653001600735653001400751653001600765653001400781653001500795700002600810773009400836856011700930852000901047655001201056IND60125387720221120170031.0151103e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012538772DNAL7 a10.1663/0007-196X(2004)056[0252:LOTNON]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmgren, Noel H.10aLectotypifications of ten names of North American taxa in Clusiaceae, Elatinaceae, Ericaceae, Primulaceae, and Violaceae  ap. 252-254.  aLectotypifications of ten names of North American taxa in Clusiaceae, Elatinaceae, Ericaceae, Primulaceae, and Violaceae.

The effects of Y concentrations of 1–5 mg L⁻¹applied for 4 days were assessed by measuring changes in photosynthetic pigments, nutrient contents, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, and ultrastructure. The accumulation of Y in subcellular fractions decreased in the order of cell wall > organelle > soluble fraction. Much more Y was located in cellulose and pectin than in other biomacromolecules. The content of some mineral elements (Mg, Ca, Fe, Mn, and Mo) increased in N. peltata, but there was an opposite effect for P and K. Meanwhile, ascorbate, and catalase activity decreased significantly for all Y concentrations. In contrast, peroxidase activity was induced, while initial rises in superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content were followed by subsequent declines. Morphological symptoms of senescence, such as chlorosis and damage to chloroplasts and mitochondria, were observed even at the lowest Y concentration. Pigment content decreased as the Y concentration rose and the calculated EC₅₀and MPC of Y for N. peltata were 2 and 0.2 mg L⁻¹after 4 days of exposure, respectively. The results showed that exogenous Y was highly available in water and that its high concentration in water bodies might produce harmful effects on aquatic organisms. N. peltata is proposed as a biomonitor for the assessment of metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3aphysiology 3aNymphoides peltata 3aglutathione 3acell walls 3airon 3acellulose 3apollution 3amitochondria 3achlorosis 3aecosystems 3asurface water 3aperoxidase 3ayttrium 3aacute toxicity 3abioaccumulation 3apectins 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aultrastructure 3aantioxidants 3apigments 3aaquatic organisms 3acatalase 3achloroplasts 2aMagnoliopsidaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 2aYttriumxtoxicity 0asenescence 0asubcellular fractions1 aLi, Feifei1 aXu, Ting1 aCai, Sanjuan1 aChu, Weiyue1 aQiu, Han1 aSha, Sha1 aCheng, Guangyu1 aXu, Qinsong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Feb., v. 21, no. 4 p.2935-2942dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-2246-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01063naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245003300174300001600207520025800223592002800481650002000509650002600529650001800555650001500573773011400588856008600702852000900788655001200797IND60657112220221119005142.0190916e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065711222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2019.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, David G.10aChris R.

The micro-raspberry powder is readily redispersed to individual nanoparticles or nanostructured sub-units, depending on the initially adjusted nanoparticle modification. In this work, it is demonstrated how the technique of magnetic zero-field-cooled/field-cooled (ZFC/FC) measurements can be used to judge the degree of agglomeration, i.e. the extent of hard-agglomerates and soft-agglomerates in a system and predict the redispersibility of the powder particles. Furthermore, the uniformity of surface modification of the individual nanoparticles can be judged via this method. In addition, the technique can be applied to characterise complex nanostructured particle systems composed of iron oxide nanoparticles mixed with another type of nanoparticulate building-block. Thus, this work shows that magnetic measurement techniques are a promising approach to characterise agglomeration states of nanoparticles, their degree of surface modification and their distribution in complex particle and composite systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3apowders 3aspray drying 0aNanostructured iron oxide particles 0aRaspberry-like particles 0aRedispersible nanoparticles 0aField cooled/zero field cooled measurements 0aMagnetic nanoparticles1 aSpäth, Stephan1 aBallweg, Thomas1 aLuxenhofer, Robert1 aMandel, Karl0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 505 p.605-614dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.06.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01320naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008400159300001800243520042300261592002800684650001300712650001200725650001400737650002100751650001600772700001700788773014200805856007400947852000901021655001201030IND60670860820221119123525.0191002e20150421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067086082DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta04482g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Chuantian10aBulk heterojunctions push the photoresponse of perovskite solar cells to 970 nm  ap. 9063-9066.  aTo expand the photoresponse of perovskite solar cells, we implanted bulk heterojunctions to make integrated solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT/CH₃NH₃PbI₃/(PDPP3T–PC₆₁BM)/Ca/Al.

Brittonia 56: 275––283. 2004.——Perforation plates and other vessel details as studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been reported for four species of Cornaceae (s.l.): similar features are shown by the four, suggesting that a more extensive sampling of the family might reveal similar phenomena. Perforation plates contain pit membrane remnants in the form of threads or, less commonly, laminar portions perforated by pores. When least well-represented, the pit membrane remnants are restricted to lateral ends of perforations and to the perforations transitional to lateral wall pitting. Perforations are all clearly bordered. Helical thickenings that do not form a continuous gyre are reported for the vessel walls of Aucuba. The presence of pit membrane remnants in vessel elements of Cornaceae correlates with the mesic habitats occupied by species in this family. The presence and type of pit membrane remnants reported by us in the three genera is very similar, although pit membrane remnants are doubtless a symplesiomorphy and thus not an indicator of relationships. The presence of pit membrane remnants in the three genera, however, does attest to the primitiveness of wood and other features of Cornaceae s.l.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCornaceae 0aecological wood anatomy 0aGarryales 0aperforation plates 0aphylogenetic wood anatomy 0avessel evolution1 aCarlquist, Sherwin0 tBrittonia.g2004 Aug., v. 56, no. 3 p.275-283dNew York Botanical Gardenx0007-196X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1663%2F0007-196X%282004%29056%5B0275%3APMRIPP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006000168520099400228592002801222653002301250653003501273653002001308653001401328653001101342700006001353700002301413773010501436856008601541852000901627655001201636IND60657112420221119005352.0190815e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065711242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabel, Lucie10aDecision-making in model construction: Unveiling habits  aThe first stages of the modeling process remain thus far poorly studied, in particular the modeler's decision-making in regard to the inclusion and representation of environmental phenomena within the model. Anchoring itself in the theoretical and methodological framework of Science and Technology Studies, the present study aims at identifying and retracing the origin of the modeler's choices. Extensive, semi-constructed interviews were conducted with European and North American modelers in a variety of disciplines within Earth and Universe sciences. The outcome of the interviews sheds light on the role of different actors in transferring choices progressively incorporated in the modelers' practice, up to becoming self-evident. We introduce and engage the sociological concept of habits as an additional layer of analysis. Modeling habits can contribute to efficiency and expertise – provided their origin, epistemic load and implications in regard to collectives are assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aModel construction 0aModel structure identification 0aDecision-making 0aSociology 0aHabits1 aVinck, Dominique1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7835-70081 aKarssenberg, Derek0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2019 Oct., v. 120dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009400172300001400266520067600280592002800956650001100984650001900995650001401014650001001028650001201038650000901050650002001059650002201079651001201101700002001113700002701133700002201160773012301182856005501305852000901360655001201369IND4483883720221118052638.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448388372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0307.2011.00734.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQUINLAN, CARRIE10aMilk transport costs under differing seasonality assumptions for the Irish Dairy Industry  ap. 22-31.  aMilk production in Ireland is seasonal in nature with the milk supply matching grass growth at farm level. The objective of this paper was to estimate the milk transport costs and carbon emissions from milk transport associated with alternative milk supply patterns and output levels in Ireland. A milk transport simulation model was used to simulate three alternative milk supply patterns with peakâtoâtrough month ratios of 5.37:1, 2.71:1 and 8:1. It was found that milk transport costs were not very sensitive to alternative milk supply patterns. Alternative milk supply pattern also had very little effect on carbon emissions from milk transport in Ireland.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adairy industry 3aemissions 3afarms 3agrasses 3amilk 3amilk production 3asimulation models 3aIreland1 aKeane, Michael,1 aOâ CONNOR, DECLAN1 aSHALLOO, LAURENCE0 tInternational journal of dairy technology.g2012 Feb., v. 65, no. 1 p.22-31dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-727X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0307.2011.00734.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01233naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006300165300001600228520033200244592002800576650001000604650001500614650001800629650001700647700001800664700002000682700001900702700001700721773010300738856004800841961000900889852000900898655001200907IND50068808220221118011118.0130827e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006880822DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674130300992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanov, D.

This feature allows for a more flexible operation in column utilization and can also achieve higher separation performances. However, to take full benefit out of it, the operating parameters, such as the strategy for port switching, must be optimal. in this paper, a novel methodology for optimizing those parameters, based on a single NLP (non-linear programming), is proposed. The main advantage of this approach is that it significantly reduces the complexity of the original MINLP (mixed-integer non-linear programming) formulation currently discussed in the literature. The proposed optimization problem is built, considering that the average column configuration of three zones provides the necessary and sufficient information to describe the VariCol process. Several optimization scenarios for the enantioseparation of 1,1´-bi-2-naphthol and aminoglutethimide were considered to evaluate the proposed methodology and to compare the performance of VariCol and SMB processes. The results have shown that with the single NLP approach, it is possible to explore the optimal solution in all the VariCol process domains with less computational effort than other optimization strategies reported in the literature. That is a great advantage, especially in the context of real-time applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achromatography 3asystem optimization 0aVariCol Process 0aSimulated Moving Bed 0aEnantioseparation 0aColumn Configuration 0ashifting scheme 0aSMB Optimization1 aBarreto Jr, Amaro Gomes1 aAndrade Neto, Ataíde Souza1 aSecchi, Argimiro Resende0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 1634 p.461672-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4616723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01733naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006400171300001600235520086400251592002801115650001401143653000801157653000801165653002601173653001701199653003501216773009801251856008501349852000901434655001201443IND60607283920221120233815.0180730e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060728392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2016.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpeer, Jamin D.10aHow bad is occupational coding error? A task-based approach  ap. 166-168.  aStudies of occupational choice and mobility are often plagued by rampant occupational coding error. Use of task-based occupation measures, such as O*Net, may mitigate the bias caused by coding error if the occupation is misclassified as an occupation similar to the true occupation. Measuring occupational changes in “task space”, I find that task-based measures reduce the problems of coding error, but only slightly. If one does not correct for coding error, one overestimates traditional occupational mobility rates by about 90%; using task-based measures, the overestimate of mobility is still 75%. I also show that when tasks are used as regressors and coding error is not corrected, estimates will be attenuated by 15%–20%. Task-based measures are a slight improvement over census occupation codes but are no panacea for dealing with coding error.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 0aJ60 0aJ62 0aOccupational mobility 0aCoding error 0aTask-based occupation measures0 tEconomics letters.g2016 Apr., v. 141 p.166-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2016.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01179naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007100165300001600236520035700252592002800609650002300637650002200660650001100682650001100693650001500704650001000719773010300729856004800832852000900880655001200889IND50068808420221118011004.0130827e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006880842DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674130301292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLankin, V.

Holland's carp (Spinibarbus hollandi) is a freshwater fish native to southern and eastern Taiwan. In the past two decades, this species has been introduced as a sport fish into the river basins of northern and western Taiwan. The large body size and active predation make it a potential threat for native fishes, but which native species are preyed by Holland's carp remains unknown. In this study, the diet from the gut contents of Holland's carp from the Zhonggang River, an invaded basin, was examined using DNA metabarcoding from 51 individuals and by morphological examinations on 140 samples. Detritus of plants were found in 83.6% samples (117 individuals). Twenty fish species of seven families were identified by DNA metabarcoding, including species of all water layers. Taiwan torrent carp (Acrossocheilus paradoxus) and Rhinogobius spp. are the most common prey items. Based on the results of this study, Holland's carp is considered an opportunistic omnivore because of its diverse diet items, which is an important trait for successful invasive fish species. The population decline of Opsariichthys pachycephalus may not result from the invasion of Holland's carps. Nonetheless, the time lag between successful invasion and the samplings of this study may be a concern because the population size of O. pachycephalus may have declined and become difficult to prey. The Holland's carps consumed the least species in winter; nonetheless, the occurrence frequencies of preys among seasons were not significantly different probably because of limited temperature fluctuation. The smallest Holland's carps consumed the least prey species compared to other size categories, similar to the relationship of prey species number to size of invasive largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrossocheilus paradoxus 3aDNA barcoding 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aOpsariichthys 3aRhinogobius 3aSpinibarbus 3abasins 3abody size 3acarp 3adetritus 3adiet 3adigestive system 3afreshwater fish 3agame fish 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aomnivores 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3apredation 3aprey species 3arivers 3atemperature 3awinter 3aTaiwan1 aWang, Feng‐Yu1 aLiu, Min‐Yun1 aChou, Tak‐Kei1 aLiao, Te‐Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7588-200X0 tJournal of fish biology.g2021 Nov., v. 99, no. 5 p.1668-1676dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.148753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011000166300001600276500001500292520061800307592002800925650001200953650002700965650001900992650002701011650001601038650002601054650002301080650002501103650001001128650003101138650001701169650002501186653001601211700002001227700001801247700002401265773010301289856004801392852000901440655001201449IND50068808520221118010958.0130827e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006880852DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674130300262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdzhiev, D.

Moreover, ZnO-NPs leaves significantly enhanced antioxidant enzymes activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3abiosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3afenugreek 3aleaves 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3aroots 3atoxicity 3azinc oxide1 aSmiri, Moez1 aMissaoui, Takwa1 aHafiane, Amor0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2019 Apr., v. 102, no. 4 p.477-485dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-019-02590-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015000164500002200314520105400336592002801390650003301418650002601451650001501477650002001492650001901512650001301531650002401544650001301568650001301581650001401594650001801608650002201626650001301648650001101661650001501672653002201687653001201709653002401721653002101745700006201766700001901828700006701847773010001914856008202014852000902096655001202105IND60657112820221119005256.0190815e20190712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065711282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2019.1073042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosugi, Yuka10aNitrogen flow and microbial community in the anoxic reactor of “Sulfate Reduction, Denitrification/Anammox and Partial Nitrification” process  aPre-press version  aWe propose a sulfate reduction, denitrification/anammox and partial nitrification process to treat organic wastewater. Nitrogen removal in the anoxic reactor in this process was examined using an anaerobic-anoxic biofilter reactor. When nitrate medium was added to the anoxic reactor simulating the return flow from a nitrification reactor, mainly heterotrophic and sulfur denitrification occurred. However, anammox as well as denitrification occurred in the anoxic reactor when nitrite was fed into the reactor simulating partially nitrified water. The proportion of nitrite removal by the anammox reaction reached over 30%. By 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, the coexistence of heterotrophic and sulfur denitrification bacteria was confirmed in the anoxic reactor, although the heterotrophic denitrification and sulfur oxidation bacterial communities were different in each reactor. Candidatus Brocadia was detected in the nitrite-fed reactor, meaning that anammox bacteria coexist with denitrification bacteria even in high-sulfide conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacterial communities 3abiofilters 3adenitrification 3adrainage water 3anitrates 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asulfates 3asulfur 3awastewater 0aSulfate reduction 0aAnammox 0aMicrobial community 0aNitrogen removal1 aMatsuura, Norihisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6917-37091 aLiang, Qiaochu1 aYamamoto-Ikemoto, Ryoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2862-04260 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2019 July 12, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2019.1073043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006000167300001600227520177100243592002802014650001502042650001902057650003602076650001702112650002102129650001702150650001902167650001802186650002202204650001302226653001902239653002402258653002502282653003102307700001502338700002102353773012502374856008202499852000902581655001202590IND60609419220221122003654.0180823e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060941922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.06.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Bijan K.10aStepwise unfolding of Ribonuclease A by a biosurfactant  ap. 673-681.  aThe interaction of Ribonuclease A (RNase A) with the bile salt, sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) is meticulously investigated using various spectroscopic techniques. The binding isotherm constructed from the modulation of intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence of the protein following interaction with NaDC conspicuously reveals an intrinsically complex stepwise interaction process which proceeds through the formation of distinct conformational states of the protein. The conformational transitions are found to occur at c1=2.2mM, and c2=7.2mM of NaDC. These results are subsequently corroborated from the studies of excited-state relaxation dynamics of the intrinsic tyrosine residues of RNase A, and the modulations in fluorescence behavior of an extrinsic probe (ANS) bound to the protein. The far-UV circular dichroism spectral analyses unveil only nominal influence on the secondary structural element of the protein up to [NaDC]=c1=2.2mM, which is then followed by marked disruption of the secondary structure of RNase A following further addition of NaDC. This clearly accounts for differential interaction behaviors of RNase A with the monomeric and micellar forms of NaDC (CMC of NaDC in aqueous buffer is estimated to be ∼3.0mM). In Region-I (up to c1=2.2mM), the protein:surfactant interaction is argued to be predominantly governed by electrostatic/ionic interaction force. Subsequently, in Region-II (up to c2=7.2mM) the RNase A:NaDC interaction accompanies major denaturation of the protein (∼17% loss of the secondary structure of RNase A at c2=7.2mM) resulting in significant exposure of hydrophobic surfaces of the protein. However, the tertiary structure of the protein remains essentially unperturbed within the concentration regime of NaDC under study.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile salts 3abiosurfactants 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adenaturation 3adeoxycholic acid 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3aribonucleases 3aspectral analysis 3atyrosine 0aRibonuclease A 0aSodium deoxycholate 0aStepwise interaction 0aConformational transitions1 aSett, Riya1 aGuchhait, Nikhil0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 505 p.673-681dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.06.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010000163300002000263520137800283592002801661596005901689596008001748596009501828650001201923650000901935650001101944650004301955650001401998650001902012650001302031650002502044650001502069651001002084700001902094700001302113700001802126700001502144773015502159856008302314852000902397655001202406IND60772966820221120151530.0220411e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077296682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-17696-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhen10aUnsupervised monitoring of vegetation in a surface coal mining region based on NDVI time series  ap. 26539-26548.  aSurface coal mining causes vegetation disturbance while providing an energy source. Thus, much attention is given to monitoring the vegetation of surface coal mining regions. Multitemporal satellite imagery, such as Landsat time-series imagery, is an operational environment monitoring service widely used to access vegetation traits and ensure vegetation surveillance across large areas. However, most of the previous studies have been conducted with change detection models or threshold-based methods that require multiple parameter settings or sample training. In this paper, we tried to analyze the change traits of vegetation in surface coal mining regions using shape-based clustering based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series without multiple parameter settings and sample training. The shape-based clustering used in this paper applied shape-based distance (SBD) to obtain the distance between time series and used Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging (DBA) to generate cluster centroids. We applied the method to a stack of 19 NDVI images from 2000 to 2018 for a surface coal mining region located in North China. The results showed that the shape-based clustering used in this paper was appropriate for monitoring vegetation change in the region and achieved 79.0% overall accuracy in detecting disturbance-recovery trajectory types.  aPublisher supplied data  a41901276cnational natural science foundation of china  a2019BS067chigh-level talent fund project of henan university of technology  a22A420001cKey Scientific Research Projects of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province 3aLandsat 3acoal 3aenergy 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apollution 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3aChina1 aShen, Yingying1 aLi, Jing1 aJiang, Huawei1 aZhao, Like0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Apr., v. 29, no. 18 p.26539-26548dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17696-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245006700216300001600283520064600299592002800945650002200973650001400995650001101009650002401020650001601044653000801060653000801068653000801076653000801084653002101092653003201113653002301145653001701168653002501185773009801210856008501308852000901393655001201402IND60607284220221121043231.0180730e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060728422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2016.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTennekoon, Vidhura S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3212-464414aThe equivalence of three latent class models and ML estimators  ap. 147-150.  aThe purpose of this letter is to show the equivalence of three latent class models; the switching regression model with endogenous switching and a latent outcome (the binary Roy model), the probit model with a systematically misclassified dependent variable, and a trivariate probit model with partial observability. The probit model with measurement error is an enhanced version of existing models which allows for the potential correlation between error terms. Establishing this connection, we hope, will help a researcher working on one of these classes of estimators to benefit from the literature and software related to other families.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aeconomics 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aresearchers 0aC01 0aC10 0aC30 0aC40 0aBinary Roy model 0aPartial observability model 0aMisclassified data 0aProbit model 0aSwitching regression0 tEconomics letters.g2016 Apr., v. 141 p.147-150dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2016.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008000158300001800238520101500256592002801271650001501299650002301314650001801337650002801355650002001383650003001403650001901433650001801452700001301470700001801483700001101501700001101512700001401523700001301537700001501550773012201565856007401687852000901761655001201770IND60618221520221122063550.0181029e20180227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061822152DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra13334k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Fupeng10aFabrication of a microfluidic chip based on the pure polypropylene material  ap. 8732-8738.  aPolypropylene (PP) material has been widely used in the biomedical field for decades due to its high reliability in biochemical reactions. However, a pure PP material microfluidic chip has rarely been reported. Herein, a simple and rapid method has been developed to fabricate a pure PP microfluidic chip by a thermal bonding process using a PP film and PP substrate. An experiment for two-temperature PCR in the pure PP microfluidic system without a pre-treatment process has been successfully carried out. It is shown that the PP microfluidic chip has a high structural strength, tightness for water sealing, and low nonspecific adsorption, which promotes the practical application of microfluidics in the biomedical field. Compared to other existing microfluidic chip technologies, our pure PP material microfluidic chip and its fabrication method have many advantages such as high-speed production rate and extremely low cost. It can be achieved in industrial assembly lines for standardized manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical reactions 3amanufacturing 3amicrofluidic technology 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolypropylenes 3arapid methods1 aQiao, Yi1 aDuan, Mengqin1 aJu, An1 aLu, Na1 aLi, Junji1 aTu, Jing1 aLu, Zuhong0 tRSC advances.g2018 Feb. 27, v. 8, no. 16 p.8732-8738dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra13334k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024001800125040001800143100001700161245008100178300001600259520131300275592002801588650002001616650002001636650001901656650002001675650001301695650001101708650001701719650002101736650001001757650001701767650001101784650002601795650002301821650001301844650001201857650000901869651001801878653001101896653001901907653001401926653001301940653001601953653001601969700002101985700001802006773015502024856007702179852000902256655001202265IND60595085820221122174810.0180526e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059508582DNAL7 a10.1638/2016-0178R3.12doi4 azamd-48-02-08  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahn, Alicia10aBlood product transfusions in great apes: a retrospective review of 12 cases  ap. 461-465.  aAlthough the administration of blood and blood products can be lifesaving, transfusions in exotic species are less common because of the lack of knowledge of a species' blood groups, the availability of species-specific donors, and possible adverse effects. Recently, blood groups were elucidated in great apes; however, few reports have been published regarding actual transfusion situations in these species. This information is critical because poorly executed transfusions can compromise already weakened patients or result in the death of the recipient. In 2014, a retrospective survey of U.S. zoos housing great apes received 45 of 67 responses; from which, 12 transfusion cases in great apes were identified, including Sumatran orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus sumatraensis, n = 4), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, n = 1), and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla, n = 7). These animals, ranging from birth to 31 yr, received intravenous transfusions of whole blood, packed red blood cells, or human albumin. Overall, animals that received transfusions for anemia because of chronic illness or blood loss survived, but those individuals with concurrent life-threatening issues did not survive.

A new species of Illicium subsection Parviflora (Illiciaceae) from the Massif de la Hotte, Haiti. Brittonia 56: 346––352. 2004.—— Illicium hottense, a new species, is here described from the floristically diverse Massif de la Hotte of southern Haiti. It is compared to related species, especially I. ekmanii, with which it has previously been confused. Illicium hottense and I. ekmanii are members of Illicium subsection Parviflora, a group that comprises four species, all endemic to peninsular Florida (I. parviflorum) or the Greater Antilles: Cuba (I. cubense) and Hispaniola (I. ekmanii, and I. hottense). The subsection is characterized by its distinctive laminar-carnose, ovoid stamens; all have trisyncolpate pollen. Illicium hottense is similar to I. ekmanii and I. parviflorum in having flowers with ten to thirteen carpels and six to less commonly eight stamens, but differs from both in its strongly papillose outer tepals and consistently acute leaves. In addition, its leaves lack the strong anise fragrance of I. parviflorum. Finally, molecular data provide support for recognizing I. hottense as a species distinct from I. ekmanii.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIllicium 0aIlliciaceae 0aHaiti 0aHispaniola 0aMassif de la Hotte1 aJudd, Walter S.1 aMorris, Ashley B.0 tBrittonia.g2004 Oct., v. 56, no. 4 p.346-352dNew York Botanical Gardenx0007-196X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1663%2F0007-196X%282004%29056%5B0346%3AANSOIS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02016naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245002500163300001600188520099700204592002801201650001901229650002001248650001901268650001101287650002101298650002301319650002901342650001101371650001301382650001701395650001001412651001201422700001501434773010201449856008201551852000901633655001201642IND60621100520221117221321.0181115e199506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062110052DNAL7 a10.1177/0958305X95006002062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, W.10aCO2 Taxes and Duties  ap. 159-166.  aThe Federal Government is aiming for a reduction of the total CO2 emissions of the whole of Germany by the year 2005 of 25-30%. One of the political instruments that is to be applied for achieving this target is a CO2 duty or tax (see note at the end of this paper). But even the most basic questions regarding the design of this tax still remain a point of conflict. Furthermore it is unclear in what relationship this kind of duty is meant to be with the European combined energy/CO2 tax which since has been suggested. This paper will examine firstly a proposal of CO2 duties for the power station sector, one differentiated according to the efficiency level of the power station and to the energy source, and secondly will show the results of simulations of CO2, duties and energy taxes in models of the economy. In both cases the effectiveness (CO reduction achieved per DM tax) and the efficiency (total economic costs per t CO2 reduction) of different taxation solutions will be noted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aeconomic costs 3aenergy 3aenergy resources 3afederal government 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3apolitics 3apower plants 3ataxes 3aGermany1 aWelsch, H.0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 6, no. 2 p.159-166dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X95006002063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245010100164506011700265506007600382520069000458592002801148506003701176650002701213650001601240650002501256650001101281650001801292650001301310650001101323651002101334653001801355653002701373653002201400653002001422700001101442700002501453773010001478856008401578852000901662655001201671IND60790071420221207063828.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079007142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1013052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrusot, M.14aThe plate collector, a new option for Pinctada margaritifera spat collection in French Polynesia  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aquaculture industry can constitute an important source of waste in the environment.

With the aim of providing a less polluting alternative, we performed in situ tests comparing reusable plate collectors and shade-mesh collectors during 16 months. Plate collectors were significantly more efficient for spat collection, especially after the first 6 months of immersion (P < 0.0001).

In this work, layered cathode materials {e.g., LiNi₀.₄Mn₀.₄Co₀.₁₈Ti₀.₀₂O₂ (NMCs)} were prepared under three different annealing conditions, i.e., 900 °C for 6 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours, respectively. The resulting materials exhibit equivalent crystal structures and morphologies yet likely different surface chemical environments. These materials show distinctively different resistances against the surface passivation/reconstruction (reduction of the transition metals in the layered structure to form rock-salt and/or spinel phases) during electrochemical cycling (2.0–4.7 V vs. Li⁺/Li). In general, the materials annealed for longer durations exhibited lower tendencies to form the surface passivation layer. Furthermore, the surface passivation became less severe when the electrode materials were cycled under mild conditions, such as slow constant current charging–discharging as opposed to cyclic voltammetry. The present study correlates the synthetic conditions with the surface instability and the electrochemical performance in cathode materials, and provides new insights into improving synthetic protocols for battery materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acathodes 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3atransition elements1 aNordlund, Dennis1 aPan, Taijun1 aMarkus, Isaac M.1 aWeng, Tsu-Chien1 aXin, Huolin L.1 aDoeff, Marca M.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Nov. 4, v. 2, no. 46 p.19833-19840dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta04497e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008700159300002000246520163200266592002801898650001201926650001101938650002201949650001101971650002801982650002102010650001902031650002102050650001302071650000902084650001302093650001302106650001302119650001102132650001902143650002402162650002902186650001302215700002102228700001502249700001802264700001902282773014402301856007402445852000902519655001202528IND60670861720221119123948.0191002e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067086172DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta04501g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yi-Chieh10aFormation of internal p–n junctions in Ta₃N₅ photoanodes for water splitting  ap. 20570-20577.  aTantalum nitride photoanodes for water splitting are fabricated by anodizing tantalum foils, with subsequent nitridation of the foils in NH₃. The as-synthesized Ta₃N₅ film has n-type conductivity. Loading Co ions during and after the anodization process forms a Ta₃N₅:Co film consisting of p- and n-type Ta₃N₅ domains. Both the Ta₃N₅ and Ta₃N₅:Co electrodes have a band gap of 2.0 eV. The p–n junctions in the Ta₃N₅:Co electrode create an internal electrical field favorable for hole transfer from the n-type domains to the p-type domains. When the photoanodes are immersed in a 0.5 M KOH aqueous solution for water splitting with one-sun illumination, the Ta₃N₅:Co photoanode exhibits photocurrents an order of magnitude higher than those of the bare Ta₃N₅ photoanode. AC impedance spectroscopy analysis reveals that the p–n junctions formed by Co-doping reduce the interfacial charge transfer resistance by an order of magnitude. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the electrodes indicate that Co incorporation minimizes the defect states in the bulk Ta₃N₅. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy analysis reveals that the high electron transit rate of the Ta₃N₅:Co electrode can be attributed to its fewer defect states. A photoelectrochemical reaction using the Ta₃N₅:Co photoanode produces H₂ and O₂ at a ratio close to 2 : 1, and N₂ evolution from the reaction is negligible. The present study demonstrates the establishment of a p–n junction configuration that considerably enhances the performance of nitride anodes in photocatalyzed water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanodes 3aaqueous solutions 3acobalt 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric current 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen 3aions 3alighting 3anitrides 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3apotassium hydroxide 3areflectance spectroscopy 3atantalum1 aChang, Chih-Yung1 aYeh, Te-Fu1 aLee, Yuh-Lang1 aTeng, Hsisheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 2, no. 48 p.20570-20577dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta04501g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01511naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245007200192300001600264520060800280592002800888653001300916653003500929653002000964653001700984653001201001773009401013856011701107852000901224655001201233IND60125389220221120165910.0151103e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012538922DNAL7 a10.1663/0007-196X(2004)056[0365:AIBOEC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Roger L.13aAn intellectual biography of Elie-Abel Carrièère (l8l8––l896)  ap. 365-374.  aWilliams, R.

Animals were anesthetized with medetomidine–ketamine (MK) (n = 101), tiletamine–zolazepam (TZ) (n = 30), tiletamine–zolazepam–medetomidine (TZM) (n = 24), or medetomidine–ketamine (maintained with isoflurane) (MKI) (n = 21). During each procedure, HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were regularly recorded. Data were grouped according to anesthetic protocol, and mean HR, SBP, and DBP were calculated. Differences between mean HR, SBP, and DBP for each anesthetic protocol were assessed using the Kruskall–Wallis test and a Dunn multiple comparisons post hoc analysis. To assess the hemodynamic time course response to each anesthetic protocol, group mean data (±95% confidence interval [CI]) were plotted against time postanesthetic induction. Mean HR (beats/min [CI]) was significantly higher in TZ (86 [80–92]) compared to MKI (69 [61–78]) and MK (62 [60–64]) and in TZM (73 [68–78]) compared to MK. The average SBP and DBP values (mm Hg [CI]) were significantly higher in MK (130 [126–134] and 94 [91–97]) compared to TZ (104 [96–112] and 58 [53–93]) and MKI (113 [103–123] and 78 [69–87]) and in TZM (128 [120–135] and 88 [83–93]) compared to TZ. Time course data were markedly different between protocols, with MKI showing the greatest decline over time. Both the anesthetic protocol adopted and the timing of measurement after injection influence hemodynamic recordings in wild-born chimpanzees and need to be considered when monitoring or assessing cardiovascular health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPan troglodytes 3aconfidence interval 3adiastolic blood pressure 3aheart rate 3aisoflurane 3amonitoring 3aprotocols 3asystolic blood pressure 0aAnesthesia 0ablood pressure 0achimpanzee 0aPan troglodytes 0aheart disease 0aheart rate1 aStöhr, Eric J.1 aDrane, Aimee L.1 aStembridge, Mike1 aHowatson, Glyn1 adel Rio, Pablo Rodriguez Lopez1 aFeltrer, Yedra1 aTafon, Babila1 aRedrobe, Sharon1 aPeck, Bruce1 aEng, Jaclyn1 aUnwin, Steve1 aSanchez, Carlos R.1 aShave, Rob E.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2017 Sept., v. 48, no. 3 p.636-644dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2016-0181.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013700166300001600303520171800319592002802037650002202065650001102087650001902098650001802117650001302135650001002148650002302158650002202181650001602203650001502219650002002234650001302254650001302267651001802280700001802298700001802316700001502334700001902349700001602368700001702384773011302401856008302514990002302597852000902620655001202629IND60099120720221119101424.0141105e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009912072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshley, N.T.10aGlucocorticosteroid concentrations in feces and hair of captive caribou and reindeer following adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge  ap. 382-391.  aClimate change and industrial development are contributing to synchronous declines in Rangifer populations across the Arctic. Chronic stress has been implicated as a proximate factor associated with decline in free-ranging populations, but its role in Rangifer is unspecified. Analysis of glucocorticosteroid (GC) concentration in feces, and more recently in hair, is a non-invasive method for monitoring stress in wildlife. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) released from the pituitary gland stimulates GC release from the adrenals and can be administered to reflect adrenal activation. In this study, we assessed concentrations of GC metabolites in feces and cortisol in hair of Alaskan caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) and reindeer (R. t. tarandus) following ACTH treatment. We predicted that ACTH challenge would increase concentrations of fecal GCs, but not hair cortisol because steroid deposited into the hair shaft occurs over an extended period of time (months) and is likely insensitive to acute adrenal stimulation. Adult caribou (n=10; mean age, 6.5 years old) exhibited a peak increase in fecal GCs 8h following a 2IU/kg dose of ACTH compared to pre-injection concentrations. In contrast, sub-adult reindeer (n=10, 0.8 years old) elicited a diminished response to the same dose. Quadrupling the dose (8IU/kg) prolonged the fecal GC response in female reindeer, but male reindeer were unresponsive. Hair cortisol was unaffected by a single ACTH challenge. Further investigation is required to ascertain whether subspecific differences in adrenal sensitivity are attributed to age or sex differences, or historical selective pressures from semi-domestication and/or sedentary life cycle in reindeer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRangifer tarandus 3aadults 3aclimate change 3acorticotropin 3acortisol 3afeces 3agender differences 3aindustrialization 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3apituitary gland 3areindeer 3awildlife 3aArctic region1 aBarboza, P.S.1 aMacbeth, B.J.1 aJanz, D.M.1 aCattet, M.R.L.1 aBooth, R.K.1 aWasser, S.K.0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2011 July 1, v. 172, no. 3 p.382-391dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.03.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100009800148245013400246300001800380520154700398592002801945596003401973596003202007650001602039650001102055650002402066650000902090650001402099650001502113650001102128650001502139650001402154650002002168650001402188650001302202650002002215650001802235700005902253700006802312700006502380700006702445700007302512700007802585773015202663856008302815852000902898655001202907IND60763713520221118053527.0220121e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076371352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16324-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenegasso,

It is present in plants, food, and as a contaminant in effluents. In this article, we demonstrate the effects of embryonic exposure to three different concentrations of genistein (10 μg/L, 40 μg/L, and 80 μg/L) which is similar to those found in effluents. Zebrafish eggs were exposed during the first 72 h post-fertilization (hpf). Heart rate was evaluated at 48 hpf and mortality rate was assessed during the first 72 hpf. The light/dark (LDT) and open field (OFT) behavioral tests were applied to the larvae (6 dpf), and the novel tank (NTT), social preference (SPT), light-dark (LDT), and sexing tests were performed on adult fish (90 dpf). Embryonic exposure to genistein caused anxiolytic-like behavior in both larvae and adult animals. In adult stage, we observed an increase in locomotor activity and antisocial behavior in the concentration of 40 μg/L. There was an increase in the mortality rate in all concentrations when compared to the control and an increase in heart rate at the concentration of 80 μg/L. Exposure to 10 μg/L generated a higher frequency of females when compared to the control group. Our results show that exposure to genistein during the embryonic phase brings damage in the short and long term as it increases the mortality rate and leads to behavioral disorders both in the larval stage, with perpetuation until adult stage. The anxiolytic-like effect and less social interaction are effects that harm fish survival.  aPublisher supplied data  a88887.161013/2017-00cFAPERGS  a17/2551-0000 804-9cFAPERGS 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aantisocial behavior 3afish 3agenistein 3aheart rate 3alarvae 3alocomotion 3amortality 3aplant estrogens 3apollution 3aresearch 3asocial behavior 3atranquilizers1 aFortuna, Milena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0335-99941 aSoares, Suelen Mendonça1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3327-00021 aMaffi, Victoria Costa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1918-85201 aMozzato, Mateus Timbola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6933-01931 aBarcellos, Leonardo José Gil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4637-33771 aRossato-Grando, Luciana Grazziotin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4574-855X0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 6 p.8957-8969dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16324-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01981naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245014000163300001600303520096800319592002801287653002001315653000901335653002601344653001201370653001001382653001301392700002201405700002401427773012801451856007901579852000901658655001201667IND60124605620221119060845.0150427e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012460562DNAL7 a10.1525/abt.2014.76.5.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlair, Amy C.10aPromoting Student Inquiry Using Zea mays (Corn) Cultivars for Hypothesis-Driven Experimentation in a Majors Introductory Biology Course  ap. 333-336.  aThe AAAS Vision and Change report (2011) recommends incorporating student research experiences into the biology curriculum at the undergraduate level. This article describes, in detail, how Zea mays (corn) cultivars were used as a model for a hypothesis-driven short-term research project in an introductory biology course at a small Midwestern university. During the course of this project, student groups generated a research question and hypothesis, designed an experiment, collected data, and reported their findings in a paper modeled after the primary literature. Throughout the project, students experienced first hand the obstacles and accomplishments associated with the process of scientific research and gained a greater understanding of plant biology. By demonstrating biology as a dynamic field centered around hypothesis generation and experimentation, the authors observed an increase in student dedication, interest, and enthusiasm for the course.  aPublisher supplied data 0aActive learning 0acorn 0ahypothesis generation 0ainquiry 0amaize 0aZea mays1 aPeters, Brenda J.1 aBendixen, Conrad W.0 tAmerican biology teacher.g2014 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.333-336dUniversity of California PresswJournal:19725x0002-76857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525/abt.2014.76.5.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01661naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010500163300001600268520066600284592002800950653001300978653000800991653002400999653002601023653002601049653001701075700001801092700002101110773012801131856007901259852000901338655001201347IND60124605720221119060811.0150427e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012460572DNAL7 a10.1525/abt.2014.76.5.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChudyk, Sarah10aUsing the Eastern Hellbender Salamander in a High School Genetics & Ecological Conservation Activity  ap. 338-344.  aThis article contains an original 5E lesson plan developed from conservation genetics research on the giant North American hellbender salamander, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis.

Therefore, studies on reproductive biology and its relationship with endocrine and environmental factors are key to improving the cultivation techniques of Brazilian fish species. This study examined the influence of water temperature on sex steroid concentrations (testosterone, 17β-estradiol and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone), spawning efficiency, fecundity, fertilisation rate, larval abnormality rates and involvement of the cytoskeleton during the final oocyte maturation of Prochilodus argenteus under experimental conditions. The results of our study showed that in captivity, sex steroid plasma concentrations and spawning performance of P. argenteus were clearly different for fish kept in water with different temperature regimes. In lower water temperature (23°C), it was observed that: 33% of females did not ovulate, fecundity was lower and vitellogenic oocytes after the spawning induction procedure exhibited a smaller diameter. Moreover, concentrations of 17β-estradiol and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone were lower and there was a delay in the final oocyte maturation and, consequently, ovulation and spawning. Our experiments showed direct influence of water temperature in the process of induced spawning of P. argenteus. Changes in water temperature also suggest the tubulin involvement in the nuclear dislocation process and the possible action of actin filaments in the release of polar bodies during final oocyte maturation of P. argenteus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProchilodus argenteus 3acaptive animals 3aenvironmental factors 3aestradiol 3afecundity 3afemales 3afish 3alarvae 3alentic systems 3amicrofilaments 3amigratory behavior 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3aspawning 3atestosterone 3atubulin 3awater temperature1 aSantos, Hélio B.1 aRizzo, Elizete1 aSato, Yoshimi1 aBazzoli, Nilo0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2011 July 1, v. 172, no. 3 p.400-408dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245011000168300001600278520036400294592002800658650001400686650001300700650001100713650002800724650002700752650001300779650001700792650002100809650002200830700002200852700001500874773011400889856005701003852000901060655001201069IND4501409120221118232417.0150424e198705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450140912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.1987.tb02675.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, I.10aUptake hydrogenase in fast‐growing strains of Rhizobium sp.

This condition may have profound implications on the structure and function of the hyporheic ecotone. This study was aimed at assessing whether meiofaunal copepod assemblages displayed a longitudinal zonation corresponding to discontinuities along an Alpine stream profile determined by changes of geology and alternating canyon and floodplain segments. Moreover, the study aimed at testing, at a regional scale, the potential role of copepods as describers of surface–subsurface hydrological exchanges in the hyporheic zone. The results indicated that copepod assemblage compositions changed according to geomorphological and physicochemical stream longitudinal discontinuities. The headwater upwelling sector of the stream predominantly harboured stygobiotic species; the intermediate sector, where stream water is in hydrodynamic equilibrium with ground water, was characterised by the highest species richness and abundances both of stygobiotic and non-stygobiotic species; the downstream alluvial fan, where downwelling occurred, was defined by high non-stygobiotic species richness along with low occurrence of stygobionts. The different distribution of stygobiotic and non-stygobiotic species in gaining and losing sectors of this Alpine stream suggested the role of copepods as describers of the hydrological flowpaths in the hyporheic zone at the catchment scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aecotones 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3ahydrodynamics 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3awatersheds 0aCopepods 0aHyporheic zone 0aAlpine stream 0aActive exchange describers 0aRiver discontinuum1 aStoch, Fabio1 aGalassi, Diana M.P.0 tLimnologica.g2013 June, v. 43, no. 4 p.288-296dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2012.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014800166520136900314592002801683650001901711650001801730650001701748650000901765650002401774650002701798650002501825650001401850650001101864650001701875650001801892650003101910650002101941650001501962650001901977650001401996650001102010650001902021651001002040653002302050653002102073653002202094653002402116653001902140653001402159653000802173653000802181653000802189700001402197700001802211773009402229856008402323852000902407655001202416IND60683573520221117185246.0201125e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068357352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1113142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Junyi14aThe structural changes and determinants of household energy choices and energy consumption in urban China: Addressing the role of building type  aUnderstanding the energy use and choice behaviors in urban China is essential to curb its energy consumption and air pollutant emissions. Current energy consumption estimates for urban households in China rarely account for the effects of building types on energy choice behavior, thus may lead to biased policy implications. In this paper, we estimate the determinants of household energy consumption for different energy choice scenarios through the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model, using urban household data. The empirical results show that household use of various energy carriers is driven by household income, fuel price, demographics, building attributes and lifestyles. Results show building types have a significant effect on household energy consumption behaviors. Households living in old houses have less access to clean energy, such as piped gas. Income and price elasticities of energy consumption vary with energy type in each scenario, and there exist certain substitution effects among different types of energy carriers. In particular, inter-fuel substitute elasticities between coal and clean energy are asymmetric. Our study highlights the significance of city planning and infrastructure expansion policies and also offers a better basis for coordinating and designing energy policies in urban China and other developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aclean energy 3acoal 3ademand elasticities 3ademographic statistics 3adeveloping countries 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenergy policy 3aenergy use and consumption 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3ainfrastructure 3alifestyle 3amodels 3aurban planning 3aChina 0aEnergy consumption 0aPrice elasticity 0aIncome elasticity 0aSubstitution effect 0aBuilding types 0aSUR model 0aD12 0aO18 0aQ411 aTeng, Fei1 aZhou, Shaojie0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Apr., v. 139 p.111314-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1113143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245013000218300001600348520162300364592002801987650000902015650001502024650001002039650001602049650001202065650004002077650002402117650001302141650001802154650001902172650001002191650001802201650000902219650001202228650002402240650002702264653003702291653001302328653002402341653000802365653000902373700002802382700002002410700002202430700001902452700002302471700002402494700002202518700002102540773011902561856008602680852000902766655001202775IND60562810920221123045015.0180831e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056281092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaraswathi, Viswanathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6721-960012aA combination of dietary N-3 fatty acids and a cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor attenuates nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice  ap. 149-159.  aWe sought to determine whether a combination of purified n-3 fatty acids (n-3) and SC-560 (SC), a cyclooxygenase-1-specific inhibitor, is effective in ameliorating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obesity. Female wild-type mice were fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HF) supplemented with n-3 in the presence or absence of SC. Mice treated with SC alone exhibited no change in liver lipids, whereas n-3-fed mice tended to have lower hepatic lipids. Mice given n-3+SC had significantly lower liver lipids compared with HF controls indicating enhanced lipid clearance. Total and sulfated bile acids were significantly higher only in n-3+SC-treated mice compared with chow diet (CD) controls. Regarding mechanisms, the level of pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor regulating drug/bile detoxification, was significantly higher in mice given n-3 or n-3+SC. Studies in precision-cut liver slices and in cultured hepatoma cells showed that n-3+SC enhanced not only the expression/activation of PXR and its target genes but also the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), another regulator of bile synthesis/clearance, indicating that n-3+SC can induce both PXR and FXR. The mRNA level of FGFR4 which inhibits bile formation showed a significant reduction in Huh 7 cells upon n-3 and n-3+SC treatment. PXR overexpression in hepatoma cells confirmed that n-3 or SC each induced the expression of PXR target genes and in combination had an enhanced effect. Our findings suggest that combining SC with n-3 potentiates its lipid-lowering effect, in part, by enhanced PXR and/or altered FXR/FGFR4 signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile 3abile acids 3adrugs 3afatty liver 3afemales 3afibroblast growth factor receptor 4 3agene overexpression 3ahepatoma 3ahigh fat diet 3alipemic effect 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aobesity 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aprostaglandin synthase 0aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease 0aFish oil 0aOmega-3 fatty acids 0aPXR 0aBile1 aPerriotte-Olson, Curtis1 aGanesan, Murali1 aDesouza, Cyrus V.1 aAlnouti, Yazen1 aDuryee, Michael J.1 aThiele, Geoffrey M.1 aNordgren, Tara M.1 aClemens, Dahn L.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2017 Apr., v. 42 p.149-159dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014600158300002000304520145300324592002801777650001601805650001701821650002301838650002101861650002201882650003101904650001101935650001201946650001501958650001301973650002201986650002402008700001202032700001702044700001702061773012402078856007402202852000902276655001202285IND60640362220221120224149.0190504e20160229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064036222DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra00328a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shujun10aQuantum mechanics and molecular mechanics study of the reaction mechanism of quorum quenching enzyme: N-acyl homoserine lactonase with C6-HSL  ap. 23396-23402.  aN-Acyl-homoserine lactonase from Ochrobactrum sp. strain (AidH) is a novel AHL (N-acyl-homoserine lactone)-lactonase that hydrolyzes the ester bond of the homoserine lactone ring of AHLs. In this article, on the basis of the high-resolution crystal structure of the mutated AidH in complex with substrate, a combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach has been employed to study the detailed catalytic mechanism of AidH using C6-HSL (N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone) as the substrate. The calculation results reveal that the catalytic reaction starts from the abstraction of the hydroxyl hydrogen of Ser102 by His248. Both the formation and cleavage of the covalent bond between Ser102 and the substrate are possible rate-limiting steps, corresponding to energy barriers of 19.2 and 21.7 kcal mol⁻¹, respectively. The ring-opening of the covalent intermediate is calculated to be quite easy. During the catalysis, His248 acts as a dual Lewis acid/base, whereas Glu219 is not directly involved in the chemical process and Tyr160 only plays a role in stabilizing the transition state and orienting the position of the hydrolytic water molecule. In addition, the distant surrounding residues were found to have different influences on the reaction by their electrostatic interaction with the substrate. These results may provide useful information for the novel treatment of plant and animal infections that rely on AHL signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aOchrobactrum 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3ahomoserine 3ahydrogen 3aquantum mechanics 3areaction mechanisms1 aSu, Hao1 aMa, Guangcai1 aLiu, Yongjun0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 29, v. 6, no. 28 p.23396-23402dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra00328a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003600149245009700185300001800282520124600300592002801546650001701574650002501591650001701616650001801633650002301651650001101674650001401685651001101699700003701710700003501747700002901782700004301811700002501854700003101879773010101910856008502011852000902096655001202105IND4461282020221120212136.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446128202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2011.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Maria Mozarina Beserra10aBioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of fresh exotic fruits from northeastern Brazil  ap. 2155-2159.  aFoods rich in antioxidants play an essential role in the prevention of diseases. The present study compared contents of phenolics, vitamin C, anthocyanin and antioxidant activity of 11 fresh exotic fruits, cultivated in the northeastern part of Brazil. The antioxidant activities were evaluated using two antioxidant systems 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), expressed as TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) and VCEAC (Vitamin C Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) values. The results indicated that the above fruits, such as murici and mangaba, were good sources of antioxidants. The phenolic contents showed positive correlations with total antioxidant by ABTS (R=0.94, P≤0.001) and DPPH (R=0.88, P≤0.001) assays. However, this correlation was not noticed when examining vitamin C and anthocyanins contents. The 11 fruits studied had comparable antioxidant activity in both, ABTS and DPPH assays. These methods are recommended as useful tools for the evaluation of the total activity antioxidant in fruits. Our results indicated promising perspectives for the development and usage of fruits species studied with considerable levels of antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3adisease prevention 3afruits 3araw fruit 3aBrazil1 ade Sousa, Paulo Henrique Machado1 aArriaga, Ângela Martha Campos1 ado Prado, Giovana Matias1 aMagalhães, Carlos Emanuel de Carvalho1 aMaia, Geraldo Arraes1 ade Lemos, Telma Leda Gomes0 tFood research international.g2011 Aug., v. 44, no. 7 p.2155-2159dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2011.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245017700172300001600349520145200365592002801817650001601845650002101861650002101882650001301903650001101916650001501927650001101942650001101953650001201964650001201976650001101988650001201999650002202011653001502033653002202048653001702070653002602087653001102113653002002124653002302144653002002167700002202187773009902209856008402308852000902392655001202401IND60086246920221120043633.0190318e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008624692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2013.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurton, Frédéric10aPrediction of the consumption rates for juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) on the scale of habitat patches: Development of empirical models based on stomach contents  ap. 332-338.  aRivers and streams are unstable environments in which estimation of energetic costs and benefits of habitat utilization are the daunting exercise. Empirical models of food consumption may be used to estimate energetic benefits based on abiotic and biotic conditions in patches of habitat. We performed thirty daily surveys of fish stomach contents to estimate the consumption rates for juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in a river. The data were used to assess whether variations of daily consumption rates existed within the river, and to develop empirical models that could predict fish consumption rates using abiotic and biotic conditions as independent variables. Daily consumption rates based on stomach content surveys in the field (range: 0.15–1.49g dry/(100g wet day)) varied significantly depending on habitat patch (500–1000m2), summer period, and sampling year. Variables such as water temperature, numerical density of salmon, water depth and moon phase explained 83–93% of the variations in daily food consumption rates. Daily consumption rates tended to increase with water temperature and depth, and were also higher near a full moon. However, they tended to decrease with the numerical density of salmon. Our work suggests that empirical models based on independent variables that are relatively simple to estimate in the field may be developed to predict fish consumption rates in different habitat patches in a river.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3afish consumption 3afood consumption 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aprediction 3arivers 3asalmon 3astomach 3astreams 3asummer 3asurveys 3awater temperature 0aWater flow 0aWater temperature 0aFish density 0aEvacuation rate model 0aGrowth 0aHabitat quality 0aInvertebrate drift 0aNet energy gain1 aBoisclair, Daniel0 tLimnologica.g2013 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.332-338dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2013.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003700117024002300154024004100177024002500218040001800243100005500261245013800316520128900454592002801743650003401771650001601805650000901821650001001830650001401840650001401854650001001868651001401878700002101892700001801913700001901931773013301950856011402083856008302197961001302280852000902293655001202302IND60792909420221119123915.0220922e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079290942DNAL7 a10113/79290942hdl7 a10.3390/agriculture120913132doi7 a3974692seq_no_1157 a6052-21000-016-000D2aris_project_no7 a4343762aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTodd, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4267-354810aIdentification of Selection Preferences and Predicting Yield Related Traits in Sugarcane Seedling Families Using RGB Spectral Indices  aThe early stages of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Louisiana commercial sugarcane breeding program involve planting large numbers of genetically unique seedlings that require time and resources to evaluate. Selection is made quickly, is subjective, and related to the appearance of yield and vigor. Remote sensing techniques have been used to predict yield of several crops over large areas using areal images. To understand selection preferences better and if remote sensing techniques could be used to increase efficiency, twelve sugarcane seedling families each having approximately 263 seedlings were planted in two replications at the USDA-ARS Ardoyne farm. Stalk height, number and diameter ratings were taken on 50 stools of each replication of each family. Red-Green-Blue images were taken of the seedling field in plant cane and first ratoon before selection. Spectral indices were derived from the images for each plot. Height had the largest influence on visual selections of the field measurements evaluated. Several spectral indices such as the Green Area (GA) correlated highly with important traits including Height (>0.80), selection rates (>0.70), and Brix (>0.60). The results show the potential for seedling evaluation by remote sensing methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aagriculture 3abrix 3afarms 3aseedlings 3asugarcane 3avigor 3aLouisiana1 aJohnson, Richard1 aVerdun, David1 aRichard, Katie0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 26, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/79290943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120913133Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009700166300001800263520141300281592002801694650001501722650003401737650001301771650002901784650002601813653001301839653001301852653002001865653002501885653003101910700002101941700002001962700001901982700002402001700001902025773009902044856008402143852000902227655001202236IND60734915520221120141952.0220606e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073491552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewell, Rhys10aChIP-R: Assembling reproducible sets of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq peaks from multiple replicates  ap. 1855-1866.  aChromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the primary protocol for detecting genome-wide DNA-protein interactions, and therefore a key tool for understanding transcriptional regulation. A number of factors, including low specificity of antibody and cellular heterogeneity of sample, may cause “peak” callers to output noise and experimental artefacts. Statistically combining multiple experimental replicates from the same condition could significantly enhance our ability to distinguish actual transcription factor binding events, even when peak caller accuracy and consistency of detection are compromised. We adapted the rank-product test to statistically evaluate the reproducibility from any number of ChIP-seq experimental replicates. We demonstrate over a number of benchmarks that our adaptation “ChIP-R" (pronounced ‘chipper’) performs as well as or better than comparable approaches on recovering transcription factor binding sites in ChIP-seq peak data. We also show ChIP-R extends to evaluate ATAC-seq peaks, finding reproducible peak sets even at low sequencing depth. ChIP-R decomposes peaks across replicates into “fragments” which either form part of a peak in a replicate, or not. We show that by re-analysing existing data sets, ChIP-R reconstructs reproducible peaks from fragments with enhanced biological enrichment relative to current strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3agenomics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aChIP-seq 0aATAC-seq 0aReproducibility 0aTranscription factor 0aTranscriptional regulation1 aPienaar, Richard1 aBalderson, Brad1 aPiper, Michael1 aEssebier, Alexandra1 aBodén, Mikael0 tGenomics.g2021 July, v. 113, no. 4 p.1855-1866dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005500092040001800147072000900165100002000174245012800194300001600322500002400338520129800362650001001660650002001670650003001690650002201720650003101742650002001773650001101793650001301804650001201817650002701829651001101856653001901867700001801886700001601904700001701920700001601937773013701953852000902090856006902099856010902168930003302277945002502310946001302335655001202348IND4381536020221123011300.0060629e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438153602DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99[536:IOPMIQ]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aBostanian, N.J.10aInventory of Predacious Mites in Quebec Commercial Apple Orchards Where Integrated Pest Management Programs Are Implemented  ap. 536-544.  aIncludes references  aThe commercial apple (Malus spp.) orchard ecosystem in Quebec has a diverse fauna of predacious mites. A systematic 2-yr survey showed Amblyseius fallacis (Garman), Typhlodromus caudiglans Schuster (Acari: Phytoseiidae), and Agistemus fleschneri Summers (Acari: Stigmaeidae) to be the most abundant species. Other phytoseiids, Typhlodromus conspicuous (Garman), Typhlodromus herbertae Chant, Typhlodromus longipilus Nesbitt, Typhlodromus bakeri (Garman), Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten, Amblyseius okanagensis (Chant), and Amblyseius finlandicus (Oudemans), were found in low numbers. Two of these species, A. finlandicus and T. conspicuus, were identified for the first time in Quebec. Other occasional species included Anystis baccarum (L.) (Acari: Anystidae) and Balaustium sp. (Acari: Erythraeidae). Tetranychid mite numbers were always less than two mites per leaf throughout the study, and none of the commercial orchards required an acaricide treatment. A notable aspect of this study was that seasonal totals for A. fleschneri and A. fallacis decreased 7.3- and 42.2-fold, respectively, whereas T. caudiglans increased 9.1-fold from 1999 to 2000. Possible mechanisms for these changes, including variations in winter mortality, competition for food, and intraguild predation are discussed. 3aAcari 3apredatory mites 3abiological control agents 3aspecies diversity 3aintegrated pest management 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3aorchards 3asurveys 3anew geographic records 3aQuebec 0amite inventory1 aHardman, J.M.1 aRacette, G.1 aFranklin, J.1 aLasnier, J.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2006 May, v. 99, no. 3 p.536-544dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ann/3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99%5B536:IOPMIQ%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20060821b20060906c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle03852naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011500172506010400287506007600391520193300467592002802400506003702428650001402465650001302479650001502492650001802507650001802525650002402543650001502567650001202582650003202594650001202626650002702638650002502665650001702690650002502707650002602732650001302758650001302771650001602784650002602800650001002826653002402836653002402860653004002884653001702924653001902941700001502960700002102975700001802996700002203014700002303036773009703059856008503156852000903241655001203250IND60763854820221207100220.0220621e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076385482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1181152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashiri, Reihaneh10aLooking for lipases and lipolytic organisms in low-temperature anaerobic reactors treating domestic wastewater  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPoor lipid degradation limits low-temperature anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater even when psychrophiles are used. We combined metagenomics and metaproteomics to find lipolytic bacteria and their potential, and actual, cold-adapted extracellular lipases in anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating domestic wastewater at 4 and 15 °C. Of the 40 recovered putative lipolytic metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), only three (Chlorobium, Desulfobacter, and Mycolicibacterium) were common and abundant (relative abundance ≥ 1%) in all reactors. Notably, some MAGs that represented aerobic autotrophs contained lipases. Therefore, we hypothesised that the lipases we found are not always associated with exogenous lipid degradation and can have other roles such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) accumulation/degradation and interference with the outer membranes of other bacteria. Metaproteomics did not provide sufficient proteome coverage for relatively lower abundant proteins such as lipases though the expression of fadL genes, long-chain fatty acid transporters, was confirmed for four genera (Dechloromonas, Azoarcus, Aeromonas and Sulfurimonas), none of which were recovered as putative lipolytic MAGs. Metaproteomics also confirmed the presence of 15 relatively abundant (≥ 1%) genera in all reactors, of which at least 6 can potentially accumulate lipid/polyhydroxyalkanoates. For most putative lipolytic MAGs, there was no statistically significant correlation between the read abundance and reactor conditions such as temperature, phase (biofilm and bulk liquid), and feed type (treated by ultraviolet light or not). Results obtained by metagenomics and metaproteomics did not confirm each other and extracellular lipases and lipolytic bacteria were not easily identifiable in the anaerobic membrane reactors used in this study. Further work is required to identify the true lipid degraders in these systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAeromonas 3aAzoarcus 3aChlorobium 3aDechloromonas 3aDesulfobacter 3aanaerobic treatment 3aautotrophs 3abiofilm 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aliquids 3along chain fatty acids 3amembrane bioreactors 3ametagenomics 3amunicipal wastewater 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3aproteome 3aresearch 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater 0aAnaerobic treatment 0aDomestic wastewater 0aPsychrophilic extracellular lipases 0aMetagenomics 0aMetaproteomics1 aAllen, Ben1 aShamurad, Burhan1 aPabst, Martin1 aCurtis, Thomas P.1 aOfiţeru, Irina D.0 tWater research.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 212 p.118115-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1181153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013300170300001800303520116100321592002801482650002201510650001501532650002001547650001301567650001001580650002001590650001301610650001601623650002601639650003101665650001901696650001501715650002201730650002401752650001701776653002401793653002101817653001501838653002001853653002201873653001901895700001501914773009901929856008402028852000902112655001202121IND60734915720221120121914.0220606e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073491572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Abhibhav12aA machine learning approach to unmask novel gene signatures and prediction of Alzheimer's disease within different brain regions  ap. 1778-1789.  aAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose aetiology is currently unknown. Although numerous studies have attempted to identify the genetic risk factor(s) of AD, the interpretability and/or the prediction accuracies achieved by these studies remained unsatisfactory, reducing their clinical significance. Here, we employ the ensemble of random-forest and regularized regression model (LASSO) to the AD-associated microarray datasets from four brain regions - Prefrontal cortex, Middle temporal gyrus, Hippocampus, and Entorhinal cortex- to discover novel genetic biomarkers through a machine learning-based feature-selection classification scheme. The proposed scheme unraveled the most optimum and biologically significant classifiers within each brain region, which achieved by far the highest prediction accuracy of AD in 5-fold cross-validation (99% average). Interestingly, along with the novel and prominent biomarkers including CORO1C, SLC25A46, RAE1, ANKIB1, CRLF3, PDYN, numerous non-coding RNA genes were also observed as discriminator, of which AK057435 and BC037880 are uncharacterized long non-coding RNA genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abiomarkers 3adata collection 3aetiology 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3ahippocampus 3amicroarray technology 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3anon-coding RNA 3aprediction 3aprefrontal cortex 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aMachine learning 0aBiomarkers 0aGene expression 0aFeature selection 0aClassification1 aDey, Pinki0 tGenomics.g2021 July, v. 113, no. 4 p.1778-1789dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01529naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099024003600116040001800152100002600170245005000196300001400246520049000260592002800750650002700778650001800805650002000823650001200843650004100855650000900896650001100905650000900916650003100925700002700956773010400983852000901087856008301096655001201179991632067610742620221118181202.0181010e197701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790582962DNAL7 a8509902pmid7 a10.1177/0300985877014001022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaag, Ingrid van der,10aEight Cases of Pericardial Defects in the Dog  ap. 14-18.  aPericardial defects were found in eight dogs.

Vast majority of existing studies paid close attention to the design of nodes in terms of economic and environmental improvements. By contrast, the optimization of core industrial chain is largely overlooked. A novel methodology is proposed in this study to assist the core ecological industry chain design where resources, economy and environment are set as the constraints. Ecological industry chain efficiency is evaluated by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) where constraint conditions gradually superimposed into the core ecological industry chain. This methodology is validated through an empirical case study. Results showed that the relative efficiency of the core ecological industry chain consisted of Chlorine Alkali Plant-Alumina Plant-Electrolytic Aluminum Plant-Aluminum Deep Processing Plant is close to 1. This core ecological industry chain achieved the coordinated development among economic, energy and environment. It belongs to the typical value-added design of EIC. The relative efficiency of the core ecological industry chains consisted of Lime Plant-Calcium Carbide Plant-Polyvinyl Chloride Plant and Chlorine Alkali Plant- Polyvinyl Chloride Plant-Density Board Plant is 0.8690 and 0.7956, respectively. These core ecological industry chains can be further improved by means of continuous optimization design, i.e., introducing key fill chain links to rearrange the upstream and downstream enterprises. These findings provide useful references for the EIPs development and related policy making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3achlorides 3achlorine 3aenergy 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3aplant density 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3avalue added 0aEconomy 0aResource 0aEnvironment 0aEcological industry chain 0aOptimization design 0aCoordinated development1 aSun, Yue1 aYuan, Xueliang1 aCao, Dayong1 aZuo, Jian1 aGao, Zhenlei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 July 10, v. 156 p.235-243dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.1853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245013400209300001600343520194800359592002802307650001902335650001502354650001402369650001002383650002402393650001002417650001302427650001102440650001802451650001802469650001102487650001202498650001302510650001302523650004302536650000902579650003002588650002102618650001002639700001902649700001902668700002402687773011302711856008302824990002302907852000902930655001202939IND60099121520221119101328.0141105e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009912152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.05.0132doi7 aPMC31522532pmcid7 a216519122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollar, Amy R.10aHigher thyroid hormone receptor expression correlates with short larval periods in spadefoot toads and increases metamorphic rate  ap. 190-198.  aSpadefoot toad species display extreme variation in larval period duration, due in part to evolution of thyroid hormone (TH) physiology. Specifically, desert species with short larval periods have higher tail tissue content of TH and exhibit increased responsiveness to TH. To address the molecular basis of larval period differences, we examined TH receptor (TR) expression across species. Based on the dual function model for the role of TR in development, we hypothesized that desert spadefoot species with short larval periods would have (1) late onset of TR expression prior to the production of endogenous TH and (2) higher TR levels when endogenous TH becomes available. To test these hypotheses, we cloned fragments of TRα and TRβ genes from the desert spadefoot toads Scaphiopus couchii and Spea multiplicata and their non-desert relative Pelobates cultripes and measured their mRNA levels in tails using quantitative PCR in the absence (premetamorphosis) or presence (natural metamorphosis) of TH. All species express TRα and TRβ from the earliest stages measured (from just after hatching), but S. couchii, which has the shortest larval period, had more TRα throughout development compared to P. cultripes, which has the longest larval period. TRβ mRNA levels were similar across species. Exogenous T3 treatment induced faster TH-response gene expression kinetics in S. couchii compared to the other species, consistent with its higher TRα mRNA expression and indicative of a functional consequence of more TRα activity at the molecular level. To directly test whether higher TRα expression may contribute to shorter larval periods, we overexpressed TRα via plasmid injection into tail muscle cells of the model frog Xenopus laevis and found an increased rate of muscle cell death in response to TH. These results suggest that increased TRα expression evolved in S. couchii and contribute to its higher metamorphic rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus laevis 3acell death 3aevolution 3afrogs 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahatching 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3ametamorphosis 3amodels 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3aplasmids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atail 3athyroid hormone receptors 3athyroid hormones 3atoads1 aChoi, Jinyoung1 aGrimm, Adam T.1 aBuchholz, Daniel R.0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 173, no. 1 p.190-198dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.05.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010500165300001800270520097100288592002801259650001001287650001001297650001301307650001501320650001801335650001201353650001801365650001401383650001301397650000901410650002101419650003001440653003101470653002401501653002201525653002601547653002601573653002401599653001601623653001801639653001001657653001201667653000801679653001101687653000701698653000901705653000801714653000801722653000801730653000801738653000901746653000801755653000801763653000801771653000801779653000801787700001801795700001601813700001901829700001601848700001801864773009901882856008401981852000902065655001202074IND60734915820221120131756.0220606e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073491582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhaopei10aGermline and somatic mutation profile in Cancer patients revealed by a medium-sized pan-Cancer panel  ap. 1930-1939.  aGene mutation detection and the resulted precision-medicine therapy is transforming clinical practice.

We used a hybridization capture-based NGS assay for targeted deep sequencing of all exons and selected introns of 181 key cancer driver genes, covering both inherited risks and somatic mutations. We performed paired-variant calling on tumor samples and their matched normal samples. We processed clinical patient samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumors (FFPE samples) and cell-free peripheral blood (cfDNA samples). We found germline mutations of inherited cancer risk at 9%; and discovered a novel germline mutation in BRCA1. Somatic mutation rate in driver genes is at 73.1%, much higher than previously reported.

Consequently, carbon accounting methods employed for this economic sector play an important role in ensuring the accuracy of carbon accounts globally. For the U.S., the diverse purposes and methods of eight federal data products yield eight different estimates of U.S. electric-sector carbon dioxide emissions. Prior studies neither fully characterized these differences nor evaluated the data products' ability to capture changes in carbon dioxide emissions from certain now-minor sources of electricity that are projected to increase as the grid modernizes. Here we explore how shifts in electricity sources might impact current carbon accounting methods. We show that if no changes are made, four of the six data products could exclude (via omission or attribution) 1.1%–3.3% of carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. electricity generation in 2040. Maintaining comprehensive tracking of electric-sector emissions through the suggestions made herein can help enable efficient allocation of mitigation resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3aeconomic sectors 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amodernization 3aUnited States 0aCarbon accounting 0aElectricity generation 0aDistributed generation 0aRenewable energy 0aGreenhouse gas reporting 0aGrid modernization1 aHeath, Garvin A.0 tEnergy policy.g2020 May, v. 140 p.111324-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1113243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010500167300001600272520245900288592002802747650002602775650001502801650002402816650001502840650002502855650001902880650001902899650001502918650001602933650001902949650001102968650001202979650002902991650001603020650001203036653003303048653001903081653002703100653003203127653003603159700002103195700002103216773009903237856008403336852000903420655001203429IND60086247520221123032246.0190318e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008624752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2013.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisser, Fleur10aOptical remote sensing of submerged aquatic vegetation: Opportunities for shallow clearwater streams  ap. 388-398.  aRemote sensing has rarely been used as a tool to map and monitor submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in rivers, due to a combination of insufficient spatial resolution of available image data and strong attenuation of light in water through absorption and scattering. The latter process reduces the possibility to use spectral reflectance information to accurately classify submerged species. However, increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) image data may enable the use of shape and texture features to help discriminate between species by taking an object based image analysis (OBIA) approach, and overcome some of the present limitations.This study aimed to investigate the possibility of using optical remote sensing for the detection and mapping of SAV. It firstly looked at the possibilities to discriminate submerged macrophyte species based on spectral information only. Reflectance spectra of three macrophyte species were measured in situ across a range of submergence depths. The results showed that water depth will be a limiting factor for the classification of species from remote sensing images. Only Spiked Water Milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) was indicated as spectrally distinct through ANOVA analysis, but subsequent Jeffries–Matusita distance analysis did not confirm this. In particular Water Crowfoot (Ranunculus fluitans) and Pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) could not be discriminated at 95% significance level. Spectral separability of these two species was also not possible without the effect of an overlying water column.Secondly, the possibility to improve species discrimination, using spatial and textural information was investigated for the same SAV species. VHR image data was acquired with a Near Infrared (NIR) sensitive DSLR camera from four different heights including a telescopic pole and a Helikite UAS. The results show that shape and texture information can improve the detection of the spectrally similar Pondweed and Water Crowfoot from VHR image data. The best performing feature ‘length/width ratio of sub-objects’ was obtained through expert knowledge. All of the shape and texture based features performed better at species differentiation than the spectrally based features.In conclusion this study has shown that there is considerable potential for the combination of VHR data and OBIA to map SAV in shallow stream environments, which can benefit species monitoring and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3aRanunculus 3aStuckenia pectinata 3aabsorption 3aanalysis of variance 3aexpert opinion 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3astreams 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3asubmergence 3atexture 0aSubmerged aquatic vegetation 0aShallow rivers 0aOptical remote sensing 0aObject-based image analysis 0aVery high resolution image data1 aWallis, Caroline1 aSinnott, Anne M.0 tLimnologica.g2013 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.388-398dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2013.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245006000169300001600229520076200245592002801007653002501035653001701060653002901077653001501106653000801121653000901129653001401138653001401152653001801166653002001184700001701204773013001221856007901351852000901430655001201439IND60124607220221119061419.0150427e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012460722DNAL7 a10.1525/abt.2014.76.7.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForrest, Christine,14aThe Electron Transport Chain: An Interactive Simulation  ap. 456-458.  aThis activity provides students an interactive demonstration of the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis during aerobic respiration.

Herein, an unprecedented molybdenum–oxo-complex-catalyzed intermolecular cross-coupling of benzyl alcohols has been reported. Various alcohols including primary, secondary, and tertiary substrates can proceed efficiently under these conditions. Several functional groups sensitive to the low-valent transition metals, such as aryl halides, can be well tolerated. The mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest that an intramolecular concerted cyclization was involved in the reverse [2 + 2]-type elimination process.  aPublisher supplied data  a22071183cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a19DZ2271500cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipalitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003399  aNAcCentral Committee of the Communist Party of Chinadhttps://doi.org/NA 3abenzyl alcohol 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3across-coupling reactions 3acyclization reactions 3atransition elements1 aLi, Yuqiang1 aXu, Tao,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4228-48950 tOrganic letters.g2022 June 07, v. 24, no. 23 p.4218-4223dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.2c015373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009000160300002000250520117100270592002801441650003401469650002201503650001401525650001201539650001301551650002201564650002001586650002201606650001001628650001401638650002901652650001301681700002301694700003001717700001801747700002001765700002401785700003101809700002101840700002301861773012601884856007502010852000902085655001202094IND60795167620221120072406.0221001e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079516762DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra04353j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiriroj, Sumeth10aEnhancement of V₂O₅ Li-ion cathode stability by Ni/Co doped Li-borate-based glass  ap. 26111-26115.  aIn this research, we investigate the stability of a Li-ion cathode created by mixing a borate based glass which has been doped with Ni/Co and vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅). V₂O₅ has a high specific capacity in battery systems because of its layered structure and variety of oxidation states. However, due to the flimsy structure, the capacity stability of V₂O₅ is fairly low. In this case, we seek to overcome the problem by mixing Ni/Co-doped borate based glass. The voltage-capacity graph demonstrates that the form of the glass mix was changed from a stairway shape to a straight line while the capacity was not much decreased. The crystallography study using X-ray diffractograms looked at whether the cycling test had changed the crystal structure of V₂O₅. The X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) results also reveal that V₂O₅'s oxidation state changed from V⁵⁺ to V⁴⁺. The glass mix can retain more of the V⁵⁺ state, indicating that glass mixture helps to release the Li-ions trapped in the structure. The findings of this study might contribute to the rapid advancement of renewable energy and electric vehicle technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abatteries 3aborates 3acathodes 3acrystal structure 3acrystallography 3aelectric vehicles 3aglass 3aoxidation 3arenewable energy sources 3avanadium1 aPadchasri, Jintara1 aMontreeuppathum, Amorntep1 aLomon, Jidapa1 aChanlek, Narong1 aPoo-arporn, Yingyot1 aSongsiriritthigul, Prayoon1 aRujirawat, Saroj1 aKidkhunthod, Pinit0 tRSC advances.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 12, no. 40 p.26111-26115dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra04353j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01578naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245007500166300001600241520064300257592002800900653001300928653001400941653001400955653001100969653001000980653001600990700002001006700002001026773013001046856007901176852000901255655001201264IND60124607320221119061211.0150427e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012460732DNAL7 a10.1525/abt.2014.76.7.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeigel, Emily G.10aOh, Behave!

However, the utilization of enrichment in aquaculture is still infrequent, maybe because there is a paucity of knowledge about how its effects depend on factors such as fish species, developmental stage, social environment or the type and extent of enrichment. In this study, we evaluated the effects of physical enrichment on the welfare of rainbow trout juveniles, by exposing them to simple plastic screen shelters. Juveniles of approx. 15 g were introduced to two types of submerged shelters: full screens (Full) or partial screens (Semi), and fish welfare was assessed and compared to a control group (without shelters) by evaluating fish growth and condition, extent of external lesions, and the neuroendocrine responses to acute and repeated stress. During the eleven-week experimental period, the fish in the sheltered units gradually developed a clear shelter-seeking behavior when exposed to external disturbance. Fish growth, condition factor and mortality were not affected by shelter presence. The presence of full shelters had a modest protective effect on fin damage: both pectoral fin- and total fin damage scores were reduced (> 10%) in this group with respect to the control group; the percentage of fish with severe damage in the pectoral fin was reduced in the Full group with respect to the Control (63% vs 82%). Partial shelters had no significant effect on fin damage scores, when compared to the control group. The presence of shelters did not affect the general level of stress upon standardized acute or repeated stressors. However, fish used to the presence of shelters showed a more intense startling response when exposed to stressors that forced them to abandon the shelter protection. Altogether, this study shows potential for shelters to be used as a welfare-promoting strategy in trout farming, but further research is needed to optimize the shelter type and design and the proper timing for its application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aanimal growth 3aanimal welfare 3acaptive animals 3acondition factor 3aenvironmental enrichment 3afins 3agrowth performance 3amortality 3aprotective effect 3asocial environment 3atrout 0aWelfare 0aEnvironmental enrichment 0aStress 0aTrout 0aShelter1 aJokumsen, Alfred0 tAquaculture.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 551 p.737930-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7379303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245009300171300001600264520238000280592002802660650002202688650002802710650003002738650002002768650001302788650002002801650001802821650001202839650001502851650001602866650002002882650001502902650001302917650001602930650001802946651001402964651001302978700002102991700002303012700001903035773008703054856008803141852000903229655001203238IND60086247720221122232326.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008624772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2010.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWicke, Birka10aExploring land use changes and the role of palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia  ap. 193-206.  aThis study compiles and analyses national-level data on land use change (LUC) and its causes in Indonesia and Malaysia over the past 30 years. The study also explores the role that palm oil has played in past LUC and that projected growth in palm oil production may play in LUC until 2020 and suggests strategies to minimize negative effects. Data collection for the study revealed that the quality and quantity of data on LUC on a national scale over time are low. Despite these uncertainties, the overview of past LUC indicates that large changes in land use have occurred in Indonesia and Malaysia. In Indonesia, LUC can primarily be characterized by forest cover loss on 40 million ha (Mha) of land, a 30% reduction in forest land. Deforestation in Malaysia has been smaller in both absolute and relative terms, with a forest cover loss of nearly 5Mha (20% reduction in forest land). Other large changes in Malaysia occurred in permanent cropland (excluding oil palm), which has decreased rapidly since the early 1990s, and in land under oil palm cultivation, which experienced a sharp increase. Projections of additional land demand for palm oil production in 2020 range from 1 to 28Mha in Indonesia. The demand can be met to a large extent by degraded land if no further deforestation is assumed. In Malaysia, expansion projections range from 0.06 to 5Mha, but only the lowest projection of oil palm expansion is feasible when only degraded land may be used. The role of palm oil production in future LUC depends on the size of the projected expansion as well as agricultural management factors such as implementation of best management practices, earlier replanting with higher yielding plants, and establishment of new plantations on degraded land. The current use of degraded land needs to be investigated in order to reduce possible indirect LUC, land tenure conflicts, or other social impacts. In addition to minimizing direct and indirect LUC by the palm oil sector, measures that reduce deforestation triggered by other causes must also be implemented. A key element for doing so is better planning and governance of land use, which entails more appropriate demarcation of forest land and protection of land that still has forest cover, improved monitoring of land use, and more research to uncover the complexities and dynamics of the causes and drivers of LUC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aagricultural management 3abest management practices 3acrop production 3acropland 3adata collection 3adeforestation 3aforests 3agovernance 3aland tenure 3aland use change 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3aplantations 3asocial impact 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia1 aSikkema, Richard1 aDornburg, Veronika1 aFaaij, André,0 tLand use policy.g2011 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.193-206dElsevier Ltdx0264-83777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2010.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011600167300001600283520165900299592002801958650001301986650001101999650001902010650001602029650001902045650001302064650002502077650001502102650001302117650001802130650001402148650005202162650002202214650001002236700001702246700002302263700001302286700001702299700001702316700002402333700001702357773012802374856008202502852000902584655001202593IND60089548420221120033821.0141102e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008954842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Harmeet10aProprotein convertases in post-menopausal endometrial cancer: Distinctive regulation and non-invasive diagnosis  ap. 809-814.  aProprotein convertases (PCs) play critical roles in cleaving precursor proteins (growth factors, hormones, receptors and adhesion molecules) for activation. PCs are implicated in a number of cellular functions, including oncogenesis. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in the developed world, but the involvement of PCs is unclear. To characterize the role of PCs in endometrial cancer, we assessed expression of seven PCs (PC1/3, PC2, PACE4, PC4, furin, PC5/6 and PC7) by RT-PCR in six well characterized endometrial cancer cell lines. Expression was variable in all lines, with furin being most consistently expressed in all cell lines tested. We next determined the cellular localization and expression levels of four ubiquitously expressed PCs (furin, PACE4, PC5/6 and PC7) in post-menopausal endometrial biopsies from control (n=7) and endometrial cancer patients (n=30) by immunohistochemistry. Furin increased in tumors, whereas PC5/6, PACE4 and PC7 expression was reduced with increasing cancer grades. Uterine lavage is a non-invasive source material for evaluating the endometrium. We thus assessed whether total PC activity was altered in uterine lavage of endometrial cancer patients (n=36) compared to controls (n=10). PC activity was detected in all uterine lavage samples, and significantly elevated in all grades of endometrial cancer. This study demonstrates a complex association between individual PCs and endometrial cancer. Importantly, we show that monitoring the total PC activity in uterine lavage may provide a rapid and non-invasive method for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiopsy 3acarcinogenesis 3aendometrium 3agrowth factors 3ahormones 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amonitoring 3apatients 3apostmenopause 3areceptors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3auterine neoplasms 3awomen1 aHeng, Sophea1 aNicholls, Peter K.1 aLi, Ying1 aTai, Li Tsan1 aJobling, Tom1 aSalamonsen, Lois A.1 aNie, Guiying0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 419, no. 4 p.809-814dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245010600202300001800308506007600326520169500402592002802097506003702125650002802162650001502190650002502205650002002230650001102250650001202261650000902273650001202282650001202294650001102306650002202317650001702339650002102356650001402377700001502391700002102406700001902427700002102446700001902467700001802486700002202504773013102526856007502657852000902732655001202741IND60541635320221207085405.0160822e20150204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054163532DNAL7 a10.1021/ja511649n2doi7 aPMC43187262pmcid7 a255643062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakris, Thomas
M.13aAn Unusual Peroxo Intermediate of the Arylamine Oxygenase of the Chloramphenicol Biosynthetic Pathway  ap. 1608-1617.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStreptomyces venezuelae CmlI catalyzes the six-electron oxygenation of the arylamine precursor of chloramphenicol in a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-based pathway to yield the nitroaryl group of the antibiotic. Optical, EPR, and Mössbauer studies show that the enzyme contains a nonheme dinuclear iron cluster. Addition of O₂ to the diferrous state of the cluster results in an exceptionally long-lived intermediate (t₁/₂ = 3 h at 4 °C) that is assigned as a peroxodiferric species (CmlI-peroxo) based upon the observation of an ¹⁸O₂-sensitive resonance Raman (rR) vibration. CmlI-peroxo is spectroscopically distinct from the well characterized and commonly observed cis-μ-1,2-peroxo (μ-η¹:η¹) intermediates of nonheme diiron enzymes. Specifically, it exhibits a blue-shifted broad absorption band around 500 nm and a rR spectrum with a ν(O–O) that is at least 60 cm–¹ lower in energy. Mössbauer studies of the peroxo state reveal a diferric cluster having iron sites with small quadrupole splittings and distinct isomer shifts (0.54 and 0.62 mm/s). Taken together, the spectroscopic comparisons clearly indicate that CmlI-peroxo does not have a μ-η¹:η¹-peroxo ligand; we propose that a μ-η¹:η²-peroxo ligand accounts for its distinct spectroscopic properties. CmlI-peroxo reacts with a range of arylamine substrates by an apparent second-order process, indicating that CmlI-peroxo is the reactive species of the catalytic cycle. Efficient production of chloramphenicol from the free arylamine precursor suggests that CmlI catalyzes the ultimate step in the biosynthetic pathway and that the precursor is not bound to the NRPS during this step.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptomyces venezuelae 3aabsorption 3abiochemical pathways 3achloramphenicol 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3airon 3aisomers 3aligands 3aoxygen 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3asuperoxide anion 3avibration1 aVu, Van V.1 aMeier, Katlyn K.1 aKomor, Anna J.1 aRivard, Brent S.1 aMünck, Eckard1 aQue, Lawrence1 aLipscomb, John D.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Feb. 04, v. 137, no. 4 p.1608-1617dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja511649n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03900naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016600164300001600330500002000346520230000366592002802666596005902694650001702753650001702770650001902787650002102806650002602827650001502853650002302868650001202891650001202903650001102915650005002926650004302976650002503019650002603044650002403070650002503094650001503119651001003134700005503144700001503199773011303214856008203327852000903409655001203418IND60588945920221123031359.0220815e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058894592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-017-1543-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Nanshan10aSensitivity and resilience of ecosystems to climate variability in the semi‐arid to hyper‐arid areas of Northern China: a case study in the Heihe River Basin  ap. 161-174.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate variability and climate extremes are important climatic determinants of plant growth, species distribution and net primary productivity. A comprehensively quantitative analysis of the sensitivity and resilience of ecosystems to climate variability is vital to identify which regions and species are most in danger in response to future climate change. Here, we proposed an empirical approach to assess the relative sensitivity and resilience of ecosystems to short‐term climate variability in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) which is the second largest inland river basin in the northern China and contains ecosystems of semi‐arid, arid and hyper‐arid types. Based on the monthly time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperatures (LST) and the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration (AET/PET) derived from MODIS sensor from 2000 to 2013, we developed a multiple linear regressive and autoregressive model to determine the sensitivity of NDVI anomalies to climate variability indicated by monthly LST anomalies (temperature variability) and monthly AET/PET anomalies (water variability). We included 1 month time lag of NDVI anomalies in order to reflect ecosystem resilience. We found that the sensitivity and resilience to climate variability were different in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the HRB. Temperature variability dominantly controlled vegetation anomalies in the upper reach, but water variability was the dominant climatic factor in the middle and lower reaches. The different responses of semi‐arid to hyper‐arid ecosystems to climate variability depended much on the distinct climatic conditions and diverse vegetation types. Ecosystems in drier condition tended to show higher sensitivity to water variability, and ecosystems with colder climate were likely to be more sensitive to temperature variability. The most sensitive vegetation type to water variability and temperature variability in the HRB was crop and meadow, respectively. Grass had been proved to have the lowest resilience. Our research on the sensitivity and resilience of semi‐arid to hyper‐arid ecosystems is helpful for formulating and implementing adaptation and mitigation strategies in response to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a41371097cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abiogeography 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecological resilience 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3agrasses 3ameadows 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprimary productivity 3aquantitative analysis 3asurface temperature 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aMeng, Jijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7911-77001 aZhu, Likai0 tEcological research.g2018 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.161-174dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-017-1543-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01424naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245006700154300001800221520035300239592002800592650002300620650001700643650001300660650003700673700001400710700001700724700002600741700001300767700001900780700001200799700001600811700001700827773013400844856007500978852000901053655001201062IND60659100420221120051016.0190827e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065910042DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14721h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Ming10aSeeded growth of two-dimensional dendritic gold nanostructures  ap. 1440-1442.  aWe show that seeded growth can be applied to creating two-dimensional (2D) dendritic Au nanostructures on sample grids, which can be directly characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Dicarboximide fungicides (DCFs) have been intensively used to control this disease for decades in China, and offer excellent efficacy. The resistance of phytopathogenic pathogens against DCFs are reportedly selected in fields; however, the DCF resistance of A. alternata from D. officinale is not well understood. The isolates of A. alternata with low procymidone resistance (Proᴸᴿ) were detected in the commercial orchards of D. officinale in China in 2018 and biochemically characterized in this study. The result showed that the Proᴸᴿ isolates were selected in the commercial orchards with a resistance frequency of 100%, and no significant difference in mycelial growth, sporulation, and virulence was observed among the Proᴸᴿ and procymidone-sensitive (ProS) isolates. A positive cross-resistance pattern was exhibited between procymidone and iprodione. Results of amino acid sequence alignment of AaOS-1 from the tested isolates showed that all of the Proᴸᴿ genotypes could be categorized into two groups, including group I (mutations at AaOs-1) and group II (no mutation). Under procymidone (5.0 µg/ml) treatment conditions, the AaOs-1 expression levels increased in the ProS isolates and ranged from approximately 2.94- to 3.69-fold higher than those under procymidone-free conditions, while the AaOs-1 expressions of the Proᴸᴿ isolates were significantly lower than those in the ProS isolates under the same conditions. The data indicated that the mutations at AaOs-1 are involved in the DCF resistance of A. alternata selected in the D. officinale orchards.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0201000a2016YED0201007a2018YFD0201201cChinese Key R & D Plan  a30671384cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aPZCZ201715aCX[19]3003aCX(18)2005cAgricultural Science and Technology Projects of Jiangsu Province, China  aKYCX18_0670cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province  aCARS-21cChina Agricultural Research System 3aAlternaria alternata 3aDendrobium officinale 3aamino acid sequences 3across resistance 3aindustry 3aiprodione 3amedicinal plants 3amutation 3amycelium 3aprocymidone 3asequence alignment 3asporulation 3avirulence 3aChina 0adicarboximide-resistant isolates 0amutations at AaOS-11 aSun, Chunxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8513-47661 aWei, Lingling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2857-69441 aChen, Wenchan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7882-10851 aWang, Bingran1 aLi, Fengjie1 aWei, Mengdi1 aLou, Tiancheng1 aZhang, Pengcheng1 aZheng, Huanhuan1 aChen, Changjun1 aXiang, Zengxu0 tPlant disease.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 105, no. 8 p.2222-2230dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1246-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100001700191245013100208300001800339506002800357506003600385506007600421506003100497520167800528592002802206596004502234506003702279650001102316650002102327650001602348650001402364650001302378650003202391650001302423650004402436653003002480653001102510653002202521653002302543653001502566653002102581653000902602653000902611653000802620653000902628653001002637773010702647856008502754903002402839852000902863655001202872IND60557297220221207053820.0180831e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055729722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2016.10.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2016.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jae B.10aJavamide-I-O-methyl ester increases p53 acetylation and induces cell death via activating caspase 3/7 in monocytic THP-1 cells  ap. 1647-1652.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aJavamide-I and-II are phenolic amide compounds found in Coffea sp.

However, javamide-I and its O-methyl ester were found to inhibit Sirt1 better than Sirt2, which is different from javamide-II able to inhibit Sirt2 stronger than Sirt1. In silico analysis, javamide-I and its O-methyl ester showed a competitive binding pattern against NAD⁺, which was also supported by the kinetic analysis with Ki=20.1µM for javamide-I and 19.5µM for the O-methyl ester. However, the O-methyl ester increased p53 acetylation better than javamide-I in monocytic THP-1 cells. Since caspase 3/7 activation is often followed by the p53 activation, we investigated their effects on caspase 3/7, and found that O-methyl ester again activated caspase 3/7 greater than javamide-I in the cells, eventually leading to apoptotic cell death.These data suggest that the O-methyl modification in javamide-I may play a critical role in increasing p53 acetylation, activating caspase, and eventually inducing the THP-1 cell death.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCoffea 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylation 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akinetics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aJavamide-I-O-methyl ester 0aCoffee 0aMolecular docking 0aSirtuin inhibition 0aCaspase3/7 0aTHP-1 cell death 0aSirt 0aHPLC 0aNMR 0aNAD+ 0aANOVA0 tPhytomedicine.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 23, no. 13 p.1647-1652dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2016.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015500165300001600320500001500336520110700351592002801458650001801486650001601504650001101520650001401531650002701545650001301572650001301585650002101598650001201619650001401631653001801645700001601663700001901679700001301698700001701711700001301728700001301741700001501754700001601769773012801785856008201913852000901995655001202004IND60089548620221120033749.0141102e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008954862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Qingna10aIdentification of miR-508-3p and miR-509-3p that are associated with cell invasion and migration and involved in the apoptosis of renal cell carcinoma  ap. 621-626.  a2019-12-06  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as powerful regulators of multiple processes linked to human cancer, including cell apoptosis, proliferation and migration, suggesting that the regulation of miRNA function could play a critical role in cancer progression. Recent studies have found that human serum/plasma contains stably expressed miRNAs. If they prove indicative of disease states, miRNAs measured from peripheral blood samples may be a source for routine clinical detection of cancer. Our studies showed that both miR-508-3p and miR-509-3p were down-regulated in renal cancer tissues. The level of miR-508-3p but not miR-509-3p in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patient plasma demonstrated significant differences from that in control plasma. In addition, the overexpression of miR-508-3p and miR-509-3p suppressed the proliferation of RCC cells (786-0), induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell migration in vitro. Our data demonstrated that miR-508-3p and miR-509-3p played an important role as tumor suppressor genes during tumor formation and that they may serve as novel diagnostic markers for RCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell movement 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3acarcinoma 3atumor suppressor genes 3amicroRNA 3apatients 3akidney neoplasms 3atissues 3aapoptosis 0acell invasion1 aZhou, Liang1 aZhao, Chunjuan1 aWan, Jun1 aYu, Zhendong1 aGuo, Xin1 aQin, Jie1 aChen, Jing1 aLu, Ruijing0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 419, no. 4 p.621-626dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245012000203520108400323592002801407650002601435650001201461650002601473650001501499650001201514650002001526650001401546650002401560650001701584773011001601856008201711852000901793655001201802IND60787675420221118042540.0220809s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078767542DNAL7 a10.1017/S0022149X190002572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBollache, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0316-674610aRETRACTED – Interspecific interactions between Acanthocephalan species in the intestine of stone loach and minnow  aInterspecific interactions between parasites sharing the same host are often antagonistic; the presence of one species decreases the number of individuals or negatively affects both the distribution and reproduction of the other species. Antagonistic interactions between co-infecting parasites may translate into direct competition or interactive segregation, but elements of both may be present. Potential interactions between two acanthocephalan species, Pomphorhynchus laevis and Acanthocephalus anguillae, were studied in the field in two of their natural fish definitive hosts. There was no evidence for competitive exclusion between P. laevis and A. anguillae. However, a negative interaction was found for the first time in the field between these two species. Based on the analysis of parasite abundance and total biomass using a static regression approach, I found that the abundance and total biomass of parasites was also limited by host characteristics. These results are consistent with previous laboratory studies on competition between P. laevis and A. anguillae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPomphorhynchus laevis 3abiomass 3acompetitive exclusion 3aintestines 3aminnows 3amixed infection 3aparasites 3aregression analysis 3areproduction0 tJournal of helminthology.g2020, v. 94 p.e49-dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X190002573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245018700187520109800374592002801472650002601500650001401526650001901540650001201559650001001571650002401581650001801605650001401623650003001637650002601667650001101693650000901704653001401713653001201727653002301739653003101762653001901793653001401812653000801826653000801834653000801842653000801850653000801858653000901866653000801875653000901883653000801892653000801900653000901908653000801917653000801925653000701933653000701940653000801947653000701955700003401962700003901996700004402035700003202079700003602111773011102147856008602258852000902344655001202353IND60714116820221119213206.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071411682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Bruna Cristina dos Santos10aUse of the synbiotic VSL#3 and yacon-based concentrate attenuates intestinal damage and reduces the abundance of Candidatus Saccharimonas in a colitis-associated carcinogenesis model  aIndividuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at high risk of developing colitis-associated cancer; thus, strategies to inhibit disease progression should be investigated. The study aimed to explore the role of the synbiotic (probiotic VSL#3® and yacon-based concentrate) in a colitis-associated carcinogenesis model. IL-10⁻/⁻ mice were induced to carcinogenesis with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine and divided into two experimental groups: control and synbiotic. Manifestations of colitis, colon histology, expression of antioxidant enzymes, production of organic acids and intestinal microbiota were evaluated. The use of the synbiotic showed benefits, such as the preservation of intestinal architecture, increased expression of antioxidant enzymes and the concentration of organic acids, especially butyrate. It was also observed different microbial community profiles between the groups during the study. Together, these factors contributed to mitigate the manifestations of colitis and improve intestinal integrity, suggesting the potential benefit of the synbiotic in intestinal diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,2-dimethylhydrazine 3abutyrates 3acarcinogenesis 3acolitis 3acolon 3adisease progression 3afood research 3ahistology 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicrobial communities 3amodels 3arisk 0aSynbiotic 0aColitis 0aColorectal câncer 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aGut microbiota 0aDysbiosis 0aIBD 0aCRC 0aCAC 0aPBY 0aDSS 0aTNBS 0aFOS 0aHPLC 0aDMH 0aCFE 0aSCFA 0aDAI 0aTNF 0aUC 0aCD 0aMDA 0aCP1 aConceição, Lisiane Lopes da1 aMendes, Tiago Antônio de Oliveira1 aFerreira, Célia Lúcia de Luces Fortes1 aGonçalves, Reggiani Vilela1 aPeluzio, Maria do Carmo Gouveia0 tFood research international.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.109721-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012600175300001600301520104000317536014501357592002801502650001501530650002001545650001401565650002201579650001301601650001501614650001401629653001401643653002301657653002301680653002501703653002401728700002501752700002501777700002801802700002801830773014401858856008602002852000902088655001202097IND60773344420221122060531.0220413e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077334442DNAL7 a10.1080/09637486.2021.19844002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCourt, Aislinn F.10aPostprandial 25-hydroxyvitamin D response varies according to the lipid composition of a vitamin D3 fortified dairy drink  ap. 396-406.  aIn-vitro evidence suggests that the lipid component of foods alters vitamin D absorption. This single-blinded, cross-over postprandial study examined the effect of changing the lipid component of a 20 µg vitamin D₃ fortified dairy drink on postprandial 25(OH)D concentrations. Participants consumed one dairy drink per visit: a non-lipid, a pre-formed oleic acid micelle, an olive oil and a fish oil dairy drink. There was a significant time*drink*baseline status effect on 25(OH)D concentrations (p = 0.039). There were no time*drink, time or drink effects on 25(OH)D in vitamin D sufficient participants (>50nmol/L). However, there was an effect of time on changes in 25(OH)D concentrations after the olive oil dairy drink (p = 0.034) in vitamin D insufficient participants (<50nmol/L). There were no effects after the other diary drinks. Olive oil may improve vitamin D absorption from fortified foods. Further research is needed to examine the practical implications of changing the lipid component of fortified foods.  aThis work was funded by the Irish Government, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) National Call 2015 (DAFM Ref: 15 F 737).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acholecalciferol 3afish oils 3alipid composition 3amicelles 3aoleic acid 3aolive oil 0aVitamin D 0afood fortification 0aoleic acid micelle 0avitamin D absorption 0a25-hydroxyvitamin D1 aMulrooney, Steven L.1 aO’Neill, Graham J.1 aO’Riordan, E.

In the comparison with acidosis, the cellular mechanisms underlying alkalosis-induced brain dysfunction remain unclear. By using electrophysiological approach, we investigated the influences of high extracellular pH environment on cortical GABAergic neurons in terms of their responsiveness to synaptic inputs and their ability to produce action potentials. Artificial cerebral spinal fluid in high pH impairs excitatory synaptic transmission and spike initiation in cortical GABAergic neurons. The alkalosis-induced dysfunction of GABAergic neurons is associated with the decrease of receptor responsiveness and the increases of spike refractory periods and threshold potentials. Our studies reveal that alkalosis impairs cortical GABAergic neurons and subsequently deteriorate brain functions. The molecular targets for alkalosis action include glutamate receptor-channels and voltage-gated sodium channels on GABAergic neurons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidosis 3aaction potentials 3aalkalosis 3abrain 3acognition 3aglutamic acid 3aneurons 3apH 3asodium channels 3asynaptic transmission1 aZhang, Keling1 aLi, Jinlong1 aLiu, Danian1 aLu, Yunting1 aZhang, Zhongling0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 419, no. 4 p.627-631dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004100151245011800192520170900310592002802019650001802047650002802065650001802093650002502111650001602136650001602152650002302168650001802191650001802209650001802227650001102245650002102256650002502277650001802302650001502320650003202335650001802367650003202385650002002417653002902437653001502466653001202481653002302493653001802516700003002534700004202564700003002606700003602636700004002672700003202712700006102744773011102805856008602916852000903002655001203011IND60714116920221119213233.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071411692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Medeiros, Viviane Priscila Barros10aExploiting the use of agro-industrial residues from fruit and vegetables as alternative microalgae culture medium  aThere is a need for searching new microalgae species, and the most suitable strategy to increase the cost-effectiveness of a microalgae culture system is to use resources of low costs, such as residues. This study aimed to evaluate the cultivation of microalgae isolated from the Brazilian Northeast region (Lagerheimia longiseta, Monoraphidium contortum, and Scenedesmus quadricauda) in an alternative medium of low cost (biocompost of discarded fruits and vegetables) with a view to possible applications in the food industry. Microalgae cultivated in the conventional synthetic medium was used as control. The cultivation of microalgae in the alternative medium allowed suitable cell growth, and improved the antioxidant activity and the levels of monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid compared to the synthetic medium. The cultivation of S. quadricauda and L. longiseta species in the alternative medium resulted in increased protein content and/or total phenolic content, and improved health indices (lower levels of atherogenic, thrombogenic, and hypercholesterolemic saturated fatty acids indices, and higher levels of desired fatty acids index) compared to cultivation in synthetic medium. The cultivation of M. contortum in the alternative medium contributed to the production of higher lipid content, mainly saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid), which contributed negatively to the health indices. This study proved that S. quadricauda and L. longiseta microalga species from freshwaters have significant potential for distinct applications in functional food industries, and the biocompost of discarded fruits and vegetables is a suitable medium for microalgae cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonoraphidium 3aScenedesmus quadricauda 3aalgae culture 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocomposts 3acell growth 3acost effectiveness 3aculture media 3afood industry 3afood research 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3apalmitic acid 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprotein content 0aPhotosynthetic organisms 0aBiocompost 0aBiomass 0aFatty acid profile 0aFood industry1 aPimentel, Tatiana Colombo1 aVarandas, Roberta Conceição Ribeiro1 ados Santos, Silvana Alves1 ade Souza Pedrosa, Geany Targino1 ada Costa Sassi, Cristiane Francisca1 ada Conceição, Marta Maria1 aMagnani, Marciane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7771-04790 tFood research international.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.109722-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003300132024001100165040001800176100001400194245009300208300001800301500000900319506017300328520139100501592002801892650001501920650002101935650002601956650001701982650001201999650001502011650001302026650002502039650001502064650001802079650001702097650002502114651001002139700001102149700001302160700001102173700001802184773013502202856011202337856008002449956014802529961000902677852000902686655001202695IND50089333120221214225257.0191122e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008933312DNAL7 a2983962aris7 a10113/587422hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2012.04692doi8 ans4417  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, W.10aYield and Water Use of Siberian Wildrye with Ridge and Furrow Planting in Northern China  ap. 1787-1796.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSiberian wildrye (Elymus sibiricus L.) is a perennial grass that is widely planted in semiarid northern China, but yield is often low due to insufficient soil water supply. Field experiments were conducted from 2009 to 2011 to study the effects of ridge and furrow planting (RFP) on yield, evapotranspiration, and water use efficiency (WUE) of Siberian wildrye grassland under rainfed conditions. The treatments included bare flat bed planting (FB), bare ridge with bare furrow (BRB), bare ridge with naked oat (Avena nuda L.) straw mulch in furrow (BRM), plastic mulch on ridge with bare furrow (MRB), and plastic mulch on ridge with straw mulch in furrow (MRM). In the RFP system, the ridge and furrow were each 30 cm wide. Total forage yield with MRB and MRM each year was 46 to 111% and 50 to 135% greater, respectively, than with FB (2580 kg ha–¹ yr–¹). These two treatments also increased total WUE each year by 79 to 121% and 80 to 150%, respectively, compared with FB (10.8 kg ha–¹ mm–¹ yr–¹). The BRB and BRM treatments increased total forage yield by 47 and 81% and total WUE by 51 and 81%, respectively, compared with FB only in 2010. The addition of straw mulch did not result in a further increase in total yield or WUE. Therefore, the MRB planting system will be recommended in Siberian wildrye production for achieving relatively high forage yield and WUE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena nuda 3aElymus sibiricus 3afield experimentation 3aforage yield 3afurrows 3agrasslands 3aplanting 3aplastic film mulches 3asoil water 3astraw mulches 3awater supply 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aLi, Z.1 aGong, Y.1 aLu, X.1 aNielsen, D.C.0 tAgronomy journal.g2013 Nov., v. 105, no. 6 p.1787-1796dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/587423Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2012.04693Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Yield%20and%20water%20use%20of%20siberian%20wildrye%20with%20ridge_0.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01362naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245008800176300001800264520028600282592002800568650001600596650001100612650001200623650001200635650001000647700002300657700005800680700002200738700006300760773012100823856008300944852000901027655001201036IND60743277820221117231201.0210707e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074327782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c016642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuran-Camacho, Geraldo10aIsolable Pyridinium Trifluoromethoxide Salt for Nucleophilic Trifluoromethoxylation  ap. 5138-5142.  aAn isolable pyridinium trifluoromethoxide salt is prepared from the reaction of 4-dimethylaminopyridine with the commercially available liquid 2,4-dinitro(trifluoromethoxy)benzene.

METHODS: In a randomized double blind controlled trial, the FO group (FG) patients were supplemented with 2 g/ day of FO concentrate containing 1.8 g of n-3 fatty acids during 30 days. The placebo group (PG) received 2 g/ day of mineral oil. At baseline and after the intervention, plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids, dietary intake, weight, body composition, biochemical and immunological markers were assessed. RESULTS: At the end of the intervention period, no between group differences were observed regarding anthropometric parameters. There was a significant increase in the plasma phospholipid EPA (p = 0.004), DHA (p = 0.007) of the FG patients. In FG patients the percentages of peripheral blood CD4⁺ T lymphocytes and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were maintained while in PG patients there was a significant increase in hsCRP (p = 0.024). We also observed a significant reduction in the percentage of CD4⁺ T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (p = 0.042) of PG patients. No changes in serum proinflammatory cytokine and prostaglandin E₂ levels were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with EPA and DHA led to a significant change in the composition of plasma fatty acids, maintained the level of CD4⁺ T cells and serum levels of hsCRP, suggestive of a beneficial effect on the immune system and less active inflammatory response.

Osbeck) and ‘Shatian pummelo’ (Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck) seedlings were fertilized for 18 weeks with nutrient solution containing either 0 mM (control) or 1 mM (Al toxicity) AlCl₃·6H₂O. Aluminum induced decreases of biomass, leaf photosynthesis, relative water content and total soluble protein levels, and increases of methylglyoxal levels only occurred in C. grandis roots and leaves. Besides, the Al-induced decreases of pigments and alterations of chlorophyll a fluorescence transients and fluorescence parameters were greater in C. grandis leaves than those in C. sinensis leaves. Aluminum-treated C. grandis had higher stem and leaf Al levels and similar root Al levels relative to Al-treated C. sinensis, but lower Al distribution in roots and Al uptake per plant. Aluminum toxicity decreased nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur uptake per plant in C. grandis and C. sinensis seedlings, with the exception of Al-treated C. sinensis seedlings exhibiting increased sulfur uptake per plant and unaltered magnesium uptake per plant. Under Al-stress, macroelement uptake per plant was higher in C. sinensis than that in C. grandis. Aluminum toxicity decreased the ratios of reduced glutathione/(reduced + oxidized glutathione) and of ascorbate/(ascorbate + dehydroascorbate) only in C. grandis roots and leaves. The activities of most antioxidant enzymes, sulfur metabolism-related enzymes and glyoxalases and the levels of S-containing compounds were higher in Al-treated C. sinensis roots and leaves than those in Al-treated C. grandis ones. Thus, C. sinensis displayed higher Al tolerance than C. grandis did. The higher Al tolerance of C. sinensis might involve: (i) more Al accumulation in roots and less transport of Al from roots to shoots; (ii) efficient maintenance of nutrient homeostasis; and (iii) efficient maintenance of redox homeostasis via detoxification systems of reactive oxygen species and methylglyoxal.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772257a31301740cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aYB2017003cScientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University  a2015J05054cNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003392  aCARS27cEarmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research Systemdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010038 3aCitrus maxima 3aCitrus sinensis 3aaluminum 3aaluminum chloride 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomass 3acalcium 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3ametabolic detoxification 3anitrogen 3anutrient solutions 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3areactive oxygen species 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3awater content 0aCitrus grandis 0aglyoxalase1 aQi, Yi-Ping1 aCai, Yan-Tong1 aYang, Tao-Yu1 aYang, Lin-Tong1 aHuang, Zeng-Rong1 aChen, Li-Song1 aRennenberg, H.q(Heinz),0 tTree physiology.g2018 Apr. 27, v. 38, no. 10 p.1548-1565dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010600169300001600275500001500291520117000306592002801476650002601504650003101530650002301561650001801584650000901602650001201611650002101623653001301644653001301657653001301670653001001683653001801693653001501711700002101726700002001747773012101767856008201888852000901970655001201979IND60089731720221119141926.0160728e20130419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008973172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Mitsutaka10aRequirement of decreased O-GlcNAc glycosylation of Mef2D for its recruitment to the myogenin promoter  ap. 558-562.  a2019-12-06  aPreviously, we demonstrated that the expression of myogenin, a critical transcription factor for myogenesis, is negatively regulated by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) glycosylation in mouse C2C12 cells. In this study, we found that Mef2 family proteins, especially Mef2D which is a crucial transcriptional activator of myogenin, are O-GlcNAc glycosylated. Between the two splice variants of Mef2D, Mef2D1a rather than Mef2D1b appears to drive the initiation of myogenin expression in the early stage of myogenesis. A deletion mutant analysis showed that Mef2D1a is glycosylated both in its DNA-binding and transactivation domains. A significant decrease in the glycosylation of Mef2D was observed in response to myogenic stimulus in C2C12 cells. Inhibition of the myogenesis-dependent decrease in the glycosylation of Mef2D suppressed its recruitment to the myogenin promoter. These results indicate that the expression of myogenin is regulated, at least in part, by the decreased glycosylation-dependent recruitment of Mef2D to the promoter region, and this is one of the negative regulatory mechanisms of skeletal myogenesis by O-GlcNAc glycosylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3amuscle development 3aglycosylation 3amice 3amutants 3apromoter regions 0aproteins 0aMyogenin 0aO-GlcNAc 0aMef2D 0aGlycosylation 0aMyogenesis1 aSakakibara, Yuki1 aKamemura, Kazuo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Apr. 19, v. 433 p.558-562dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011000174300001800284520078600302592002801088650001601116650002301132650001901155650001901174650002001193700005901213773012101272856008301393852000901476655001201485IND60743277920221117231331.0210707e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074327792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c016732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutskalova, Valeriia10aAd Hoc Adjustment of Photoredox Properties by the Late-Stage Diversification of Acridinium Photocatalysts  ap. 5143-5147.  aThe steadily growing interest in substituting precious-metal photoredox catalysts with organic surrogates is vibrantly sustained by emerging methodologies to vary their photochemical behavior. Herein, we report an ad hoc approach for the preparation of acridinium salts with a particularly broad range of photoredox properties. The method involves an aryne–imine–aryne coupling to a linchpin tetrafluoro acridinium salt for a late-stage diversification by nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions to form diaminoacridinium and undescribed aza-rhodol photocatalysts. The different functionalities and redox properties of the organic acridinium photocatalysts render them suitable for bifunctional photoredox catalysis and organocatalytic photochemical C–N cross-couplings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3acatalytic activity 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotochemistry 3aredox reactions1 aSparr, Christof1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4213-09410 tOrganic letters.g2021 June 10, v. 23, no. 13 p.5143-5147dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c016733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009600168300001600264520151000280592002801790650000801818650002301826650001901849650001901868650002601887650002501913650001701938650001101955650002501966650001201991650001402003650002602017650002202043650002102065650001202086650001802098650001402116650002502130653003502155653002602190653002002216653002502236653002202261653002502283700001802308700006502326700002202391773011602413856008502529852000902614655001202623IND60625546220221119023018.0210105e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062554622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVivas, María10aMaternal environment regulates morphological and physiological traits in Eucalyptus grandis  ap. 631-636.  aThe phenotype of a plant can be shaped by the biotic and abiotic conditions to which their parents are subjected. This phenotypic plasticity known as maternal environmental effect occurs regardless of the changes in the DNA sequences. Whereas the effect of the maternal environment on plant phenotype has been studied, its specific influence on plant physiology is less clear. This study considered the influence of the maternal environment on the regulation of plant morphology and physiology in progeny of Eucalyptus grandis. Plants were grown from seeds collected from two E. grandis clonal seed orchards that differed in environmental conditions (e.g. precipitation). Plant relative growth rate (RGR), leaf gas exchange and water use efficiency (WUE) were measured in the seedlings. RGR was 10% higher in the offspring from the maternal environment receiving higher precipitation levels. Leaf gas exchange, specifically leaves intercellular CO₂, and intrinsic WUE were also influenced by maternal environments. Intrinsic WUE was significantly lower in the orchard that received lower precipitation levels. The results demonstrate that the maternal environment can regulate the physiology of E. grandis in the subsequent generation. These analyses are useful to optimise tree improvement in a changing environment. Moreover, in a scenario of climate change, maternal environmental effects may be a crucial mechanism for certain species to get acclimated to sudden changes in environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEucalyptus grandis 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplant improvement 3aplant morphology 3aprogeny 3aseed orchards 3aseedlings 3awater use efficiency 0aMaternal environmental effects 0aPhenotypic plasticity 0aTree physiology 0aRelative growth rate 0aLeaf gas exchange 0aWater use efficiency1 aRolo, Víctor1 aWingfield, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2712-417X1 aSlippers, Bernard0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 432 p.631-636dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245013600169300001800305520176000323592002802083650001602111650001102127650001102138650001202149650001202161650001402173650002602187650001902213650001302232650001502245650001102260650002002271650001102291650001402302650001602316650001102332651002502343653003002368653001302398653001402411653001802425653001602443700002602459700001902485700005902504700001802563700002002581773012102601856007902722852000902801655001202810IND60674345820221118114624.0191025e20180424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067434582DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastagneri, Daniele10aTree-ring anatomy and carbon isotope ratio show both direct and legacy effects of climate on bimodal xylem formation in Pinus pinea  ap. 1098-1109.  aUnderstanding how climate affects xylem formation is critical for predicting the impact of future conditions on tree growth and functioning in the Mediterranean region, which is expected to face warmer and drier conditions. However, mechanisms of growth response to climate at different temporal scales are still largely unknown, being complicated by separation between spring and autumn xylogenesis (bimodal temporal pattern) in most species such as Mediterranean pines. We investigated wood anatomical characteristics and carbon stable isotope composition in Mediterranean Pinus pinea L. along tree-ring series at intra-ring resolution to assess xylem formation processes and responses to intra-annual climate variability. Xylem anatomy was strongly related to environmental conditions occurring a few months before and during the growing season, but was not affected by summer drought. In particular, the lumen diameter of the first earlywood tracheids was related to winter precipitation, whereas the size of tracheids produced later was influenced by mid-spring precipitation. Diameter of latewood tracheids was associated with precipitation in mid-autumn. In contrast, tree-ring carbon isotope composition was mostly related to climate of the previous seasons. Earlywood was likely formed using both recently and formerly assimilated carbon, while latewood relied mostly on carbon accumulated many months prior to its formation. Our integrated approach provided new evidence on the short-term and carry-over effects of climate on the bimodal temporal xylem formation in P. pinea. Investigations on different variables and time scales are necessary to disentangle the complex climate influence on tree growth processes under Mediterranean conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinea 3aautumn 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adrought 3aearlywood 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowing season 3alatewood 3aprediction 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3atracheids 3atree growth 3awinter 3aMediterranean region 0aquantitative wood anatomy 0atracheid 0atree ring 0aumbrella pine 0axylogenesis1 aBattipaglia, Giovanna1 avon Arx, Georg1 aPacheco, Arturo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7049-73641 aCarrer, Marco1 aCernusak, Lucas0 tTree physiology.g2018 Apr. 24, v. 38, no. 8 p.1098-1109dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011500173300001600288520172400304592002802028650001702056650001502073650001202088650001902100651001102119653001202130653001102142653001502153653002502168653002602193700002302219700002402242773009202266856008402358852000902442655001202451IND60566824620221117172933.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056682462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjukic, Aleksandra10aAchieving the Basic Sustainable Qualities in New Housing in Post-socialist Serbia: Regulation vs. Case-studies  ap. 696-703.  aIn a period of post-socialist transformation, unexpected and sudden socio-economic changes in society have deeply reflected into urbanspace. Their influence has been specially observed in the most common spatial elements, such as housing. Thus, the housing has proved to be an evident example of both positive and negative characteristics of post-socialist transformation in urbanism and architecture.The regulation of housing in Serbia has been postponed compared with other post-socialist countries. A few different guidelines for housing design existed in socialist Serbia, but they were overcome in transition period, in early 1990s.Furthermore, the official evaluation of current housing is still an underdeveloped field, regarding to various factors. The differences and deficiencies between housing regulation and related statistic data are among the most noticeable. The implication of such state can be overviewed through housing construction in situ; the quality of new housing projects varies greatly, even by basic characteristics, such as housing area, number of rooms or accessibility to natural lighting.The methodology is critical analysis of existing regulations of housing in Serbia, through the official Act of conditions and normative for the designing of housing buildings and flats, adopted in 2012.The differences and deficiencies between regulation and statistics were the starting-point to define criteria. The relevant case studies were checked through them. The expected contribution of the paper is providing the set of recommendations and guidelines for the improvement of evaluation process of the basic elements of new housing in Serbia as well as other countries with similar background.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aguidelines 3asociety 3asocioeconomics 3aSerbia 0ahousing 0aSerbia 0aregulation 0astatistic evaluation 0asustainable qualities1 aLojanica, Vladimir1 aAntonić, Branislav0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2017, v. 38 p.696-703dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01608naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011300169300001800282520062300300592002800923650002500951650001900976650002100995650001401016650001901030700005601049773012101105856008301226852000901309655001201318IND60743278020221117231237.0210707e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074327802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c016762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Ho Seong10aComplementary Reactivity in Selective Radical Processes: Electrochemistry of Oxadiazolines to Quinazolinones  ap. 5148-5152.  aElectrochemistry has recently emerged as a sustainable approach for efficiently generating radical intermediates utilizing eco-friendly electric energy.

Two types of particle-toughened Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites were loaded to allow crack growth in Modes I and II to be isolated and observed in standard and non-standard specimen geometries. Both materials failed in complex and distinct failure modes, showing that interlaminar fracture in these materials involves a process zone rather than a singular crack tip. The work indicates that incorporating particle/resin, fibre/interlayer and neat resin failure is essential within models for material response, since the competition between these mechanisms to provide the energetically favourable crack path influences the macro-scale toughness. The work uniquely combines the strengths of SRCT and SRCL to compare failure micro-mechanisms between two specimen geometries, whilst assessing any edge effects and providing powerful insight into the complex micro-mechanical behaviour of these materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acomposite materials 3amodels 3aplastics 3atomography 0aA.

These potentials reflect the residual function of the cochlea. In cochlear implant candidates with residual hearing, the implant electrode can directly measure ECochG responses during the implantation process. Various authors have described the ability to monitor the inner ear function by continuous ECochG measurements during the surgery. The measurement of ECochG signals during surgery is not trivial. There are no interpretable signals in up to 20% of cases. For a successful recording, a standardized procedure is recommended to achieve the highest measurement reliability and avoid possible pitfalls. Therefore, seamless collaboration between the CI surgeon and CI technician is key. This video consists of an overview of the system setup and a stepwise procedure of performing intracochlear ECochG measurements during CI surgery. It shows the surgeon's and the CI technician's roles in the process, and how a smooth collaboration between the two is made possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aelectrodes 3ainner ear 3asurgery1 aWaser, Manuel1 aMantokoudis, Georgios1 aAnschuetz, Lukas1 aWimmer, Wilhelm1 aCaversaccio, Marco1 aWeder, Stefan0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 Mar. 08, , no. 181 p.e63153-e63153dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/631533Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63153/performing-intracochlear-electrocochleography-during-cochlear  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245011200211300001200323506007600335520177700411592002802188506003702216650001202253650000802265650002702273650002402300650001102324650003502335650004402370650002302414650002602437650001902463650003002482650002202512650002102534700002102555700002102576700002202597773009402619856008102713852000902794655001202803IND60584445420221207140526.0171119e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058444542DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-017-1009-x2doi7 aPMC56536702pmcid7 a290711722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoopnarain, Ashira10aBiases during DNA extraction affect bacterial and archaeal community profile of anaerobic digestion samples  ap. 375.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic waste for biogas production has received much attention in recent years due to the increasing need for renewable energy and environmentally friendly waste management systems. Identification of the microbial community involved in AD aids in better understanding and optimising of the process. The choice of DNA extraction method is an integral step in any molecular biodiversity study. In the present study, potential biases introduced by DNA extraction methods were examined by comparing quality, quantity and representability of DNA extracted from AD samples using various extraction methods. In spite of the non-kit based method (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) yielding the largest quantity of DNA (approximately 44 µg DNA per gram dry weight), the extracted DNA contained PCR inhibitors. Furthermore, the quantity of extracted DNA was not proportional to species diversity. Diversity, determined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), was strongly linked to the type of extraction method used. The spin-column filter-based kit that incorporated mechanical and chemical lysis (Macherey-Nagel kit) gave the best results in terms of bacterial and archaeal diversity (Shannon–Wiener indices: average 2.5 and 2.6, respectively). Furthermore, this kit was the most effective at lysing hard-to-lyse bacterial and archaeal cells. The choice of DNA extraction method significantly influences the reliability and comparability of results obtained during AD microbial ecology investigations. Moreover, the careful selection of the DNA extraction method is of particular importance when analysing AD samples since these samples are rich in PCR inhibitors and hard-to-lyse cells such as archaea and gram-positive bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aDNA 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3amanagement systems 3amicrobial communities 3aorganic wastes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aspecies diversity 3awaste management1 aMukhuba, Mashudu1 aAdeleke, Rasheed1 aMoeletsi, Mokhele0 t3 Biotech.g2017 Dec., v. 7, no. 6 p.375-375dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-1009-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007500168300001600243520057300259592002800832650001100860650002400871651001100895653003600906653003000942653001500972653002300987653002101010653003301031700002301064700002001087700001801107773009201125856008401217852000901301655001201310IND60566824820221117172928.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056682482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDroutsa, K.G.10aBenchmarking Energy Use of Existing Hellenic Non-residential Buildings  ap. 713-720.  aThe total number of buildings in Greece amount to 4.1 million of which 20% are exclusivenon-residentialbuildings that usually have high energy consumption due to specific building uses.

Common sleep disorders include insomnia disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias, and other sleep disorders. The ketogenic diet (KD) is rich in fat, low in carbohydrates (CHO), and adequate in protein. The KD has shown several applications in treating medical conditions, such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disorders, obesity with its comorbidities, and sleep disorders, with encouraging results. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to address the primary sleep disorders and their respective standard therapeutic approaches, analyse the effect of ketone bodies (KBs) on sleep homeostasis, and the effects of KD on sleep disorders and in particular on obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) syndrome. The goal is to summarise the evidence existing up to now on the subject, to provide a starting point for further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircadian rhythm 3aepilepsy 3ahomeostasis 3aketogenic diet 3aobesity 3asleep 3asomnolence 3atherapeutics 0asleep disorders 0aketone bodies 0aobstructive sleep apnoea 0anutritionist1 aPugliese, Gabriella1 aFrias-Toral, Evelyn1 aNapolitano, Bruno1 aLaudisio, Daniela1 aAprano, Sara1 aCeriani, Florencia1 aSavastano, Silvia1 aColao, Annamaria1 aMuscogiuri, Giovanna0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2022 Apr. 3, v. 73, no. 3 p.285-295dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09637486.2021.19931543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010700154300002000261500001900281520046200300592002800762650001400790650002200804650002300826650001200849650001200861650001100873650001100884700001700895700001900912700001500931700001700946700001900963773013600982856007401118852000901192655001201201IND60708588420221123014859.0200828e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070858842DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc04590j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wei10aNickel(ii)-catalyzed asymmetric thio-Claisen rearrangement of α-diazo pyrazoleamides with thioindoles  ap. 10002-10005.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA nickel(ii) catalyzed enantioselective thio-Claisen rearrangement of α-diazo pyrazoleamides with thioindoles was realized with modified chiral N,N′-dioxide ligands, affording a variety of C3-substituted indole derivatives in high yields (up to 95%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee) under mild reaction conditions.

The emission coefficient to treated wastewater was 291gCO2m−3. The main source of GHGs was CO2 from the consumption of electricity, nitrous oxide from the sludge incineration process, and methane from the water treatment process. They accounted for 43.4%, 41.7% and 8.3% of the total amount of GHGs emissions, respectively. The amount of methane was plotted as a function of water temperature ranging between 13.3 and 27.3°C. An aeration tank was the main source of methane emission from all the units. Almost all the methane was emitted from the aeration tank, which accounted for 86.4% of the total gaseous methane emission. However, 18.4% of the methane was produced in sewage lines, 15.4% in the primary sedimentation tank, and 60.0% in the aeration tank.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3aseasonal variation 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3awastewater 3awater temperature 3awater treatment 0aSewage treatment plant 0aGreenhouse gas 0aMethane 0aNitrous oxide 0aLCA1 aSuzuki, Shunsuke1 aSano, Itsumi1 aLi, Yu-You1 aNishimura, Osamu0 tChemosphere.g2015 Dec., v. 140 p.167-173dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007900165300001200244520099400256592002801250650002501278650003001303650001101333650001601344650001201360650001101372650001301383650000901396650001201405650001501417650001401432650001701446650000901463700001201472700001701484700001601501700001801517773009401535856008501629852000901714655001201723IND60080875620221119124618.0140812e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmair, S.10aSarcosine metabolism in Haemonchus contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta  ap. 1-6.  aSarcosine (N-methylglycine) is an intermediate in glycine degradation and can also be synthesised from glycine in mammals. Sarcosine metabolism in Haemonchus contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta differed from that of mammals in that creatinase activity was present and sarcosine was demethylated only by sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and not by sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH). The mean SOX activity was 30nmolmin⁻¹mg⁻¹ protein in homogenates of L3 and adult worms of both parasites and the apparent Kₘ for sarcosine was 1.1mM. Addition of 2mM Cd²⁺ inhibited activity by 30%. There was no SDH activity with either NAD⁺ or NADP⁺ as co-factor. Mean creatinase activity in L3 T. circumcincta and adult worms of both species was 31±6nmolmin⁻¹mg⁻¹ protein, but was undetectable in L3 H. contortus. Activity was inhibited by up to 70% by Cu²⁺, Fe²⁺, Fe³⁺ and Zn²⁺.

They were spheres with a common diameter under given conditions, which ranged from 0.5μm to 1.0μm depending on the pH, ionic concentration and temperature. They were swollen at low salt concentrations, low temperatures and high pH of aqueous suspensions. One particle contained 6.0×10⁸ carboxyl groups, the concentration of which was ca. 1M, exhibiting pKₐ=5.2. The particles were adsorbed spontaneously on the platinum surface in a one-particle layer with regular arrangement. The particle-adsorbed electrode showed the voltammetric peak for the reduction of hydrogen ions which were dissociated from the carboxylic groups of the adsorbed layer. The amount of the dissociated hydrogen ions per particle was 19% of the loaded amount of carboxyl groups, whereas the non-gelized particles had 3% of the loaded amount. The film worked as a source of supply of hydrogen ions for the electrochemical reduction of 1,4-naphthoquinone. It provided acidic environment of pH 4.5 for the reduction in the neutral solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen ions 3alatex 3apH 3aplatinum 3asalt concentration 3atemperature1 aAoki, Koichi1 aChen, Jingyuan1 aNishiumi, Toyohiko0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2011 June 15, v. 656, no. 1-2 p.279-284dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2010.10.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245005100165300001600216520156100232592002801793650001901821650002501840650001101865650003101876650001901907650002901926650001901955651001001974651001201984700001701996700002502013700001902038773008602057856008602143852000902229655001202238IND60084835420221119140811.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008483542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wen10aPotential of renewable energy systems in China  ap. 518-525.  aAlong with high-speed economic development and increasing energy consumption, the Chinese Government faces a growing pressure to maintain the balance between energy supply and demand. In 2009, China has become both the largest energy consumer and CO₂ emitting country in the world. In this case, the inappropriate energy consumption structure should be changed. As an alternative, a suitable infrastructure for the implementation of renewable energy may serve as a long-term sustainable solution. The perspective of a 100% renewable energy system has been analyzed and discussed in some countries previously. In this process, assessment of domestic renewable energy sources is the first step. Then appropriate methodologies are needed to perform energy system analyses involving the integration of more sustainable strategies. Denmark may serve as an example of how sustainable strategies can be implemented. The Danish system has demonstrated the possibility of converting into a 100% renewable energy system. This paper discusses the perspective of renewable energy in China firstly, and then analyses whether it is suitable to adopt similar methodologies applied in other countries as China approaches a renewable energy system. The conclusion is that China’s domestic renewable energy sources are abundant and show the possibility to cover future energy demand; the methodologies used to analyse a 100% renewable energy system are applicable in China. Therefore, proposing an analysis of a 100% renewable energy system in China is not unreasonable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3ainfrastructure 3arenewable energy sources 3asupply balance 3aChina 3aDenmark1 aLund, Henrik1 aMathiesen, Brian Vad1 aZhang, Xiliang0 tApplied energy.g2011 Feb., v. 88, no. 2 p.518-525dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011000170300001600280520080100296592002801097650001501125650001601140650002101156650002101177650001501198650001201213650002001225650001301245650001101258650000901269650001101278650001501289700001601304700001801320700001801338700001801356773011701374856008601491990002301577852000901600655001201609IND60113173820221120125152.0141111e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011317382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2010.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Siyuan10aFunctionalization of graphene nanoribbons with porphyrin for electrocatalysis and amperometric biosensing  ap. 285-288.  aA direct electrochemical method to reduce graphene oxide nanoribbons was proposed. The reduced graphene nanoribbons (RGNRs) could be functionalized with water-soluble iron(III) meso-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinum-4-yl) porphyrin (FeTMPyP) via π–π noncovalent interaction on electrode surface. The resulting FeTMPyP/RGNRs film showed excellent electrocatalysis toward the reduction of dissolved oxygen at peak potential of −0.28V. Using glucose oxidase as model enzyme, a biosensor based on the consumption of O₂ was developed for amperometric detection of glucose ranging from 0.5mM to 10mM. This biosensor could be successfully applied in the detection of glucose in human serum. The FeTMPyP functionalized RGNRs provided a platform for electrocatalysis and biosensing of oxidase substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agraphene 3ahumans 3airon 3aoxygen 3aporphyrins1 aTang, Sheng1 aLei, Jianping1 aDong, Haifeng1 aJu, Huangxian0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2011 June 15, v. 656, no. 1-2 p.285-288dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2010.10.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245007300181300001600254520110600270592002801376650002001404650001201424650001401436650001101450650003101461650002101492650001101513650002901524650001601553700002201569700002001591700002501611773008601636856008601722852000901808655001201817IND60084835520221119140745.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008483552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFøyn, T.

This will show where limits in global resources are met and where limits in the data fed to the model until now are met. Results from the modelling are global and regional energy consumption, emission of greenhouse gasses and thereby potential increase in global mean temperature. Furthermore, total system costs are compared to a reference scenario. Existing analysis with TIAM shows different ways of reaching the 2°C target (increase in global mean temperature) and also how uncertainty on different factors influences the optimal solution. The main conclusion from existing analysis with TIAM is that the 2°C target is possible to reach, but it will be expensive. Another very important point is that if uncertainty on the value of the climate sensitivity (Cₛ) is taken into account then the optimal strategy calls for early action compared to a full foresight optimisation using the most probable value of Cₛ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3auncertainty1 aKarlsson, Kenneth1 aBalyk, Olexandr1 aGrohnheit, Poul Erik0 tApplied energy.g2011 Feb., v. 88, no. 2 p.526-534dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011000172520175200282592002802034650001802062650001002080650001502090650001802105650002302123650002402146650001902170650001202189650001702201650001502218650001702233650002802250650003502278650001102313650002202324650001202346650001502358650001102373650001202384650001702396650001402413650001402427650001502441650001102456653001602467653001302483653001902496653002402515653003202539653002002571700002202591700002102613700001802634700002002652700002502672700002402697773012902721856008302850852000902933655001202942IND60734122220221117193553.0220205e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073412222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2021.1106002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhania, Narender K.10aGut-specific arylphorin mediates midgut regenerative response against Cry-induced damage in Achaea janata  aDevelopment of insect resistance to biopesticides is a current and pertinent global issue. Earlier, it was established that lepidopteran larvae can recover from Bt intoxication via a midgut regenerative response and subsequently generate resistance. Molecular aspects of restoration of the midgut integrity following toxin exposure are emerging recently. In the present study, we bring out the pivotal role of gut arylphorin in mediating the midgut regenerative response following sublethal Bt exposure in Achaea janata. Bt-induced midgut damage was characterized by microscopic analysis using differential interference contrast (DIC) and immunofluorescence (IF). Extensive disruption of brush-border membrane, associated with the underlying cytoskeletal alterations including F-actin, α-actin and β-tubulin was observed. Single-photon fluorescence microscopy combined with fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) established the metabolic state associated with enhanced stem cell proliferation and migration from the basal side towards the luminal side following the damage. In-silico analysis revealed the phylogenetic relationship of gut arylphorin with closely related insect species and indicated the presence of two different subunits. Transient RNAi knockdown of the arylphorin resulted in diminished expression of mitotic Cyclin B mRNA levels. Human monoclonal Cyclin B antibody cross-reactivity with the Cyclin B located in the stem cells further validate the role of arylphorin as the mitogenic factor responsible for stem cell proliferation and epithelial regeneration. An in-depth understanding of resistance mechanisms will aid in the design of new strategies for the long-term usage and efficacy of Bt technology against pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchaea janata 3aactin 3aantibodies 3abiopesticides 3acell proliferation 3acomputer simulation 3across reaction 3acyclins 3acytoskeleton 3aepithelium 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3ainsect resistance 3ainsects 3amicrovilli 3amidgut 3amitosis 3apest control 3aphylogeny 3apoisoning 3astem cells 3atoxins 0aArylphorins 0aCyclin B 0aGut stem cells 0aMidgut regeneration 0aBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) 0aPest resistance1 aChauhan, Vinod K.1 aAbhilash, Dasari1 aThakur, Vivek1 aChaitanya, R.K.1 aDutta-Gupta, Shourya1 aDutta-Gupta, Aparna0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Aug.,  Sept., v. 255 p.110600-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2021.1106003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01588naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016200155300002000317520046100337592002800798650001800826650002300844650001100867650002800878650001400906650002100920650001400941700001200955700002100967700001900988700001301007773013501020856007401155852000901229655001201238IND60660949820221119115511.0190827e20150707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066094982DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc02092a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yi-Jin10aCopper(ii)-catalyzed oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reactions of secondary amines with α-diazo compounds: a facile and efficient synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles  ap. 11564-11567.  aA novel copper-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of secondary amines with α-diazo compounds has been developed via a cross-dehydrogenative coupling process.

This results in acceleration and amplification of the beat-to-beat changes in cytosolic Ca ²⁺ in cardiomyocytes and, in turn, an increased rate and force of contraction. PKA is held in proximity to its substrates by protein scaffolds called A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). It has been suggested that the short and long isoforms of AKAP7 (also called AKAP15/18) localize PKA in complexes with Ca V1.2 and PLN, respectively. We generated an AKAP7 KO mouse in which all isoforms were deleted and tested whether Ca ²⁺ current, intracellular Ca ²⁺ concentration, or Ca ²⁺ reuptake were impaired in isolated adult ventricular cardiomyocytes following stimulation with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. KO cardiomyocytes responded normally to adrenergic stimulation, as measured by whole-cell patch clamp or a fluorescent intracellular Ca ²⁺ indicator. Phosphorylation of Ca V1.2 and PLN were also unaffected by genetic deletion of AKAP7. Immunoblot and RT-PCR revealed that only the long isoforms of AKAP7 were detectable in ventricular cardiomyocytes. The results indicate that AKAP7 is not required for regulation of Ca ²⁺ handling in mouse cardiomyocytes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3acalcium 3afluorescence 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3acardiomyocytes 3amice 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3aknockout mutants 3ascaffolding proteins 3aphosphorylation 3aadults 0aagonists1 aBrunet, Sylvain1 aGilbert, Merle L.1 aNichols, C.

To define the timing and regulation of these processes, we developed a SunTag-based reporter to monitor translation of a problematic sequence (poly[A]) in real time on single mRNAs. Although poly(A)-containing mRNAs undergo continuous translation over the timescale of minutes to hours, ribosome load is increased by ∼3-fold compared to a control, reflecting long queues of ribosomes extending far upstream of the stall. We monitor the resolution of these queues in real time and find that ribosome rescue is very slow compared to both elongation and termination. Modulation of pause strength, collision frequency, and the collision sensor ZNF598 reveals how the dynamics of ribosome collisions and their recognition facilitate selective targeting for quality control. Our results establish that slow clearance of stalled ribosomes allows cells to distinguish between transient and deleterious stalls.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolypeptides 3aquality control 3aribosomes 0aribosome 0atranslation 0aprotein synthesis 0amRNA 0aimaging 0asingle-molecule 0aSunTag1 aLivingston, Nathan M.1 aMovsik, Jonathan1 aWu, Bin1 aGreen, Rachel0 tMolecular cell.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 81, no. 8 p.1830-1840.e8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01258naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007200159300002000231520031300251592002800564650001300592650003600605650001800641650001100659650002400670700002400694700001900718773013600737856007400873852000900947655001200956IND60661053520221118162336.0190827e20150827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066105352DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05117g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Terumasa10aTransfer hydrogenation promoted by N-heterocyclic carbene and water  ap. 13906-13909.  aN-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) promote the transfer hydrogenation of various activated CC, CN, and NN bonds with water as the proton source.

However, the productivity of hydrogen by gas separation is constrained by the inevitable trade-off phenomenon between gas selectivity and permeance, known as the Robeson upper bound. Here we find by comprehensive simulations that a bottom-up synthesized nanoporous graphene with high pore density and pinpoint pore size sharply breaks through the Robeson upper bound with high hydrogen permeance and ultrahigh hydrogen/nitrogen selectivity. Hydrogen can easily pass through the densely distributed pinpoint-sized nanopores, while no nitrogen can diffuse across the membrane due to a high energy barrier through the pore. It is also found that the membrane is mechanically strong enough to sustain the pressure for gas separation. Hydrogen permeance could be further enhanced by straining the membrane. These results show that the nanoporous graphene membrane can be a very competitive candidate for hydrogen/nitrogen gas separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ananopores 3anitrogen 3aporosity 0aHydrogen/nitrogen separation 0aNanoporous graphene 0aUltrahigh selectivity 0aHigh permeance1 aQiu, Hu1 aGuo, Wanlin0 tCarbon.g2021 Sept., v. 182 p.628-633dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005100165300001600216520157400232592002801806650000801834650001801842650001301860650001201873650001201885650002001897650001501917650001901932650001401951650001301965650001801978650002001996650001302016650001102029650001702040650001402057653001802071653002402089653002502113653002602138653003002164653001902194653001302213700001902226773014802245856008202393852000902475655001202484IND60656187820221118014238.0191010e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065618782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2019.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Nazrul10aFinding a clean woodstove – A 300-year quest  ap. 147-153.  aThis paper reports the results of an experimental study carried out over 30 years ago on the combustion and air pollution characteristics of biomass fuels when used with downdraft combustion. Such combustion involves the flow of fuel and air in the same direction (cocurrent) leading to the biomass to gasify first to a combustible mixture including carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) that will burn in a gas phase with high combustion efficiencies and low total suspended particulates (TSP). It is noteworthy that over 300 years ago, Justell published a report of a similar device that led to apparently very clean combustion.The study ascertained the extent to which complete combustion is possible in a cocurrent burner using primary air only or using both primary air and secondary air, exploring other variables such as dry or wet woodfuels and control of heat transfer from the combustion zone. The study has resulted in some generalized concepts for cocurrent combustion that link the oxygen requirements to the reactor conditions that impact upon the rate of pyrolysis or devolatilization of the biomass material. Clean combustion can be obtained with very little CO and TSP in the flue gas, with primary air only or a mixture of primary and secondary air. In the latter, the primary must be just enough to operate the device as a gasifier. The device seems to operate above the WHO PM2.5 Emissions Rate Target but meets the Intermediate Emissions Rate Target for cookstoves and easily meets the incoming USEPA emissions standard for woodheating stoves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3acooking stoves 3aemissions 3aflue gas 3aheat transfer 3aheating systems 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aparticulates 3apyrolysis 0aBiomass stove 0aDowndraft combustor 0aCocurrent combustion 0aParticulate emissions 0aCarbon monoxide emissions 0aCarbon dioxide 0aCat piss1 aSmith, Kirk R.0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2019 Oct., v. 52 p.147-153dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2019.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245009000189300001600279520146000295592002801755653001801783653002601801653001401827653001601841653001701857653001001874653001201884653001801896700001601914700002601930700002701956773013101983856011502114852000902229655001202238IND60125192020221118193548.0151102e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012519202DNAL7 a10.1647/1082-6742(2007)21[307:TUOVFT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Somma, Antonio14aThe Use of Voriconazole for the Treatment of Aspergillosis in Falcons (Falco Species)  ap. 307-316.  aTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of voriconazole for the treatment of aspergillosis in falcons, 20 falcons with aspergillosis admitted to the Dubai Falcon Hospital from August 2003 to May 2006 were treated with voriconazole. These falcons included 6 gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus), 10 gyrfalcon hybrids, 1 lanner (Falco biarmicus), 1 saker (Falco cherrug), and 2 peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus). Clinical signs were weight loss, inappetence, dyspnea, inspiratory stridor, tachypnea, and biliverdinuria. Aspergillosis was diagnosed from clinical signs, hematologic results, radiographic abnormalities, endoscopic examination of the lower respiratory tract, cytologic examination of biopsy samples from air sacs, and fungal cultures. Birds treated with voriconazole administered by crop gavage were divided into 2 groups: in group 1, birds were treated with 12.5 mg/kg q12 h for 3 days (loading dose), then q24h for an additional 18 to 87 days; in group 2, birds were treated with 12.5 mg/kg q12h for the full period of 44 to 100 days. Treatment with voriconazole resulted in a successful clinical response in most cases, an acceptable survival rate, and few adverse effects. Complete clinical resolution occurred in 14 birds (70%%), a partial response in 5 birds (25%%), and 1 bird (5%%) died during treatment. From these results, voriconazole appeared to be effective and safe for the treatment of aspergillosis in some species of falcons.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaspergillosis 0aAspergillus fumigatus 0aendoscopy 0aantifungals 0avoriconazole 0aavian 0afalcons 0aFalco species1 aBailey, Tom1 aSilvanose, Christudas1 aGarcia-Martinez, Celia0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2007 Dec., v. 21, no. 4 p.307-316dAssociation of Avian Veterinariansx1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647%2F1082-6742%282007%2921%5B307%3ATUOVFT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013800209300001600347520140500363592002801768650000801796650001801804650003401822650002401856650001301880650001901893650001901912650002701931650001101958650002201969653001901991653002702010653001902037653002102056653002102077653002002098700002402118700003502142700006002177700006102237700002602298700006202324773008802386856008502474852000902559655001202568IND60741649620221116155757.0220103e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074164962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshmukh, Sujit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7763-169310aPolarity dependent electrowetting for directional transport of water through patterned superhydrophobic laser induced graphene fibers  ap. 605-614.  aThe possibilities of the precise control of wetting properties of a series of laser-induced graphene (LIG) films consisting of microscale air pockets on top of nano-scale surface roughness using electrowetting are demonstrated. By application of a marginal DC bias (∼2 V), water can efficiently wet as well as can be pumped through the superhydrophobic LIG substrates. Interestingly, the electrowetting phenomenon is strongly dependent on the applied voltage polarity and it causes an abrupt wetting transition from superhydrophobic (contact angle ∼152°) Cassie state to superhydrophilic (contact angle ∼7°) Wenzel state on the LIG films. By analyzing the voltage polarity dependent electrowetting results with an equivalent electrical circuit model at the solid-liquid interface, and considering the hierarchical dual surface roughness (micro-nano scale), the transition between the “slippy” Cassie state and the “sticky” Wenzel states is explained. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the unique structural characteristics of the custom-designed micropatterned LIGs, with precisely tailored surface energy by simple post-annealing treatment, enable easy preparation of superhydrophobic LIG films. The approach to prepare stable superhydrophobic LIG with voltage polarity dependent wetting mode transition is used here to controllably transport of water through 3D porous LIG surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acontact angle 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectronic circuits 3agraphene 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquid-solid interface 3amodels 3asurface roughness 0aElectrowetting 0aLaser-induced graphene 0aMicropatterned 0aSuperhydrophobic 0aSuperhydrophilic 0aWater transport1 aBanerjee, Debosmita1 aMarin Quintero, Juan Sebastian1 aFishlock, Sam J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0712-81061 aMcLaughlin, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6026-89711 aWaghmare, Prashant R.1 aRoy, Susanta Sinha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5078-88770 tCarbon.g2021 Sept., v. 182 p.605-614dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009900178300001400277520156200291592002801853650001501881650001501896650001901911650001001930650002201940650002001962650002101982650001702003650001802020650001602038650000902054650001102063650001302074650001702087650001402104650001702118650001702135650001402152650001102166650001302177700002802190700002602218700003702244773009602281856008502377852000902462655001202471IND60080876220221119125507.0140812e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKückelhaus, Carlos S.10aPravastatin modulates macrophage functions of Leishmania (L.) amazonensis-infected BALB/c mice  ap. 18-25.  aThe control of leishmaniases poses an important challenge due to the scarcity and toxicity of the pharmacological options available. We have previously shown that pravastatin significantly improves the course of the disease in Leishmania (L.) amazonensis-infected BALB/c mice. Since the drug caused no direct effect on the parasite, we decided to evaluate its immunomodulatory action in this experimental model. To evaluate the impact of pravastatin treatment, BALB/c mice infected or not with L. (L.) amazonensis were treated with pravastatin (20mg/kg daily) or saline during 30 or 90days and phagocytosis, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide and the tumor necrosis factor production by peritoneal macrophages were assessed. We showed that pravastatin increased the phagocytosis mediated by complement and immunoglobulin receptors (63.5 to 130.3; p=0.03, t test), but not that occurring via pattern recognition receptors, induced a rise of nitric oxide production by macrophages (2.1μM to 12.9μM; p=0.04, Mann–Whitney test), endowing these cells to better kill ingested leishmania organisms, caused no modification of the otherwise increased production of hydrogen peroxide by macrophages, and reduced the overproduction of tumor necrosis factor (166.6pg/mL to 3.9pg/mL; p=0.016, Mann–Whitney test), a major component of the exacerbated inflammation associated to leishmaniases. Our findings point to the potential usefulness of pravastatin as an adjunct to the treatment of leishmaniases, based on its powerful immunomodulatory effects and low toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania 3acomplement 3adisease course 3adrugs 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunoglobulins 3aimmunomodulation 3ainflammation 3aleishmaniasis 3amacrophages 3amice 3amodels 3anecrosis 3anitric oxide 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aphagocytosis 3areceptors 3at-test 3atoxicity1 aKückelhaus, Selma A.S.1 aTosta, Carlos Eduardo1 aMuniz-Junqueira, Maria Imaculada0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 May, v. 134, no. 1 p.18-25dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04111naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245017400175300001600349520222800365592002802593650002102621650001802642650001602660650001702676650001102693650002102704650001502725650002802740650002102768650002102789653003402810653003702844653002102881653001902902653004802921653003202969653000903001653000703010653000803017653000803025653000803033653000703041653000803048653000803056653000903064653000903073653000903082700002403091700002203115700002203137700002003159700002203179700001803201700002203219700002203241700002303263773007703286856008903363852000903452655001203461IND60545396120221119165918.0160902e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054539612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroh, Ksenia J.10aDevelopment and application of the adverse outcome pathway framework for understanding and predicting chronic toxicity: I. Challenges and research needs in ecotoxicology  ap. 764-777.  aTo elucidate the effects of chemicals on populations of different species in the environment, efficient testing and modeling approaches are needed that consider multiple stressors and allow reliable extrapolation of responses across species. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is a concept that provides a framework for organizing knowledge about the progression of toxicity events across scales of biological organization that lead to adverse outcomes relevant for risk assessment. In this paper, we focus on exploring how the AOP concept can be used to guide research aimed at improving both our understanding of chronic toxicity, including delayed toxicity as well as epigenetic and transgenerational effects of chemicals, and our ability to predict adverse outcomes. A better understanding of the influence of subtle toxicity on individual and population fitness would support a broader integration of sublethal endpoints into risk assessment frameworks. Detailed mechanistic knowledge would facilitate the development of alternative testing methods as well as help prioritize higher tier toxicity testing. We argue that targeted development of AOPs supports both of these aspects by promoting the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and their contribution to relevant toxicity outcomes across biological scales. We further discuss information requirements and challenges in application of AOPs for chemical- and site-specific risk assessment and for extrapolation across species. We provide recommendations for potential extension of the AOP framework to incorporate information on exposure, toxicokinetics and situation-specific ecological contexts, and discuss common interfaces that can be employed to couple AOPs with computational modeling approaches and with evolutionary life history theory. The extended AOP framework can serve as a venue for integration of knowledge derived from various sources, including empirical data as well as molecular, quantitative and evolutionary-based models describing species responses to toxicants. This will allow a more efficient application of AOP knowledge for quantitative chemical- and site-specific risk assessment as well as for extrapolation across species in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic toxicity 3aecotoxicology 3aepigenetics 3alife history 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3aprediction 3arisk assessment process 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity testing 0aAdverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) 0aEcotoxicological risk assessment 0aChronic toxicity 0aToxicokinetics 0aExtrapolation from individual to population 0aCross-species extrapolation 0aADME 0aAO 0aAOP 0aDEB 0aIBM 0aKE 0aKER 0aMIE 0aPBTK 0aQSAR 0aTKTD1 aCarvalho, Raquel N.1 aChipman, James K.1 aDenslow, Nancy D.1 aHalder, Marlies1 aMurphy, Cheryl A.1 aRoelofs, Dick1 aRolaki, Alexandra1 aSchirmer, Kristin1 aWatanabe, Karen H.0 tChemosphere.g2015 Feb., v. 120 p.764-777dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014400168300001600312520146800328592002801796650003001824650001601854650001601870650001301886650001701899650001401916650001201930650001801942650001201960650004001972650001302012650002302025650002102048650001602069651001102085653003002096653001502126653001802141653002302159653001302182700001702195700001802212700001902230700001702249700001902266700013702285773012502422856008502547852000902632655001202641IND60656188220221118014249.0191121e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065618822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ying-Ju10aSeasonal variations in emission rates and composition of terpenoids emitted from Chamaecyparis formosensis (Cupressaceae) of different ages  ap. 405-414.  aChamaecyparis formosensis (Cupressaceae) is among the most precious endemic conifers in Taiwan. Field study was conducted on seasonal variations in emission rates and compositions of terpenoids from this tree species of two different ages. A total of 21 terpenoids were detected, of which there were 13 monoterpenoids (MTs), 4 sesquiterpenoids (STs), and 4 diterpenoids (DTs). MTs dominated the emissions in both saplings and adult trees and produced more than 80% of terpene emissions. Contrasting seasonal pattern between saplings and adult trees was found. Total actual emissions from saplings were higher in cold seasons (range, 64.40 ± 13.18 to 140.74 ± 18.90 ng g−1 h−1) than in warm seasons (range, 55.63 ± 15.84 to 63.48 ± 11.85 ng g−1 h−1). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was found to be the most important factor affecting terpene emissions from saplings. On the contrary, higher emissions were found in warm seasons for adult trees (range, 101.49 ± 12.29 to 181.35 ± 80.15 ng g−1 h−1), and the emissions were mainly in response to temperature. Some compounds in C. formosensis of both ages (e.g., β-myrcene, α-terpinene, trans-β-ocimene, terpinen-4-ol, α-cedrene and trans-β-farnesene) showed comparably higher contents in cold seasons. Results presented here provide important fundamental information for better understanding of forest bathing and estimating air quality in Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChamaecyparis formosensis 3aair quality 3acold season 3aconifers 3aditerpenoids 3aemissions 3aforests 3amature plants 3amyrcene 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asaplings 3aseasonal variation 3asesquiterpenoids 3atemperature 3aTaiwan 0aChamaecyparis formosensis 0aTerpenoids 0aEmission rate 0aSeasonal variation 0aTree age1 aLin, Chun-Ya1 aHsu, Huai-Wan1 aYeh, Chen-Ying1 aChen, Yu-Han1 aYeh, Ting-Feng1 aChang, Shang-Tzen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5747-3373 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5747-3373 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5747-33730 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 Sept., v. 142 p.405-414dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014200178300001400320520142200334592002801756650003101784650002201815650001301837650001701850650002401867650001801891650002001909650002101929650002301950650001801973650001701991650002502008650002602033650001702059650002802076650000902104650002402113650003202137650001602169650001302185700002102198700002102219700001802240700002102258700002602279773009602305856008502401852000902486655001202495IND60080876420221119125254.0140812e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesołowska, Agnieszka10aMicroarray analysis of rat immune responses to liver fluke infection following vaccination with Fasciola hepatica phosphoglycerate kinase  ap. 33-38.  aFasciolosis is a considerable veterinary problem, causing significant economic losses to livestock production and the food industry. Research in the area of Fasciola hepatica infection immunology is necessary to improve our knowledge about immunological mechanism evoked by the parasite and to develop new control strategies against liver fluke. In this present paper we analyzed the expression levels of cytokines in rats infected with F. hepatica following immunization with F. hepatica phosphoglycerate kinase – a novel vaccine antigen. Immune response analysis using microarray was undertaken six weeks after infection. Expression levels of INF-γ and IL-4, which are characteristic cytokines secreted during Th1-like and Th2-like immune responses, respectively, were unchanged in vaccinated animals as compared to control animals. This indicates the vaccine did not influence the major modulation of immune responses typically observed during Fasciola infections, however, other subtle but significant variations were observed that indicated altered inflammatory and possibly T helper cell responses. A significant rise in IL-12α chain expression levels was observed. Expression levels of TNF-α and some related molecules, such as ADAM17, FasL, CD40 and TRAF3 were also elevated. Expression levels of molecules involved in IL-1 signaling pathways were reduced, although a rise in IL-1α expression was noted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aFasciola hepatica 3aantigens 3afascioliasis 3afinancial economics 3afood industry 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1alpha 3ainterleukin-4 3aliver flukes 3alivestock production 3amicroarray technology 3aparasitology 3aphosphoglycerate kinase 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccination 3avaccines1 aJaros, Sławomir1 aNorbury, Luke J.1 aJaros, Dorota1 aZygner, Wojciech1 aWędrychowicz, Halina0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 May, v. 134, no. 1 p.33-38dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245012900173300001400302520079300316592002801109650002601137650001501163650001101178650001601189650001501205650002201220650001201242650002501254650001801279650001301297653003901310653002401349653001001373653001501383653001601398700001901414700002001433700001901453700001501472773007501487856008901562852000901651655001201660IND60545396320221119170049.0160902e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054539632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yang-Yang10aNitrogen doped carbon nanoparticles enhanced extracellular electron transfer for high-performance microbial fuel cells anode  ap. 26-33.  aNitrogen doped carbon nanoparticles (NDCN) were applied to modify the carbon cloth anodes of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) inoculated with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, one of the most well-studied exoelectrogens.

The development of theory and application promotes the advanced physics research on metasurfaces supporting dynamic BIC. However, the dynamic conversion between quasi-BIC and BIC of the metasurfaces is still not realized in strict sense. Herein, we report a significant progress that the free switch between BIC and quasi-BIC is successfully achieved by introducing the structured graphene into the metal terahertz metasurfaces, which is based on free-electron concentration of graphene changing from semiconductor-like to metal-like with adjustment of Fermi energy. We propose the efficient-structure model to explain these phenomena, and prove the wide applicability of this model by investigating seven class metal structures which includes a parameter-tuned metasurface and six common symmetry-protected metasurfaces. The further investigation shows such graphene-metal metasurface array has potential application in dynamic display, and it only needs to change the bias voltage applied on each structure to obtain different display contents, without the requirement of preparing additional metasurface array, which is impossible to achieve via traditional static metasurfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3agraphene 3amodels 0aGraphene-metal terahertz metasurfaces 0aBIC and Quasi-BIC 0aFree switch 0aEfficient-structure model 0aDynamic display1 aLi, Jie1 aZheng, Chenglong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5754-54481 aYue, Zhen1 aWang, Silei1 aLi, Mengyao1 aZhao, Hongliang1 aZhang, Yating1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6927-84521 aYao, Jianquan0 tCarbon.g2021 Sept., v. 182 p.506-515dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245011600186300001400302500001500316520186800331592002802199650001702227650001002244650001102254650002502265650001802290650001202308650003002320650002602350650001802376650001802394650001702412650002102429650001402450650001302464650002502477653002002502700003502522700002902557700002502586700003102611773009602642856008502738852000902823655001202832IND60080876520221119125409.0140812e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzmán-Silva, Maria Angélica10aExperimental amoebic liver abscess in hamsters caused by trophozoites of a Brazilian strain of Entamoeba dispar  ap. 39-47.  a2019-12-06  aIt has been claimed that amoebic molecules such as amoebapore, galactose/N-acetyl galactosamine inhibitable lectin, and cysteine proteases are responsible for host tissue destruction and are present in both pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica and non-pathogenic Entamoeba dispar. Some reports have provided evidence that after infection with E. dispar, pathological changes may occur in some humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate E. dispar pathogenicity by comparing it to the pathogenicity of E. histolytica through liver abscesses induced in hamsters. Syrian golden hamsters were challenged by intrahepatic inoculation with the 03C E. dispar strain or with two strains of E. histolytica (HM1:IMSS and EGG) to compare their virulence grades. As control groups, we used bacterial flora and Pavlova’s modified medium. Lesions were verified at 1, 3 and 6days after inoculation. Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction was performed to characterize each strain using EdP1/EdP2 and EhP1/EhP2 primers. The EGG and HM1:IMSS E. histolytica strains and 03C E. dispar were able to cause liver lesions. The EGG strain caused extensive hepatic abscesses, and trophozoites were found in the lesions throughout the three periods of study. The HM1:IMSS strain caused smaller abscesses when compared to EGG lesions; however, trophozoites were observed at 1 and 3days after inoculation. The 03C E. dispar strain caused intermediate abscesses when compared to the others; trophozoites were observed in all periods analyzed. The EGG strain caused progressive evolution of the injury, which differed from the HM1:IMSS and 03C strains. These results strongly suggest that the 03C E. dispar strain is pathogenic in the experimental hamster model. Additional studies are necessary to identify potential factors that regulate the manifestation of virulence of this strain and others.  aPublisher supplied data 3atrophozoites 3aliver 3ahumans 3aMesocricetus auratus 3aliver abscess 3alectins 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aanimal models 3agalactosamine 3aparasitology 3avirulent strains 3avirulence 3abacteria 3acysteine proteinases 0agolden hamsters1 aSantos, Helena Lúcia Carneiro1 aPeralta, Regina Saramago1 aPeralta, José Mauro1 ade Macedo, Heloisa Werneck0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 May, v. 134, no. 1 p.39-47dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245013400211300001600345506007600361520191500437592002802352506003702380650000902417650001202426650001202438650001502450650001402465650001402479650002202493650002202515650001802537650002202555650001202577650001902589650001402608650001402622650001402636650001202650650001202662650001902674650003702693650001802730651002202748700002102770700002202791700002102813773009302834856008102927852000903008655001203017IND60438834820221207132856.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043883482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-015-2292-62doi7 aPMC44982402pmcid7 a258963742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolzinger, Andreas10aDesiccation tolerance in the chlorophyte green alga Ulva compressa: does cell wall architecture contribute to ecological success?  ap. 477-492.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMAIN CONCLUSION : Desiccation leads to structural changes of the inner pectic cell wall layers in Ulva compressa . This contributes to protection against mechanical damage due to desiccation–rehydration cycles. Ulva compressa, characterized by rbcL phylogeny, is a common species in the Mediterranean Sea. Ulva as an intertidal species tolerates repeated desiccation–rehydration cycles in nature; the physiological and structural basis were investigated under experimental conditions here. Desiccation to 73 % relative water content (RWC) led to a significant decrease of the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F ᵥ/F ₘ) to about half of the initial value. A reduction to 48 or 27 % RWC caused a more drastic effect and thalli were only able to recover fully from desiccation to 73 % RWC. Relative electron transport rates were stimulated at 73 % RWC, but decreased significantly at 48 and 27 % RWC, respectively. Imaging-PAM analysis demonstrated a homogenous desiccation process within individual thallus discs. The different cell wall layers of U. compressa were characterized by standard staining procedures, i.e. calcofluor white and aniline blue for structural components (cellulose, callose), ruthenium red for pectins and toluidine blue for acidic polysaccharides. Already a reduction to 73 % RWC caused severe changes of the cell walls. The inner pectin-rich layers followed the shrinkage process of the cytoplasm, while the outer denser fibrillar layers maintained their shape. In this way, the thalli were not plasmolyzed during water loss, and upon recovery not negatively influenced by any mechanical damage. Transmission electron microscopy corroborated the arrangement of the different layers clearly distinguishable by their texture and electron density. We suggest the flexibility of the pectin-rich cell wall layers as a major contribution to desiccation tolerance in Ulva.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUlva 3aaniline 3acallose 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acytoplasm 3adrought tolerance 3aelectron transfer 3alittoral zone 3amechanical damage 3apectins 3aphotosystem II 3aphylogeny 3aruthenium 3ashrinkage 3atexture 3athallus 3atoluidine blue 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater content 3aMediterranean Sea1 aHerburger, Klaus1 aKaplan, Franziska1 aLewis, Louise A.0 tPlanta.g2015 Aug., v. 242, no. 2 p.477-492dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2292-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245019600171300001400367520136900381592002801750650001501778650001301793650002101806650001601827650002001843650002801863650002101891650001501912650002201927650001301949650001801962650001801980650001901998650001302017650001702030700001602047700001802063700001702081773011502098856008602213990002302299852000902322655001202331IND60113174920221121025315.0141111e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011317492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ke-Jing13aAn electrochemical amperometric immunobiosensor for label-free detection of α-fetoprotein based on amine-functionalized graphene and gold nanoparticles modified carbon ionic liquid electrode  ap. 72-77.  aA sensitive label-free amperometric immunosensor was developed based on the amine-functionalized graphene (GR-NH₂) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) composite modified carbon ionic liquid electrode (CILE). CILE was fabricated by using an ionic liquid of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate as binder. The nanocomposite AuNPs/GR-NH₂ had prominent biocompatibility, good electron transfer ability, large specific surface area, and primarily excellent adsorption. The negatively charged AuNPs could be adsorbed on the positively charged GR-NH₂ modified CILE surface by electrostatic adsorption, and then to immobilize α-fetoprotein antibody (anti-AFP) for the assay of α-fetoprotein (AFP). The fabricated procedures and electrochemical behaviors of the immunosensor were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The anti-AFP/AuNPs/GR-NH₂ modified CILE was sensitive to AFP in linear relation between 1 and 250ngmL⁻¹ with the correlation coefficient of 0.995, and the detection limit (S/N=3) was 0.1ngmL⁻¹ under the optimal conditions. In addition, the proposed immunosensor exhibited good sensitivity, selectivity, stability and long-term maintenance of bioactivity and it may be used to immobilize other biomoleculars to develop biosensor for the detection of other antigens or biocompounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantigens 3abiocompatibility 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3aimmunosensors 3aionic liquids 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3asurface area1 aNiu, De-Jun1 aSun, Jun-Yong1 aZhu, Jun-Jie0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2011 June 15, v. 656, no. 1-2 p.72-77dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.01.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002800186245004800214300002000262506007600282520109300358592002801451506003701479650000801516650001001524650002301534650001701557650000901574650001201583650002601595650001101621650001501632653002301647653002701670653002201697653002301719700003001742700001901772773017601791856007901967852000902046655001202055IND60172330220221207055159.0150602e20121023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017233022DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12087321092doi7 aPMC34915152pmcid7 a230456352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertrand, Olivier J.

These capabilities are enabled by the pervading cytoskeletal network, an active gel composed of structural filaments (e.g., actin) that are acted upon by motor proteins (e.g., myosin). Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of an active gel using noncytoskeletal components. We use methods of base-pair-templated DNA self assembly to create a hybrid DNA gel containing stiff tubes and flexible linkers. We then activate the gel by adding the motor FtsK50C, a construct derived from the bacterial protein FtsK that, in vitro, has a strong and processive DNA contraction activity. The motors stiffen the gel and create stochastic contractile events that affect the positions of attached beads. We quantify the fluctuations of the beads and show that they are comparable both to measurements of cytoskeletal systems and to theoretical predictions for active gels. Thus, we present a DNA-based active gel whose behavior highlights the universal aspects of nonequilibrium, motor-driven networks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aactin 3abacterial proteins 3acytoskeleton 3agels 3ahybrids 3amechanical properties 3amyosin 3aprediction 0aactive soft matter 0acytoskeletal mechanics 0aDNA self-assembly 0adiffusive dynamics1 aFygenson, Deborah Kuchnir1 aSaleh, Omar A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 23, v. 109, no. 43 p.17342-17347dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12087321093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011600170300001400286520137900300592002801679650001701707650002001724650002101744650004301765650001401808650002101822650000901843650001501852650001701867700002201884700001901906700001701925773011501942856008602057990002302143852000902166655001202175IND60113175120221120202913.0141111e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011317512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotani, Akira10aPrepeak of trolox caused by theophylline and its application to the determination of theophylline in rat plasma  ap. 85-90.  aA novel electrochemical detection coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed for determining theophylline in plasma samples. On a voltammogram of acetonitrile containing trolox (TrOH), theophylline and LiClO₄, a new oxidation peak (termed a prepeak) appeared at a potential less positive than that for the oxidation peak of TrOH without theophylline. Since the prepeak current linearly increased with the theophylline concentration, the electrochemical detection was carried out by measuring the prepeak current height at a constant potential in a flow-type thin-layer cell. HPLC using a silica gel column and a mobile phase of acetonitrile was conducted for the separation of the theophylline. The eluate from the column was mixed with a solution of 1.5mmolL⁻¹ TrOH and 20mmolL⁻¹ LiClO₄ in acetonitrile. The chromatographic peak height for theophylline at a detection potential of +1.1V vs. Ag/AgCl was found to be linearly related to the concentrations injected, ranging from 2.0 to 100μmolL⁻¹ (r>0.999). The detection limit of the concentration of theophylline was 0.55μmolL⁻¹. The present method, which required only 10μL of plasma sample, was applied to the determination of theophylline in rat plasma. The concentration–time profile of theophylline in rat plasma was monitored to determine pharmacokinetic parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoxidation 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3asilica gel 3atheophylline1 aHashimoto, Mariko1 aKotani, Tomoko1 aKusu, Fumiyo0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2011 June 15, v. 656, no. 1-2 p.85-90dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.01.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158300002000268500001400288520095400302583145701256592002802713650002102741650001702762650001102779650001502790650003102805650001002836650000902846650002902855650001102884650002702895650001002922700001302932700001602945773012502961856007403086852000903160655001203169IND60708589820221123014837.0200828e20200826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070858982DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra04607h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBevan, Eloise10aRETRACTION: Challenges and opportunities of hydrothermal carbonisation in the UK; case study in Chirnside  ap. 31586-31610.  aNAL-light  aThe latest research and development in hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) processes are reviewed and the feasibility of application to small towns in the UK is assessed. The HTC process designed in this report is theoretically evaluated for the biodegradable municipal waste and sewage waste produced by the small-town Chirnside, in the Scottish Borders. Calculation of mass and energy balances of the process are carried out alongside the evaluation of challenges and environmental, social and economic opportunities presented. The hypothetical HTC plant is capable of processing Chirnside's waste at a rate of 72.5 kg h⁻¹ and has a positive net energy. The hydrochar produced is capable of producing 1452 MW h per year which equates to 35.6% of Chirnside's predicted energy demand in 2041. Both the expected opportunities and challenges for the application of HTC are discussed, sheding light on the associated research on sustainable technology.  aRetracted: October 2021, v.11(54), p.33938, 10.1039/d1ra90160ezWe, the authors, hereby wholly retract this article due to an error in the calculations. In this article, only the electrical energy demand of Chirnside’s residents was considered and the total energy supply from the hydrochar produced by the modelled plant was taken as the total HHV (higher heating value) energy content contained in these pellets. Thus, the following calculations did not consider the efficiencies in the conversion of hydrochar into its usable forms of energy (electricity and thermal energies). Therefore, the statement that HTC can provide Chirnside’s residents with 35.6% of their energy demand is fundamentally incorrect. Having consulted with an independent expert, the Royal Society of Chemistry has determined that any changes made to the paper to correct this would be major, and therefore that the best course of action is retraction and republication of the article with the correct data. The Royal Society of Chemistry is happy that the overall conclusions of the paper are not affected by this error, and therefore that republication of the work with the correct data is appropriate. The republished article was peer reviewed and can be found at https://doi.org/10.1039/D1RA06736B.

Blood glucose and HbA1c levels significantly increased in the D group compared to the healthy ones (p < 0.05). However, the fasting period significantly improved blood glucose and HbA1c levels 14 days after STZ induced diabetes in rats compared to the D group. Similar findings we obtained for serum (BUN-creatinine) and urine samples (creatinine and urea levels). STZ induced high glucose levels significantly up-regulated TNF-α, NLRP-3, TGF-β1 and VCAM-1 mRNA expression and fasting significantly decreased these parameters when compared to diabetic rats. Histopathological staining also demonstrated the protective effects of fasting on diabetic kidney tissue. In conclusion, intermittent fasting regulated blood glucose level as well as decreasing harmful effects of diabetes on kidney tissue. The fasting period significantly decreased the hyperglycemia-related inflammatory cytokine damage on kidneys and also reduced apoptosis in favor of living organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbino 3aapoptosis 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adiabetes 3afasting 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglycemic control 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3aurea 3aurine 3avascular cell adhesion molecules 0aKidney 0aRat1 aCalik, Ilknur1 aYayla, Muhammed1 aDincer, Busra1 aTavaci, Taha1 aCinar, Irfan1 aBilen, Habip1 aCadirci, Elif1 aHalici, Zekai1 aMercantepe, Filiz0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 190 p.911-918dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.2163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007700171300001600248520193600264592002802200650002702228650001502255650001102270650002302281650001802304650002002322650001902342650002202361650001402383651001102397700002602408700001702434773008602451856008602537852000902623655001202632IND60084837020221119140646.0141101e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008483702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGauder, Martin14aThe impact of a growing bioethanol industry on food production in Brazil  ap. 672-679.  aThe Brazilian production of major food commodities increased fivefold between 1961 and 2008. In the same time, the area cropped with sugar cane increased with high growth rates, currently covering 3% of the area dedicated to agricultural production in Brazil. In order to assess a possible competition between biofuel and food production, the development of agricultural productivity and area expansion in the past was analysed. Furthermore, the future situation of land resources for agricultural production was illustrated. The findings of this study indicated that area resources of more than 20 million hectare would be available for agricultural production in the upcoming years. A current constraint of food production throughout land dedicated to biofuels was not found. Three scenarios were investigated, simulating possibilities of future changes in Brazilian agriculture. The results demonstrated that primary food production could be enhanced by 1.5 times while bioethanol production was enhanced simultaneously by 1.8 times over the years 2007/2008 and 2020. The generated bioethanol volumes would meet 38% of the total energy demand in Brazilian transport sector, applied to the year 2007. The second scenario evaluated an agricultural development with a higher focus on biofuels. It was projected that the production of bioethanol could be increased by 3.0 times to 76.7 million m³ of bioethanol, while increasing at the same time primary food production with the factor 1.4 aligned to the projected population growth. This bioethanol volume represents 67% of the total energy demand in Brazilian transport sector in the year 2007. A third scenario demonstrated that food production could be increased even with no area expansion higher than the projected population growth, due to a continued increase of productivity. At the same time bioethanol production would rise to 32 million m³ without occupying more area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural resources 3abioethanol 3aenergy 3aethanol production 3afood industry 3afood production 3aland resources 3apopulation growth 3asugarcane 3aBrazil1 aGraeff-Hönninger, S.1 aClaupein, W.0 tApplied energy.g2011 Mar., v. 88, no. 3 p.672-679dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013300164300001600297520111100313592002801424650001201452650001701464650002801481650001101509650001901520650000901539651001301548651001801561700002001579700002001599773011301619856008101732852000901813655001201822IND60575018620221118062431.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057501862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-016-1795-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Wei Lun10aSubseasonal to multidecadal variability of northeast monsoon daily rainfall over Peninsular Malaysia using a hidden Markov model  ap. 577-586.  aThis study involves the modelling of a homogeneous hidden Markov model (HMM) on the northeast rainfall monsoon using 40 rainfall stations in Peninsular Malaysia for the period of 1975 to 2008. A six hidden states HMM was selected based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and every hidden state has distinct rainfall characteristics. Three of the states were found to correspond by wet conditions; while the remaining three states were found to correspond to dry conditions. The six hidden states were found to correspond with the associated atmospheric composites. The relationships between El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Pacific Ocean are found regarding interannual variability. The wet (dry) states were found to be well correlated with a Niño 3.4 index which was used to characterize the intensity of an ENSO event. This model is able to assess the behaviour of the rainfall characteristics with the large scale atmospheric circulation; the monsoon rainfall is well correlated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in Peninsular Malaysia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aMarkov chain 3aatmospheric circulation 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3arain 3aMalaysia 3aPacific Ocean1 aYusof, Fadhilah1 aYusop, Zulkifli0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 July, v. 129, no. 1-2 p.577-586dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-016-1795-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001800164245005800182300001600240520042200256592002800678650002700706650001800733650002000751650001200771650001100783650003700794650003800831650002100869650002000890650000900910650003000919650000900949650002500958650002000983650003101003650002201034700002001056700001801076773010601094852000901200856008201209655001201291IND8308403320221118221744.0181010e198307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND830840332DNAL7 a66238472pmid7 a10.1177/0300985883020004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbott, D.

However, the effects of UV treatment on microbial control and disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation in real municipal drinking water systems are poorly understood. Here, we collected water samples from three real drinking water systems in Beijing and Tianjin to investigate the impacts of UV treatment on microbial control and DBP formation. We employed heterotrophic plate count (HPC), flow cytometry (FCM), quantitative PCR analysis, and high-throughput sequencing to measure microorganisms in the samples. Different trends were observed between HPC and total cell count (measured by FCM), indicating that a single indicator could not reflect the real degree of biological re-growth in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs). A significant increase in the 16S rRNA gene concentration was observed when the UV system was stopped. Besides, the bacterial community composition was similar at the phylum level but differed markedly at the genera level among the three DWDSs. Some chlorine-resistant bacteria, including potential pathogens (e.g., Acinetobacter) showed a high relative abundance when the UV system was turned off. It can be concluded that UV treatment can mitigate microbial re-growth to some extent. Finally, UV treatment had a limited influence on the formation of DBPs, including trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, and nitrogenated DBPs. The findings of this study may help to understand the performance of UV treatment in real drinking water systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abyproducts 3acommunity structure 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3ahaloacetic acids 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3apathogens 3aplate count 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater distribution 3aChina 0aUV treatment 0aBacterial community 0aDisinfection by-products (DBPs) 0aMulti-barrier disinfection 0aMunicipal drinking water systems1 aChen, Zhongyun1 aLi, Simiao1 aLi, Chen1 aLu, Zedong1 aSun, Wenjun0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2020 Jan., v. 87 p.398-410dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2019.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245010200177300001600279520164600295592002801941650002801969650002401997650002402021650001902045650001702064650001302081650001402094650001402108650002202122650002502144650002402169650002102193650001102214651001102225653001702236653001602253653002402269653000802293653001902301653001702320653001602337653002402353653000802377653001902385700003202404700003602436700002002472700003202492700003002524700003002554700002702584700003802611773018002649856008302829852000902912655001202921IND60734123820210926000000.0210926e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073412382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2021.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Herrera, Erick10aMolecular identification of yeasts from the order Trichosporonales causing superficial infections  ap. 119-124.  aThe molecular reclassification of the order Trichosporonales placed the medically relevant Trichosporon species into three genera of the family Trichosporonaceae: Cutaneotrichosporon, Trichosporon, and Apiotrichum. From the clinical and epidemiological standpoint, it is important to identify any species of the family Trichosporonaceae because they present different antifungal susceptibility profiles. In Mexico, little is known about trichosporonosis etiology because the fungi are identified through phenotypic methods.To identify at a molecular level 12 yeast isolates morfologically compatible with Trichosporon, obtained from patients with superficial infections.The yeast isolates were obtained from patients with white piedra, onychomycosis, and hand and foot dermatomycosis, and were identified morphologically and genotypically (sequencing of the IGS1 region and phylogenetic analysis using the Maximum Likelihood Method). The phylogenetic analysis included 40 yeast sequences from the order Trichosporonales and one from Cryptococcus neoformans as outgroup.Based on the molecular analysis, we identified three (25%) Trichosporon inkin isolates, two (16.7%) Trichosporon asteroides, two (16.7%) Cutaneotrichosporon mucoides, and one each (8.3%) of Trichosporon aquatile, Trichosporon asahii, Apiotrichum montevideense, Cutaneotrichosporon cutaneum, and Cutaneotrichosporon jirovecii.The molecular characterization of the isolates showed a broad diversity of species within the order Trichosporonales, particularly among onychomycosis. It is essential to identify these yeasts at the species level to delve into their epidemiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aCutaneotrichosporon 3aTrichosporon asahii 3adermatomycoses 3aepidemiology 3aetiology 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3astatistical analysis 3ataxonomic revisions 3atrichosporonosis 3ayeasts 3aMexico 0aTrichosporon 0aApiotrichum 0aCutaneotrichosporon 0aIGS 0aDermatomycosis 0aTrichosporon 0aApiotrichum 0aCutaneotrichosporon 0aIGS 0aDermatomicosis1 aDuarte-Escalante, Esperanza1 aReyes-Montes, María del Rocío1 aArenas, Roberto1 aAcosta Altamirano, Gustavo,1 aMoreno-Coutiño, Gabriela1 aVite-Garín, Tania Mayela1 aMeza-Robles, Alejandro1 aFrías-De-León, María Guadalupe0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2021 July,  Sept., v. 38, no. 3 p.119-124dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Española de MicologíawJournal:12421x1130-14067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2021.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012800156300002000284520038900304592002800693650002300721650001100744650001400755650001400769650001000783700002100793700001900814700001800833700001800851700001600869700001700885773013600902856007401038852000901112655001201121IND60661054620221118161915.0190827e20150811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066105462DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05166e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, C.

The intrinsic blinking of photoactivatable fluorescent proteins mEos2 and Dendra2 leads to an overcounting error, which constitutes a major obstacle for their use as molecular counting tags. Here, we introduce a kinetic model to describe blinking and show that Dendra2 photobleaches three times faster and blinks seven times less than mEos2, making Dendra2 a better photoactivated localization microscopy tag than mEos2 for molecular counting. The simultaneous activation of multiple molecules is another source of error, but it leads to molecular undercounting instead. We propose a photoactivation scheme that maximally separates the activation of different molecules, thus helping to overcome undercounting. We also present a method that quantifies the total counting error and minimizes it by balancing over- and undercounting. This unique method establishes that Dendra2 is better for counting purposes than mEos2, allowing us to count in vitro up to 200 molecules in a diffraction-limited spot with a bias smaller than 2% and an uncertainty less than 6% within 10 min. Finally, we demonstrate that this counting method can be applied to protein quantification in vivo by counting the bacterial flagellar motor protein FliM fused to Dendra2.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afluorescence 3afluorescent proteins 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amolecular motor proteins 3auncertainty 0asuper-resolution optical microscopy 0asingle molecule counting 0afluorescence blinking1 aShin, Jae Yen1 aLee, Antony1 aBustamante, Carlos0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 23, v. 109, no. 43 p.17436-17441dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12151751093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015200166300001600318500001500334520200500349592002802354650002302382650001602405650001202421650000902433650001602442650001702458650002202475650001902497650001002516650001102526650001502537650001102552650001402563650002902577650001802606650001002624650002002634650001002654650003102664653001302695700002002708700002202728700002502750700001802775700002202793773009402815856008102909852000902990655001202999IND60438835420221120101041.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043883542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-015-2343-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoda, Soichiro14aThe expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, OsCesA7, is directly regulated by a rice transcription factor, OsMYB58/63  ap. 589-600.  a2019-12-06  aMAIN CONCLUSION : A rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, was found to directly upregulate the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 (OsCesA7); in contrast, the Arabidopsis putative orthologs AtMYB58 and AtMYB63 have been shown to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. Although indirect evidence has shown that grass plants are similar to but partially different from dicotyledonous ones in transcriptional regulation of lignocellulose biosynthesis, little is known about the differences. This study showed that a rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, directly upregulated the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 (OsCesA7). Gene co-expression analysis showed that, in rice, OsMYB58/63 and several rice MYB genes were co-expressed with genes encoding lignocellulose biosynthetic enzymes. The expression levels of OsMYB55/61, OsMYB55/61-L, OsMYB58/63, and OsMYB42/85 were commonly found to be high in culm internodes and nodes. All four MYB transcription factors functioned as transcriptional activators in yeast cells. OsMYB58/63 most strongly transactivated the expression of OsCesA7 in rice protoplasts. Moreover, recombinant OsMYB58/63 protein was bound to two distinct cis-regulatory elements, AC-II and SMRE3, in the OsCesA7 promoter. This is in sharp contrast to the role of Arabidopsis orthologs, AtMYB58 and AtMYB63, which had been reported to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. The promoter analysis revealed that AC elements, which are the binding sites for MYB58 and MYB63, were lacking in cellulose and xylan biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis, but present in cellulose, xylan, and lignin biosynthetic genes in rice, implying that the difference of transcriptional regulation between rice and Arabidopsis is due to the distinct composition of promoters. Our results provide a new insight into transcriptional regulation in grass lignocellulose biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose synthase 3aprotoplasts 3agrasses 3arice 3aArabidopsis 3abiosynthesis 3achemical elements 3alignocellulose 3axylan 3ayeasts 3ainternodes 3alignin 3acellulose 3atranscription (genetics) 3abinding sites 3agenes 3atransactivators 3aculms 3agene expression regulation 0aelements1 aKoshiba, Taichi1 aHattori, Takefumi1 aYamaguchi, Masatoshi1 aSuzuki, Shiro1 aUmezawa, Toshiaki0 tPlanta.g2015 Sept., v. 242, no. 3 p.589-600dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2343-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008500167300001600252520127100268592002801539650001201567650001701579650002201596650001501618650001401633650002801647650001401675650001101689650001001700653002801710653001301738653002101751653001701772700002301789700001901812700002101831773011601852856008501968852000902053655001202062IND60625543520221119021728.0210105e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062554352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeunier, Jed10aEffects of oak wilt (Bretziella fagacearum) on post harvest Quercus regeneration  ap. 575-581.  aOak wilt is a serious disease affecting oaks, especially those in the red oak group. Despite concern around a lack of oak regeneration and increasing mortality from oak wilt, there has been little effort to connect the two in relation to common forest management practices to regenerate oak. Oak management commonly includes clearcut harvesting, particularly within lower quality sites where sprouting is a viable regeneration method, but also where oak wilt is most problematic. We found that clearcut harvesting that encompassed pockets of oak wilt infected trees did not facilitate expansion or long-term perpetuation of oak wilt, but rather could serve as a containment mechanism for oak wilt. We found that stumps around 30 cm produced the greatest number of sprouts and that relatively minor differences in stump size determined if a stump was initially viable or never produced sprouts. Strong effects of stump size, and sprouting ability, remained significant drivers of survival (and mortality) over an extended 10-year period. Forest practices for oak on poor sites, such as those we studied, tend to be managed on short rotations which is likely well suited to capturing the maximum sprouting ability and long-term survival of oaks to regenerate stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus 3aclearcutting 3aforest management 3aharvesting 3amortality 3asilvicultural practices 3asprouting 3astumps 3atrees 0aCeratpcystis fagacearum 0aClearcut 0aOak regeneration 0aStump sprout1 aBronson, Dustin R.1 aScanlon, Kyoko1 aGray, Rebecca H.0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 432 p.575-581dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014400175300001600319520147600335592002801811650001501839650003001854650001301884650002901897650001301926650002301939650002701962650002001989650001402009650001002023650001702033650001302050650000702063650001502070650001602085650004302101650001302144650001502157650001002172650002502182650001002207650001902217650001402236653002102250653002502271700002302296700002402319700002302343773012002366856008602486852000902572655001202581IND60773341520221122151853.0220413e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077334152DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2019.16440192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheikh, Gowher Gull10aRumen microflora, fermentation pattern and microbial enzyme activity in sheep fed paddy straw based complete feed fortified with probiotics  ap. 547-558.  aThe use of probiotics for farm animals has increased considerably over the last 25 years. The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotics (Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2 × 10¹⁰ cfu/g + Lactobacillus acidophilus 6 × 10⁹ cfu/g) on the rumen microflora, fermentation pattern and the enzyme activity. A 90 day feeding trial was conducted in the Corriedale sheep which were fed paddy straw based complete feed mixed with probiotics (Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2 × 10¹⁰ cfu/g + Lactobacillus acidophilus 6 × 10⁹ cfu/g). The complete feed without probiotics served as a control. The real-time PCR allowed us to observe the changes in the number of rumen microbes. The mean values of total bacterial, fibrolytic bacteria, fungi and protozoa count irrespective of period were significantly (p < 0.01) higher in probiotic mix supplemented group than in non-supplemented group. With respect to fermentation pattern, Rumen pH, TVFA, total nitrogen and TCA perceptible nitrogen were significantly (p < 0.01) higher in probiotic supplemented group than non-supplemented group. The enzyme activity viz., carboxymethyl cellulose, xylanase, amylase, glucosidase, acetyl esterase and protease were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in probiotic mix supplemented group as compared to non-supplemented group. This study contributes to understand the positive impact of probiotics on rumen microbial count, rumen fermentation parameters and the enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorriedale 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aProtozoa 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamylases 3abiological rhythms 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3afarms 3afermentation 3anitrogen 3apH 3aprobiotics 3aproteinases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3arice straw 3arumen 3arumen microorganisms 3asheep 3atotal nitrogen 3axylanases 0aCorriedale sheep 0afermentation pattern1 aGanai, Abdul Majid1 aAhmad Sheikh, Aasif1 aMir, Danish Masood0 tBiological rhythm research.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 53, no. 4 p.547-558dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2019.16440193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04464naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245018300174300001400357520233100371592002802702650002402730650001702754650001102771650001602782650004302798650001902841650001202860650001302872650001802885650001202903650002302915650002802938650001502966650001002981650001902991650002103010650002103031650002303052650001203075650002703087650001403114650001703128650001603145650001803161650001003179650001403189650001403203650002203217650001103239650001703250650001303267653001803280653002603298653002203324653003203346653000903378653001903387700002503406700002503431700006203456700002303518773011903541856008503660852000903745655001203754IND60557294820221117173825.0180831e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055729482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2016.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassari, Ajit Kumar10aPhytohormone production endowed with antagonistic potential and plant growth promoting abilities of culturable endophytic bacteria isolated from Clerodendrum colebrookianum Walp.  ap. 57-73.  aIn this study, culturable endophytic bacterial isolates obtained from an ethnomedicinal plant Clerodendrum colebrookianum Walp., were assessed for their diversity, in vitro screening for their plant growth promoting (PGP) activities and to use them as inoculant for in vivo PGP activities with biocontrol potential. Totally, 73 isolates were recovered from different tissues of C. colebrookianum were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetically analyzed by using BOX-PCR fingerprinting. Out of 73 isolates, 52 exhibited varying extents of antagonistic potential were selected for screening for various PGP traits. Concerning the PGP activities, the percentage of isolates positive for P-solubilisation, indolic compounds production, siderophore and ammonia production were 84.6, 92.3, 78.8 and 98.0 respectively. All isolates were positive for the production of hydrocyanic acid (HCN) and 86.5%, 84.6% and 90.3% of isolates showed significant cellulase, amylase and protease production respectively. Further, the top 10 bacterial isolates based on a bonitur scale with multiple PGP activities were screened for root surface colonization and biofilm formation ability. Out of selected 10 isolates, 9 showed significant potential for root surface colonization on tomato roots. Isolate BPSAC6 identified as Bacillus sp. was most efficient in biofilm formation as assessed with respect to the intensity of crystal violet, which further showed their potential to withstand various biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, Bacillus sp. strain BPSAC6 showed a significant increase in shoot and root height as well as fresh weight after 45 and 60 d of inoculation with tomato seedlings. Additionally, biosynthetic potential of antagonistic isolate was detection by using PKSI, PKSII and NRPS biosynthetic genes. Two isolates Pseudomonas psychrotolerans and Labrys wisconsinensis were reported first time as an endophyte. At last, first time an endophytic bacterial strain Bacillus sp. BPSAC6 was reported to produce altogether three phytohormones (IAA, Kinetin and 6-Benzyladenine). This study is the first report that bacteria isolated from C. colebrookianum has biocontrol as well as PGP abilities endowed with phytohormones production and can be used for the preparation of bioinoculant for plant growth promotion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aClerodendrum 3aLabrys 3aPseudomonas 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aabiotic stress 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abenzyladenine 3abiofilm 3abiological control 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendophytes 3agenes 3agentian violet 3agrowth promotion 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aindole acetic acid 3akinetin 3amicrobial colonization 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3aproteinases 3aribosomal RNA 3aroots 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis 3ashoots 3asiderophores 3atomatoes 0a16S rRNA gene 0aAntagonistic activity 0aBiofilm formation 0aClerodendrum colebrookianum 0aHPLC 0aPGP activities1 aMishra, Vineet Kumar1 aLeo, Vincent Vineeth1 aGupta, Vijai Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1565-59181 aSingh, Bhim Pratap0 tMicrobiological research.g2016 Dec., v. 193 p.57-73dElsevier GmbHaElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2016.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009800170300001800268520107200286592002801358650001301386650001101399650002601410650002301436650003301459650001201492650000901504650001201513650001601525650001901541650000901560653003101569653001701600653001901617653000901636653001601645653002101661700001901682773010201701856008701803852000901890655001201899IND60571017420221118031731.0190402e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057101742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondor, Anett10aRelationships between surface energy analysis and functional characteristics of dairy powders  ap. 1155-1162.  aSurface energetics of demineralised whey (DMW), skimmed milk (SMP), phosphocasein (PCN) and infant milk formula (IMF) powders were determined by inverse gas chromatography (IGC). All four milk powders were amphoteric in nature with the dispersive (apolar) component of surface energy dominating the specific (polar) contribution. PCN and IMF had the highest and lowest extent of surface heterogeneity, respectively. PCN also demonstrated the poorest functional properties of the powders examined. In contrast, IMF had excellent flow and rehydration properties. Thermodynamic work of cohesion was highest in PCN and may have contributed to inadequate rehydration behaviour. Glass transition temperature of IMF powder, determined by IGC, suggested a surface dominated by lactose. Surface heterogeneity provided a better indicator of functional behaviour than total surface energy. IGC is a useful complementary technique for chemical and structural analysis of milk powders and allows improved insight into the contribution of surface and bulk factors to functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3aenergy 3afunctional properties 3agas chromatography 3aglass transition temperature 3alactose 3amilk 3apowders 3arehydration 3athermodynamics 3awhey 0aInverse gas chromatography 0aMilk powders 0aSurface energy 0aFlow 0aRehydration 0aGlass transition1 aHogan, Sean A.0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 237 p.1155-1162dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007000168300001600238520095300254592002801207650002401235650002301259650002201282650002101304650001501325650001401340650003901354700001901393700002001412700002401432700002501456773012801481856008201609852000901691655001201700IND60089546320221120181642.0141102e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008954632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaufmann, Doris10aRegulation and spatial organization of PCNA in Trypanosoma brucei  ap. 698-702.  aAs in most eukaryotic cells, replication is regulated by a conserved group of proteins in the early-diverged parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Only a few components of the replication machinery have been described in this parasite and regulation, sub-nuclear localization and timing of replication are not well understood. We characterized the proliferating cell nuclear antigen in T. brucei (TbPCNA) to establish a spatial and temporal marker for replication. Interestingly, PCNA distribution and regulation is different compared to the closely related parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani. TbPCNA foci are clearly detectable during S phase of the cell cycle but in contrast to T. cruzi they are not preferentially located at the nuclear periphery. Furthermore, PCNA seems to be degraded when cells enter G2 phase in T. brucei suggesting different modes of replication regulation or functions of PCNA in these closely related eukaryotes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania donovani 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aeukaryotic cells 3ainterphase 3aparasites 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen1 aGassen, Alwine1 aMaiser, Andreas1 aLeonhardt, Heinrich1 aJanzen, Christian J.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 419, no. 4 p.698-702dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007000174300001400244520057600258592002800834650001400862650000800876650002100884650001200905650001600917650001200933650001100945650002200956650002200978650001101000650002201011650001901033653002201052653002501074653001201099653002201111653001601133700002201149700002301171700002701194700001901221700002201240700001801262773011801280856008501398852000901483655001201492IND60535496120221121044403.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053549612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGołacki, Krzysztof10aStudies on Stress Relaxation Process in Biodegradable Starch Film  ap. 80-86.  aIn the paper the effects of keratin and polyvinyl alcohol additives on the stress relaxation course in thermoplastic starch film were presented.

However, providing these complex interventions in rural areas presents challenges. Internet‐based and telephone‐based caregiver support can potentially expand access to effective support. METHODS: We designed a multisite intervention for caregivers of veterans with dementia. Caregivers were stratified into 2 cohorts based on their use or nonuse of the Internet. Each cohort was then randomized to either a technology or telephone‐delivered support group within each cohort. All groups had a care manager who monitored the 4‐ to 6‐month multicomponent program of assessments, educational content, and skills training. Caregiver outcome measures included burden, anticipatory grief, depression, family conflict, and a desire to institutionalize the care recipient. RESULTS: The majority of comparative effectiveness outcomes were not different between caregivers receiving technology interventions versus those receiving telephone‐delivered support. This was true for the 68% of caregivers using home Internet and the 32% nonusers, as well as the 53% rural versus 47% urban caregivers. For experienced Internet users, a meaningful difference in the Marwit Grief Inventory was noted for caregivers receiving Internet versus telephone support, particularly for the Isolation Subscale. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of using a variety of modalities to deliver caregiver support to a group of largely older, rural, spousal caregivers of veterans with dementia. The potential for reducing isolation for caregivers capable of receiving this intervention through the Internet is a promising finding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acaregivers 3adementia 3ainventories 3arural areas 3arural health 3atelephones 3aveterans1 aDaniel, Candice1 aLuptak, Marilyn1 aGrant, Marren1 aKilian, Shirley1 aRupper, Randall W.0 tJournal of rural health.g2017 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.305-313dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44673x0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.121953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015900166300001600325520123200341592002801573650002101601650002501622650001301647650002501660650002701685650002301712650001601735650001201751650001601763650001101779650001201790650001301802650001401815650001501829650002401844650002001868650001301888650000901901651001001910653000801920653002601928653001201954653000901966653001201975653002201987700001502009700001502024773012002039856008602159852000902245655001202254IND60773341720221123034603.0220413e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077334172DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2019.16852152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArun, A.S.10aComparative assessment of adaptive capabilities of wild and captive Indian sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) based on rhythmic changes in biochemical response  ap. 569-579.  aThe study is to establish the adaptive capabilities of wild and captive Indian Sloth Bear based on changes in the biochemical responses influenced by the gender, age and habitat. The free-ranging and captive sloth bears that were residing in Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre, Bangalore, Karnataka, India were chosen for this study. An analysis of serum biochemical variables like glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), albumin, total protein (TP), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase/alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase (SGPT/ALT), serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT/AST), urea, alkaline phosphatase, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) was determined in Indian sloth bear. The study was conducted during the years 2017 and 2018 in the state of Karnataka, India. Statistically, no difference was found in the biochemical variables between the sexes. Instead, age and habitat-related significant differences were found in certain biochemical variables like cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, urea and AST. The findings of this analysis serve as a reference to assess the health and physiological status of Indian sloth bear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelursus ursinus 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiological rhythms 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3agender 3aglucose 3ahabitats 3amagnesium 3aphosphorus 3aphysiological state 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3aurea 3aIndia 0aAge 0abiochemical variables 0acaptive 0awild 0ahabitat 0aIndian sloth bear1 aSejian, V.1 aBhatta, R.0 tBiological rhythm research.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 53, no. 4 p.569-579dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2019.16852153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009100166300001800257520153100275592002801806596009801834596009801932650004402030650002202074650001602096650002402112650002202136700001902158700001502177700001302192700005402205700001302259700001902272700005502291773012002346856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60787671320221118042605.0220809e20220728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078767132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c009582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yunpeng10aStructure Evolution of Oriented Poly(l-lactic acid) Ultrathin Films during Deformation  ap. 6633-6643.  aPoly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) ultrathin films with a highly oriented chain-fold lamellar structure in its α phase with a 10/3 helical chain conformation were prepared by a melt-draw technique. The structure evolution of the oriented α PLLA films during deformation along the original chain direction was studied by electron microscopy combined with electron diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results clearly illustrate that further deformation always enhances the orientation of chain segments in amorphous regions regardless of the draw ratio, which reduces slightly after thermal annealing, whereas the orientation status of chains in the crystalline phase is less affected owing to their already perfect alignments. Moreover, the combined results of electron diffraction and FTIR demonstrate that stretching the oriented thin film up to a draw ratio of λ = 1.5 reduces the crystallinity of α PLLA due to the distortion of pre-existing crystals and transition of 10/3 helical chains into 3/1 ones of some chain segments. The packing of 3/1 helical chains characteristic of the β form PLLA into an ordered crystal unit cell is, however, not realized even after thermal annealing. Further stretching up to λ = 2 results in the formation of β crystals, which are perfected by annealing at 150 °C but melt and recrystallize into oriented α crystals again after annealing at 175 °C. These results clearly shed more light on the strain-induced α-β transition of oriented PLLA thin films.  aPublisher supplied data  a22022501cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a52027804cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acrystal structure 3adeformation 3aelectron microscopy 3afilms (materials)1 aWang, Shaojuan1 aZhang, Hao1 aHu, Jian1 aLiu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7688-60101 aXin, Rui1 aSong, Chunfeng1 aYan, Shouke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1627-341X0 tMacromolecules.g2022 July 28, v. 55, no. 15 p.6633-6643dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c009583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013300170300001600303500001500319520104500334592002801379650001201407650002401419650001501443650001401458650001001472650001901482650000901501650002001510650001101530650001901541650001201560653002601572700001901598700001901617700001901636773010201655856008101757852000901838655001201847IND60584442320221118184016.0171024e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058444232DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452170501502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrivalikhin, A.

Based on the external morphological characteristics of sexual glands of 17 fishes, the most frequent types of the structure of bisexual gonads are described. Histological analysis shows the absence of differences in the composition and condition of oocytes in the left and right-paired ovaries, and the testes and ovaries of each individual are at the same maturity stage. In the ovigerous lamellae of ovaries in the areas adjacent to testes the zones of oocyte resorption are observed. These zones are located exclusively near the joining of the female and male parts of the gonads. The development of ovaries and testes of bisexual gonads is similar to that in the majority of normally maturing males and females collected during the same period. The occurrence of hermaphrodites is 0.0003–0.0016% from the total number of investigated exemplars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoocytes 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3aresorption 3ahistology 3amales 3amaturity stage 3afish 3ahermaphroditism 3atestes 3aanimal ovaries 3afemales 0aTheragra chalcogramma1 aZhukova, K.

Increasing glucose concentration from 1 to 7% in the growth medium, though improved the phosphorus (P) solubilization significantly but each fungal strain preferred different optimum carbon concentrations for mediating solubilization of different P sources. The two fungi employed different mechanisms to reduce medium pH for release of P from TCP, AP and FP. However, URP was solubilized solely through fungal production of citric, succinic, propionic, malic and acetic acid. A linear increase in citric acid production with increasing carbon concentration was recorded during FP solubilization by T. harzianum. The cell free culture filtrate of A. niger detected high phytase and low acid phosphatase activity titre whereas results were vice versa for T. harzianum. Both the fungal strains possessed plant growth promoting attributes such as auxin and sidreophore production and could solubilize Zn. In hydroponic system (with 60mM of sodium chloride concentration), supplementation with culture filtrate from each fungal strain increased the shoot growth of wheat seedlings significantly compared to non culture filtrate control. Use of A.niger as bio-inoculant could be a sustainable approach to improve soil P availability, promote plant growth and alleviate adverse effect of salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aacetic acid 3aacid phosphatase 3aadverse effects 3aaluminum phosphate 3aauxins 3acarbon 3acell free system 3acitric acid 3aculture filtrates 3aculture media 3aferric phosphate 3afungi 3aglucose 3ahydroponics 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3aplant growth 3arock phosphate 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3asoil 3asolubilization 3atricalcium phosphate 3awheat 3azinc 0aFungi 0aPhosphate dissolution 0aPlant growth promotion 0aSalt stress0 tMicrobiological research.g2016 Dec., v. 193 p.94-102dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2016.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245008700168300001600255520091800271592002801189650001301217650001301230650002401243650003101267650001801298650001901316650001901335650001901354650002601373650001101399650002001410650003401430650001101464653003001475653004001505653001701545653002901562700001501591700001701606700001901623700001701642773009001659856008901749852000901838655001201847IND60605080320221121011354.0180720e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060508032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aA, Nuona10aStarch/polylactide sustainable composites: Interface tailoring with graphene oxide  ap. 247-254.  aThe high production cost of polylactide (PLA) can be effectively reduced by simply mixing with starch, unfortunately a trade-off of its mechanical properties. In this paper, we reported a new strategy in which graphene oxide (GO) was used as a compatibilizer to bridge PLA and starch. The native starch was first cationized and then encapsulated with GO by electrostatic force between the negatively charged GO and the positively charged cationic starch. The encapsulating GO was reduced by the quaternary ammonium ions on the cationic starch, which converted the surface of the starch from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Due to the amphipathicity approximation between PLA and starch, a good dispersion as well as a strong interfacial adhesion was achieved. The PLA composite reinforced with GO encapsulated starch exhibited much higher yield strength than that of pure PLA, increasing from 36.64MPa up to 41.40MPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aammonium 3acomposite materials 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amechanical properties 3amixing 3apolylactic acid 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3astarch 0aA.

Riddell, then a leading multidisciplinary scientist in Louisiana, validly published 34 binomials and trinomials of vascular plants from Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas. Most of these names were first published in 1852 in a checklist of Louisiana plants, but lacked descriptions and hence were not then validly published. This paper has been previously noted by several biologists. The following year, Riddell published a paper in the same journal providing brief descriptions of all of these supposedly undescribed plants. Unfortunately, this paper with the valid publication of these names has rarely been noted, as the journal is not widely available in botanical libraries. The few names so noted are often attributed to the supposed publishing author rather than to Riddell, who alone should be credited as the author for the new taxa. The genera of flowering plants in which new species or varieties are described are listed alphabetically as follows: Acalypha, Campanula, Cucumis, Dicliptera, Eriogonum, Lysimachia, Melothria, Physalis, Plantago, Polygonum, Potamogeton, Quercus, Sagittaria, and Urtica. The protologue of each of the published names is included and, for those that we could identify, synonymy is listed. For those species which we were unable to identify, we have included the protologues as a convenience to those not having access to the 1853 publication. We hope others may have the floristic or monographic knowledge to identify those names we have been unable to.  aPublisher supplied data 0aJohn L.

In addition, circadian transcriptomic studies have revealed that there are hundreds of genes with rhythmic expression patterns in skeletal muscle, and these expression patterns are important for the maintenance of the physiological functions of skeletal muscle. Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal skeletal muscle circadian rhythms disrupt the metabolism of glucose, lipids, and amino acids, and increase the risk of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. This review aims to provide a more detailed overview of the skeletal muscle clock and its relationship with metabolism based on the current state of knowledge. We first reviewed the research being done on the skeletal muscle clock and the regulation mechanism of the circadian rhythm. With the in-depth study of skeletal muscle clock control genes (CCGs), it has been found that many genes are involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle energy metabolism. On this basis, we further discussed the evidence on how circadian genes in skeletal muscle regulate glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism. This will help provide valuable insights into the relationship between metabolic diseases and the skeletal muscle clock.  aThis work was supported by the “13th five year” plan of Hunan province education sciences (Project No. XJK19BTW015).  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No. XJK18CTW004 3acircadian rhythm 3adiabetes 3aenergy metabolism 3aglucose 3alipids 3aobesity 3aprotein metabolism 3aresearch 3arisk 3askeletal muscle 3atranscriptomics 0acircadian clock 0ametabolism 0aenergy substance1 aChen, Wei0 tBiological rhythm research.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 53, no. 4 p.580-591dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2020.18160373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010300173300001400276520083300290592002801123650002101151650001801172650000901190650000901199650000901208650001601217650001101233653001001244653001401254653001601268653001701284653002801301653002301329700002501352700002201377700002401399700002001423773010401443856008501547852000901632655001201641IND60557295120221122040352.0180831e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055729512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2016.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelvydas, Vytautas10aFormation of self-organized periodic patterns around yeasts secreting a precursor of a red pigment  ap. 87-93.  aFormation of self-organized regular patterns (Liesegang patterns) due to reaction-diffusion process in the gel medium and related to vital activity of yeasts is presented.

Chilling stress significantly affected the grain characteristics and physicochemical properties of rice starches, except for those of two varieties, NJ 9108 and ZD 18. In the other four rice cultivars subjected to chilling stress, the content of medium, and large sized granules showed a decrease, and an increase, respectively. Amylose content increased as a result of chilling stress, thereby resulting in starch with a lower swelling power, water solubility, and higher retrogradation enthalpy and gelatinization temperature. Chilling stress led to deterioration of cooked rice quality as determined by the pasting properties of starch.

In the summer of 2019, onions with soft rot were found in commercial fields in Hokkaido, the northern island in Japan. Diseased onion showed chlorosis, maceration of leaves, and rotted bulbs. We sampled some diseased onions and isolated three independent isolations (NAONI191, NAONI192, and NAONI193) from infected bulbs on LB medium. These strains were identified as Pectobacterium wasabiae based on their inability to grow at 37°C and their ability to utilize raffinose and lactose. These bacterial strains were gram-negative, rod-shaped, N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase, gelatin liquefaction. The bacterium was positive for O-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase, gelatin liquefaction, and acid production from D-galactose, lactose, melibiose, raffinose, citrate, and trehalose. The bacterium was negative for indole production and acid production from maltose, α-methyl-D-glucoside, sorbitol, D-arabitol, inositol, inulin, and melezitose. All the strains exhibited pectolytic activity on potato slices. DNA from these strains yielded a single size amplicon with the primer set of PhF/PhR for P. wasabiae (De Boer et al. 2012) by PCR. However, DNA from these strains did not yield the expected amplicon with the primer set of BR1f/L1r for P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense (Duarte et al. 2004) and Eca1f/Eca2r for P. atrosepticum (De Boer and Ward 1995) by PCR. The sequence analysis of 16S rDNA (LC597917 to LC597919) showed more than 98% identities to P. wasabiae strains (e.g., HAFL01 in Switzerland) by BLAST analysis. In addition, multilocus sequence analysis (Ma et al. 2007) was performed by MEGA6.06 using concatenated DNA sequences of seven housekeeping genes (aconitate hydratase [acnA, LC597925 to LC597927], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A [gapA, LC597972 to LC597974], isocitrate dehydrogenase [icdA, LC597998 to LC598000], malate dehydrogenase [mdh, LC598024 to LC598026], mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase [mtlD, LC598050 to LC598052], glucose-6-phosphate isomerase [pgi, LC598076 to LC598078], and gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase [proA, LC598099 to LC598101]), and all clustered into a clade containing other confirmed strains of P. wasabiae. As a result, these three strains shared high identity with each other (>98%, E-values showed 0). The clade containing these three strains was consistently placed in a larger clade with the other P. wasabiae with 100% bootstrap support for its separation from other Pectobacterium species available in GenBank when the consensus tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. Pathogenicity of these strains against onion (cv. ‘Hayate’) was confirmed by the field experiments with 5-weeks-growth plants sprayed with bacterial suspension (1 × 10⁷ CFU/ml), resulting in soft rot on the plants about 4 weeks after inoculation, whereas water-inoculated plants remained symptomless. Strains reisolated from the artificially diseased stems were confirmed as P. wasabiae using the methods as biochemical characterization and multiple genetic analyses. Based on the disease symptoms and the cultural, molecular, and pathological features of the strains, we conclude that the soft rot symptoms of onion in Hokkaido in 2019 were caused by P. wasabiae. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. wasabiae as the soft rot disease agent of onion in Japan.  aPublisher supplied data  a01022CcProject of the NARO Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution (Research program on development of innovative technology) 3aAllium cepa 3aJapan 3aPectobacterium wasabiae 3aaconitate hydratase 3aarabitol 3abacteria 3achlorosis 3acitrates 3agalactose 3agelatin 3aglucose-6-phosphate isomerase 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aindoles 3ainositols 3ainulin 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3alactose 3aliquefaction 3amaceration 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amaltose 3amelezitose 3amelibiose 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aonions 3apathogenicity 3aphosphates 3apotatoes 3araffinose 3asorbitol 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3atrehalose 3aSwitzerland 0aprokaryotes 0aPectobacterium 0asoft rot 0aonion 0amolecular phylogenetic analysis 0aphenotype1 aNakayama, Takato1 aOhki, Takehiro1 aMaoka, Tetsuo0 tPlant disease.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 105, no. 8 p.2238-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0082-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245007700176300001600253520148700269536026701756592002802023596001102051650001502062650002302077650001402100650001102114650001902125650001302144650001602157653001502173653001602188653001602204653002602220653002702246700002502273700002002298700002302318700002602341700001902367700002202386773012002408856008602528852000902614655001202623IND60773342020221122234626.0220413e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077334202DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2020.18220532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvansová, Katarína14aThe effect of chronotype and time of assessment on cognitive performance  ap. 608-627.  aStandard cognitive measures are often applied at various times of the day to assess cognitive deficits in patients with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, irrespective of their chronotype. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the subjectively nonpreferred time of an assessment might be a crucial factor in persons with extreme chronotypes. We compared morning (08:00) and evening (20:00) cognitive performance in extreme morning, extreme evening, and intermediate chronotypes determined by the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, supported by actigraphy and peripheral temperature measurement. The assessment sessions were performed in pseudorandom order over two consecutive weekend days. We administered the commonly used test battery for neurocognitive assessment comprised of tasks aimed mainly at attention, processing speed, working memory, and declarative memory. The time of assessment influenced the declarative memory measures, whereas the chronotype-specific differences occurred only in the Stroop colour-naming subtest aimed at processing speed. The observed effects should be considered in routine clinical practice because they might cause misrepresentation of the results obtained during improperly timed cognitive assessment. Our results also point towards similarity of doves and owls in contrast to larks in cognitive performance, suggesting that early morning assessments should also be considered in cases of intermediate chronotypes.  aThis study was supported mainly by the project of the Charles University Grant Agency number 138217, and partially by the project Nr.

The imposed schedule and confinement led to extensive use of digital media and rise in sedentary activity drastically. The escalated duration of screen exposure causes disruption in sleep behavior. An online survey was conducted to comprehend the effect of lockdown on sleep behavior and screen exposure time on school children. Screen exposure time involved with various electronic gadgets was also analyzed. It was observed that the social jet lag and sleep debt were significantly less during lockdown than before it. Inertia during lockdown significantly increased. The difference between screen exposure time on weekdays before lockdown and weekends during lockdown was identified to be the highest. Three clusters based on sleep behavior and duration of screen time were identified of which Cluster 2 revealed simultaneous existence of high sleep duration and screen time. These baseline data on sleep parameters and duration of exposure to the screen will help us in devising approaches to mitigate the evident disruption this unprecedented phase has brought about.  aThe funding for this work has been provided from SVMCM (Swami Vivekananda Merit Cum Means fellowship, Government of West Bengal (IN) received by Koumi Dutta.Personal Research Grant provided by University of Kalyani to Dr. Subhashis Sahu.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3abiological rhythms 3aexposure duration 3aobservational studies 3aresearch 3asleep deprivation 3asurveys 0aLockdown 0asleep behavior 0ascreen exposure time 0aschool children 0acircadian realignment1 aMukherjee, Ruchira1 aSen, Devashish1 aSahu, Subhashis0 tBiological rhythm research.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 53, no. 4 p.628-639dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2020.18252843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245011800170300001600288520106200304592002801366650001801394650002101412650001301433650002401446650001301470650001501483653002601498653001801524653002301542653002001565700001201585700001901597700002201616700001501638773009001653856008901743852000901832655001201841IND60605080720221120224941.0180720e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060508072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.11.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Han10aImproved fracture toughness and integrated damage sensing capability by spray coated CNTs on carbon fibre prepreg  ap. 102-110.  aThe development of a hierarchically engineered micro-nano hybrid composite system is described. A spray coating technique has been utilized as an effective way to deposit carbon nanotubes (CNTs) onto carbon fibre prepregs with good control of network formation and the potential for localization. Compared to more traditional approaches of introducing CNTs into epoxy matrices for enhancing composite properties, this technique has benefits in terms of its simplicity and versatility, as well as the potential for industrial scale-up. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated by the extremely low CNT loading (0.047wt.%) needed to significantly increase the Mode-I fracture toughness of the carbon fibre laminates by about 50%, which is so far the largest reported improvement for such extremely low concentrations of non-functionalized CNTs. In-situ damage sensing has also been presented for the monitoring of structural health of these nano-engineered composite laminates upon loading, and a systematic analysis of sensing signals is performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3amonitoring 0aB.

This work was purposed to study the differences of gene expression at different oxygen supply conditions in Bacillus natto. The differences of fermentation characteristics, gene expression related to MK-7 biosynthesis, spore and biofilm formation were analyzed. The yield of MK-7 increased by two fold under high oxygen supply condition of 200 rpm. Further transcriptome analysis indicated that most of the enzymes in MK-7 biosynthesis pathway were also up-regulated. Moreover, glycerol kinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and phosphofructokinase in glycolysis pathway were all up-regulated indicating that high oxygen supply can increase the consumption of substrate glycerol. Meanwhile, menD, encoded the rate-limiting enzyme in the MK pathway, was obviously up-regulated by 3.49-fold while most of the enzymes related to spore formation were down regulated at 200 rpm. Besides, superoxide dismutase (SOD2), catalase (CAT), hydroperoxide reductase (AhpF) and DNA-binding protein MrgA in the antioxidant defense system were up-regulated, while superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were down-regulated. These results could contribute to a better understanding for the effect of oxygen on the MK-7 production in Bacillus natto, and further analyze the molecular regulation mechanism of MK-7 biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis var. natto 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aantioxidant activity 3abiofilm 3abiosynthesis 3acardiovascular diseases 3acatalase 3acoagulation 3afermentation 3afood research 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3agene expression 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglycerol 3aglycerol kinase 3aglycolysis 3amenaquinones 3aosteoporosis 3aoxygen 3aphosphofructokinases 3aspores 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscriptomics 0aMenaquinone-7 0aBacillus natto 0aTranscriptome 0aOxygen 0aVitamin K2 0aRNA-seq1 aZhu, Siyu1 aLu, Jianyao1 aHu, Xuechao1 aRen, Lujing0 tFood research international.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.109700-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1097003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013400172300001600306520097100322592002801293650001301321650001501334650002701349650002401376650001801400650001101418650001001429650001301439650002201452650001601474653002601490653001201516653001501528653003101543700001901574773008901593856008901682852000901771655001201780IND60605080820221120224930.0180720e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060508082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKratz, James10aVacuum-bag-only co-bonding prepreg skins to aramid honeycomb core.

The pressure response was measured throughout the vacuum hold and elevated temperature processing stages of both oven and autoclave manufacturing. The elevated temperature processing measurements validated the honeycomb core pressure model presented in Part I, confirming that gas flow primarily occurs through the bag-side skin in semi-infinite panels. Aramid core panels showed much higher honeycomb core pressures than aluminum cores during elevated temperature processing. Higher core pressures during processing led to more gas flow and as a result, cured skins with interconnected porosity. The best sealed aramid core honeycomb skins were processed under one atmosphere of positive pressure with a vented vacuum bag, avoiding the continuous extraction of gas through the skins by the vacuum pump while the resin was highly mobile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aautoclaves 3acombs (social insects) 3acomposite materials 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aovens 3aporosity 3aprocessing stages 3atemperature 0aD.

Herein, creep and recovery behaviors of polystyrene (PS) composites filled with various loadings of chemically reduced graphene oxide (CRGO) were investigated at different environment temperatures. As expected, incorporation of CRGO into PS polymer increases the thermal stability, glass transition temperature and elastic modulus, although the tensile strength of the composite has a slight decrease. It was found that the creep deformation and strain rate of PS polymer reduce with decreasing temperature and with increasing loading of CRGO. A significant improvement in the recovered strain of PS was also obtained after the presence of CRGO.

Light emitting diodes are characterized by a high electricity-to-light yield, strength, a long lifetime, to ability to use a direct current power source, an almost-complete recycling rate, and a lack of mercury. Irrespective of the number of LEDs, we showed that the decontamination efficiency associated with removing airborne T2 bacteriophage viruses resulted from both the photocatalytic activity and the passive filtration effect of the TiO₂/β-SiC solid alveolar foams. A high photocatalytic filtration efficiency was observed with 56 LEDs and a logarithmic abatement of 3 was achieved for 60 min of run time, with an apparent time constant of 11.0 min after correcting for the natural decay of the bioaerosol. The pure filtration effect corresponded to a logarithmic abatement of 1, with an apparent time constant of 43.1 min. The interest in using 56 LEDs vs. 40 LEDs was highlighted in terms of the logarithmic abatement as well as energy effectiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aairborne microorganisms 3abacteriophages 3abioaerosols 3adecontamination 3aenergy 3afiltration 3afoams 3airradiation 3alight emitting diodes 3amercury 3aphotocatalysis 3arecycling 3atitanium dioxide1 aCarré, Gaëlle1 aKeller, Valérie1 aAndré, Philippe,1 aKeller, Nicolas0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2018 Feb., v. 229, no. 2 p.29-29dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3676-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001600295520126500311592002801576650001401604650001701618650001901635650001701654650002101671650001101692650002401703650001501727650002301742650004301765650001501808700001501823700001701838700001401855700001801869700001501887700001801902700001301920773012801933856008202061852000902143655001202152IND60089547020221120022129.0141102e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008954702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xin-xing10aCharacterization of cancer stem-like cells derived from a side population of a human gallbladder carcinoma cell line, SGC-996  ap. 728-734.  aThe cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis proposes that CSCs, which can renew themselves proliferate infinitely, and escape chemotherapy, become the root of recurrence and metastasis. Previous studies have verified that side population (SP) cells, characterized by their ability to efflux lipophilic substrate Hoechst 33342, to share many characteristics of CSCs in multiplying solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to sort SP cells from a human gallbladder carcinoma cell line, SGC-996 and to preliminarily identify the biological characteristics of SP cells from the cell line. Using flow cytometry we effectively sorted SP cells from the cell line SGC-996. SP cells not only displayed higher proliferative, stronger clonal-generating, more migratory and more invasive capacities, but showed stronger resistance. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrated that SP cells were more tumorigenic than non-SP counterparts in vivo. Real-time PCR analysis and immunocytochemistry showed that the expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) was significantly higher in SP cells. Hence, these results collectively suggest that SP cells are progenitor/stem-like cells and ABCG2 might be a candidate marker for SP cells in human gallbladder cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3adrug therapy 3aflow cytometry 3agall bladder 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ametastasis 3amigratory behavior 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells1 aWang, Jian1 aWang, Hao-lu1 aWang, Wei1 aYin, Xiao-bin1 aLi, Qi-wei1 aChen, Yu-ying1 aYi, Jing0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 419, no. 4 p.728-734dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245009200167300001600259520115900275592002801434650002901462650001901491650001901510650001801529650002301547650000701570650001301577650001501590650001301605650001301618650002101631650002501652650002001677653001801697653001301715653002101728653000701749653002901756653001301785700001301798700002301811700001701834773010601851856008801957852000902045655001202054IND60597136820221118234755.0190705e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059713682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Baile14aThe sorption kinetics and isotherms of sulfamethoxazole with polyethylene microplastics  ap. 191-196.  aMicroplastics and sulfamethoxazole coexist ubiquitously in the marine environment, and microplastics tend to sorb organic pollutants from the surrounding environment. Here, the sorption kinetics and isotherms of sulfamethoxazole on polyethylene (PE) microplastics closely fitted a pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.98) and linear model (R2 = 0.99), respectively, indicating that the sorption process was partition-dominant interaction. The main binding mechanism was possibly the van der Waals interaction for hydrophilic sulfamethoxazole onto hydrophobic PE microplastics. The effects of pH, dissolved organic matter and salinity on sorption behavior were also studied. The sorption behavior of sulfamethoxazole on PE microplastics was not significantly influenced by pH and salinity, probably because the electrostatic repulsion played a minor role. In addition, the negligible effect of dissolved organic matter was attributed to the greater affinity of sulfamethoxazole to PE microplastics than to dissolved organic matter. Our results demonstrated that PE microplastics may serve as a carrier for sulfamethoxazole in the aquatic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved organic matter 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alinear models 3amarine environment 3apH 3aplastics 3apollutants 3asalinity 3asorption 3asulfamethoxazole 3avan der Waals forces 3awater pollution 0aMicroplastics 0aSorption 0aSulfamethoxazole 0apH 0aDissolved organic matter 0aSalinity1 aLiu, Fei1 aBrookes, Philip C.1 aXu, Jianming0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 June, v. 131 p.191-196dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014900170300001600319520123700335592002801572650001501600650001301615650002301628650001701651650002201668650002001690650002401710650002501734650001601759650001301775650001201788650001301800650001901813653001201832653001901844653001401863653001301877653001501890700001801905773012001923856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60535497320221121104507.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053549732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.12.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWasiak, Andrzej14aThe Effects of Energy Contributions into Subsidiary Processes on Energetic Efficiency of Biomass Plantation Supplying Biofuel Production System  ap. 292-300.  aA number of technologies of biofuel production from various biomass crops are already in use, and many studies on new ones are carried out. Biomass production, like any other production processes, involves a number of necessary processes that facilitate subsequent production steps. Those subsidiary processes (e.g. tillage or logistic operations) are connected with consumption of energy. It is therefore important to assure that the sum of energy inputs into those technological steps does not exceed the energy output from the system. Obviously, large energy gain is desired. The paper is devoted to the estimation of energy inputs made into the subsidiary processes occurring in the agricultural subsystems in which various topological structures of plantations as well as for various technologies of tillage, and different requirements for transportation are allowed. Mathematical model describing above mentioned dependencies is derived, and appropriate algorithm elaborated for numerical computations, that have been performed for rapeseed plantations. The results demonstrate evident effects of the choices of technology, and organization of work onto efficiency of plantation as measured by EROEI - type indicator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3aenergy crops 3aenergy efficiency 3afuel production 3amathematical models 3aorganization of work 3aplantations 3arapeseed 3atillage 3atopology 3atransportation 0abiofuel 0aenergy balance 0amodelling 0arapeseed 0abiodiesel.1 aOrynycz, Olga0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 7 p.292-300dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.12.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016400167300001600331520087900347592002801226650002501254650002401279650003101303650002001334650003101354650001001385650001101395650002001406650002001426650002101446650002201467650002401489650001601513650003601529650003201565700002001597700001601617700001801633700001801651700001801669773012801687856008201815852000901897655001201906IND60089547120221120022134.0141102e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008954712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sun Hong10aInhibition of LPS binding to MD-2 co-receptor for suppressing TLR4-mediated expression of inflammatory cytokine by 1-dehydro-10-gingerdione from dietary ginger  ap. 735-740.  aMyeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) is a co-receptor of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) for innate immunity. Here, we delineated a new mechanism of 1-dehydro-10-gingerdione (1D10G), one of pungent isolates from ginger (Zingiber officinale), in the suppression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced gene expression of inflammatory cytokines. 1D10G inhibited LPS binding to MD-2 with higher affinity than gingerol and shogaol from dietary ginger. Moreover, 1D10G down-regulated TLR4-mediated expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or activating protein 1 (AP1)-target genes such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β, as well as those of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-target IFN-β gene and IFN-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10) in LPS-activated macrophages.

The aim was to use cellulose acetate as matrix since it is readily soluble and more flexible compared with cellulose. Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) was selected as the reinforcement material. Cellulose acetate was dissolved for solution impregnation of the fibers. Plasticized cellulose composites were prepared by addition of tributyl citrate (TBC) to cellulose acetate solutions prior to fiber impregnation. Composites were then compression molded for compaction and fabrication of the composites. The surface morphology, thermal stability and mechanical properties of the kenaf-cellulose acetate composites were characterized. Thermal stability of the composites was limited by evaporation of moisture and TBC, followed by elimination of acetic acid for cellulose acetate. Scanning electron microscopy provided a morphological examination of the composites. Mechanical property measurements demonstrated that modulus of cellulose acetate was increased by kenaf, though the composites were brittle without TBC plasticizer addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHibiscus cannabinus 3aacetic acid 3abiocomposites 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3acitrates 3aevaporation 3akenaf 3amechanical properties 3aplasticizers 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 0aA.

While many DNA demethylation studies have focused on T cell activation, proliferation and differentiation, changes in DNA methylation in other types of immune cells are less well studied. We found that the expression of two cytokines (IL-2 and GM-CSF) responded differently to activation in three types of immune cells: EL4, A20 and RAW264.7 cells. Using the McrBC and MeDIP approaches, we observed decreases in DNA methylation at a genome-wide level and at the promoters of the genes of these cytokines. The expression of several potential enzymes/co-enzymes involved in the DNA demethylation pathways seemed to be associated with immune cell activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aT-lymphocytes 3agenes 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ainterleukin-2 3amacrophages 3atranscription (genetics)1 aOhms, Stephen J.1 aShannon, Frances M.1 aSun, Chao1 aFan, Jun Y.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 419, no. 4 p.748-753dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05410naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245008500204520345300289592002803742650002203770650002003792650002403812650000803836650002003844650000803864650000903872650001303881650001503894650001103909650003003920650001203950650001803962650002203980650001204002650001104014650001004025650001004035650001604045650001304061650003304074650001404107650001104121650001304132650001804145650001404163650003104177650001704208650002404225650001604249650001204265651001304277653001004290653002304300700001404323700001504337700001504352700001804367700001504385700001604400700001604416700001604432700001604448773013104464856008404595852000904679655001204688IND60758682920221117040404.0211202e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075868292DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0200-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, M.

During a survey in autumn 2019, leaf lesions were observed on plants (cv. Kandhari) in different orchards of Muzaffargarh (30°4′27.7572′′ N, 71°11′4.7544′′ E), a major pomegranate-producing region in Punjab Province. Disease incidence ranged from 17 to 20%. Leaf lesions were initially small (1 to 3 mm in diameter), round, purple or reddish-brown, scattered spots. At later stages, spots increased in size, and the centers of mature lesions became dark red or black with fungal sporulation. To isolate the pathogen, samples of leaf (5 × 5 mm) were cut from the junction of diseased and healthy tissue, surface disinfected in 75% alcohol for 30 s, sterilized with 6% sodium hypochlorite for 3 min, washed with sterile distilled water three times, air dried in laminar flow hood, and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA). After 1 week of incubation at 25 ± 2°C with a 12-h photoperiod, fungal colonies developed, which were initially white and became pale yellow with olivaceous green mycelium after 20 days. On PDA, ascomata were olivaceous green, with a papillate ostiole, globose or ovoidal to obovoidal (155 to 220 × 120 to 240 µm, n = 50). Terminal and lateral setae were abundant, brown, and tapering toward the tips (4 to 6 µm, n = 50). Asci were greenish and lemon-shaped (6 to 8 × 9 to 13.5 µm, n = 50). Ascospores were limoniform and olivaceous gray-brown (10 to 11.5 × 7 to 9 µm, n = 50). These morphological characteristics were consistent with the morphology of Chaetomium globosum (Lan et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2016). Genomic DNA was extracted from two isolates, and identification of the pathogen was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and the partial translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1) gene using ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and EF1-983F/EF1-2218R primers (Wang et al. 2016), respectively. The sequences of the PCR products were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MW522514 and MW522352 (ITS) and MW530423 and MW530424 (TEF1). BLAST results of the obtained sequences of the ITS and TEF1 genes revealed 100% (513/513 bp) and 99.78% (927/929 bp) similarity with those of C. globosum in GenBank (ITS: KX834823 and KT898637; TEF1: MG812564 and KC485028). To confirm pathogenicity, inoculum was prepared by harvesting conidia from 10-day-old culture grown in PDA. The surface-disinfected (70% ethyl alcohol, 30 s) leaves of ten 1-year-old seedlings (cv. Kandhari) were sprayed with a spore suspension (1 × 10⁶ conidia/ml). Leaves of 10 seedlings sprayed with sterile distilled water served as controls. All seedlings were covered with plastic bags and placed in a greenhouse at 26°C with a 12-h photoperiod. After 8 days, symptoms on inoculated leaves were similar to those observed in the orchards; no symptoms were observed on controls. The fungus was reisolated from all symptomatic tissues. C. globosum has been reported on Punica granatum (Guo et al. 2016), Cannabis sativa (Chaffin et al. 2020), and Brassica oleracea (Zhu et al. 2020). This is the first report of C. globosum causing leaf spot on pomegranate in Pakistan. This finding suggests a potential threat to pomegranate production in Pakistan, and further studies should focus on effective prevention and control practices of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aCannabis sativa 3aChaetomium globosum 3aDNA 3aPunica granatum 3aair 3aasci 3aascomata 3aascospores 3aautumn 3abiological safety cabinet 3aconidia 3aculture media 3adisease incidence 3aethanol 3afruits 3afungi 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3apomegranates 3asodium hypochlorite 3asporulation 3asurveys 3aPakistan 0afruit 0apathogen detection1 aMalik, A.1 aRehman, A.1 aHameed, A.1 aChohan, T.

The surface composition, morphology, hydrophilicity, fluorescence performance and metal ions adsorption performance of PVDF/SiO₂-g-CDs blended membrane were studied. The fluorescence quenching effect of the membrane with Hg²⁺ and Fe³⁺ was obvious. The quenching mechanism was the complexation of metal ions with the functional groups of CDs including -NH₂, -OH and -COOH. The optical detection limits of PVDF/SiO₂-g-CDs blended membrane for Hg²⁺ was 1.6 nM in the linear range of 0.0025–20 μM, and the optical detection limits for Fe³⁺ was 2.1 μM in the linear range of 0.5–5000 μM. The maximum adsorption capacity of PVDF/SiO₂-g-CDs blended membrane for Fe³⁺ was 47.04 mg·g⁻¹. The adsorption of the membrane conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langumir model, and belonged to monolayer chemical adsorption on the membrane surface. Through adsorption thermodynamic analysis, adsorption was a spontaneous endothermic process. The recovery rate of fluorescence and adsorption capacity could still be maintained above 82% after five cycles. The PVDF/SiO₂-g-CDs blended membrane had the ability to regenerate. In summary, the PVDF/SiO₂-g-CDs blended membrane had the dual functions of detecting and adsorbing metal ions, and had broad application prospects in sewage treatment.  aThis work was financially sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 51973158] and the Science and Technology Plans of Tianjin [grant number 18JCYBJC18100], and Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China [grant number IRT-17R80] Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Tianjin [grant number TD13-5044].  aPublisher supplied data  a51973158cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a18PTSYJC00180a18JCYBJC18100cScience and Technology Plans of Tianjin  aIRT-17R80cProgram for Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004467  aTD13-5044cProgram for Innovative Research Team in University of Tianjindhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004467 3aadsorption 3aendothermy 3aenvironmental technology 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3asewage treatment 3athermodynamics 0aCarbon dots 0ablended membrane 0ametal ions 0adetection1 aJi, Zhicheng1 aSun, Heyu1 aZhang, Dongdong1 aZhao, Yiping1 aChen, Li0 tEnvironmental technology.g2022 May 12, v. 43, no. 11 p.1648-1661dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2020.18458203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01831naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010300166300001600269520070900285592002800994650002101022650001201043650000901055650001401064650001501078651001801093651001601111651001301127700002801140700003001168700002201198700002401220700002101244773010201265856008101367852000901448655001201457IND60584443320221119090344.0171024e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058444332DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452170500222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonov, N.

The Arctic cod is most unevenly distributed across the water area and capable to form the high-density aggregations, which can be caught by the targeted trawls. A wide range of the age composition (0+−6+), the size-age composition, and the growth rates of the Arctic cod in the trawl catches in the Kara Sea, which are different from those in the fish in the adjacent Barents Sea, can indicate their assignment of the Arctic cod in these seas to different populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoreogadus saida 3aecology 3afish 3afisheries 3atrawl nets 3aArctic region 3aBarents Sea 3aKara Sea1 aKuznet︠s︡ov, V.

The main objective of the study was to analyze the sensory scores of the various samples of the dahi drinks and rank the different samples according to their sensory qualities, using fuzzy analysis. The general sensory attributes color, flavor, homogeneity and taste were also ranked according to their importance in the overall acceptability of the dahi drinks. Dahi was prepared in laboratory using a standard procedure, which was freeze dried, and used for further analysis. A panel of 11 judges was formed for the sensory evaluation of the drink samples and it was found that the market drink (S4) is the most acceptable and was ranked very good, whereas the S2 and S3 were also designated good followed by the S1 designated as satisfactory. So the ranking of the drinks was S4 > S3 > S2 > S1, showing the increasing acceptability of the dahi powder‐based drinks with the addition of stabilizers and flavor compounds. The quality attributes were ranked as Taste > Flavor > Homogeneity > Color, showing the highest importance of taste and least importance of the color as a quality attribute in case of dahi drinks. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Along with the increase in food production, there is the requirement of advanced technologies for the effective preservation of food. Drying is one of the main processes of preservation, which increases the shelf life of the product, but this leads to loss of texture and taste of products such as dahi, an Indian yogurt, which can be a potential drink mix and a space food. This paper supports the prospects of dry dahi powder in the food beverage mix industry, added with some common food additives, without affecting the nutritional and sensory properties, and increases the scope of use of dahi mix as a military drink and in the preparation of drinks while traveling. Also, this paper encourages the possibility of use of the fuzzy analysis for the sensory evaluation of other fermented products which should be further explored and verified.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverage industry 3abeverages 3acolor 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3afood additives 3afood preservation 3afood production 3afreeze drying 3afuzzy logic 3aguar gum 3alocust bean gum 3amarkets 3apowders 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3astabilizers 3ataste 3atexture 3ayogurt1 aMISHRA, H.N.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2012 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.1-10dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2011.00545.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013900166520157200305592002801877650001201905650003101917650001201948650001601960650002001976650001801996650002502014650001302039651001402052653002202066653001802088653001402106653001802120700001902138773010302157856008702260852000902347655001202356IND60777414520221119182944.0220614e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077741452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1062442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Ju10aSensitivity of the simulated atmospheric rivers over East Asia to horizontal resolution in the HadGEM3-GC3.1 general circulation model  aThis study evaluates the performance of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model 3–Global Coupled version 3.1 (HadGEM3-GC3.1) in simulating the climatology of atmospheric rivers (ARs) over East Asia during the period 1951–2014. Compared to a high-resolution climate reanalysis dataset and three different precipitation observation datasets, better performances in simulating the characteristics of ARs, including the frequency of occurrences, intensity of moisture transport, meridional heat transport and contributions to precipitation, are demonstrated by the simulation at the N512 (0.35° × 0.23°, ~25-km) horizontal resolution compared to those at the N96 (1.875° × 1.25°, ~135-km) and N216 (0.83° × 0.56°, ~65-km) resolutions. Also, the N512 experiment is more capable of representing the significant increase in AR frequency for the years with preceding El Niño events. However, the N512 experiment still presents an underestimation of AR frequency in different seasons. In contrast to the N96 and N216 simulations, it overestimates the AR-associated extreme precipitation amount over most of the study region, which is partly explained by the more precipitation-favorable thermodynamic conditions along the simulated AR axes. Overall, a sufficiently high horizontal resolution is crucial for the GCM to realistically represent the observed characteristics of ARs over East Asia and to robustly project their potential changes in a warming climate, although the systematic errors still affect the realism of the simulated ARs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3adata collection 3aheat transfer 3amoisture diffusivity 3aresearch 3aEast Asia 0aAtmospheric River 0aPrecipitation 0aEast Asia 0aHadGEM3-GC3.11 aYong, Yangyang0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 Sept., v. 275 p.106244-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1062443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01867naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011000165300002000275520077000295592002801065650002301093650002401116650001401140650002201154650002301176700001701199700001901216700001601235700001501251700001501266700001601281773012901297856008201426852000901508655001201517IND60565693620180611000000.0170327e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056569362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b062622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Biyaali, A.10aTube-Length Dependence on Theoretical Raman Spectra of Single-Walled BC3 Nanotubes and Bundle Size Effect  ap. 22653-22662.  aPolarized Raman spectra of single-walled BC₃ nanotubes (SBCNTs) are calculated as a function of their diameter, chirality, length, and bundle size using a classical force field combined with the bond-polarizability model. For isolated infinite tubes, we give a mathematical model to estimate their diameter from their Raman spectra. The tangential modes are sensitive to the tube chirality. The length shortening of the tube below ∼50 nm leads to the appearance of several additional Raman lines in the regions of breathing modes and tangential modes. For SBCNT bundles, the position of the radial breathing mode is significantly upshifted with respect to its position in isolated SBCNTs, and a specific bundle breathing-like mode is observed below 300 cm–¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3amathematical models 3ananotubes 3aoptical isomerism 3aphysical chemistry1 aBentaleb, M.1 aRahmani, A.

In species with a central resting or breeding place, there can be conflict between the environmental requirements of the âcentral placeâ and foraging habitat. We apply a multi-scale SDM to examine habitat trade-offs between the central place, roost sites, and foraging habitat in Myotis nattereri. We validate these derived associations using habitat selection from behavioural observations of radio-tracked bats. A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) of roost occurrence using land cover variables with mixed spatial scales indicated roost occurrence was positively associated with woodland on a fine scale and pasture on a broad scale. Habitat selection of radio-tracked bats mirrored the SDM with bats selecting for woodland in the immediate vicinity of individual roosts but avoiding this habitat in foraging areas, whilst pasture was significantly positively selected for in foraging areas. Using habitat selection derived from radio-tracking enables a multi-scale SDM to be interpreted in a behavioural context. We suggest that the multi-scale SDM of M. nattereri describes a trade-off between the central place and foraging habitat. Multi-scale methods provide a greater understanding of the ecological processes which determine where species occur and allow integration of behavioural processes into SDMs. The findings have implications when assessing the resource use of a species at a single point in time. Doing so could lead to misinterpretation of habitat requirements as these can change within a short time period depending on specific behaviour, particularly if detectability changes depending on behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyotis 3aanimal behavior 3abiogeography 3abreeding sites 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3amodels 3apastures1 aBuckley, Daniel J.1 aBoston, Emma S.M.1 aScott, David D.1 aProdÃ¶hl, Paulo A.1 aMarnell, Ferdia1 aTeeling, Emma C.1 aIan Montgomery, W.0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2012 Mar., v. 13, no. 2 p.188-195dElsevier GmbHx1439-17917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245018400164300001800348500001900366520164700385592002802032650001302060650001602073650001702089650001102106650001502117650001302132650001102145650002202156650000902178653003302187653002302220653002102243653001702264653003202281700002002313700002102333700001602354700001902370700001902389700005802408773013902466856007802605852000902683655001202692IND60724078520221120195218.0210120e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072407852DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c172382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jeong Hwa10aEnhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of Oxygen Electrodes via Incorporating Highly Conductive Sm³⁺ and Nd³⁺ Double-Doped Ceria for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells  ap. 2496-2506.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolid oxide cells (SOCs) are mutually convertible energy devices capable of generating electricity from chemical fuels including hydrogen in the fuel cell mode and producing green hydrogen using electricity from renewable but intermittent solar and wind resources in the electrolysis cell mode. An effective approach to enhance the performance of SOCs at reduced temperatures is by developing highly active oxygen electrodes for both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Herein, highly conductive Sm³⁺ and Nd³⁺ double-doped ceria (Sm₀.₀₇₅Nd₀.₀₇₅Ce₀.₈₅O₂₋δ, SNDC) is utilized as an active component for reversible SOC applications. We develop a novel La₀.₆Sr₀.₄Co₀.₂Fe₀.₈O₃ ₋δ (LSCF)–SNDC composite oxygen electrode. Compared with the conventional LSCF–Gd-doped ceria oxygen electrode, the LSCF–SNDC exhibits ∼35% lower cathode polarization resistance (0.042 Ω cm² at 750 °C) owing to rapid oxygen incorporation and surface diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the SOC with the LSCF–SNDC oxygen electrode and the SNDC buffer layer yields a remarkable performance in both the fuel cell (1.54 W cm–² at 750 °C) and electrolysis cell (1.37 A cm–² at 750 °C) modes because the incorporation of SNDC promotes the surface diffusion kinetics at the oxygen electrode bulk and the activity of the triple phase boundary at the interface. These findings suggest that the highly conductive SNDC material effectively enhances both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, thus serving as a promising material in reversible SOC applications at reduced temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3awind 0areversible solid oxide cells 0adouble-doped ceria 0aoxygen electrode 0abuffer layer 0aelectrochemical performance1 aJung, Chan Hoon1 aKim, Kyeong Joon1 aKim, Doyeub1 aShin, Hong Rim1 aHong, Jong-Eun1 aLee, Kang Taek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3067-45890 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 13, no. 2 p.2496-2506dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c172383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245013400166300001600300520160400316592002801920650001401948650003001962650002101992650001002013650002202023650001002045650001202055650002102067650001302088650001502101650001102116650001302127650001102140650001602151650001502167650001402182650001102196651002602207653003002233653002102263653001002284653001802294653001602312700001502328700002302343700002202366773012602388856007602514961001202590852000902602655001202611IND60551859120221121125007.0161104e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185912DNAL7 a10.3375/043.036.04152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumroese, R. Kasten10aForbs: Foundation for Restoration of Monarch Butterflies, other Pollinators, and Greater Sage-Grouse in the Western United States  ap. 499-511.  aMonarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), other pollinators, and Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are currently the focus of increased conservation efforts. Federal attention on these fauna is encouraging land managers to develop conservation strategies, often without corresponding financial resources. This could foster a myopic approach when allocating resources and setting restoration priorities, and at best, allow for inefficiencies in the usage of land management resources, or, at worst, pit one species (or suite of species, e.g., pollinators) against another (e.g., sage-grouse). Instead, investing holistically by linking conservation of these fauna may provide improved leverage of available resources and more benefit to the landscape. Fortunately, on the western US rangelands, these fauna can all benefit from restoration that increases the abundance and diversity of forbs. Establishing high density islands of outplanted forb seedlings may be a way to expedite restoration. Managers establishing forbs for pollinators (including monarchs) would further increase food availability for greater sage-grouse and vice versa. Adding milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) in appropriate areas to forb mixtures for restoration is warranted because they are excellent nectar sources for pollinators in general and the sole host for monarch larvae in particular. Here, we provide an overview of why forb species are keystone for monarch butterflies, other pollinators, and Greater Sage-Grouse and how seeding and outplanting seedlings of specific forbs are critical to restoration efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsclepias 3aCentrocercus urophasianus 3aDanaus plexippus 3afauna 3afood availability 3aforbs 3aislands 3akeystone species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alarvae 3amanagers 3anectar 3apollinators 3arangelands 3aseedlings 3asowing 3aWestern United States 0aCentrocercus urophasianus 0aDanaus plexippus 0aforbs 0anative plants 0awildflowers1 aLuna, Tara1 aPinto, Jeremiah R.1 aLandis, Thomas D.0 tNatural areas journal.g2016 Oct., v. 36, no. 4 p.499-511dNatural Areas AssociationwJournal:jnl4078689x0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375/043.036.04153Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002800147245008200175300001800257500000900275520155700284592002801841650002001869650001201889650001601901650001001917650001301927650001001940650001601950650002601966650001901992650002002011650001402031650001202045650001802057650000902075650002302084650001202107650001302119650001402132650003002146650002602176650002202202700002502224700001902249700002602268773013402294852000902428856008402437655001202521IND4463935020221119205539.0191122e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446393502DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2011.12.06312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrero Farfan, Ivan D.12aA Stable dw3 Allele in Sorghum and a Molecular Marker to Facilitate Selection  ap. 2063-2069.  aepub  aDwarfism plays a key role in adapting crops to high-input production systems by contributing to improved lodging resistance and fertilizer efficiency. In sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], four dwarfing mutations have been found that profoundly reduce the stalk height. Notable among these mutations is dwarf-3 (dw3), even though the phenotype it confers is unstable. The objectives of this research were to identify and characterize a stable mutant allele of the dw3 locus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a region of dw3 containing the 882 bp tandem duplication that is diagnostic for the unstable allele. Analyses of PCR fragments from dwarf sorghum accessions that lacked the duplicated region led to the identification of Tx2737 as a possible carrier of a novel mutant dw3 allele. Sequence analysis confirmed and revealed the presence of a 6 bp deletion in exon 5 of dw3 that eliminates two highly conserved amino acids, Q1275 and R1276, from the enzyme. The frequency of this allele in sorghum germplasm appears to be very low with only 1% of the accessions in the diversity panel exhibiting this deletion. Field trials demonstrated that this allele of dw3 produces a stable dwarf phenotype with no height mutants found in Tx2737 and KS19. The new allele has been coined dw3-sd2.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by agar dilution method and bactericidal activity was assessed by a time-kill assay. The anti-QS activity was evaluated using Chromobacterium violaceum. The effect of AMPT on virulence factors production by MRSA and biofilm formation by MRSA, C. violaceum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also assessed. AMPT was superior to vancomycin and teichoplanin against MRSA isolates. MIC₅₀/₉₀ values of AMPT (2/4 mg/L) were 2–4 folds lower than the values for vancomycin (4/16 mg/L) and 2-fold lower than the values for teichoplanin (4/8 mg/L). Results of time-kill assay against two multidrug-resistant MRSA isolates revealed bactericidal effect of AMPT after 4 h of treatment, with no bacterial cells detected after 24 h. Remarkably, AMPT exhibited anti-QS activity against both C. violaceum and MRSA at subinhibitory concentrations. Moreover, AMPT reduced haemolysin and protease production by MRSA and inhibited biofilm formation by MRSA, C. violaceum and P. aeruginosa but had no dispersion effect on preformed ones. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis revealed promising interactions between AMPT and AgrA as well as SarA in S. aureus confirming the antivirulence and antibiofilm activities. Favourably, no significant cytotoxicity of AMPT was observed on murine macrophage cell line. Taken altogether, these results suggest that AMPT could be considered an interesting lead compound in the search for treatment of MRSA infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3abiofilm 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3ahemolysins 3amacrophages 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amice 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogenesis 3aproteinases 3athiazoles 3avancomycin 3avirulence 0aThiazole 0aAnti-quorum sensing 0aAntivirulence 0aMRSA 0aC. violaceum 0aBiofilm1 aAbouwarda, Ahmed Megahed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8745-86281 aNasr, Tamer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0104-97651 aOmar, Farghaly Abdelhamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5325-80111 aBondock, Samir0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Dec., v. 149 p.104500-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1045003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001700147245017500164300001800339500000900357520115700366592002801523650001101551650001601562650002101578650002301599650002001622650003001642650002501672650002801697650000901725650001901734700001901753700001801772700001701790700001501807773013401822852000901956856008401965655001202049IND4463935320221119205513.0191122e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446393532DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2012.01.00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Meixue10aQuantitative Trait Loci for Waterlogging Tolerance in a Barley Cross of Franklin × YuYaoXiangTian Erleng and the Relationship Between Waterlogging and Salinity Tolerance  ap. 2082-2088.  aepub  aBreeding for waterlogging tolerance is an important and challenging objective in high rainfall areas across many countries in the world, as evaluation of the tolerance in the field is difficult and not reliable. Molecular markers can be effectively used in a breeding program to indirectly select waterlogging tolerance. In this study, 172 doubled haploid (DH) lines originating from a cross of YuYaoXiangTian Erleng (YYXT) and ‘Franklin’ were used to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling waterlogging tolerance. For the purpose of comparing QTL from different DH populations, a consensus map was constructed using six different populations. A total of four QTL were identified, which controlled 6.2 to 30.1% of the phenotypic variation. Among these QTL, one located on chromosome 6H was not identified in previous studies. Two of the QTL were located at similar positions to QTL for salinity tolerance that had been reported earlier. Further analysis showed some relationships between waterlogging and salinity tolerance. Therefore, waterlogging and salinity tolerance can be improved simultaneously by marker-assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3achromosomes 3adoubled haploids 3aflooded conditions 3agenetic markers 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3arain 3asalt tolerance1 aJohnson, Peter1 aZhou, Gaofeng1 aLi, Chengdao1 aLance, Reg0 tCrop science.g2012 Sept., v. 52, no. 5 p.2082-2088dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2012.01.00083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04000naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245006200206300001100268506007600279520216300355592002802518506003702546650001102583650001602594650001402610650001902624650002502643650001902668650001202687650001802699650001202717650001002729650001102739650002102750650000902771650002402780650002202804650001002826650001302836650001002849650001902859650001102878650001502889650001002904650001602914650001302930650001302943650001402956650001402970650002402984700002403008700002003032700001903052700002103071700001903092700002403111773010103135856008103236852000903317655001203326IND60550194920221207103157.0161030e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055019492DNAL7 a10.1186/s13028-016-0220-92doi7 aPMC48960352pmcid7 a272674542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠvara, Tanja10aPulmonary hypoplasia and anasarca syndrome in Cika cattle  ap. 36.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Hydrops foetalis is defined as excessive fluid accumulation within the foetal extravascular compartments and body cavities. It has been described in human and veterinary medicine, but despite several descriptive studies its aetiology is still not fully clarified. Pulmonary hypoplasia and anasarca (PHA) syndrome is a rare congenital abnormality in cattle that is characterised by hydrops foetalis including extreme subcutaneous oedema (anasarca) and undeveloped or poorly formed lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia). Until now, sporadic cases of PHA were reported in cattle breeds like Australian Dexter, Belted Galloway, Maine-Anjou, and Shorthorn. This report describes the first known cases of PHA syndrome in Slovenian Cika cattle. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old cow aborted a male calf in the seventh month of pregnancy, while a male calf was delivered by caesarean section on the due date from a 14-year-old cow. The pedigree analysis showed that the calves were sired by the same bull, the dams were paternal half-sisters and the second calf was the product of a dam-son mating. Gross lesions were similar in both cases and characterized by severe anasarca, hydrothorax, hydropericardium, ascites, hypoplastic lungs, absence of lymph nodes, and an enlarged heart. The first calf was also athymic. Histopathology of the second affected calf confirmed severe oedema of the subcutis and interstitium of the organs, and pulmonary hypoplasia. The lymph vessels in the subcutis and other organs were severely dilated. Histopathology of the second calf revealed also lack of bronchus associated lymphoid tissue and adrenal gland hypoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: The findings were consistent with known forms of the bovine PHA syndrome. This is the first report of the PHA syndrome occurring in the local endangered breed of Cika cattle. Observed inbreeding practice supports that this lethal defect most likely follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. In the light of the disease phenotype it is assumed that a mutation causing an impaired development of lymph vessels is responsible for the hydrops foetalis associated malformations in bovine PHA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDexter 3aMaine-Anjou 3aShorthorn 3aSlovenian Cika 3aabnormal development 3aadrenal glands 3aascites 3abody cavities 3abronchi 3abulls 3acalves 3acesarean section 3acows 3adescriptive studies 3adisease incidence 3aedema 3aetiology 3aheart 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3ainbreeding 3alymph 3alymph nodes 3amutation 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3apregnancy 3aveterinary medicine1 aCociancich, Vasilij1 aŠest, Katarina1 aGombač, Mitja1 aPaller, Tomislav1 aStarič, Jože1 aDrögemüller, Cord0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2015 Dec., v. 58, no. 1 p.36-36dBioMed Centralx1751-01477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-016-0220-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245010500176300001400281520135600295592002801651653002001679653002101699653001401720653002201734653002101756700002501777700002401802700002301826773009601849856008101945852000902026655001202035IND60544276820221119235820.0161025e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054427682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.als.2015.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBocharnikov, Vladimir N.10aMaterials for the Study of the Spring Migration of Waterfowl (Anseriformes, Aves) on the Lake Khanka  ap. 87-94.  aThe results of 11years (2003–2013) monitoring activities, including estimation of number and gender structure of waterfowl on the Lake Khanka, are presented. The accounting work (50days) took place in the first decade of April, in the period of mass spring migration of migratory birds. About 682,270 birds are registered. The comparison of the species composition and the ratio of the major groups of waterfowl of the two periods — 2003–2009 and 2010–2013 are given. The most minority group of migratory birds is Cygnus — less than 0.1% of all registered birds. More than 10,000 specimens of geese were accounted (17.7% of registered birds). The maximum number of birds was registered in 2008, the minimum number was registered in 2011. In all years of monitoring the part of Anas formosa was the largest among migratory birds — from 42 to 80% of all registered birds. The Anser albifrons dominates among all Ansers — about 50–80% of all identified species of Ansers. For the first time of all years of the ornithological investigations of the Prikhankayskaya lowland the gender structure of Anas was identified by visual estimates and photo data. The sample was 28.9 thousand birds. The average proportion of males for all years (2003–2013) was 58.9%, the maximum was recorded for Authya ferina (70.2%) and Authya foligula (70.3%).  aPublisher supplied data 0aMigratory birds 0aSpring migration 0aWaterfowl 0aSpecies structure 0aGender structure1 aGluschenko, Yuriy N.1 aKorobov, Dmitriy V.1 aKorobova, Irina N.0 tAchievements in the Life Sciences.g2015 Dec., v. 9 p.87-94dElsevier B.V.x2078-15207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2015.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008200158300001800240520121700258592002801475650001501503650001101518650001701529650001901546650001901565650001201584650002101596650002401617650001701641650001301658650001401671650002101685650001701706700001301723700001901736700001201755700001501767700001801782773012101800856007401921852000901995655001202004IND60664474320221118090610.0190912e20130528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066447432DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40752g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Weisheng10aOne-pot synthesis of hydrophilic ZnCuInS/ZnS quantum dots for in vivo imaging  ap. 9470-9475.  aSynthesis of CuInS-based quantum dots (QDs) in the organic phase is currently one of the fastest growing points of nanotechnology. Most of the reported CuInS-based QDs are hydrophobic and cannot be directly used for biomedical applications without phase transfer. We put forward a one-pot synthetic strategy aimed at fabricating hydrophilic Zn–Cu–In–S/ZnS (ZCIS/ZnS) quantum dots (QDs) to be used directly for in vivo imaging without surface treatment. This strategy is based on the use of a hydrophilic ligand (6-sulfanyl-1-hexanol, MPH) and non-coordinating solvents such as a low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW = 400 Da). The capping ligand MPH endows the obtained ZCIS/ZnS QDs with good hydrophilicity and therefore offers great opportunity for direct bioimaging applications without phase transfer. Experimental results have indicated that these so-called hydrophilic ZCIS/ZnS QDs show low cytotoxicity and are successfully utilized for in vivo imaging. Furthermore, the here reported strategy doesn't only present a synthetic idea, but also might stimulate other innovative ideas on fabricating hydrophilic or water-soluble ZCIS/ZnS QDs to be used directly for biological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioimaging 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3amolecular weight 3apolyethylene glycol 3aquantum dots 3asolvents 3asynthesis 3awater solubility 3azinc sulfide1 aChen, Na1 aDong, Chunhong1 aDu, Yu,1 aChang, Jin1 aZhang, Bingbo0 tRSC advances.g2013 May 28, v. 3, no. 24 p.9470-9475dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra40752g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100003100147245010200178300001800280500000900298520150800307592002801815650002201843650001301865650001401878650001401892650002401906650003701930650001601967650001801983650001902001650001502020650001102035650001802046650001202064650002402076650001002100650002602110650001102136700001502147700001902162700001502181700001702196700001502213700001402228773013402242852000902376856008402385655001202469IND4463935620221119205519.0191122e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446393562DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2012.01.00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, A.

This study was conducted to determine the rate and magnitude of yield progress in eastern soft red winter (SRW) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars released from 1950 to 2009 relative to a historical cultivar Red May (1919). The effects of agronomic, morphological, and yield component traits on grain yield were studied in 50 widely grown historic and current cultivars in replicated yield trials at Warsaw, VA, in 2010 and 2011 and at Holland and Blacksburg, VA, in 2011.Genotype × environment interactions were significant (p ﹤ 0.01) for most traits. Linear regression models for yield were constructed for each environment, with r² values ranging from 0.62 to 0.76 among environments. The traits flag leaf angle, kernel weight, spikes per square meter, lodging, flowering date, harvest index, normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), and green leaf retention, respectively, explained the most yield variation in multiple environments. The rate of genetic yield improvement ranged from 0.56% yr⁻¹ at Holland in 2011 to 1.4% yr⁻¹ at Blacksburg in 2011.

In this context, the present work investigated the occurrence of 13 cytostatics and 4 metabolites in wastewater samples from various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from a large hospital from Spain. The target compounds belong to five different classes according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC), namely, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, plant alkaloids and other natural products, cytotoxic antibiotics and related substances, and other antineoplastic agents. Some of them have been classified as carcinogens in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). These compounds were determined by an automated on line solid-phase extraction–liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) method. Results showed the presence of methotrexate (MET), ifosfamide (IF), cyclophosphamide (CP), irinotecan (IRI), doxorubicin (DOX), capecitabine (CAP), tamoxifen (TAM) and the metabolites endoxifen (OH-D-TAM), hydroxytamoxifen (OH-TAM) and hydroxypaclitaxel (OH-PAC) at levels ranging from 2ngL−1 (for MET) to 180ngL−1 (for TAM). Some of these compounds were found to be efficiently removed after wastewater treatment, e.g. MET, DOX and IRI, whereas other compounds, such as TAM, CP and IF remained largely unaltered. The behaviour of the target compounds during the common filtration step of the water samples was also investigated with the finding that some compounds are strongly adsorbed to nylon filters, while cellulose acetate appears as the best choice for the filter material. The aquatic environmental risk associated to the detected compounds was also assessed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of the metabolites OH-D-TAM and OH-TAM in the water cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3aantibiotics 3acarcinogens 3acellulose acetate 3acyclophosphamide 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3afilters 3afiltration 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3ahydrologic cycle 3ametabolites 3amethotrexate 3anylon 3arisk 3atamoxifen 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aSpain 0aCytostatics 0aOccurrence 0aWastewater 0aFiltration 0aLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aRisk assessment1 ade Alda, Miren López1 aBarceló, Damià,0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 497-498 p.68-77dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013000161300001800291520073400309592002801043650001501071650002201086650000901108650001201117650002301129650002601152700001901178700001801197773012201215856007401337852000901411655001201420IND60664474420221118090622.0190912e20130430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066447442DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40753e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuyuki, Masanori10aVibronic relaxation dynamics at intermediate state of two-pump excitation: Photoisomerization of indocyanine green in ethanol  ap. 7313-7320.  aNIR-UV two-pulse correlation measurements of a cyanine dye were conducted to study its trans-to-cis photoisomerization through a multiphoton process.

Compared with the widely studied electronic skin, this flexible ionic skin could generate electrical signals without any power supply and distinguish different directions of the bending strain due to ion redistribution induced by mechanical deformation. In this study, the bionic-ordered ion channel and single-ion conductor design in the nanocomposite sensor guarantee simultaneous sensing signal (mV) under a micro-strain as small as 0.0347% with high sensitivity, stability, and linearity. The integrated wearable sensors succeed in detecting the real-time signal of human activities from large-scale deformations to subtle physiological signals including pulse wave at different frequencies and multiple modes of muscle relaxation–contraction. The present study paves a new way for designing artificial skin similar to the natural skin and developing the emerging flexible and wearable sensing platforms for healthcare and biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial skin 3acarbon nanotubes 3adeformation 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic equipment 3ahealth services 3aion channels 3aions 3amuscles 3ananocomposites1 aZhao, Jingjing1 aWang, Dongxing1 aLü, Chao,1 aChen, Wei0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Aug. 30, v. 5, no. 34 p.7126-7132dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb01760j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013700161520203400298592002802332650001602360650002002376650001202396650001702408650002502425650002402450650001502474650001602489650001502505650001402520651001402534700002502548700001802573700002302591700001902614773012902633856007502762852000902837655001202846IND60782489420221121130342.0220708e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078248942DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141331322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChhabra, Aakash 10aRADAR-Vegetation Structural Perpendicular Index (R-VSPI) for the Quantification of Wildfire Impact and Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery  aThe precise information on fuel characteristics is essential for wildfire modelling and management. Satellite remote sensing can provide accurate and timely measurements of fuel characteristics. However, current estimates of fuel load changes from optical remote sensing are obstructed by seasonal cloud cover that limits their continuous assessments. This study utilises remotely sensed Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1 backscatter) data as an alternative to optical-based imaging (Sentinel-2 scaled surface reflectance). SAR can penetrate clouds and offers high-spatial and medium-temporal resolution datasets and can hence complement the optical dataset. Inspired by the optical-based Vegetation Structural Perpendicular Index (VSPI), an SAR-based index termed RADAR-VSPI (R-VSPI) is introduced in this study. R-VSPI characterises the spatio-temporal changes in fuel load due to wildfire and the subsequent vegetation recovery thereof. The R-VSPI utilises SAR backscatter (σ°) from the co-polarized (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) channels at a centre frequency of 5.4 GHz. The newly developed index is applied over major wildfire events that occurred during the “Black Summer” wildfire season (2019–2020) in southern Australia. The condition of the fuel load was mapped every 5 (any orbit) to 12 (same orbit) days at an aggregated spatial resolution of 110 m. The results show that R-VSPI was able to quantify fuel depletion by wildfire (relative to healthy vegetation) and monitor its subsequent post-fire recovery. The information on fuel condition and heterogeneity improved at high-resolution by adapting the VSPI on a dual-polarization SAR dataset (R-VSPI) compared to the historic forest fuel characterisation methods (that used visible and infrared bands only for fuel estimations). The R-VSPI thus provides a complementary source of information on fuel load changes in a forest landscape compared to the optical-based VSPI, in particular when optical observations are not available due to cloud cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3acloud cover 3adata collection 3aforests 3afuel loading 3afuels (fire ecology) 3ainformation sources 3alandscapes 3areflectance 3asatellites 3awildfires 3aAustralia1 aRüdiger, Christoph 1 aYebra, Marta 1 aJagdhuber, Thomas 1 aHilton, James 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 29, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141331323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011800154300001800272520048200290592002800772650001400800650001900814650001800833650001700851650001300868650001700881650001300898700002500911773012100936856007401057852000901131655001201140IND60664474620221118090731.0190912e20130514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066447462DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40755a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Qiang10aPhase and morphology selective interface-assisted synthesis of highly luminescent Ln³⁺-doped NaGdF₄ nanorods  ap. 8172-8175.  aMaking use of the multifunctional properties of ionic liquids by employing them as a fluoride resource and hydrophilic phase, we have grown small, monodisperse, highly luminescent Ln³⁺-doped NaGdF₄ nanorods at the interface between octadecene and the reactive ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate.

Given their notable promise, a general and scalable strategy to access these catalyst systems is highly desirable. Herein, we describe a straightforward and efficient thermal atomization strategy to create atomically dispersed palladium atoms anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon shell over an SBA-15 support. Their presence was confirmed by spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurement. The nitrogen-containing carbon shells provide atomic diffusion sites for anchoring palladium atoms emitted from palladium nanoparticles. This catalyst showed exceptional efficiency in selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and other types of alkynes. Importantly, it showed excellent stability, recyclability, and sintering-resistant ability. This approach can be scaled up with comparable catalytic activity. We anticipate that this work may lay the foundation for rapid access to high-quality SACs that are amenable to large-scale production for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aalkynes 3aatomization 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron microscopy 3ahydrogenation 3apalladium 0aheterogeneous catalysis 0apalladium single atom 0aSBA-15 0asemi-hydrogenation 0acatalytic performance 0alarge-scale production1 aRen, Qinghui1 aWang, Xuexia1 aChen, Wenxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9669-43581 aLeng, Leipeng1 aZhang, Mingyang1 aHorton, J.

Photovoltaic devices with colloidal CuInS₂ nanoparticles suffer, however, still from low performance. The present study focuses on a detailed investigation of charge transfer as an elemental process involved in the energy conversion process. Therefore, the excited state properties and the process of charge transfer in CuInS₂ (CIS) nanocrystal/polymer composites were studied by applying quasi-steady-state photoinduced absorption (PIA) and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) as well as time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The excited state dynamics of our systems was studied using time-correlated single photon counting. We examined two different composites, namely, CuInS₂ nanocrystals combined with either poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT). Optical absorption and emission spectra of these hybrid material systems exhibit luminescence quenching and polaronic photoinduced absorption indicating photoinduced charge transfer. By systematic variations of the composition of the films, the material ratios favoring efficient charge transfer were determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acadmium 3aenergy conversion 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotons 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity1 aFirdaus, Yuliar1 aFron, Eduard1 aVan der Auweraer, Mark1 aParisi, Jürgen1 aBorchert, Holger0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 119, no. 39 p.22669-22680dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b066183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245018400172520219600356592002802552650001202580650002802592650001202620650001202632650001702644650001102661650002002672650001702692650001202709650001902721650001102740650001502751650001302766651001002779653002302789653003402812653001802846653002802864653002402892653001502916700001602931700001802947700002102965700001802986700001703004773010103021856008803122852000903210655001203219IND60710822120221116140522.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071082212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1047602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chengbin10aIndicator element selection and geochemical anomaly mapping using recursive feature elimination and random forest methods in the Jingdezhen region of Jiangxi Province, South China  aDetermining indicator element association for mineralization can not only improve mineral exploration efficiency but also reduce the cost of unnecessary element analysis during geochemical exploration. This study provides a case study of Zhuxi tungsten-copper deposits and presents a workflow using recursive feature elimination and random forest methods to select the indicator element association for copper and tungsten mineralization in regional geochemical mapping. First, a training dataset containing positive and negative samples was built based on the known mineral deposits and mineral deposit model. Second, a 100-time simulation of recursive feature elimination with cross-validation based on random forest (RFECV-RF) was run to get a robust result of indicator elements by the ranking of variable importance. Third, the random forest (RF) method was used to integrate six indicator elements for mapping geochemical anomaly. The Youden index and prediction-area (P-A) plot were used to determine the threshold value for geochemical anomaly identification. The results demonstrated the hybrid workflow was useful to determine key indicator element for geochemical anomaly identification associated with copper and tungsten mineralization. Bi, Mo, Cu, Cd, W, and As were selected as the key indicator elements for geochemical exploration of Cu–W mineralization. Bi, Mo, W and Cu elements correspond to skarn and altered granite mineralization at depth while Cd and As elements correspond to the hydrothermal-vein mineralization at shallow levels. The result of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that geochemical anomaly identified using the hybrid method proposed in this study had the best performance in producing comprehensive geochemical signatures. The six indicator elements also exhibited an excellent performance of identifying geochemical anomaly associated to Cu–W mineralization. This study provides a cost-benefit solution to reduce the cost of unnecessary elements concentration detection by determining a small number of key indicator elements using machine learning methods in the regional geochemical mapping for discovering mineral deposits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3aartificial intelligence 3abismuth 3acadmium 3acase studies 3acopper 3adata collection 3ageochemistry 3agranite 3amineralization 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3atungsten 3aChina 0aIndicator elements 0aRecursive feature elimination 0aRandom forest 0aZhuxi tungsten deposits 0aGeochemical anomaly 0aSimulation1 aPan, Yipeng1 aChen, Jianguo1 aOuyang, Yongpeng1 aRao, Jianfeng1 aJiang, Qibao0 tApplied geochemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 122 p.104760-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1047603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245014500188300001600333520126500349592002801614650001801642650001601660650001401676650001301690650001801703650000901721650001001730650003501740650001301775650002001788650002001808650002201828650000901850650001201859650001301871650002001884650001601904650001101920650001101931650001201942650001801954650002301972650004001995650001102035650004102046650001802087650001902105650003002124650000902154650003202163650000902195650003502204650003102239650002802270650005202298650003802350650002702388650005102415700002402466700001502490700002202505700002102527700002102548773009302569856004802662852000902710655001202719IND50074114920221119202435.0140321e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007411492DNAL7 a242758872pmid7 a10.1007/s00335-013-9491-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenzetti, Diego12aA transgenic insertion on mouse chromosome 17 inactivates a novel immunoglobulin superfamily gene potentially involved in sperm–egg fusion  ap. 141-148.  aFertilization is the process that leads to the formation of a diploid zygote from two haploid gametes. This is achieved through a complex series of cell-to-cell interactions between a sperm and an egg. The final event of fertilization is the fusion of the gametes’ membranes, which allows the delivery of the sperm genetic material into the egg cytoplasm. In vivo studies in the laboratory mouse have led to the discovery of membrane proteins that are essential for the fusion process in both the sperm and egg. Specifically, the sperm protein Izumo1 was shown to be necessary for normal fertility. Izumo1-deficient spermatozoa fail to fuse with the egg plasma membrane. Izumo1 is a member of the Immunoglobulin Superfamily of proteins, which are known to be involved in cell adhesion. Here, we describe BART97b, a new mouse line with a recessive mutation that displays a fertilization block associated with a failure of sperm fusion. BART97b mutants carry a deletion that inactivates Spaca6, a previously uncharacterized gene expressed in testis. Similar to Izumo1, Spaca6 encodes an immunoglobulin-like protein. We propose that the Spaca6 gene product may, together with Izumo1, mediate sperm fusion by binding an as yet unidentified egg membrane receptor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell adhesion 3achromosomes 3acytoplasm 3adiploidy 3aegg membranes 3aeggs 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahaploidy 3aimmunoglobulins 3ain vivo studies 3amembrane proteins 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3aplasma membrane 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3azygote 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFertilizationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Silencing 2aImmunoglobulinsxgenetics 2aMale 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aMice 2aMice, Mutant Strainsxgenetics 2aMice, Transgenicxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeminal Plasma Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSperm-Ovum Interactionsxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aPoirier, Christophe1 aZhao, Ming1 aOverbeek, Paul A.1 aHarrison, Wilbur1 aBishop, Colin E.0 tMammalian genome.g2014 Apr., v. 25, no. 3-4 p.141-148dSpringer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-013-9491-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245011400159300001800273500002000291520155600311592002801867650001901895650001601914650001901930650001801949650001301967650001901980650001301999650001902012650002202031650001302053650001502066650001702081700001202098700001902110700001402129700001802143773011202161856008002273852000902353655001202362IND60790298620221119025615.0220824e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029862DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ying,10aMiR‐101 inhibits ovarian carcinogenesis by repressing the expression of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor  ap. 1258-1266.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOvarian cancer is one of the most lethal malignant gynecological tumors as a result of difficulties in early‐stage detection and a lack of effective treatments for patients with advanced or recurrent cancer. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether some of the microRNA (miRNA) content of serum might be related to ovarian cancer, as well as the role of these miRNAs and their intercellular transport via exosomes in ovarian cancer. We first detected the expression of six candidate miRNAs in ovarian cancer tissues and adjacent nontumor ovarian samples from 36 patients and confirmed the altered expression of four miRNAs. The level of these six candidate miRNAs was also examined in exosomes from patient serum samples. Only the level of miR‐101 was altered in both ovarian tissue samples and serum exosomes. After prediction using online bioinformatics tools and confirmation by dual‐luciferase assay and immunoblotting, we identified that miR‐101 can repress the expression of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor by targeting its 3′‐UTR. Using Transwell assays, we examined the effect of miR‐101 on migration and invasion capacity of ovarian cancer cells. The results indicated that the reduction of miR‐101 is mostly related to significant enhanced ovarian cancer cell migration. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that miR‐101 content in serum exosomes has potential as a marker for diagnosis of ovarian cancer and that miR‐101 mimics are potential therapeutic drugs for the treatment of ovarian cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3ablood serum 3acarcinogenesis 3acell movement 3aexosomes 3aimmunoblotting 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3apatients 3aprediction 3atherapeutics1 aXu, Lei1 aZheng, Jianbin1 aGeng, Lei1 aZhao, Shuping0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Sept., v. 7, no. 9 p.1258-1266dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014700169300001600316520136100332592002801693650001101721650001201732650001901744650002601763650001101789650001301800650001001813650002301823650001101846651002201857651001001879700003401889700001701923700002801940700003001968700001901998700002702017700001902044700002902063773009202092856008402184852000902268655001202277IND60085980620221120152421.0141101e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008598062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2012.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHöbig, Nicole10aLake Banyoles (northeastern Spain): A Last Glacial to Holocene multi-proxy study with regard to environmental variability and human occupation  ap. 205-218.  aAnalyses of a 67-m long sediment core from Lake Banyoles (northeastern Spain) have revealed evidence for the palaeoclimate history of the northern Iberian Peninsula. Investigations have included high-resolution and non-destructive sediment-physical, geochemical, and optical methods to generate proxies indicative of sedimentologic variability and climate change. Primary stratigraphic control is based on ¹⁴C and U-series dates of organic and inorganic material, as well as tephra from the Late Pleistocene Olot volcanic episode. While preliminary ages obtained for the core base date back to approximately 60 ka, the Last Glacial Maximum (23–19 ka) interval ends at 15 m. The top 8 m of deposits accumulated in the Holocene. Several slump events were observed in the core section, as were microtectonic structures, which constrain the movement. Evidence for palaeoclimate variations in element ratios is interpreted to represent effects of Heinrich Events H0–H5. Associated changes in environmental conditions (e.g., humidity) may have affected human occupation during the Palaeolithic–Neolithic period. Implications on human occupation in northeastern Iberia due to climate changes are discussed from archeological findings and cave sediments in neighboring areas and are analyzed with respect to the palaeolimnologic data of Lake Banyoles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3ahumans 3ahumidity 3alakes 3aradiocarbon dating 3atephra 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain1 aWeber, Michaelq(Michael E.),1 aKehl, Martin1 aWeniger, Gerd-Christian1 aJulià i Brugués, Ramon,1 aMelles, Martin1 aFülöp, Reka-Hajnalka1 aVogel, Hendrik1 aReicherter, K.q(Klaus),0 tQuaternary international.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 274 p.205-218dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.05.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245006700163300001600230520121300246592002801459650001901487650002801506650001901534650001501553650002301568650001401591650003101605650001101636650001901647650001001666650001901676650001401695650001301709650002601722653001101748653000901759653000801768653001601776653001701792700001501809700001401824700001801838773014601856856008202002852000902084655001202093IND60622538320221120062016.0181127e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062253832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Geng10aCombinatory inhibition of TRIM65 and MDM2 in lung cancer cells  ap. 698-702.  aIn addition to the involvement in white matter lesion, tripartite-motif protein family member 65 (TRIM65) has also been implicated in tumorigenesis as a potential oncogene. However, the underlining mechanisms of TRIM65 functions and its clinical implication still remain to be further elucidated. In the present study, we found that TRIM65 binds to the N-terminus of p53 tumor suppressor and thus competes with MDM2 for p53 binding. Intriguingly, analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) gene alteration database revealed that elevated expression of TRIM65 is mutually exclusive to MDM2 up-regulation in human lung adenocarcinoma patients, indicating potential compensatory effect of one over the other. Indeed, overexpression of TRIM65 renders lung cancer cell line resistance to Nutlin-3a, an effective MDM2 inhibitor, as determined by p53 activation and cell proliferation assays. Furthermore, depletion of TRIM65 using siRNA in combination with Nutlin-3a treatment demonstrates enhanced anti-tumor effects on lung cancer cell line. Collectively, our findings provide the rationale for developing strategies to target TRIM65 for lung cancer intervention, potentially in combination with MDM2 inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aantineoplastic activity 3acarcinogenesis 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3adatabases 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3apatients 3asmall interfering RNA 0aTRIM65 0aMDM2 0ap53 0aLung cancer 0aTherapeutics1 aZhou, Tong1 aLiu, Ying1 aYu, Zhenxiang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 506, no. 3 p.698-702dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245013900168520203000307592002802337650004802365650002202413650001602435650001402451650001502465650001602480650002602496650000902522650002002531650002002551650001402571650001302585650001402598650002202612650001802634650001102652650004002663653001002703653001002713653001402723653002202737700002002759700001802779700002002797773009902817856009002916852000903006655001203015IND60749950620221119122114.0220704e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074995062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7374502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yu10aMicroRNA expression and analysis of immune-related putative target genes in ISKNV-infected spleen of mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi)  aInfectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), a highly infectious and lethal pathogen of mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi), has resulted in major aquaculture losses over the past few decades. A lack of understanding of the regulatory mechanism of viral infection has impeded the development of effective measures to control ISKNV infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that regulate the processes of viral infection and are involved in various physiological processes in vivo. In this study, miRNAs involved in the response of mandarin fish to ISKNV infection were identified at several time points following infection through Illumina high-throughput sequencing. A total of 434 (27 known and 407 novel) miRNAs were identified in mandarin fish; 26 (26 up-regulated), 38 (30 up-regulated, 8 down-regulated), and 18 (14 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated) differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified at 12, 24, and 48 h post-infection (hpi), respectively. The putative target genes of DEMs were all significantly enriched in host immune response or signaling pathways, such as autophagy, endocytosis, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, Salmonella infection, cell cycle, protein export, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway at 12 and 24 hpi and in vascular endothelial growth factor, phosphatidylinositol signaling system and lysosome at 48 hpi. Further analysis indicated that the targeted mRNAs of miRNAs were involved in innate immunity; autophagy and endocytosis might play an important role in immune regulation within 24 hpi with ISKNV. Although the number of DEMs was lowest at 48 hpi, they might still be involved in immunity through the above pathway. We also constructed a miRNA–mRNA targeting network. Generally, the findings of this study provide novel information that advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA during ISKNV infection in mandarin fish as well as the development of new approaches for preventing ISKNV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3aaquaculture 3aautophagy 3acell cycle 3aendocytosis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afish 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3alysosomes 3amicroRNA 3apathogens 3aprotein transport 3asalmonellosis 3aspleen 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0amiRNA 0aISKNV 0aInfection 0aSignaling pathway1 aWang, Ying-Ying1 aFu, Huang-Cui1 aHuang, He-Zhong0 tAquaculture.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 547 p.737450-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7374503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009200174300001600266520108600282592002801368650001801396650001701414650001801431650001101449651002201460651001201482651001201494651001001506700001701516700001901533700002801552773009201580856008401672852000901756655001201765IND60085980720221120132258.0141101e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008598072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2012.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinstädter, Jörg,10aNeolithisation process within the Alboran territory: Models and possible African impact  ap. 219-232.  aThe Neolithisation of the southern Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean Maghreb, here termed “Alboran territory”, must be considered as the same integrative process. By the mid-8th millennium calBP, both sides of the Western Mediterranean were inhabited by hunter-gatherer groups which probably maintained intercontinental contacts. However, from around 7.6 ka calBP, Neolithic groups from the Eastern Mediterranean arrived in the region along the littoral of what is today Andalusia. Neolithic innovations were adopted step by step by local Epipalaeolithic groups and subsequently dispersed via already existing networks. At the same time indigenous elements were integrated into this transitional process. The model presented here is supported by the available archaeological data from both sides of the Alboran territory. New ¹⁴C-data confirm the simultaneity of the Epipalaeolithic–Neolithic transition in southern Spain and northern Morocco. Results are discussed considering models and concepts from social anthropology dealing with migration and acculturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacculturation 3aanthropology 3alittoral zone 3amodels 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMaghreb 3aMorocco 3aSpain1 aMedved, Ines1 aSolich, Martin1 aWeniger, Gerd-Christian0 tQuaternary international.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 274 p.219-232dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008200160300001800242520089900260592002801159650003201187650001401219650002301233650001101256650002001267650001901287650000901306700002001315700002201335773012601357856007401483852000901557655001201566IND60745713420221118054352.0210723e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074571342DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc01333e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeller, Zachary10aAqueous redox flow batteries: How ‘green’ are the redox active materials?  ap. 4955-4979.  aEnergy storage using aqueous organic redox flow batteries (ORFBs) is gaining momentum in recent years parallel with the renewable energy industry, principally to store energy from solar, wind and hydro generation. The safety and environmental effects of active materials utilised in aqueous ORFB systems are vital to stay true to the ultimate aim of producing a ‘green’ technology. In this review, we evaluate the ‘greenness’ of the synthetic methodology employed to prepare the anolyte or catholyte active materials which have been developed for aqueous ORBFs using the 12 principles of green chemistry. Some of the most common synthetic strategies that will be discussed involve acid catalysis, catalyst free procedures, and oxidative polymerisation. Additionally, the ‘greenness’ of several key commercial materials with limited synthetic procedures published will be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative energy industry 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3apolymerization 3awind1 aJones, Lathe A.1 aManiam, Subashani0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 July 21, v. 23, no. 14 p.4955-4979dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc01333e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013000170300001400300520194200314592002802256650001102284650001702295650001902312650002002331650001702351650001902368650001102387650001602398650001902414650001502433650001102448650001402459650001602473650001602489650001702505650001802522650001502540650002502555650001302580650001502593650003602608700002002644700002102664773008902685856008402774990002302858852000902881655001202890IND60083791320221122153640.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008379132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.acthis.2009.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarducci, Paola10aReceptor Activator for Nuclear Factor kappa B Ligand (RANKL) as an osteoimmune key regulator in bone physiology and pathology  ap. 73-81.  aThe strength and integrity of the human skeleton depends on a delicate equilibrium between bone resorption and bone formation. Bone resorption is an elementary cellular activity in the modelling of the skeleton during growth and development. Later in life a most important physiological process in the skeleton is bone remodelling, which is locally initiated by resorption. During remodelling bone resorption is coupled to new bone formation that ensures renewal of bone with only minor local and temporary bone loss. Cells responsible for bone resorption and subsequent bone formation are the osteoclasts and osteoblasts, respectively. The osteoclast is derived from the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, which gives rise to a myeloid stem cell that can further differentiate into megakaryocytes, granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages and osteoclasts. The respective bone resorbing and forming actions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are finely coupled, so that bone mass remains remarkably stable in a healthy adult. Imbalance between osteoclast and osteoblast activities can arise from a wide variety of hormonal changes or perturbations of inflammatory and growth factors resulting in postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget's disease, lytic bone metastases, or rheumatoid arthritis, leading to increased bone resorption and crippling bone damage. In view of the critical role of osteoclasts in diverse pathology, there has been immense effort aimed at understanding the biology of this unique cell. The present review is focused on the current knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate the functional links between bone turnover and the immune system helping us to understand the main factors that lead to bone loss observed in osteoporosis, cancer and in rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this review paper is to consider the key molecular interactions involved in the formation of osteoclast cells in normal and pathological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abone density 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3agranulocytes 3agrowth factors 3ahumans 3amacrophages 3amegakaryocytes 3ametastasis 3amodels 3amonocytes 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3aosteoporosis 3apostmenopause 3aresorption 3arheumatoid arthritis 3askeleton 3astem cells 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aBareggi, Renato1 aNicolin, Vanessa0 tActa histochemica.g2011 Feb., v. 113, no. 2 p.73-81dElsevier GmbHx0065-12817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acthis.2009.10.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010000162300001400262520170700276592002801983650001502011650001502026650002402041650001202065650002602077650002202103650001102125650001602136650001102152650001502163650002002178650002402198650001302222650001402235650001402249650002802263650001002291650001802301650001502319650001402334650001402348650002102362650001302383650002202396650001002418650001602428650001202444653002402456653000902480653001402489653002002503700001602523700001502539700001702554700001502571700001502586773012002601856008302721852000902804655001202813IND60646260320221119141827.0190711e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064626032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubé, M.10aGene expression changes and toxicity of selected rare earth elements in rainbow trout juveniles  ap. 88-95.  aRare earth elements (REEs) are increasingly used in electronics industry and other areas of our economy and questions were raised about their impacts to the environment. The purpose of this study was to examine the lethal and sublethal toxicity of REEs in juvenile rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout. The fish were exposed to increasing concentrations (0.064, 0.32, 1.6, 8 and 40 mg/L) of the following 7 REEs for 96 h at 15 °C: cerium (CeCl3), erbium (ErCl3), gadolinium (GdCl3), lanthanum (LaCl3), neodymium (NdCl3), samarium (SmCl3) and yttrium (YCl3). The mortality were determined and in the surviving fish, 10 target gene transcripts were measured in the liver to track changes in oxidative stress, DNA repair, tissue growth/proliferation, protein chaperoning, xenobiotic biotransformation and ammonia metabolism. The data revealed that Y, Sm, Er and Gd formed a distinct group based on toxicity (mortality) and gene expression changes. Electronegativity was significantly correlated (r = −0.8, p < 0.01) with the lethal concentration (LC50). Gene expression changes occurred at concentration circa 120 times lower than the LC50 and the following transcripts in protein chaperoning (heat shock proteins), DNA repair (growth arrest DNA Damage) and CYP1A1 gene expression involved in the metabolism of coplanar aromatic hydrocarbons were involved. In conclusion, the study revealed that the more electronegative REEs were the most toxic to trout juveniles and produced sublethal effects at concentrations 2 orders of magnitude lower than the lethal concentrations. The toxicity of REEs depends on the elements were toxicity involves specific pathways at the gene expression level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aammonia 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiotransformation 3acerium 3aelectronics 3aerbium 3agadolinium 3agene expression 3aheat shock proteins 3aindustry 3ajuveniles 3alanthanum 3alethal concentration 50 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amortality 3aneodymium 3aoxidative stress 3asamarium 3asublethal effects 3atrout 3axenobiotics 3ayttrium 0aRare earth elements 0aFish 0aMortality 0aGene expression1 aAuclair, J.1 aHanana, H.1 aTurcotte, P.1 aGagnon, C.1 aGagné, F.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2019 Sept., v. 223 p.88-95dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010500166520143700271592002801708650002801736650001901764650001001783650001301793650001501806650002201821650001001843651002801853651001201881653001001893653001501903653002801918653001101946653002401957653002501981700002102006700002402027700002102051700001802072700001702090700003102107700006302138700006402201700006302265773011702328856008502445852000902530655001202539IND60741228620221119134749.0210812e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074122862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1017672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElias, Leta10aExtensive sex-specific and regional variations observed in the microbiome of Dermacentor reticulatus  aRecent progress in DNA sequencing technologies and advanced bioinformatic tools have enabled researchers to rapidly decipher the tick microbiome. To date, however, a number of microbiome studies performed on Dermacentor reticulatus ticks is still quite limited. Despite the importance of this ixodid tick for veterinary and human medicine, only two investigations have examined its microbiome. Moreover, these studies analyzed only a limited number of ticks/tick pools. Given the scarcity of microbiome data for D. reticulatus in general and the lack of microbiome studies on tick species from Eastern Europe in particular, the objective of the current investigation was to analyze the microbiome of D. reticulatus ticks collected from three geographical regions of Ukraine. A total of 88 individual tick microbiomes were analyzed by sequencing the V6 region of 16S rRNA. As a result, numerous significant differences in the bacterial relative abundance were detected between males and females of D. reticulatus for each region. The alpha diversity measures indicate that microbiomes were significantly different between females of D. reticulatus inter-regionally. In contrast, the collective results for male ticks are more suggestive of inter-regional microbiome homogeneity. The overall findings indicate that the composition and diversity of the D. reticulatus microbiome can be impacted by geographical and sex-related factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermacentor reticulatus 3abioinformatics 3amales 3amedicine 3amicrobiome 3aspecies diversity 3aticks 3aEastern European region 3aUkraine 0aTicks 0aMicrobiome 0aDermacentor reticulatus 0aEurope 0aMicrobial diversity 0aTick-borne pathogens1 aBlazier, John C.1 aRogovska, Yuliya V.1 aKonganti, Kranti1 aWang, Jiangli1 aLiu, Shuling1 aThieman Mankin, Kelley M.,1 aNebogatkin, Igor V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1451-462X1 aThreadgill, David W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3538-16351 aRogovskyy, Artem S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6499-79280 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2021 Sept., v. 12, no. 5 p.101767-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1017673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012900170300001600299500001500315520142900330592002801759650002101787650002401808650002901832650001301861650001701874650001701891650002201908650001901930650001401949650001801963650002401981650001502005651000902020653003102029700001902060700002102079700002002100700002402120773010302144856008102247852000902328655001202337IND50071788220221123033207.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007178822DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-2440-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyoubi, Shamsollah10aPasture degradation effects on soil quality indicators at different hillslope positions in a semiarid region of western Iran  ap. 375-381.  a2019-12-05  aA study was made to determine the influence of pasture degradation on soil quality indicators that included physical, chemical, biological and micromorphological attributes, along the hillslope positions in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, western Iran. Soil samples from different slope positions were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth for physical and chemical properties and from 0 to 15 cm depth for biological properties at two adjacent sites in the two ecosystems: natural pasture and cultivated land. Soil quality indicators including bulk density, mean weight diameter, soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic material (POM) in aggregate fractions, total nitrogen, available potassium, available phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, soil microbial respiration (SMR) and microbial biomass C and N were determined. The results showed that SOC decreased cultivation from 1.09 to 0.77 % following pasture degradation. The POM decreased by about 19.35 % in cultivated soils when compared to natural pasture; also, SMR and microbial biomass C and N decreased significantly following pasture degradation. Furthermore, aggregate stability and pore spaces decreased, and bulk density increased in the cultivated soils. Overall, our results showed that long-term cultivation following pasture degradation led to a decline in soil quality in all selected slope positions at the site studied in the semiarid region.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrogen content 3asoil organic carbon 3acation exchange capacity 3apastures 3asoil quality 3abulk density 3amicrobial biomass 3asemiarid zones 3apotassium 3asoil sampling 3aaggregate stability 3aphosphorus 3aIran 0aphysicochemical properties1 aEmami, Nazanin1 aGhaffari, Nasrin1 aHonarjoo, Naser1 aSahrawat, Kanwar L.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.375-381dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2440-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011100166520173200277592002802009650000802037650001102045650001902056650001802075650001102093650002402104653003402128653002402162653002202186653001902208653001802227700001402245700001802259700001502277700001402292700001902306773009002325856008502415852000902500655001202509IND60782792020221116143055.0221004e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078279202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1247732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwok, Woon,10aConcise analytical solution and optimization of compressed air energy storage systems with thermal storage  aThe evaluation of compressed air energy storage (CAES) system mostly focused on system efficiency and cost, while less attention has been paid to energy density in the past, and each performance expression was complex, making it difficult to obtain clear variation law of multiple indexes with key parameters, as well as the optimal coupling relationship among them. In view of the above problems, the research on concise analytical solution of CAES systems with thermal storage (TS-CAES) is carried out in this paper, in which a dimensionless pressure coefficient K and the parameter Z to describe thermal storage characteristics are established. Based on the above parameters and simplified model, the concise analytical expression of system efficiency and energy density for constant-volume and constant-pressure CAES systems are established. Based on the analytical expression, the influence law of each key parameter on the system evaluation indexes is revealed, and the optimal matching relationship of key parameters is obtained. It is revealed that without considering the heat exchange temperature difference, the system efficiency is only related to the thermal storage temperature, K and the efficiency of compressor/expander. The greater the temperature and K are, the higher the system efficiency is. The higher the temperature and pressure are, the higher the energy density of the two systems is. The energy density is more sensitive to the value of Z with lower temperature and higher pressure. It is also found that there is an optimal K under a certain temperature and pressure to maximize the energy density for constant-volume CAES, and the optimal value of K corresponding to 200 bar and 100 °C is 0.77.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3astorage temperature 0aCompressed air energy storage 0aAnalytical solution 0aSystem efficiency 0aEnergy density 0aOptimal point1 aXu, Yujie1 aHuang, Lujing1 aZhu, Yilin1 aLiang, Qi1 aChen, Haisheng0 tEnergy.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 258 p.124773-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1247733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007900172300001400251520091600265592002801181650001801209650001301227650002501240650002201265650001801287700002601305700002101331700002101352700001901373773008901392856008401481990002301565852000901588655001201597IND60083791520221122153602.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008379152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.acthis.2009.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordignon, Matteo14aThe role of immunohistochemical analysis in the diagnosis of parapsoriasis  ap. 92-95.  aParapsoriasis is a chronic dermatosis whose biological distinction from early mycosis fungoides, the most frequent form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is still not clearly defined. Two types of parapsoriasis have been delineated: large-plaque parapsoriasis and small-plaque parapsoriasis. The lack of clinical and histological features, which may allow distinguishing parapsoriasis from early mycosis fungoides has prompted several investigations to assess the role of immunohistochemistry in establishing a conclusive diagnosis of these conditions. However, the additional data obtained by immunohistochemical analysis concerning the CD4/CD8 ratio, the aberrant expression of T-cell antigens and the expression of proliferation markers has not generally helped establish a more definitive diagnosis. This review critically discusses these immunohistochemical markers and their use in diagnosis of parapsoriasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amycosis fungoides 3askin diseases1 aBelloni-Fortina, Anna1 aPigozzi, Barbara1 aSaponeri, Andrea1 aAlaibac, Mauro0 tActa histochemica.g2011 Feb., v. 113, no. 2 p.92-95dElsevier GmbHx0065-12817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acthis.2009.12.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245012500165300001800290500002000308520190400328592002802232596009302260596006102353596007202414596007202486650001602558650001202574650001502586650002202601650001602623650002002639650001002659650001202669650001102681650001702692650001502709650001502724650001202739650001702751650001402768650001702782700002002799700001602819700001902835700002002854700001802874700001902892700002902911700001602940700001902956700002402975700001702999700002603016700002303042700002103065700002203086700002003108773011203128856008003240852000903320655001203329IND60790299020221119025506.0220824e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029902DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimada, Hiroki10aHigh glucose stimulates expression of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and secretion of aldosterone in human adrenal cells  ap. 1410-1421.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAldosterone synthase is the key rate‐limiting enzyme in adrenal aldosterone production, and induction of its gene (CYP11B2) results in the progression of hypertension. As hypertension is a frequent complication among patients with diabetes, we set out to elucidate the link between diabetes mellitus and hypertension. We examined the effects of high glucose on CYP11B2 expression and aldosterone production using human adrenal H295R cells and a stable H295R cell line expressing a CYP11B2 5′‐flanking region/luciferase cDNA chimeric construct. d‐glucose (d‐glu), but not its enantiomer l‐glucose, dose dependently induced CYP11B2 transcription and mRNA expression. A high concentration (450 mg·dL⁻¹) of d‐glu time dependently induced CYP11B2 transcription and mRNA expression. Moreover, high glucose stimulated secretion of aldosterone into the media. Transient transfection studies using deletion mutants/nerve growth factor‐induced clone B (NGFIB) response element 1 (NBRE‐1) point mutant of CYP11B2 5′‐flanking region revealed that the NBRE‐1 element, known to be activated by transcription factors NGFIB and NURR1, was responsible for the high glucose‐mediated effect. High glucose also induced the mRNA expression of these transcription factors, especially that of NURR1, but NURR1 knockdown using its siRNA did not affect high glucose‐induced CYP11B2 mRNA expression. Taken together, it is speculated that high glucose may induce CYP11B2 transcription via the NBRE‐1 element in its 5′‐flanking region, resulting in the increase in aldosterone production although high glucose‐induced NURR1 is not directly involved in the effect. Additionally, glucose metabolism and calcium channels were found to be involved in the high glucose effect. Our observations suggest one possible explanation for the high incidence of hypertension in patients with diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data  a25461381cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan  cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)  a16H03252cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI  a16K15492cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI 3aaldosterone 3acalcium 3acell lines 3adiabetes mellitus 3aenantiomers 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3aluciferase 3ametabolism 3amutants 3anerve tissue 3asecretion 3atransfection1 aKogure, Naotaka1 aNoro, Erika1 aKudo, Masataka1 aSugawara, Kaori1 aSatō, Ikuko,1 aShimizu, Kyoko1 aKobayashi, M.q(Makoto),1 aSuzuki, Dai1 aParvin, Rehana1 aSaito‐Ito, Takako1 aUruno, Akira1 aSaito‐Hakoda, Akiko1 aRainey, William E.1 aItō, Sadayoshi,1 aYokoyama, Atsushi1 aSugawara, Akira0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Sept., v. 7, no. 9 p.1410-1421dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245017400173520177400347592002802121650001302149650001602162650001702178650000902195650002502204650002602229650000902255650001402264650001002278650001202288650001602300650001802316650001602334650004302350650001202393650001402405650001202419650002702431653001802458653002702476653003302503653002102536700001802557700001602575700001802591700001802609700001702627700001902644700001602663700001602679700002302695700001602718700001302734773009902747856009002846852000902936655001202945IND60749950920221119021216.0220704e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074995092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7374562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Tingting10aEffects of an alternating linseed oil-fish oil feeding strategy on growth, fatty acid restoration and expression of lipid related genes in black seabream (A. schlegelii)  aAn eight-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the influence of an alternating linseed oil (LO) and fish oil (FO) feeding strategy in black seabream A. schlegelii (initial weight, 8.49 ± 0.01 g). Two isonitrogenous and isolipidic feeds were formulated to contain FO or LO, and used to enable three feeding strategy treatments termed FO (feeding the FO diet for 8 weeks), LO (feeding the LO diet for 8 weeks) and FO re-feeding (feeding LO for 4 weeks then FO for 4 weeks). Fish in the FO re-feeding and FO groups had significantly higher final body weights (FBW), weight gains (WG), specific growth rates (SGR) but lower muscle lipid content than fish in the LO group. In muscle, the FO re-feeding strategy restored eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid contents to 82.67% and 83.84%, respectively, of those in fish fed the FO treatment. In addition, the FO re-feeding strategy significantly down-regulated the expression levels of genes related to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis and lipogenesis, including fatty acyl desaturase (fads2), elongase of very long-chain fatty acids 4a (elovl4a) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (srebp-1) compared to fish fed the LO treatment. Similarly, the hepatic Srebp-1c concentration in fish in the FO re-feeding group was markedly lower than in fish in the LO treatment group. Expression of the lipid catabolism gene adipose triglyceride lipase (atgl) was up-regulated in fish in the FO re-feeding group compared with fish in the LO group. Overall, the present study indicated that a strategy of re-feeding FO following feeding LO for four-week promoted growth, mitigated lipid accumulation in muscle, and effectively restored muscle n-3 LC-PUFA levels in A. schlegelii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparidae 3aaquaculture 3abiosynthesis 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afish 3afish oils 3agenes 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3alipid content 3alipogenesis 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3amuscles 3arefeeding 3asterols 3atriacylglycerol lipase 0aA. schlegelii 0aFatty acid restoration 0aFish oil re-feeding strategy 0aLipid metabolism1 aShen, Yuedong1 aLi, Xuejiao1 aPan, Tingting1 aLuo, Jiaxiang1 aLu, Jingjing1 aBao, Yangguang1 aWu, Zhaoxun1 aJiao, Lefei1 aTocher, Douglas R.1 aZhou, Qicun1 aJin, Min0 tAquaculture.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 547 p.737456-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7374563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001300157245017100170300001400341520093500355592002801290650001301318650001401331650001501345650001701360650001201377650001701389650001101406650001001417650001001427653002101437653002901458653002601487653001901513700001501532700001901547700002301566773011101589856009201700852000901792655001201801IND60646260520221119141851.0190712e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064626052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Min10aDetection of damaged wheat kernels using an impact acoustic signal processing technique based on Gaussian modelling and an improved extreme learning machine algorithm  ap. 37-44.  aWheat kernel damage is a major source of food quality degradation, and long-term feeding on products from damaged wheat kernels will result in malnutrition or even induce diseases. Therefore, detection of damaged wheat kernels is of significant interest. An impact acoustic signal processing technique based on Gaussian modelling and an improved extreme learning machine approach was proposed for detection of insect and sprout-damaged wheat kernels. Discriminant features extracted from Gaussian-model-estimated parameters were fed to an extreme learning machine based on a C-matrix embedded optimisation approximation solution. The best results, 92.0% of undamaged, 96.0% of insect-damaged, and 95.0% of sprout-damaged wheat kernels were correctly classified by using the proposed method. Furthermore, the detection system had good processing speed.

Temporal variations in the natural tracer²²²Rn and contaminant concentrations in groundwater contaminated with multiple chlorinated contaminants, such as trichloroethene, carbon tetrachloride, and chloroform, were examined to trace residual multiple DNAPL contaminants at an industrial complex in Wonju, Korea. The²²²Rn activities and multiple DNAPL concentrations in the groundwater fluctuated irregularly according to the groundwater recharge. The natural tracer²²²Rn in groundwater present in the soil layer, originating from the underlying crystalline biotite granite, had a wide range from 29,000 to 179,000 Bq/m³, and total concentrations of chlorinated solvents ranged from 0.06 to 17.77 mg/l, indicating the ambiguous results of²²²Rn for tracing the residual DNAPL sources. In this paper, a method is presented to locate zones with a high probability of containing depth-discrete residual multiple DNAPL sources using²²²Rn and considering relative contaminant concentrations. The results demonstrate that the combination of the²²²Rn activities as a natural tracer and the relative contaminant concentrations is able to be used as a useful tool for tracing residual DNAPLs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotite 3acarbon tetrachloride 3achloroform 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3agranite 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3aprobability 3aremediation 3asoil 3asolvents 3aKorean Peninsula1 aJun, Seong-Chun1 aKwon, Hyung-Pyo1 aLee, Kang-Kun0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.407-417dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2448-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009200169300001800261520190400279592002802183650001102211650001102222650001602233650001902249650002002268650003302288650002102321650001502342650001402357650001502371650002902386650002102415650001102436650000702447650001502454650001802469650001802487650001502505650002302520650001102543650001102554651002302565651001702588700002502605700002002630700002002650700001702670700001802687773009302705856008102798852000902879655001202888IND60555815120221119043631.0161029e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055581512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-016-0113-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOczkowski, Autumn10aComparing Measures of Estuarine Ecosystem Production in a Temperate New England Estuary  ap. 1827-1844.  aAnthropogenic nutrient enrichments and concerted efforts at nutrient reductions, compounded with the influences of climate change, are likely changing the net ecosystem production (NEP) of our coastal systems. To quantify these changes, scientists monitor a range of physical, chemical, and biological parameters sampled at various frequencies. Water column chlorophyll concentrations are arguably the most commonly used indicator of net phytoplankton production, as well as a coarse indicator of NEP. We compared parameters that estimate production, including chlorophyll, across an experimental nutrient gradient and in situ in both well-mixed and stratified estuarine environments. Data from an experiment conducted in the early 1980s in mesocosms designed to replicate a well-mixed mid-Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island) water column were used to correlate changes in chlorophyll concentrations, pH, dissolved oxygen (O₂), dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, and silicate concentrations, cell counts, and ¹⁴C carbon uptake measurements across a range of nutrient enrichments. The pH, O₂, nutrient, and cell count measurements reflected seasonal cycles of spring blooms followed by late summer/early fall respiration periods across nutrient enrichments. Chlorophyll concentrations were more variable and rates of ¹⁴C productivity were inconsistent with observed trends in nutrient concentrations, pH, and O₂ concentrations. Similar comparisons were made using data from a well-mixed lower Narragansett Bay station and a more stratified upper Narragansett Bay station in 2007 and 2008. Trends among pH, O₂, and nutrient concentration parameters were similar to those observed in the mesocosm dataset, suggesting that continuous free water measurements of pH and O₂ seem to reliably reflect ecosystem metabolism and, while not perfect measures, may be underused indicators of NEP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3ametabolism 3anet ecosystem production 3anutrient content 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphytoplankton 3aradionuclides 3ascientists 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3aNew England region 3aRhode Island1 aHunt, Christopher W.1 aMiller, Kenneth1 aOviatt, Candace1 aNixon, Scott1 aSmith, Leslie0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2016 Nov., v. 39, no. 6 p.1827-1844dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-016-0113-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011700163300001800280500002000298520135300318592002801671596006001699650001501759650001201774650001001786650001201796650002401808650002101832650001901853650001801872650001901890650001401909650001101923650001601934650001701950650001101967650001901978700001701997700001602014700001402030773011202044856008002156852000902236655001202245IND60790299320221119025608.0220824e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029932DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.125142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Xiaodong10aRab32‐related antimicrobial pathway is involved in the progression of dextran sodium sulfate‐induced colitis  ap. 1658-1668.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disease involving defective immune responses against invasive microbiota. Genes associated with innate immune responses to microbes have been highlighted in the pathogenesis of IBD. To determine the role of Rab32 in the pathogenesis of IBD, we administered dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to CD11c⁺ cell‐specific Rab32 knockout (CD11c‐Cre⁺Rab32ᶠ/ᶠ) mice to induce colitis. Rab32 deficiency in CD11c⁺ cells resulted in more severe disease progression and increased mortality. Histopathological analysis showed extensive damage to the colon mucosa in DSS‐treated CD11c‐Cre⁺Rab32ᶠ/ᶠ mice, including more severe damage to the epithelial layer and crypts, as well as more inflammatory cell infiltration. The pro‐inflammatory cytokines IL1A, IL1B, IL6, and CSF3 and chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 were significantly increased, and the frequency of CD11b⁺Ly6G⁺ neutrophils was higher in CD11c‐Cre⁺Rab32ᶠ/ᶠ colitis mice. Furthermore, CD11c⁺ cells deficient for Rab32 exhibited a significant increase in bacterial translocation in inflamed colon tissue. The present data demonstrate that Rab32 knockout in CD11c⁺ cells aggravates the development of DSS‐induced colitis and suggest that the Rab32‐related antimicrobial pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFA0502201cThe National Key R & D Program of China 3achemokines 3acolitis 3acolon 3adextran 3adisease progression 3adisease severity 3ahistopathology 3ainterleukin-6 3amicroorganisms 3amortality 3amucosa 3aneutrophils 3apathogenesis 3asodium 3asodium sulfate1 aNi, Qingshan1 aZhou, Daxue1 aWan, Ying0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2018 Oct., v. 8, no. 10 p.1658-1668dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.125143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04186naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011400172300001600286520213800302592002802440650004502468650002002513650001602533650002602549650002602575650003102601650002202632650001302654650001202667650001902679650002302698650001402721650002002735650002402755650001502779650002302794650002702817650002302844650002102867650001302888650001502901650001402916650002602930650001502956650001002971650001202981651001002993651001103003653003003014653002503044653002003069653001903089653003403108653004003142700002403182700002803206700002103234773015603255856008303411961000903494852000903503655001203512IND60646260720221119142019.0190830e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064626072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2019.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsposito, Daniel M.10aDifferential Species Responses to Aspects of Resistance to Invasion in Two Columbia Plateau−Protected Areas  ap. 773-782.  aProtected-area sagebrush steppe ecosystems are few in number and increasingly important to the North American conservation network as sagebrush steppe faces growing threats from land use, climate change, and invasive species. We analyzed the distribution and abundance of native perennial and invasive annual plants to better understand patterns of plant invasion within two protected areas: John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (JODA), located in central Oregon, and Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (CRMO), located in southeast Idaho. We used multivariate analysis to examine vegetation monitoring datasets and illuminate geographic variation in plant cover along gradients of well-known aspects of resistance to plant invasion (elevation, exposure [slope and aspect], precipitation and proximity to disturbance). Topographically mediated resistance to invasion appeared to manifest in the park with greater topographic variability (JODA), while increased elevation was more strongly associated with resistant sites in the park, which spanned a greater elevational gradient (CRMO). Factors that may mitigate moisture-mediated resistance also differed between sites. Slope and aspect were factors of apparent resistance for bunchgrass communities in JODA, while high crop year precipitation appeared to benefit medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae [L.] Nevski) and the weedy native subshrub broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae [Pursh] Britton & Rusby) over bunchgrasses and Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young). Increased elevation and distance to disturbed areas were the most important factors of resistance in forb-rich communities at CRMO, with the invasive annuals cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), tumblemustard (Sisymbrium altissimum L.), and Descurainia spp. Webb & Bethel. invading in low elevations and in close proximity to roads or agricultural fields. Such complexity underscores the idiosyncratic nature of the manifestation of resistance and the need for place-based empirical studies to provide information for guiding protected-area management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis 3aBromus tectorum 3aDescurainia 3aGutierrezia sarothrae 3aSisymbrium altissimum 3aTaeniatherum caput-medusae 3aagricultural land 3aaltitude 3aannuals 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3acrop year 3adata collection 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aempirical research 3ageographical variation 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aland use 3amonitoring 3amonuments 3amultivariate analysis 3aperennials 3aroads 3asteppes 3aIdaho 3aOregon 0aanthropogenic disturbance 0aArtemisia tridentata 0aBromus tectorum 0aColumbia Basin 0ainvasive species distribution 0atopographically mediated resistance1 aRodhouse, Thomas J.1 aMata-González, Ricardo1 aHovland, Matthew0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2019 Sept., v. 72, no. 5 p.773-782dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2019.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011400169500001900283520165400302592002801956650002201984650001402006650002302020650003502043650001102078650001902089650002602108650001102134651001202145653001802157653001702175653001702192653001502209653001602224653002202240700002102262700001902283700001902302700002002321773009802341856008502439852000902524655001202533IND60713298220221119172407.0201025e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071329822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.1023202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalkanen, Joel10aAnalyzing fair access to urban green areas using multimodal accessibility measures and spatial prioritization  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMaintaining enough green areas and ensuring fair access to them is a common planning challenge in growing and densifying cities. Evaluations of green area access typically use metrics like population around green areas (within a certain buffer), but these do not fully ensure equitable access. We propose that using systematic and complementarity-driven spatial prioritization, often used in nature conservation planning, could assist in the complex planning challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of spatial prioritization to identify green areas with highest recreational potential based on their type and their accessibility for the residents of the Helsinki Metropolitan area, the capital district of Finland. We calculated travel times from each city district to each green area. Travel times were calculated separately to local green areas using active travel modes (walking and biking), and to large forests (attracting people from near and far) using public transport. We prioritized the green areas using these multimodal travel times from each district and weighting the prioritization with population data with Zonation, conservation prioritization software. Compared to a typical buffer analysis (population within a 500 m buffer from green areas), our approach identified areas of high recreational potential in different parts of the study area. This approach allows systematic integration of travel-time-based accessibility measures into equitable spatial prioritization of recreational green areas. It can help urban planners to identify sets of green areas that best support the recreational needs of the residents across the city.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3ageography 3ametropolitan areas 3anatural resources conservation 3apeople 3aprioritization 3apublic transportation 3atravel 3aFinland 0aAccessibility 0aEquitability 0aGreen spaces 0aRecreation 0aTravel mode 0aZonation software1 aFabritius, Henna1 aVierikko, Kati1 aMoilanen, Atte1 aToivonen, Tuuli0 tApplied geography.g2020 Nov., v. 124 p.102320-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.1023203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014600170300001800316520120200334592002801536650002401564650002401588650001501612650001401627650002601641650001301667650001201680650001001692650001201702650000901714650001301723650001601736653002001752653001101772653001401783653002701797653001301824700001301837700005301850700001601903700001301919700001501932773013701947856008702084852000902171655001202180IND60637413420221122224055.0190606e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063741342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.04.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Fangmeng13aAn optimized cocktail of chitinolytic enzymes to produce N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine from defatted krill by-products  ap. 1029-1034.  aDefatted krill powder (DKP), the byproduct of krill oil industry, is a resource of biological macromolecules. Here, one bacterial protease, three bacterial chitinases and one insect N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidase were integratively used to produce peptide, N,N′-diacetylchitobiose [(GlcNAc)2] and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) from DKP. First, alkaline protease was found to outperform neutral protease in deproteinizing DKP and the resultant krill peptides were rich in essential amino acids (41.4%). Second, the mutant of chitinase A from Serratia marcescens [SmChiA-F232W/F396W (SmChiA-M)] was found to be 32% faster than wild-type SmChiA in hydrolyzing the deproteinized DKP (DDKP) and showed significant synergy with chitinase B from S. marcescens (SmChiB) and chitinase C from S. marcescens (SmChiC).

Thus, appropriate pre-treatments are needed for successful identification. Here, the bacteria in blood culture bottles were enriched using co-magnetic beads and processed for MALDI-TOF MS profiling. In this strategy, the Fc-containing mannose-binding lectin-coated Fe₃O₄ (Fc-MBL@Fe₃O₄) is incorporated with human IgG-coated Fe₃O₄ (IgG@Fe₃O₄) to form co-magnetic beads, which can recognize both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Compared to single magnetic beads Fc-MBL@Fe₃O₄ or IgG@Fe₃O₄, co-magnetic beads resulted in better bacterial capture efficiency and, therefore, could decrease the false-negative results. Our proposed strategy is much more suitable for enrichment of clinically unknown bacteria from blood culture bottles for MALDI-TOF MS database identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adesorption 3ahumans 3amagnetism 0aBacterial enrichment 0aFc-MBL 0aIgG 0aMagnetic beads 0aMALDI-TOF MS1 aShi, Haimei1 aFeng, Bin1 aQiao, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6233-84591 aDing, Chuanfan1 aYu, Shaoning0 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122472-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1224723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245007300153300001800226500002000244520116200264592002801426650000801454650001501462650001901477650001701496650001301513650001601526650001801542650001501560650001801575650002001593650001701613650002701630650002301657650001701680650002101697650001401718650000901732650002501741650000901766700001801775700001601793700001801809700001401827700001801841773012701859856007301986852000902059655001202068IND60588119120221120052058.0180103e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058811912DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.221392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie10aOxidative damage of naphthenic acids on the Eisenia fetida earthworm  ap. 1337-1343.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNaphthenic acids (NAs) have been gaining recognition in recent years as potentially harmful environmental contaminants. Few studies have focused on the potential ecotoxicity of NAs to terrestrial environment. In this study, the responses of antioxidant system and lipid peroxidation and DNA damage were investigated after exposing Eisenia fetida to soil contaminated with NAs. The results indicated that NAs induced a significant increase (p < 0.05) in superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme activities. The glutathione peroxidase enzyme activities were significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) in the medium and high dose treatments. An increase in malondialidehyde indicated that NAs could cause cellular lipid peroxidation in the tested earthworms. The percentage of DNA in the tail of comet assay of coelomocytes as an indication of DNA damage increased after treatment with different doses of NAs, and a dose‐dependent DNA damage of coelomocytes was found. In conclusion, oxidative stress caused by NAs exposure induces physiological responses and genotoxicity on earthworms. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The subcellular activity of these GTPases is regulated by dedicated activators (guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GEFs) and deactivators (GTPase-activating proteins, GAPs). RAPGEF5 is a potent activator of Rap proteins and mutations in RAPGEF5 have been linked to both neurological disorders and congenital heart disease. In the frog model, Xenopus tropicalis, Rapgef5 is a critical regulator of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway and is required for normal gastrulation and correct establishment of the left-right body axis. However, requirements for RAPGEF5 in other developmental contexts, and in mammalian embryogenesis in particular, remain undefined. Here, we describe RAPGEF5 mRNA expression patterns during mouse (E9.5 – E16.5) and human (Carnegie stage 21) development, as an initial step towards better understanding its developmental functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGTPase-activating proteins 3aXenopus tropicalis 3acell adhesion 3acongenital abnormalities 3aenzyme activity 3afrogs 3agastrulation 3agene expression 3aguanine nucleotide exchange factors 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aheart diseases 3ahumans 3amice 3amodels 3amutation 3anervous system diseases 3asignal transduction 0aRapgef5 0amRNA expression 0aRAP GTPase 0aGuanine nucleotide exchange factor1 aGriffin, John N.1 aLiu, Karen J.0 tGene expression patterns.g2019 Dec., v. 34 p.119057-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12408x1567-133X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gep.2019.1190573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002200183245013800205300001800343506007600361520149500437592002801932506003701960650001301997650001802010650001302028650001202041650002002053650002102073650001202094650001902106650001102125650001102136650001302147700001902160700001702179700001502196700001902211700001802230700001802248700001602266700001602282700002302298773009102321856008202412852000902494655001202503IND4487153120221207094559.0120502e20120507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448715312DNAL7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.20642doi7 aPMC32974542pmcid7 a221589542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunningham, J.

However, the fossils have been interpreted alternatively as giant sulphur bacteria similar to the extant THIOMARGARITA: To test this hypothesis, living and decayed Thiomargarita were compared with Doushantuo fossils and experimental taphonomic pathways were compared with modern embryos. In the fossils, as in eukaryotic cells, subcellular structures are distributed throughout cell volume; in Thiomargarita, a central vacuole encompasses approximately 98 per cent cell volume. Key features of the fossils, including putative lipid vesicles and nuclei, complex envelope ornament, and ornate outer vesicles are incompatible with living and decay morphologies observed in THIOMARGARITA: Microbial taphonomy of Thiomargarita also differed from that of embryos. Embryo tissues can be consumed and replaced by bacteria, forming a replica composed of a three-dimensional biofilm, a stable fabric for potential fossilization. Vacuolated Thiomargarita cells collapse easily and do not provide an internal substrate for bacteria. The findings do not support the hypothesis that giant sulphur bacteria are an appropriate interpretative model for the embryo-like Doushantuo fossils. However, sulphur bacteria may have mediated fossil mineralization and may provide a potential bacterial analogue for other macroscopic Precambrian remains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnimalia 3aThiomargarita 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aembryo (animal) 3aeukaryotic cells 3afossils 3amineralization 3amodels 3asulfur 3avacuoles1 aThomas, C.

In many cases, an ant has more than one of these information types available and may give priority to one mechanism over the others. We investigated how the ant Formica podzolica Francoeur makes use of polarized light during the initial stages of homing. When ants were displaced to an unfamiliar area, they spent significantly more time in the 90° arc centered on their perception of the direction to the nest. This preference was eliminated by modifying the ants' view of the sky with a polarizing filter, suggesting that F. podzolica use polarized light information. However, the displacements also showed that the ants make use of nest-specific information (possibly landmarks or snapshot matching) to recalibrate their homeward paths. When confronted with incompatible orientation information from polarized light in the sky and landmarks, the ant seems to reorient using landmarks, overriding the information from polarized light. 3aFormica 3ainsect behavior 3apolarized light 3ainsect nests 3aColorado 0ahoming behavior 0anavigation cues 0aorientation information 0adirection to nest1 aBreed, Michael D.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2008 Nov., v. 101, no. 6 p.1145-1149dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746-101.6.11453Available from publisher's Web site  a20081201b20081206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle02787naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010800159300001800267500002000285520150700305592002801812650001301840650002001853650003601873650001801909650001801927650002401945650001601969650000901985650001701994650001602011650002302027650003202050700001602082700002202098700001702120700001902137773012702156856007302283852000902356655001202365IND60588119220221120051944.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058811922DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.223402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jae‐Wook10aPolarized macrophages treated with nonylphenol differently regulate lipopolysaccharide‐induced sepsis  ap. 2081-2089.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNonylphenol (NP) as well‐known “endocrine disrupter” influences sexual and reproductive development. Here, we investigated the effect of NP on M1‐/M2‐type macrophages and their role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐induced sepsis. Polarized macrophages of M1‐ and M2‐types were obtained by the treatment with LPS and interleukin‐4 (IL‐4) to bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDM), respectively. Coincubation of M1‐macrophages with NP decreased COX‐2, iNOS, IL‐6, and TNF‐α expression but no changes were detected in the production of nitric oxide (NO). Survival probability of LPS‐induced sepsis mice was enhanced by the injection of NP‐treated BMDM as compared to the injection of NP‐untreated control BMDM. In the meanwhile, the expression of arginase 1(Arg1), a marker for M2‐polarized macrophages was increased by the stimulation with LPS in BMDM. Arg1 expression was also enhanced by the treatment with IL‐4 in BMDM, which was reduced by the coincubation with NP. Survival probability of LPS‐induced sepsis mice was decreased by the injection of BMDM treated with IL‐4 and NP as compared to the injection of IL‐4‐treated BMDM. It suggests that NP might inhibit macrophage function and the polarization to M2‐macrophages. Taken together, data demonstrate that NP could differently affect immune responses of polarized macrophages resulted in the modulation of LPS‐induced sepsis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Reported herein is the establishment of a strategy involving bimetallic catalysis to form such π-conjugated extended frameworks, specifically via the CoCl₂/Cu(OTf)₂-catalyzed double aerobic oxidative cycloaddition of indoles with p-hydroquinone ester. The crucial and distinct roles of the two metals salts and the alcohol solvent were clarified. This oxidation system enabled the disruption of the well-established acid-catalyzed quinone–indole [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction favoring benzofuro[2,3-b]indolines and is superior to previously known multi-step synthetic methods involving Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling with pre-functionalized (pseudo)halides. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the product were preliminarily investigated, the results of which suggested the potential of these polycyclic heteroaromatics to be used in efficient deep-blue organic light-emitting diodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3across-coupling reactions 3acycloaddition reactions 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3agreen chemistry 3aindoles 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3asolvents1 aZhang, Yulong1 aYu, Huaibin1 aWang, Bofei1 aZhao, Weining1 aZhong, Fangrui0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 July 21, v. 23, no. 14 p.5031-5036dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc01658j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245017600160300001800336520167000354592002802024650002402052650001202076650001702088650002802105650001402133650001402147650000902161650001902170650001902189650000702208650002002215650001102235650001702246650001402263650001302277650001502290651001002305700002102315700001602336700002002352700001402372700001802386773009302404856008102497852000902578655001202587IND60555815620221119043718.0161029e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055581562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-016-0094-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Min10aIron Reduction Along an Inundation Gradient in a Tidal Sedge (Cyperus malaccensis) Marsh: the Rates, Pathways, and Contributions to Anaerobic Organic Matter Mineralization  ap. 1679-1693.  aIncubation experiments were adopted to characterize the rates and pathways of iron reduction and the contributions to anaerobic organic matter mineralization in the upper 0–5 cm of sediments along a landscape-scale inundation gradient in tidal marsh sediments in the Min River Estuary, Southeast China. Similar sediment characteristics, single-species vegetation, varied biomass and bioturbation, distinct porewater pH, redox potential, and electrical conductivity values have resulted in a unique ecogeochemical zonation along the inundation gradient. Decreases in solid-phase Fe(III) and increases in nonsulfidic Fe(II) and iron sulfide were observed in a seaward direction. Porewater Fe²⁺ was only detected in the upland area. High rates of iron reduction were observed in incubation jars, with significant accumulations of nonsulfidic Fe(II), moderate accumulations of iron sulfides, and negligible accumulations of porewater Fe²⁺. Most of the iron reduction was microbially mediated rather than coupled to reduced sulfides. Microbial iron reduction accounted for 20–89 % of the anaerobic organic matter mineralization along the inundation gradient. The rate and dominance of microbial iron reduction generally decreased in a seaward direction. The contributions of microbial iron reduction to anaerobic organic matter mineralization depended on the concentrations of bioavailable Fe(III), the spatial distribution of which was significantly related to tidal inundation. Our results clearly showed that microbial iron reduction in the upper sediments along the gradient is highly dependent on spatial scales controlled primarily by tidal inundation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyperus malaccensis 3abiomass 3abioturbation 3aelectrical conductivity 3aestuaries 3ahighlands 3airon 3amineralization 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aredox potential 3arivers 3asalt marshes 3asediments 3asulfides 3avegetation 3aChina1 aZeng, Cong-Sheng1 aTong, Chuan1 aHuang, Jia-Fang1 aChen, Kai1 aLiu, Feng-Qin0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2016 Nov., v. 39, no. 6 p.1679-1693dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-016-0094-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009500175300001500270520094200285592002801227650001201255650001901267650000901286650001201295650001601307650001701323650001001340650001501350650001501365650001401380651002101394700002301415700002001438700002401458700003001482700001601512700002301528773009101551856008401642852000901726655001201735IND60085981720221123022017.0141101e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008598172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2012.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÜlgen, Umut Barış10aClimatic and environmental evolution of Lake Iznik (NW Turkey) over the last ∼4700 years  ap. 88-101.  aMagnetic susceptibility, geochemistry, mineralogy and palynology of sediments from Lake Iznik in Northwestern Anatolia, Turkey, provide a 4700 year record of climatic trends and events. The measured proxies allow a reconstruction of variations in humid/dry periods and lake level changes. The Lake Iznik sedimentary sequence points to an oscillating trend of humid periods interrupted by rapid climate change (RCC) to arid periods. Especially abrupt lithologic and geochemical changes at 4.2 and 3.3 ka calBP may outline intense droughts, which extremely lowered the lake level. For the last 2000 years, the effects of the Roman warm period, Dark Age cold period, Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age are recorded within Lake Iznik sediments. Besides many similarities of local climatic periods with other records from the Eastern Mediterranean, there are also differences indicating the complex pattern of the climate in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acold 3adrought 3aenvironment 3ageochemistry 3alakes 3amineralogy 3apalynology 3asediments 3aTurkey (country)1 aFranz, Sven Oliver1 aBiltekin, Demet1 aÇagatay, M.

Patients with NTM pulmonary disease can be falsely diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due detection of AFB in sputum and similar clinical and chest X-ray picture. Laboratory detection of NTM is complicated and does not always mean presence of the disease, but can be attributed to colonization or sample contamination. Molecular tests, such as Genotype Mycobacterium CM/AS, allow quick and reliable detection of NTM.To assess the NTM identification rate, to estimate the incidence of pulmonary NTM disease and to report the treatment outcomes among patients with NTM disease.Retrospective cohort design.NTM were detected among 92 (0.98 per 100,000 population) presumptive pulmonary TB patients in Arkhangelsk region in 2010–2017 among who 39 (0.42 per 100,000 population) patients were diagnosed with NTM disease. The most prevalent species found in our study were M. avium (33%) and M.intracellulare (11%). 69% of patients with NTM disease completed their treatment, 15% died, 13% were lost to follow up and 3% failed treatment.A system of diagnostics and treatment for NTM disease was set up in the Arkhangelsk region in Russia. Average NTM identification rate and incidence of pulmonary NTM disease were 0.98 per 100,000 and 0.42 per 100,000 population accordingly and were lower than reported in other studies.

Herein, a novel ether-free poly(p-terphenylene methylimidazole) (PTMIm) is synthesized by a facile one-pot Friedel-Crafts polyhydroxyalkylation of p-terphenyl and 1-methyl-2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde. The PTMIm has excellent organic solubility and good chemical stability towards high valence vanadium ions. Meanwhile, due to the present pendant imidazole groups, the PTMIm membrane exhibits a high sulfonic acid absorption capability, achieving a suitable area resistance (AR). In order to further enhance the performance of the PTMIm membrane, side-chain quaternization is carried out by using 1-bromopropane, 3-bromo-N,N,N-trimethylpropan-1-aminium bromide and 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride as quaternized reagents. Comparing with pure PTMIm membrane and propyl group grafted membrane (i.e. PTMIm-C₃), terminal quaternary ammonium side chain grafted membranes of PTM-C₃-QA and PTMIm-C₃-OH-QA possess lower AR and better vanadium ion resistance simultaneously. Consequently, the ion selectivity value of the PTMIm-C₃-QA membrane is 8.7 × 10⁵ S min cm⁻³, which is approximately 130 times higher than that of Nafion 115 (6.6 × 10³ S min cm⁻³), mainly resulting from its low AR (0.68 Ω cm²) and ultralow vanadium ion permeability (9.5 × 10⁻⁹ cm² min⁻¹). Meanwhile, both PTMIm and its grafted membranes exhibit excellent chemical stabilities within 400 h chemical stability test. Owing to the superior restriction on vanadium migration, the single cell with PTMIm-C₃-QA displays an excellent self-discharge duration of 500 h, which is greatly longer than that of Nafion 115 (58 h). In the range of 40–160 mA cm⁻², the PTMIm-C₃-QA based cell expresses higher coulombic efficiencies (>99.5%) and larger energy efficiencies than the cell with Nafion 115. For the cycling test of VRFB during 500 cycles, the PTMIm-C₃-QA based cell displays excellent cycle stability and good discharge capacity retention, indicating a great application potentiality of the PTMIm-C₃-QA membrane for VRFBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aammonium chloride 3abatteries 3aimidazole 3apermeability 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asolubility 3asulfonic acids 3avanadium 0aEther-free poly(p-terphenylene methylimidazole) 0aChemical stability 0aLong side-chain quaternary ammonium 0aIon selectivity 0aVanadium redox flow battery1 aTang, Weiqin1 aShi, Ning1 aWang, Guorui1 aWang, Tingting1 aWang, Ting1 aYang, Jingshuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0275-09780 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 659 p.120793-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1207933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013300169300001600302520135000318592002801668650002101696650001101717650001401728650002401742650001301766650001401779650001401793650004301807650001701850653001501867653001501882653001301897653001801910700002401928700002001952700002301972700006701995773011602062856008502178852000902263655001202272IND60646261220221119141915.0190830e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064626122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChetri, Shiela10aEffect of concentration gradient carbapenem exposure on expression of blaNDM-1 and acrA in carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli  ap. 332-336.  aEscherichia coli, one of the major pathogens, frequently exhibits carbapenem resistance. It would be of interest to investigate which of the mechanisms responds when a strain that carries both blaNDM-1 and over expressed AcrAB-TolC efflux pump system is exposed against carbapenem under differential concentration gradient stress. Four different sets of strains were used in the study; (i) Strain that have blaNDM-1 and over expressed AcrAB-TolC system (ii) Strain that harbour blaNDM-1 and express AcrAB-TolC at basal level (iii) the strain that is devoid of blaNDM-1 but having over expressed AcrAB-TolC systems and (iv) E. coli AG100A (ΔAcrAB) and E. coli HUE 1 (ΔAcrAB-TolC) where blaNDM-1was cloned. The Quantitative Real time PCR showed blaNDM-1 was over expressed under meropenem and imipenem stress irrespective of concentration gradient. In case of ertapenem, at lower concentration AcrA were over expressed whereas, at higher concentration blaNDM-1 showed elevated expression. A consistent elevated expression of AcrA and AcrB was observed against all carbapenems in the strains devoid of blaNDM-1 where as in case of the strain with basal level expression of AcrA, no significant over expression could be observed for blaNDM-1. In case of clones in group IV, expression of blaNDM-1 was elevated in the presence of carbapenem stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aclones 3aertapenem 3agene overexpression 3aimipenem 3ameropenem 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atransporters 0aCarbapenem 0aAcrAB-TolC 0ablaNDM-1 0aE. coli AG1001 aBhowmik, Deepshikha1 aDhar, Debadatta1 aChakravarty, Atanu1 aBhattacharjee, Amitabha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3111-98350 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2019 Sept., v. 73 p.332-336dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245007200172300001800244500002000262520087500282592002801157596002701185596006001212596004601272596001101318650000801329650001501337650001401352650001401366650003001380700006001410700006401470773011201534856008001646852000901726655001201735IND60790299820221119025352.0220824e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029982DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.124952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérébaskine, Natacha10aStructural and interaction analysis of the Rrp5 C‐terminal region  ap. 1605-1614.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRrp5 is an essential factor during the ribosome biogenesis process. The protein contains a series of 12 S1 RNA‐binding domains followed by a TetratricoPeptide Repeat (TPR) domain. In the past, several studies aiming at defining the function of the TPR domain have used nonequivalent Rrp5 constructs, as these protein fragments include not only the TPR module, but also three or four S1 domains. We solved the structure of the Rrp5 TPR module and demonstrated in vitro that the TPR region alone does not bind RNA, while the three S1 domains preceding the TPR module can associate with homopolymeric RNA. Finally, we tested the association of our Rrp5 constructs with several proposed interactors, in support of cryo‐EM‐based models.

Twenty-five Saanen goats were included in the study. Assessments were performed weekly from the 21ˢᵗ day of pregnancy until parturition. The abdominal, thoracic, biparietal, and eye socket diameters; distance from the neck to snout; crown-rump, humerus, radius-ulna, metacarpal, femur, tibia, metatarsal, and placentome lengths; kidney height and length; and heart area were measured. Heart rate was obtained using the pulsed Doppler mode. The variables were correlated with gestational age using Spearman's test, and the adjustment of these variables to simple and multiple regression models was done to determine the mathematical formulas for calculating the gestational age. The highest obtained coefficients of determination (R²) were for humerus length (96.2), heart area (95.6), and distance from the neck to the snout (95.3). Only the placentome length and fetal heart rate presented low determination coefficients (R² = 54.3, R² = 45.0). The results indicated significant correlations between measures of maternal-fetal structures and gestational age, and can be used as reference values for detection of abnormalities during fetal development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaanen 3aeyes 3afemur 3afetal development 3agestational age 3aheart 3aheart rate 3ahumerus 3akidneys 3ametacarpus 3aneck 3aparturition 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3atibia 3aultrasonics 0aUltrasonography1 aCirino dos Santos, Fabiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7340-50661 aCorreia Santos, Victor José1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6979-53801 aRodrigues Simões, Ana Paula1 aRamirez Uscategui, Ricardo Andres1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9760-86311 aPadilha-Nakaghi, Luciana Cristina1 aAmoroso, Lizandra1 aRussiano Vicente, Wilter Ricardo1 aRossi Feliciano, Marcus Antônio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4373-65390 tTheriogenology.g2021 Nov., v. 175 p.123-133dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2021.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009700161300001800258520082300276592002801099650002601127650001701153650003201170650001101202650002001213650001301233700002501246700002101271700003001292700002401322700002301346773012601369856007401495852000901569655001201578IND60745714420221118054344.0210723e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074571442DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc01783g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByrne, Fergal P.10aEnzyme-catalyzed synthesis of malonate polyesters and their use as metal chelating materials  ap. 5043-5048.  aFollowing the environmental problems caused by non-degradable plastics there is a need to synthesise greener and more sustainable polymers. In this work we describe, for the first time, the facile enzyme-catalysed synthesis of linear polyesters using dimethyl malonate as the diester. These polymers, containing a different aliphatic diol component (C₄, C₆ or C₈), were synthesised in solventless conditions using immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B as the biocatalyst. The potential of enzymes for catalysing this reaction is compared with the unsuccessful antimony- and titanium-catalysed synthesis (T > 150 °C). The application of the synthesized polymers as effective metal chelators in biphasic, green solvent systems was also described, together with the characterisation of the synthesised materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3abiocatalysts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aesters 3agreen chemistry 3asolvents1 aAssemat, Jamie M.

E. granulosus causes formation of cystic echinococcosis (CE) in humans. In the present study, the scolicidal effect of coelomic fluid extract solely, and in combination with TiO₂ and coelomic fluid + gonad extract was evaluated on the liver and lung contaminated with hydatid cysts in-vitro. The immunomodulatory effect of high scolicidal extracts on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and interleukin 5 (IL-5) was assayed. Methanolic coelomic extract was obtained and then, it was incubated with different concentrations of coelomic, coelomic + TiO₂, and coelomic + gonad extracts for different exposure times. Coelomic + gonad extract significantly decreased the number of protoscolices. Moreover, scolicidal activity of coelomic extract at 100 μl concentration of the drug was increased over time. The results of our study showed that immunomodulatory effect of coelomic + gonad and coelomic extracts significantly increased expression of TNFα and IFNγ at concentrations of 30 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively.

This receptor type is composed by GluN1 and different GluN2 (A, B, C or D) subunits. However, the receptor activity of HCY in brain regions which differ in relative contribution of GluN2 subunits was not tested so far.In the current study, we explored the action of HCY on cerebellar neurons which natively express GluN2C and GluN2D subunits of NMDARs and compared this with the action of HCY on cortical neurons which are mainly composed by GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. To validate obtained results, we also studied the responses to HCY in recombinant GluN1/2C and GluN1/2D NMDARs expressed in HEK293T cells. Responses to HCY were compared to membrane currents evoked by glutamate or by the specific agonist NMDA.First, we found that on HEK cells expressing GluN1/2C or GluN1/2D NMDARs, HCY was full agonist producing membrane currents similar in amplitude to currents induced by glutamate. The EC50 values for these particular receptor subtype activation were 80 μM and 31 μM, respectively. Then, we found that HCY similarly to NMDA, evoked large slightly desensitizing membrane currents in native NMDARs of cerebellar and cortical neurons. In cortical neurons, the ratio of the respective currents (IHCY/INMDA) was 0.16 and did not significantly change during in vitro maturation. In sharp contrast, in cerebellar neurons, the ratio of currents evoked by HCY and NMDA was dramatically increased from 0.31 to 0.72 from 7 to 21 day in culture. We show that least 75% of HCY-induced currents in cerebellum were mediated by GluN2C- or GluN2D-containing NMDARs. Thus, our data revealed a large population of cerebellar NMDA receptors highly sensitive to HCY which suggest potential vulnerability of this brain region to pathological conditions associated with enhanced levels of this neurotoxic amino acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acerebellum 3aglutamic acid 3ahomocysteine 3amedian effective concentration 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3areceptors 0aHomocysteine 0aNMDA receptors 0aGluN2C 0aGluN2D 0aCortex 0aCerebellum 0aTriheteromeric1 aGiniatullin, Rashid1 aAntonov, Sergei M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0644-93300 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 506, no. 3 p.648-652dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245015500175300001600330520095100346592002801297650001501325650002401340650001201364650002101376650003101397650001001428650002301438650003601461650001701497650002201514650001801536650003201554650001601586650003701602650001701639650002001656650003601676650003201712653002201744653001401766653002501780653002901805653001501834700001601849773013501865856008702000852000902087655001202096IND60637413820221120095843.0190606e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063741382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.04.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Aaron Taehwan10aAnti-inflammatory effects of vanadium-binding protein from Halocynthia roretzi in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages through NF-κB and MAPK pathways  ap. 732-738.  aVanadium-binding protein (VBP) was separated from the blood of the fresh sea urchin Halocynthia roretzi through (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, Diethylaminoethyl Sepharose fast-flow ion-exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl S-200 high-resolution size-exclusion chromatography. The protein size and purification yield of VBP were 27 kDa and 5.5%, respectively. VBP exerted anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages by downregulating iNOS expression and inhibiting nitric oxide production. VBP also suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. The anti-inflammatory activity of VBP was further demonstrated in the NF-κB and MAPK inflammation pathways, in which VBP inhibited phosphorylation of signaling proteins such as p65, JNK, ERK1/2, and p38. Therefore, VBP from H. roretzi has anti-inflammatory effects and could potentially be used to treat inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aHalocynthia roretzi 3aagarose 3aammonium sulfate 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood 3agel chromatography 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aion exchange chromatography 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3aphosphorylation 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAnti-inflammation 0aCytokines 0aRAW264.7 macrophages 0aVanadium-binding protein 0aSea squirt1 aKim, Dae-Ok0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 July 15, v. 133 p.732-738dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.04.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04050naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245017200209520178500381592002802166650001102194650001102205650001402216650002102230650001602251650002602267650001302293650001602306650001602322650001202338650001502350650001302365650002102378650001602399650001602415650002902431650002902460650001802489653000902507653000702516653000802523653000902531653000802540653000902548653000902557653000902566653000902575653000802584653000702592653000702599653000902606653000602615653000702621653000802628653000702636653000802643653001402651653000802665653002402673653000702697653000902704653001402713653000702727653000802734653002002742653002502762653002102787653002302808653001702831653001602848700001602864700001502880700001402895700001602909700001302925700001602938773012102954856008803075852000903163655001203172IND60749951720221119120712.0211015e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074995172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1046442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yuqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0772-257810aHigh temperature in the root zone repressed flowering in Lilium × formolongi by disturbing the photoperiodic pathway and reconfiguring hormones and primary metabolism  aLilium × formolongi, a facultative long-day (LD) plant, has precocious flowering characteristics, as it can flower within one year from seeds without the need for vernalization. Under normal LD conditions, the seedlings entered the flowering induction phase and bolted with 9−10 rosette leaves at 6 months after sowing. High temperature, especially at the root zone, inhibited bolting of the seedlings in LDs, accompanied by changes in plant shape and rapid expansion of underground bulbs. Low temperature in the natural environment could rapidly reverse the inhibition caused by high temperature, and promote bolting even under non-induced short days. The circadian clock and photoperiod pathways were disturbed at the transcriptional level by high temperature in both leaves and bulbs, such as LfCCA1, LfCRY, LfCOP1, LfFKF1, LfCOLs and LfPIFs. Thus, the flowering integrators LfFT1 and LfSOC1 were suppressed by high temperature. To determine the flowering inhibitors induced by high temperature in the root zone, the metabolome was analyzed under different conditions. ABA and ACC accumulation in the leaves and bulbs respectively during high temperature, was crucial to flowering inhibition possibly via interaction with the circadian clock and photoperiod-dependent pathways. Additionally, under high temperature conditions, D-allose, pentose and glucuronate interconversions and glutathione metabolism in the leaves were significantly activated. After cold exposure, TCA cycle was suppressed and SA, JA and some sugar (D-mannose, D-fructose, D-arabinose and maltotriose) levels were upregulated in the leaves, simultaneously with the vigorous fatty acid metabolism in the bulbs. These metabolic regulations were crucial to the phase transition under different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLilium 3aallose 3aarabinose 3acircadian clocks 3acold stress 3afatty acid metabolism 3afructose 3aglutathione 3amaltotriose 3amannose 3ametabolome 3apentoses 3aphase transition 3arhizosphere 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3avernalization 0aCCA1 0aCO 0aCOL 0aCOP1 0aCRY 0aDEGs 0aDEMs 0aELF3 0aFKF1 0aFLC 0aFT 0aGI 0aHTLD 0aL 0aLD 0aLHY 0aNE 0aNLD 0a(O)PLS-DA 0aPCA 0aRESPONSE REGULATORS 0aSD 0aSOC1 0aTCA cycle 0aVB 0aVIP 0aCircadian clock 0aFlowering inhibition 0aHigh temperature 0aLilium×formolongi 0aMetabolomics 0aPhotoperiod1 aZhang, Qian1 aLi, Jiewen1 aYan, Xiao1 aHe, Hengbin1 aGao, Xue1 aJia, Guixia0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2021 Dec., v. 192 p.104644-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1046443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245014200178520128000320592002801600650001101628650000901639650001301648650001101661650001101672653003701683653002201720653002301742653002001765700002401785700002501809700001901834700001901853700001801872700002401890773011201914856008502026852000902111655001202120IND60782793020221116142555.0220824e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078279302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1207972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalyanaraman, Jayashree10aFundamental modeling and experimental validation of hydrogen and oxygen transport through mixed ionic and electronic conducting membranes  aHydrogen transporting mixed ionic and electronic membranes offer tremendous opportunities for process intensification and energy savings in various applications such as reaction chemistries and heat/energy generation. Over the past several decades there has been significant advancement in the membrane materials science to produce improved molecular transport, but commercial adoption is still limited. To escalate implementation, a fundamental understanding of the solid state membrane transport and the water splitting phenomenon would bridge the gap for process conceptualization and design. This work presents a fundamental transport model, which quantifies the contribution of the water splitting phenomenon to the overall observed apparent flux of hydrogen and oxygen through ionic and electronic conducting membranes. The model predictions are rigorously validated against experimental data gathered in parallel. Membranes tested were based on the composition La₀.₈₇Sr₀.₁₃CrO₃₋δ-La₅.₄WO₁₂₋δ. These measurements include both apparent hydrogen/oxygen fluxes and the water splitting contributions over a range of operating conditions that included varying temperatures, hydrogen partial pressures, and hydration gradients across the membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aoxygen 0aMixed ionic-electronic membranes 0aMembrane reactors 0aHydrogen transport 0aWater splitting1 aMorejudo, Selene H.1 aKjølseth, Christian1 aBeeaff, Dustin1 aVigen, Camilla1 aJohnson, J.R.1 aMcCool, Benjamin A.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 660 p.120797-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1207973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001600191245011700207300001600324506007600340520185600416592002802272506003702300650001502337650001602352650000902368650001102377650002502388650000902413650001002422650001002432650002602442650001302468650001102481650001502492650002502507650001402532650001402546650001202560650001202572651001602584653002202600653002902622653002102651653001002672700001902682700001902701700001602720700006202736773011602798856008502914852000902999655001203008IND60646261520221207112612.0190830e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064626152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.06.0032doi7 aPMC71060882pmcid7 a311739322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOem, Jae-Ku10aGenetic characteristics and analysis of a novel rotavirus G3P[22] identified in diarrheic feces of Korean rabbit  ap. 368-377.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGroup A rotaviruses (RVAs) are important gastroenteric pathogens that infect humans and animals. This study aimed to analyze the complete genome sequence, i.e., 11 genome segments of the lapine rotavirus (LRV) identified in the intestine of a dead rabbit in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and to describe the genetic relationships between this lapine isolate [RVA/Rabbit-wt/KOR/Rab1404/2014/G3P[22] (Rab1404)] and other lapine isolates/strains. Rab1404 possessed the following genotype constellation: G3-P[22]-I2-R3-C3-M3-A9-N2-T3-E3-H3. The P[22] genotype was found to originate from rabbits and was for the first time identified in the ROK. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Rab1404 possessed VP1-3 and VP7 genes, which were closely related to those of the bat strain LZHP2; NSP1-4 genes, which were closely related to those of the simian strain RRV; and VP4, VP6, and NSP5 genes, which were closely related to the genes obtained from other rabbits. Interestingly, a close relationship between Rab1404 and simian RVA strain RVA/Simian-tc/USA/RRV/1975/G3P[3] for 8 gene segments was observed. RRV is believed to be a reassortant between bovine-like RVA strain and canine/feline RVA strains. Rab1404 and canine/feline RVAs shared the genes encoding VP1, VP3, VP7, NSP3, and NSP4. Additionally, the genome segments VP6 (I2), NSP1 (N2), and NSP5 (H3) of Rab1404 were closely related to those of bovine RVAs. This is the first report describing the complete genome sequence of an LRV detected in the ROK. These results indicate that Rab1404 could be a result of interspecies transmission, possibly through multiple reassortment events in the strains of various animal species and the subsequent transmission of the virus to a rabbit. Additional studies are required to determine the evolutionary source and to identify possible reservoirs of RVAs in nature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChiroptera 3aRotavirus A 3acats 3acattle 3adisease transmission 3adogs 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3agenotype 3ahumans 3aintestines 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3arabbits 3aviruses 3aSouth Korea 0aGroup A rotavirus 0aComplete genome sequence 0aLapine rotavirus 0aP[22]1 aLee, Soo-Young1 aKim, Young-Sik1 aNa, Eun-Jee1 aChoi, Kyoung-Seong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2271-53600 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2019 Sept., v. 73 p.368-377dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010200177300001300279520160000292592002801892650001601920650001801936650001101954650001601965650001601981650001501997650002202012650001602034650001402050650002002064651001102084700002502095700001902120700002402139773010402163856008102267852000902348655001202357IND60119307520221120063012.0150129e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011930752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-014-1735-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazubska-Przybył, Teresa10aEffect of partial drying and desiccation on somatic seedling quality in Norway and Serbian spruce  ap. 1735.  aSomatic embryo quality is still a problem for many researchers. To improve the efficiency of germination, special procedures are used, such as partial drying of somatic embryos at high relative humidity or desiccation in the presence of supersaturated solutions of salt. In this work, cotyledonary somatic embryos of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Serbian spruce (P. omorika) were placed on culture media (ME or BM-5) to germinate. We found that after 4 weeks of incubation on these media, hypocotyl and radicle growth of control (non-dried) somatic embryos of both species was not adequate to yield seedlings able to acclimatize to greenhouse conditions. Therefore, somatic embryos were partly dried at relative humidity of 97 % or desiccated at relative humidity of 79 %, for 2 or 3 weeks, and then placed on the Margara (ME) medium. Partial drying of somatic embryos at the higher relative humidity (97 %) enabled an improvement of radicle growth of germinating somatic embryos in both species. The highest conversion rate (45 %) was obtained for embryos of Norway spruce maintained for 2 weeks at relative humidity of 97 %. This treatment contributed to the improvement of germination and conversion efficiency of somatic embryos of Norway spruce, regardless of the drying period. Improved radicle growth facilitated development of better quality seedlings of this spruce species. In Serbian spruce, we did not obtain seedlings of sufficient quality, due to poor hypocotyl growth. Desiccation at humidity of 79 % for 3 weeks proved to be lethal to somatic embryos of both species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aculture media 3adrying 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3ahypocotyls 3arelative humidity 3aresearchers 3aseedlings 3asomatic embryos 3aNorway1 aWawrzyniak, Mikołaj1 aObarska, Agata1 aBojarczuk, Krystyna0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2015 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.1735-1735dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-014-1735-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012300171520166700294592002801961650001001989650001201999650001702011650001302028650001502041650001602056650001902072650002202091650001702113650002902130650001802159653001402177653003302191653001202224653002502236653003202261700001602293700001702309700001702326700002102343700005402364773012102418856008802539852000902627655001202636IND60749951820221119120805.0211015e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074995182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1046452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Zhongxin10aComprehensive discovery of salt-responsive alternative splicing events based on Iso-Seq and RNA-seq in grapevine roots  aAlternative splicing (AS) can enhance the adaptive capacity of organisms to respond to abiotic stresses via transcriptome plasticity; however, the mechanism underlying the responses of AS events to salt remains unclear in grapevine roots. In this study, an optimized genome annotation file was generated using Iso-Seq and RNA-seq data of grapevine roots. Based on the updated file, a total of 8,453 AS events across five types were identified in A17 grapevine roots, of which retained intron (RI) was the most dominant type. A total of 1,466 AS events affiliated with 1,113 genes responded to salt stress in grapevine roots. A global decrease in the proportion of inclusion isoforms was demonstrated, indicating that salt stress promoted the production of shorter isoforms. Only 206 salt-responsive AS events were affiliated with differentially expressed genes, indicating little overlap between transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation. A total of 672 and 410 AS events affected the length of protein products and miRNA binding, respectively. Differentially spliced genes were primarily related to RNA processing, nucleic acid binding, and ion channel activity. In addition, the salt-induced spliceosomal protein genes LSM2 and SRSF1 were identified, and their possible roles in regulating AS events were inferred. Moreover, we drafted an approach to explore possible interactions between AS and alternative polyadenylation (APA) using Iso-Seq data. Overall, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding of salt-responsive AS events in grapevine roots, providing insight into the molecular mechanism of salt tolerance in grapevine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3aintrons 3aion channels 3amicroRNA 3aplasticity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asequence analysis 3aspliceosomes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 0aGrapevine 0aIsoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) 0aRNA-seq 0aAlternative splicing 0aAlternative polyadenylation1 aLv, Xinning1 aSun, Yushuai1 aFan, Zongbao1 aXiang, Guangqing1 aYao, Yuxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9358-77300 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2021 Dec., v. 192 p.104645-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1046453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010000161300001600261520112700277592002801404650001501432650002501447650003501472650001601507650001301523650002201536650002401558650002801582650001801610653000901628653001101637653003901648653004201687653001301729653001401742653001401756700001201770700001501782700001301797700005801810700001401868700001801882700001301900700001301913700002101926700005701947773014602004856008202150852000902232655001202241IND60622539520221120072542.0181127e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062253952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Ran10aPrognostic significance of interferon regulating factor 4 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  ap. 685-691.  aAberrant expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) has been reported in several hematologic malignancies. However, the prognostic significance of IRF4 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unknown.IRF4 protein expression in ESCC tumor specimens was determined immunohistochemically. The correlation of IRF4 expression with clinico-pathological features was assessed from a cohort of 100 patients with primary ESCC. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between IRF4 expression and patient survival.A Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high IRF4 expression had a significantly longer overall survival rate than those with low IRF4 expression (p = 0.0006). Furthermore, multi-variate analyses revealed that IRF4 protein expression is an independent prognostic indicator for ESCC patients.Our results suggest that increased IRF4 protein expression correlates with improved outcome in ESCC. IRF4 may therefore represent a promising prognostic biomarker and potential immuno-therapeutic target for patients with ESCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterferon regulatory factor-4 3ainterferons 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3aregression analysis 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3asurvival rate 0aIRF4 0aCancer 0aEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma 0aTumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) 0aSurvival 0aPrognosis 0aBiomarker1 aYe, Lin1 aZhang, Min1 aQiu, Zhu1 aXiang, Tingxiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4589-05991 aTang, Jun1 aWang, Xiangyu1 aLi, Lili1 aLuo, Jie1 aZhang, Dongsheng1 aRen, Guosheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6416-89670 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 506, no. 3 p.685-691dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245010200215520157600317592002801893650002201921650001301943650001701956650000901973650001401982650001001996650001702006650000802023653001802031653002202049653002102071653002402092700003302116700006102149773012102210856008802331852000902419655001202428IND60749951920221119120705.0211015e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074995192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1046462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMourad, Amira M.I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6879-255910aGenetic variation in kernel traits under lead and tin stresses in spring wheat diverse collection  aPollution with heavy metals is a common problem worldwide that affects the growth of important crops and human health due to the consumption of contaminated crops. In the recent study, a set of 103 diverse spring wheat genotypes were evaluated for their tolerance to two important metals (lead and tin). The effect of these metals on kernel traits was measured to select tolerant and high-yielding genotypes. A great reduction in kernel length, kernel diameter, kernel width, and thousand kernel weight were found due to the effect of both metals. However, a highly significant correlation between the studied kernel traits was found suggesting their efficiency to indirectly select high yielding genotypes under heavy metals stress. In addition, the effect of the studied heavy metals on the physiological process was investigated and different responses to each metal were found suggesting that there are two different tolerant systems that the plant used to resist lead and tin. The selection of superior genotypes was done based on eight indices calculated for each studied kernel trait. Superior genotypes are those that were found to be tolerant based on all kernel traits. Based on this, one genotype, Gimmiza_11, was found to be highly tolerant to Sn and could be used as a parent in breeding for Sn tolerance. However, one genotype, BeniSweif_7, was found to be moderately tolerant to Pb based on only three kernel traits. Hence, searching for other sources of Pb tolerance in spring wheat is urgently needed. No genotype was found to be tolerant to both metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahuman health 3alead 3apollution 3aseeds 3aspring wheat 3atin 0aKernel traits 0aSelection indices 0aOxidative marker 0aAntioxidant enzymes1 aAmin, Abu El-Eyuoon Abu Zeid1 aDawood, Mona F.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1387-61350 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2021 Dec., v. 192 p.104646-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1046463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010300164300001800267500002000285520161900305592002801924596005601952596005702008596004202065596002102107650001102128650001302139650001802152650001902170650001502189650002002204650002502224650001602249650001902265650001402284650001402298650002002312650001802332650000902350650001802359700002702377700002602404700002102430700001902451773011202470856008002582852000902662655001202671IND60790300120221118233137.0220824e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079030012DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.125062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoussel, Elise10aMultiple short‐chain dehydrogenases/reductases are regulated in pathological cardiac hypertrophy  ap. 1624-1635.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCardiac hypertrophy (CH) is an important and independent predictor of morbidity and mortality. Through expression profiling, we recently identified a subset of genes (Dhrs7c, Decr, Dhrs11, Dhrs4, Hsd11b1, Hsd17b10, Hsd17b8, Blvrb, Pecr), all of which are members of the short‐chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily and are highly expressed in the heart, that were significantly dysregulated in a rat model of CH caused by severe aortic valve regurgitation (AR). Here, we studied their expression in various models of CH, as well as factors influencing their regulation. Among the nine SDR genes studied, all but Hsd11b1 were down‐regulated in CH models (AR rats or mice infused with either isoproterenol or angiotensin II). This regulation showed a clear sex dimorphism, being more evident in males than in females irrespective of CH levels. In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we observed that treatment with the α₁‐adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine mostly reproduced the observations made in CH animals models. Retinoic acid, on the other hand, stimulated the expression of most of the SDR genes studied, suggesting that their expression may be related to cardiomyocyte differentiation. Indeed, levels of expression were found to be higher in the hearts of adult animals than in neonatal cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, we identified a group of genes modulated in animal models of CH and mostly in males. This could be related to the activation of the fetal gene expression program in pathological CH situations, in which these highly expressed genes are down‐regulated in the adult heart.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOP‐61818cCanadian Institutes of Health Research  aMOP‐106479cCanadian Institutes of Health Research  cHeart and Stroke Foundation of Canada  cIUCPQ Foundation 3aadults 3aagonists 3aanimal models 3acardiomyocytes 3adimorphism 3agene expression 3aheart valve diseases 3ahypertrophy 3aisoproterenols 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoxidoreductases 3aphenylephrine 3arats 3aretinoic acid1 aDrolet, Marie‐Claude1 aLavigne, Anne‐Marie1 aArsenault, Marie1 aCouet, Jacques0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2018 Oct., v. 8, no. 10 p.1624-1635dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.125063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002200158245015500180300001600335520176700351592002802118650001502146650001702161650001602178650001702194650002102211650001002232650002302242650001702265650000902282650001902291700002002310700002002330700002302350700002102373700001602394773019302410856007302603852000902676655001202685IND60081330820221122031516.0150206e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008133082DNAL7 a249470122pmid7 a10.1111/tpj.125982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Sayaka10aTransport of rice cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase into mitochondria relies on a targeting sequence located in its C‐terminal internal region  ap. 951-963.  aThe cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), which represents a major type of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet‐B (UVB) radiation, is a principal cause of UVB‐induced growth inhibition in plants. CPD photolyase is the primary enzyme for repairing CPDs and is crucial for determining the sensitivity of Oryza sativa (rice) to UVB radiation. CPD photolyase is widely distributed among species ranging from eubacteria to eukaryotes, and is classified into class I or II based on its primary structure. We previously demonstrated that rice CPD photolyase (OsPHR), which belongs to class II and is encoded by a single‐copy gene, is a unique nuclear/mitochondrial/chloroplast triple‐targeting protein; however, the location and nature of the organellar targeting information contained within OsPHR are unknown. Here, the nuclear and mitochondrial targeting signal sequences of OsPHR were identified by systematic deletion analysis. The nuclear and mitochondrial targeting sequences are harbored within residues 487–489 and 391–401 in the C‐terminal region of OsPHR (506 amino acid residues), respectively. The mitochondrial targeting signal represents a distinct topogenic sequence that differs structurally and functionally from classical N‐terminal pre‐sequences, and this region, in addition to its role in localization to the mitochondria, is essential for the proper functioning of the CPD photolyase. Furthermore, the mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is characteristic of class‐II CPD photolyases, was acquired before the divergence of class‐II CPD photolyases in eukaryotes. These results indicate that rice plants have evolved a CPD photolyase that functions in mitochondria to protect cells from the harmful effects of UVB radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aOryza sativa 3aamino acids 3achloroplasts 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3amitochondria 3arice 3asignal peptide1 aTeranishi, Mika1 aIzumi, Masanori1 aTakahashi, Masaaki1 aTakahashi, Fumio1 aHidema, Jun0 tplant journal.g2014 Sept., v. 79, no. 6 p.951-963dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.125983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008000178300001400258520107700272592002801349650002101377650001601398650001901414650002701433650002101460650001801481650001301499651001001512700002601522700002601548773010101574856004801675852000901723655001201732IND50071789820221118030359.0140113e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007178982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-2695-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Martos, Francisco10aGroundwater–wetlands interaction in coastal lagoon of Almería (SE Spain)  ap. 67-76.  aWater resources management in coastal wetlands requires the degree of interdependence between groundwater and terrestrial ecosystems to be known. This is especially so in semiarid areas where surface inflows are restricted, marine influence is marked and the evaporation rate is high. Thus, chemistry of surface waters is very variable in the Cerrillos-Punta Entinas wetlands system. Using classical hydrogeochemical tools, the main processes that favor a diversity of water types were described, related to: presence of salt deposits on the lagoon beds, marine origin of the water, and local influence of groundwater. All these factors make it difficult to establish what reference conditions should be used to define “good” water quality of the surface waters—as required by the Water framework directive—and to understand the influence of groundwater on these coastal wetlands. Knowledge about the influence of the different interaction of these factors on the hydrogeochemical dynamics is required for the sustainable management of this protected natural site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation rate 3agroundwater 3asemiarid zones 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awater management 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aSpain1 aMolina-Sánchez, Luis1 aGisbert-Gallego, Juan0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.67-76dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2695-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007100169300001400240520152900254592002801783650001201811650001401823650001501837650001001852650001201862650001401874650002201888700003101910773009101941856008402032852000902116655001202125IND60085982320221123042252.0141101e20121010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008598232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2011.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrews, Peter10aBronze Age barrows at Longstone Edge: Taphonomy and site formation  ap. 43-54.  aThe taphonomy of the small vertebrate fauna from Longstone Edge is compared and contrasted with the site formation processes of the Bronze Age round barrows from which they were recovered. The microfauna may provide important clues about the site formation processes of the barrows, including access to and exposure of the structures in different periods. Two contexts, the earth barrow 1 and the burial cists beneath barrow 1, have rich small vertebrate faunas preserved, and taphonomic evidence of breakage and digestion provides evidence of two predators responsible for the accumulation of the faunas. The preservation context indicates that the predators were nesting or roosting on the ground. Three other contexts in barrow 1 (subsoil, stone mound underlying the earth mound, and a later fissure cutting across the mound) have only scattered remains, and barrow 2 also has dispersed remains. The taphonomy and site formation processes of the two Longstone Edge barrows complement each other, but the nature of the evidence from the two sources is quite different: taphonomy is a constructive discipline that adds information to animal and plant assemblages, shows what processes were operating in the past, and allows us to retrieve the original information of past ecosystems. Site formation processes and destruction of the structural elements that make up the barrows may show how the site was formed, and how it has deteriorated over time. Attempts to refer to both subjects as aspects of taphonomy are misguided.  aPublisher supplied data 3acutting 3adigestion 3aecosystems 3afauna 3anesting 3apredators 3aroosting behavior1 aFernández-Jalvo, Yolanda,0 tQuaternary international.g2012 Oct. 10, v. 275 p.43-54dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011900168300001400287520088900301592002801190650002301218650001301241650001201254650002001266650001201286650001101298650001101309650001501320650001401335650000901349650000901358650001401367650001101381650000701392650001701399650001101416650001301427650001001440650000901450651001001459653001901469653002301488653001901511653002401530700001501554700001901569700001801588700001801606773010401624856008701728852000901815655001201824IND60545626820221120200641.0160902e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054562682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHierro, A.10aTrace metal partitioning over a tidal cycle in an estuary affected by acid mine drainage (Tinto estuary, SW Spain)  ap. 18-28.  aThe Tinto River estuary is highly polluted with the acid lixiviates from old sulphide mines. In this work the behaviour of dissolved and particulate trace metals under strong chemical gradients during a tidal cycle is studied. The pH values range from 4.4 with low tide to 6.9 with high tide. Precipitation of Fe and Al is intense during rising tides and As and Pb are almost exclusively found in the particulate matter (PM). Sorption processes are very important in controlling the mobility (and hence bioavailability) of some metals and particularly affect Cu below pH6. Above pH~6 Cu is desorbed, probably by the formation of Cu(I)–chloride complexes. Although less pronounced than Cu, also Zn desorption above pH6.5 seems to occur. Mn and Co are affected by sorption processes at pH higher than ca. 6. Cd behaves conservatively and Ni is slightly affected by sorption processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adesorption 3aestuaries 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3apH 3aparticulates 3arivers 3asulfides 3atides 3azinc 3aSpain 0aRía of Huelva 0aAcid mine drainage 0aTrace elements 0aSorption/desorption1 aOlías, M.1 aCánovas, C.R.1 aMartín, J.E.1 aBolivar, J.P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 497-498 p.18-28dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010600161300001800267520172900285592002802014650001302042650001902055650001402074650001102088650001002099650001402109650001902123650000902142650001202151650001502163650001702178650001302195650001802208650001502226650001102241650002402252700001602276700001402292700001802306700001702324700002202341773014202363856007402505852000902579655001202588IND60642776220221120035639.0190508e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064277622DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb01621b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNigoghossian, K.10aUpconversion nanoparticle-decorated gold nanoshells for near-infrared induced heating and thermometry  ap. 7109-7117.  aThe present work involves the design of a multifunctional system based on gold nanoshells (AuNSs) decorated with lanthanide-based upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) intended as an optical heater and a temperature probe at the nanoscale. The synthesis of NaGdF₄ UCNPs doped with ions Yb³⁺:Er³⁺ was performed via thermal decomposition of lanthanide fluoride precursors at high temperatures (>300 °C) in the presence of a coordinating ligand (oleic acid). UCNPs were synthesized at three different temperatures (310, 315 and 320 °C) and characterized in terms of morphological, structural and emission properties. In view of the intended biological applications, the surface of hydrophobic oleate-capped UCNPs was modified using a silica coating to achieve sufficient water dispersibility, through a modified Stöber process using a reverse micro-emulsion method. Monodisperse NaGdF₄:Yb³⁺:Er³⁺ upconversion nanocrystals (∼25 nm dia.) were obtained in cubic (at 310, 315 °C) and hexagonal (at 320 °C) phases. The UCNPs in the hexagonal phase were shown to be more suitable as temperature sensors, due to their lower red-to-green emission ratios and higher thermal sensitivities. The emission spectrum of NaGdF₄:Yb³⁺:Er³⁺ (oleate- or silica-coated) UCNPs was recorded at different temperatures in the vicinity of the physiological range (20–70 °C) and presented suitable properties for application as temperature sensors, such as excellent linearity (r² > 0.99) and sensitivity (>3 × 10⁻³ K⁻¹). The heating capacity of AuNSs@UCNPs was verified by monitoring the Er³⁺ emission, showing their potential for application as a hyperthermia agent controlled using a nanothermometer function.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adispersibility 3aemulsions 3aerbium 3afever 3afluorides 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3aligands 3amonitoring 3ananocrystals 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3asilica 3athermal degradation1 aOuellet, S.1 aPlain, J.1 aMessaddeq, Y.1 aBoudreau, D.1 aRibeiro, S.

GEDI is equipped with 3 identical 1064 nm lasers with a power of 10 mJ per shot, where 1 laser is split into 2 lasers, resulting in two 5 mJ coverage lasers and two 10 mJ full-power lasers. In this study, we evaluate the potential of GEDI’s four lasers to penetrate through canopies and detect the ground, and their capabilities to detect the top of the canopies over a tropical forest (in French Guiana) characterized by a dense canopy cover and tall trees. The accurate detection of both of these surfaces is the first step in characterizing vertical forest structures. The SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is used as a reference point for elevations while a canopy height model (CHM), derived from airborne and spaceborne LiDAR data, is used as a reference for canopy heights. In addition, the ground and canopy-top elevations estimated from NASA’s Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS, 1064 nm full-waveform LiDAR, 5 mJ per shot, ~8 km altitude) are used as a benchmark for comparison with GEDI’s lasers. Results indicate that GEDI’s coverage and full-power lasers, even after the application of a preliminary filter that removes around 50% of acquisitions, tend to underestimate tree heights in densely vegetated, tall forests. Moreover, GEDI’s coverage lasers also exhibited a lower level of performance in comparison to both the full-power lasers and LVIS. Overall, the average estimated maximum canopy heights (RH₁₀₀) for a CHM greater than 30 m was 24.4 m with the coverage lasers, 32.1 m with the full-power lasers, and 36.7 m with LVIS. The analysis of shots with high-beam sensitivity (sensitivity ≥ 98%) showed that they tend to have a better probability of reaching the ground and have better detection of canopy tops for both GEDI laser types. Nonetheless, GEDI’s coverage lasers still showed an underestimation of canopy heights with an average RH₁₀₀ of 29.8 m, while for GEDI’s full-power lasers and LVIS, the average RH₁₀₀ was 35.2 m and 37.7 m, respectively. Finally, the assessment of the acquisition time on the detection of the ground return and the top of the canopies showed that, for the coverage lasers, solar noise could affect the detection of the ground return as acquisitions made during early mornings or late afternoons have more penetration than shots acquired between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. The effect of acquisition time on the detection of the tops of canopies showed that solar noise slightly affected the coverage lasers. Regarding the full-power lasers, the acquisition time of the shots seem to affect neither the penetration of the lasers, nor the detection of the tops of canopies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acanopy 3acanopy height 3adigital elevation models 3aecosystems 3aice 3alidar 3aprobability 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aFrench Guiana1 aBaghdadi, Nicolas 1 aLahssini, Kamel 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 21, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141329693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245007600167300001600243520132300259592002801582650001001610650001601620650001701636650001701653650001701670650001301687650002401700650002001724650003201744650000901776650002101785650001401806650003101820653002501851653001001876653003701886700001801923700001701941700001301958700001501971700001301986700001401999773011602013856008602129852000902215655001202224IND60551856220221122230045.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yipeng10aEnzymatic and thermodynamic analysis of calcineurin inhibition by RCAN1  ap. 254-260.  aCalcineurin (CN) is the target of the immunophilin–immunosuppressant complex, cyclophilin/cyclosporin A (CyP/CsA). RCAN1 has recently been shown to be an endogenous regulator of CN activity. We determined the enzymatic and thermodynamic aspects of CN inhibition by RCAN1. The IC50 values of isoforms RCAN1-1L and RCAN1-4 for CN were 2.7μM and 2.6μM, respectively. Two deletions in the CN catalytic subunit, one a deletion of Val314 in the Loop7 domain (ΔV314) and the other in the autoinhibitory domain (CNAabc), increased the sensitivity of CN to inhibition by RCAN1-1L. The IC50s of RCAN1-1L and RCAN1-4 for CN in homogenates of mouse brain were 141nM and 100nM, respectively. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we found that the RCAN1-1L/CN or CyP/CsA/CN interactions were exothermic with a dissociation constant of 0.46μM or 0.17μM, respectively. Our ITC results show that the interactions between CN and its two inhibitors were both characterized by a favorable binding enthalpy change. We also confirmed that overexpression of RCAN1-1L could inhibit the transcriptional activation of an NFAT-dependent promoter in response to PMA and ionomycin by inhibiting CN activity in HEK293T cells. Our data should contribute to our understanding of the regulation of CN activity by endogenous inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acalorimetry 3acyclophilins 3acyclosporine 3adissociation 3aenthalpy 3agene overexpression 3aheat production 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amice 3aprotein subunits 3atitration 3atranscriptional activation 0aCalcineurin activity 0aRCAN1 0aIsothermal titration calorimetry1 aJiang, Guohua1 aWang, Qianru1 aSun, Yue1 aZhao, Yane1 aTong, Li1 aLuo, Jing0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.254-260dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008400168300001400252520121400266592002801480650001701508650001001525650001701535650001201552650001901564650002901583650001101612650002001623650001201643650002201655650002001677650001101697650001301708650001801721651001101739700001701750700002201767700002401789700001801813773009201831856008101923852000902004655001202013IND60081787320221120111234.0141106e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008178732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-014-1202-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAy, Jean-Sauveur10aIntegrated models, scenarios and dynamics of climate, land use and common birds  ap. 13-30.  aReconciling food, fiber and energy production with biodiversity conservation is among the greatest challenges of the century, especially in the face of climate change. Model-based scenarios linking climate, land use and biodiversity can be exceptionally useful tools for decision support in this context. We present a modeling framework that links climate projections, private land use decisions including farming, forest and urban uses and the abundances of common birds as an indicator of biodiversity. Our major innovation is to simultaneously integrate the direct impacts of climate change and land use on biodiversity as well as indirect impacts mediated by climate change effects on land use, all at very fine spatial resolution. In addition, our framework can be used to evaluate incentive-based conservation policies in terms of land use and biodiversity over several decades. The results for our case study in France indicate that the projected effects of climate change dominate the effects of land use on bird abundances. As a conservation policy, implementing a spatially uniform payment for pastures has a positive effect in relatively few locations and only on the least vulnerable bird species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision support systems 3aenergy 3afarming systems 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3amodels 3apastures 3aprivate lands 3aFrance1 aChakir, Raja1 aDoyen, L.q(Luc),1 aJiguet, Frédéric,1 aLeadley, Paul0 tClimatic change.g2014 Sept., v. 126, no. 1-2 p.13-30dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1202-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100001900178245006500197300001600262520108200278592002801360650001201388650002001400650001501420650002501435650001701460650001101477650002101488650000901509650002601518650001501544650000901559650002101568650001201589650004301601650002701644650001901671650003801690650001501728650001101743650001801754650002701772650002001799650006701819650000901886650002301895650001901918650004901937650001501986650001402001650003602015650003202051650002402083650002002107650001702127651001202144651001002156700002002166700001902186700002402205700002202229700002002251700002302271700001902294773009602313856009302409990002302502852000902525655001202534IND60088893220221118075251.0141102e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008889322DNAL7 a221195382pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotterle, Anna10aInfluence of matrix metalloproteinase-12 on fibrinogen level  ap. 351-354.  aIn vitro studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12) can degrade fibrinogen, a clotting factor whose level predicts risk of advanced atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. In this study, we found that mean plasma fibrinogen level was approximately 10-fold higher in MMP12 knockout mice than wildtype mice (p=0.0006). Differential allelic expression analysis of human MMP12 gene polymorphism rs17368582 in human vascular tissues showed an allele-specific effect on MMP12 expression, with one allele (T) having 1.6 fold higher expression level than the other allele (C) (p=0.0006). In a population cohort, we found that individuals homozygous for the MMP12 low expression allele had higher plasma fibrinogen levels (2.95mg/mL compared with 2.61mg/mL in other individuals, p=0.029) and increased risk of advanced atherosclerosis [odds ratio 6.3 (95% CI 1.9–20.8), p=0.003] and myocardial infarction [hazard ratio 5.6 (95% CI 1.7–18.3), p=0.005]. In summary, our study in mouse and humans provides in vivo evidence of an effect of MMP12 on fibrinogen level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aatherosclerosis 3afibrinogen 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3aodds ratio 3arisk 3avascular tissues 2aAnimals 2aAtherosclerosisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aFibrinogenxmetabolism 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHomozygote 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aLogistic Models 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 12xdeficiencyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMyocardial Infarctionxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aOdds Ratio 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 0aEngland 0aItaly1 aXiao, Qingzhong1 aKiechl, Stefan1 aPender, Sylvia L.F.1 aMorris, Gareth E.1 aWilleit, Johann1 aCaulfield, Mark J.1 aYe, S.q(Shu),0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Feb., v. 220, no. 2 p.351-354dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245014200169300001600311520144300327592002801770650002301798650001201821650002401833650001501857650001101872650001801883650001301901650000901914650001201923653002501935653002801960653002301988653002902011700002302040700001902063700001702082700001902099773012402118852000902242856008202251655001202333IND4391968020221119035802.0200513e20070601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439196802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-007-0008-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiraki, Katsushige10aNumerical calculation of secondary discharge peak from a small watershed using a physically based watershed scale infiltration simulation  ap. 201-208.  aNumerical infiltration simulations were performed to reproduce secondary discharge peaks in a mountainous forest watershed (watershed area, 1.89 ha; average topsoil depth, 2.61 m; and bedrock geology, Mesozoic–Paleozoic) using a simplified physically based three-dimensional saturated and unsaturated water-flow model based on Richards' equation. We were able to calculate the quick discharge during rain and a secondary discharge peak at the watershed simultaneously, using observed topographical information, the topsoil depth distribution, and soil hydraulic characteristics, and by dividing the watershed by 2.5 m horizontally and ten cells vertically. Although the calculated hydrograph did not agree entirely with the observed hydrograph, we conclude that the characteristics of the observed hydrograph were explained with better accuracy using the smaller soil porosity patterns than using the observed patterns. We verified that the simulation method based on Richards' equation was effective to analyze the rainfall-runoff processes toward the intended watershed. Computational comparisons clarified that lower soil porosity quickens the timing of secondary discharge peaks and increases their volume. Additional examinations, such as the distribution of soil hydraulic characteristics and the actual condition of Hortonian overland flow, are necessary to simulate rainfall-runoff processes precisely at the intended watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRichards' equation 3abedrock 3aforested watersheds 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aporosity 3arain 3atopsoil 0aNumerical simulation 0aRainfall-runoff process 0aRichards' equation 0aSecondary discharge peak1 aShinomiya, Yoshiki1 aUrakawa, Rieko1 aToda, Hiroto1 aHaibara, Kikuo0 tJournal of forest research.g2007 June 1, v. 12, no. 3 p.201-208dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-007-0008-x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04206naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013500168300001600303520226200319592002802581650001602609650004302625650001302668650001302681650001802694650001702712650001702729650002402746650000902770650001602779650002002795650002502815650002002840650001002860650001602870650001602886650003102902650002202933650002302955650002202978650002403000650002903024650003303053650001503086650001603101650000903117650002003126650001703146650001503163650001703178650001803195650001203213650001303225651001303238700002503251700003203276700001803308700001603326773010003342856008103442852000903523655001203532IND60555695120221119091057.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055569512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-016-9895-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajper, Ahsan M.10aEffects of probiotics on soil microbial activity, biomass and enzymatic activity under cover crops in field and greenhouse studies  ap. 811-827.  aIntensive use of agro-chemicals over the past few decades has increased land productivity, however, frequent application of agro-chemicals has also resulted in some negative impacts on the environment and soil microbial biodiversity. Use of alternative management such as probiotics is believed to promote soil microbial biodiversity and enzymatic activity. This research was conducted at the Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Health Farm, Chariton County, Missouri to quantify probiotic effects on soil biological diversity and activity. Prior to 2012, the site was comprised of conventional corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation with tillage and chemical fertilizer use. Soil amendment with probiotics (Bio-Ag) included a non-treated control, and dosages at 60 L probiotic ha⁻¹ year⁻¹; 90 L probiotic ha⁻¹ year⁻¹; and 120 L probiotic ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ with three replications. Two equal split soil applications of probiotics were applied in September 2013 and May 2014. Soil samples were collected in August (pre-treatment), September 2013 and June 2014 from 0 to 6 cm depth. A greenhouse study was conducted using soil cores. Treatments were similar those in the field study except the low dose was excluded and higher dose of 150 L ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ was used. Soil microbial biomass and community structures were analyzed using phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Standard soil enzyme assays were used to assess microbial activity. Saprophytic fungi, protozoa and rhizobia biomass were significantly higher with 120 L probiotic ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ dose than control in the field study (p < 0.10). Total microbial biomass was significantly increased and saprophytic fungi biomass was more than two times higher with the 120 L ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ dose compared with the control in the greenhouse study at the December 2014 sampling. In the field study, principal component analysis revealed that PC1 and PC2 accounted for 62 % of total variance.

While the thinking-action relationship has been widely studied in psychology, there is a need to further investigate, from a geographical perspective, how structure shortens or widens the gap between pro-environmental intentions and actions in land management. In filling this need, we examine the structural factors reported to influence this intention-action link in a Costa Rican watershed recently designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve for its social-ecological importance. To this end, we draw on intensive fieldwork and land manager interview data. Research design was informed by theoretical and conceptual insights from social psychology, land systems science and political ecology. Results suggest a strong influence of diverse structural factors on the pro-environmental intention-action connection in land use in this social-ecological system, both as a facilitating and/or constraining force. More salient is the marked gap between intentions and actions among managers, largely influenced by market dynamics and incentive structures, land tenure policies, perceptions about government institutional performance, and deficient extension networks. These results highlight the need to “clear the way” for pro-environmental intentions to materialize into actions through selective structural measures, especially in social-ecological landscapes facing dire needs to reduce ecological impacts of productive systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3aconservation areas 3aecology 3aland tenure 3aland use 3amarkets 3apolitics 3apsychology 3awatersheds 0aPro-environmental intentions 0aCognitive-action mismatch 0aLand management 0aStructural factors 0aCosta Rica1 aAkhter, Majed0 tJournal of rural studies.g2020 Oct., v. 79 p.334-344dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.08.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011800170300001600288520087300304592002801177650004401205650002401249650001701273650002501290650002501315650002601340650002001366650002101386653002301407653002401430653001601454653002401470700002101494700001901515773011601534856008601650852000901736655001201745IND60551856520221122230012.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaomei10aCarboxymethylation of polysaccharides from Tremella fuciformis for antioxidant and moisture-preserving activities  ap. 526-530.  aThe carboxymethylated polysaccharide (CATP), which derived from water-insoluble crude Tremella fuciformis polysaccharide (ATP), was prepared.

The degree of substitution (DS) of four carboxymethylated derivatives were different with the molar of monochloroacetic acid. Their water solubility and biological activities were improved with the increase of DS.

In regard to structural health monitoring, vibration-based scour detection techniques have received increasing attention over the past two decades. Scour occurs below the water surface in rivers or sea, leading to difficulty in equipment installation and maintenance. Recently, the concept of “drive-by” SHM using the indirect measurement of passing vehicle responses has been developed rapidly due to its convenience and low cost. This paper proposes a method to detect scour using the vehicle responses under an operational vehicle speed. The wavelet transform was applied to vehicle accelerations to obtain the wavelet energy. It was found that the wavelet energy increases with the increase in the scour damage level. However, the wavelet energy may also be affected by the on-site operating environments, such as sensor noise and other variabilities, which interferes with the identification of scour in practice. Hence, in this work, a statistical-wavelet-based approach was presented to effectively detect the presence of scour and even its location. The feasibility of the proposed approach is verified in both numerical simulation and lab experiments. The results show that the proposed method has a good potential to detect scour using indirect measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequipment 3amathematical models 3awavelet1 aZhao, Hua 1 aTan, Chengjun 1 aOBrien, Eugene J.1 aFitzgerald, Paul C.1 aKim, Chul-Woo 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 28, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141331063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010300166300001600269520131600285592002801601650002101629650002301650650002001673650001701693650001601710650001201726650001601738650001401754650001701768650001401785653002201799653003401821653003401855653001601889653003101905700001401936700001301950700001601963700001501979700001701994700001302011700001202024700001602036700001602052700001402068700001602082700001802098773011102116856008602227852000902313655001202322IND60777412420221119181619.0220628e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077741242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Chao10aDual nanoenzymes loaded hollow mesoporous organotantalum nanospheres for chemo-radio sensitization  ap. 369-378.  aChemo-radiotherapy has been extensively used in clinics, displaying substantial advantages in treatment and prognosis. Stimuli-responsive biodegradable nanoagents that can achieve not only delivery and controlled release of chemotherapeutics, but also hypoxia alleviation to enhance chemoradiotherapy therefore has tremendous potential. Herein, glutathione (GSH)-responsive, biodegradable, doxorubicin-carrying hollow mesoporous organotantalum nanospheres modified with Au and Pt dual nanoenzymes (HMOTP@Pt@Au@Dox) were constructed for chemo-radio sensitization. Degradation of HMOTP@Pt@Au@Dox can be self-activated through GSH stimulation and on-demand release packaged Dox owing to the disulfide bond in the hybrid framework of organotantalum nanospheres. Au and Pt nanoenzymes triggered cascade catalytic reactions that could alleviate hypoxia by utilizing β-d-glucose and H₂O₂, thereby sensitizing ROS-based chemoradiotherapy with synergistic starving therapy. Given the radiosensitization of high-Z elements (Ta, Pt, Au), nanoenzymes induced cascade catalytic reaction for hypoxia relief, and the depletion of the predominant antioxidant GSH, desirable tumor suppression could be achieved both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that HMOTP@Pt@Au@Dox is a promising nanoagent to boost chemo-radiotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acatalytic activity 3adisulfide bonds 3adrug therapy 3aglutathione 3ahypoxia 3ananospheres 3aneoplasms 3aporous media 3aprognosis 0aChemoradiotherapy 0aGSH-responsive biodegradation 0aHypoxia-associated resistance 0aNanoenzymes 0aOrganotantalum nanospheres1 aLiang, Yu1 aSu, Ning1 aChen, Siwen1 aYuan, Zhen1 aChen, Yanqun1 aWu, Dong1 aWu, Bin1 aZhang, Yang1 aXu, Ziting,1 aZheng, Si1 aLi, Yingjia1 aZhao, Bingxia0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 July, v. 347 p.369-378dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011400167300001600281520140100297592002801698650001601726650002101742650002101763650003601784650001701820650003901837650001501876650002101891650001901912650002101931650001501952650002001967650001601987650002202003650002502025653003502050653004102085653003002126653003002156653003602186653002202222700001402244700001902258700001902277700001802296773011602314856008602430852000902516655001202525IND60551856620221122230050.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Chen10aBinding interaction between a queen pheromone component HOB and pheromone binding protein ASP1 of Apis cerana  ap. 430-436.  aThe honeybee's social behavior is closely related to the critical response to pheromone, while pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) play an important role in binding and transferring those pheromones. Here we report one known PBP, antennal special protein 1(ASP1), which has high affinity with a queen mandibular pheromone component, methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (HOB). In this study, multiple fluorescent spectra, UV absorption spectra, circular dichroism (CD) spectra and molecular docking analysis were combined to clarify the binding process. Basically, fluorescence intensity of ASP1 could be considerably quenched by HOB with an appropriate interaction distance (3.1nm), indicating that a complex, which is more stable in lower temperature, was formed. The fact ΔH<0, ΔS<0, by thermodynamic analysis, indicated the van der Waals and hydrogen bond as main driving force. Moreover, synchronous fluorescence spectra and CD spectra analysis showed the change of partial hydrophilicity of ASP1 and the increase of α-helix after HOB addition. In conclusion, ASP1 can strongly and spontaneously interact with HOB. But the binding ability decreases with the rise of temperature, which may be necessary for sufficient social stability of hives. This study provides elucidation of the detailed binding mechanism and potential physicochemical basis of thermal stability to the social behavior of honeybee.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis cerana 3abinding capacity 3abinding proteins 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahoney bees 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilicity 3amolecular models 3apheromones 3asocial behavior 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3avan der Waals forces 0aMethyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (HOB) 0aQueen mandibular pheromone component 0aPheromone binding protein 0aFluorescence spectroscopy 0aCircular dichroism (CD) spectra 0aMolecular docking1 aFu, Yuxia1 aJiang, Hongtao1 aZhuang, Shulin1 aLi, Hongliang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.430-436dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013800159300001400297520126800311592002801579650002601607650001401633650003901647650001001686650001301696650001601709650000901725650001001734650001801744650001801762700001701780700001701797700002701814700002701841700003301868773017901901856007302080852000902153655001202162IND60125935520221117234738.0150428e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593552DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadílek, David10aMolecular cytogenetics of Androctonus scorpions: an oasis of calm in the turbulent karyotype evolution of the diverse family Buthidae  ap. 69-76.  aRecent cytogenetic and genomic studies suggest that morphological and molecular evolution is decoupled in the basal arachnid order Scorpiones. Extraordinary karyotype variation has been observed particularly in the family Buthidae, which is unique among scorpions for its holokinetic chromosomes. We analyzed the karyotypes of four geographically distant species of the genus Androctonus Ehrenberg, 1828 (Androctonus australis, Androctonus bourdoni, Androctonus crassicauda, Androctonus maelfaiti) (Scorpiones: Buthidae) using both classic and molecular cytogenetic methods. The mitotic complement of all species consisted of 2n = 24 elements. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a fragment of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene, a cytogenetic marker well known for its mobility, identified a single interstitial rDNA locus on the largest chromosome pair in all species examined. Our findings thus support the evolutionary stasis of the Androctonus karyotype, which is discussed with respect to current hypotheses on chromosome evolution both within and beyond the family Buthidae. Differences in karyotype dynamics between Androctonus spp. and the other buthids can help us better understand the driving forces behind their chromosome evolution and speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndroctonus australis 3aevolution 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3agenomics 3akaryotyping 3aloci 3aoases 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA1 aNguyen, Petr1 aKoç, Halіl1 aKovařík, František,1 aYağmur, Ersen Aydın,1 aŠt̕áhlavský, František,0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 May, v. 115, no. 1 p.69-76dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245004400166300001600210520083800226592002801064650001801092650001901110650001501129650001101144650001201155650002201167650001301189650001201202650000901214650000901223650001701232650001601249650001501265650001801280653001401298653001101312653001101323653001001334653001201344653001801356773012301374852000901497856008201506655001201588IND4391078020221119040239.0200513e20041101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439107802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-004-0112-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaimowitz, David10aForests and water: a policy perspective  ap. 289-291.  aAsian policymakers need to know how changes in land uses and practices related to forests affect flooding, dry season stream flow, and water quality. Based on their beliefs about these relations, policymakers often ban logging or introduce expensive projects. Many key stakeholders believe that logging and deforestation increase flooding and the damage floods cause, but there is only evidence for this in relation to smaller and less severe floods. It is also widely believed that logging and clearing forest reduce dry season stream flow, but whether that actually occurs depends on rainfall patterns, soils, topography, geology, and the type of vegetation. Forests generally improve water quality, although not always. More research is needed on the magnitude of the water quality effects, particularly as regards drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeforestation 3adrinking water 3adry season 3afloods 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alogging 3arain 3asoil 3astakeholders 3astream flow 3atopography 3awater quality 0aHydrology 0aPolicy 0aFloods 0aWater 0aLogging 0aDeforestation0 tJournal of forest research.g2004 Nov. 1, v. 9, no. 4 p.289-291dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-004-0112-03Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03652naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015700161300001800318520223800336592002802574650002102602650001202623650001602635650004402651650001602695650001202711650002302723650001802746650001702764650002602781650000902807650001402816650001402830650002102844650002102865700001702886700001502903700001702918700002102935700001402956773014102970856007403111852000903185655001203194IND60642776720221120035641.0190508e20170802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064277672DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb01638g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Guangqiang10aPrecise correlation of macroscopic mechanical properties and microscopic structures of animal silks—using Antheraea pernyi silkworm silk as an example  ap. 6042-6048.  aAnimal silks, as one type of high performance natural material, display a unique combination of modulus, tensile strength, and extensibility that gives rise to a greater toughness than any other natural or synthetic fibers. Many previous researchers have already suggested that such excellent comprehensive mechanical properties should be closely related to their special molecular structures. In this paper, we provide more direct evidence to such an assumption by using Antheraea pernyi silkworm silk (tussah silk) as an example with synchrotron radiation FTIR microspectroscopy as a major characterization tool. Being a silkworm silk, A. pernyi silk has the same function as other silkworm silks (like common Bombyx mori silk), but on the other hand, its amino acid residue sequence is similar to that of spider dragline silk. Thus, A. pernyi silk can be a bridge between silkworm silk and spider silk that is worth investigating. Hence, in this research we designed different forcibly reeled A. pernyi silk samples by controlling the reeling rate, and subsequently tested their mechanical properties and then correlated them with their molecular structures and orientation degrees. Results show that the Young's modulus and breaking stress of forcibly reeled A. pernyi silks increased with the reeling rate, whereas the breaking strain was reduced. In the meantime, structure characterization revealed that the β-sheet content and molecular chain orientation in A. pernyi silk all increased significantly with an increase in reeling rate. In addition, the mechanical performance of A. pernyi silk can be altered from close to that of spider dragline silk to that of B. mori silkworm silk, with just a change of the reeling rate. All these phenomena clearly indicate that structural changes in A. pernyi silks contrived and controlled by reeling rate have a great effect upon their final mechanical properties. These observations further confirm that the mechanical properties of animal silks are able to be tuned by structure control during harvest time. Furthermore, the results obtained in this study may provide useful guidance when designing and producing high performance regenerated silk fibers for different applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntheraea pernyi 3aAraneae 3aBombyx mori 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aamino acids 3aanimals 3achemical structure 3aextensibility 3aharvest date 3amodulus of elasticity 3asilk 3asilkworms 3aspidroins 3asynthetic fibers 3atensile strength1 aTang, Yuzhao1 aQi, Zeming1 aYao, Jinrong1 aShao, Zhengzhong1 aChen, Xin0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Aug. 2, v. 5, no. 30 p.6042-6048dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb01638g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009400153300001800247520112100265592002801386650002101414650001001435650001201445650001201457650001401469650001801483650000701501650001901508650001301527650001101540650001601551650002101567700001701588700001601605700001801621700001801639700001701657773012101674856007401795852000901869655001201878IND60664147720221121031558.0190910e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066414772DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21408c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lei10aGlucose- and temperature-responsive core–shell microgels for controlled insulin release  ap. 9904-9913.  aIn this paper, a novel core–shell microgel was prepared based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid-co-dextran-maleic acid) (p(NIPAM-co-AAPBA-co-Dex-Ma)) coated silica nanoparticles via radical polymerization. The core–shell microgels presented glucose- and temperature-sensitivity, and the shell thickness could be easily regulated by the molar ratio of the comonomers. The polymer shell was active in drug loading as it underwent a distinct transition from a swollen state to a collapsed state as the temperature increased. Insulin was applied as a model drug and the behaviors of insulin loading/release were investigated. The insulin loading was temperature-dependent and up to 20%. The cumulative release of insulin in vitro showed that insulin release was dependent on glucose concentration. The glucose sensitivity of the microgels could be adjusted simply by adjusting the pH. The cytotoxicity assay indicated that the core–shell microgels have good biocompatibility. These results showed that the core–shell microgels have potential for a controlled insulin release system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3adrugs 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3amicrogels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asilica 3atemperature 3atoxicity testing1 aZhang, Xinge1 aZheng, Chao1 aWu, Zhongming1 aXia, Xiaoting1 aLi, Chaoxing0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 2, no. 26 p.9904-9913dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21408c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007300161300001600234520110300250592002801353650001201381650001001393650001801403650001701421650001401438650001001452650001201462650001701474650001301491700002501504700003501529773018101564856007301745852000901818655001201827IND60125935620221117234653.0150428e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593562DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDugas, Matthew B.10aBoth sexes pay a cost of reproduction in a frog with biparental care  ap. 211-218.  aThe assumption that reproduction is costly is central to life‐history theory. Good evidence supporting this premise comes from studies, mostly in short‐lived invertebrates, demonstrating a negative relationship between reproduction and longevity. Whether this trade‐off operates broadly, for example in males and females and in short‐ and long‐lived organisms, remains unresolved. We found a negative relationship between reproduction and days survived in captive, wild‐caught, individuals of a long‐lived poison frog with biparental care (Oophaga pumilio). The proportion of time that individuals spent paired and tadpole production rate were negatively associated with days survived in both sexes, and clutch production was negatively associated with days survived in females. These results broaden the taxonomic base upon which this tenet of life‐history theory is built, empirically confirm that females of this species should be choosy when selecting mates and caring for offspring, and suggest that the costs of ‘limited’ male care in this species deserve re‐evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3afrogs 3ainvertebrates 3alife history 3alongevity 3amales 3aprogeny 3areproduction 3atadpoles1 aWamelink, Caitlin N.1 aRichards‐Zawacki, Corinne L.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 May, v. 115, no. 1 p.211-218dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011800164300001800282520148100300592002801781650001501809650001301824650002901837650001601866650001501882650001501897650000901912650001901921650002601940650001401966650001101980650001301991650001002004650002102014650001102035653001202046653002102058653001502079653002902094653003002123700001702153700001602170700001402186773010602200856008402306852000902390655001202399IND60122705020221119202901.0150325e20141217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012270502DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9305152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArdau, C.10aChemical stabilization of metals in mine wastes by transformed red mud and other iron compounds: laboratory tests  ap. 3060-3073.  aA series of static and kinetic laboratory-scale tests were designed in order to evaluate the efficacy of transformed red mud (TRM) from bauxite refining residues, commercial zero-valent iron, and synthetic iron (III) hydroxides as sorbents/reagents to minimize the generation of acid drainage and the release of toxic elements from multi-contaminant-laden mine wastes. In particular, in some column experiments the percolation of meteoric water through a waste pile, alternated with periods of dryness, was simulated. Wastes were placed in columns together with sorbents/reagents in three different set-ups: as blended amendment (mixing method), as a bed at the bottom of the column (filtration method), or as a combination of the two previous methods. The filtration methods, which simulate the creation of a permeable reactive barrier downstream of a waste pile, are the most effective, while the use of sorbents/reagents as amendments leads to unsatisfactory results, because of the selective removal of only some contaminants. The efficacy of the filtration method is not significantly affected by the periods of dryness, except for a temporary rise of metal contents in the leachates due to dissolution of soluble salts formed upon evaporation in the dry periods. These results offer original information on advantages/limits in the use of TRM for the treatment of multi-contaminant-laden mine wastes, and represent the starting point for experimentation at larger scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3adrainage 3aenvironmental technology 3aevaporation 3afiltration 3ahydroxides 3airon 3airon compounds 3alaboratory techniques 3aleachates 3amixing 3arefining 3asalts 3atoxic substances 3awastes 0ared mud 0azero-valent iron 0amine waste 0alow-cost waste treatment 0acontamination attenuation1 aLattanzi, P.1 aPeretti, R.1 aZucca, A.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2014 Dec. 17, v. 35, no. 24 p.3060-3073dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.9305153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245006000162300001600222520113300238592002801371650001401399650002501413650001401438650001301452650001201465650001201477651000901489653001601498653001501514653001601529653002201545653002001567773012301587852000901710856008201719655001201801IND4391078420221119040430.0200513e20041101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439107842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-004-0108-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Don Koo10aInformation networking for new partnerships in forestry  ap. 299-305.  aEasy access to information is now an essential component of modern living in a changing society. These days, much of the information is disseminated through networking. Networking is required in collaborative partnerships between information providers and receivers to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and information. Partnership acts as a catalyst towards successful communication of information among users. There are many challenges and/or issues in the forestry sector, particularly in the developing countries. However, these issues can be resolved through new partnerships in networking such as the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF), Asia Forest Partnership (AFP), and Global Forest Information Service (GFIS). Activities in education, training, and research are especially vital for the future in order to develop better partnerships and networking of information in the forestry sector. The Japanese Forest Society, Chinese Society of Forestry, and Korean Forest Society may act as collaborative partners to initiate networking activities to bridge existing information gaps in the Northeast Asian regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adeveloping countries 3aeducation 3aforestry 3aforests 3asociety 3aAsia 0aInformation 0aNetworking 0aPartnership 0aChallenges/Issues 0aForestry sector0 tJournal of forest research.g2004 Nov. 1, v. 9, no. 4 p.299-305dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-004-0108-93Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01844naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003500145245004500180300001600225520067000241592002800911650001500939650002800954650001000982650003100992650002301023650001601046650001601062651001101078653003001089653002701119653002701146653001901173653002801192700002301220773012401243852000901367856008201376655001201458IND4395277420221119040224.0200513e20071001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439527742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-007-0035-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Queiroz Santana, Dalva Luiz10aIntroduced Eucalyptus psyllids in Brazil  ap. 337-344.  aIn the last 10 years, four species of psyllid were detected in Brazil on eucalypts: Ctenarytaina spatulata in 1994, Blastopsylla occidentalis in 1997, Ctenarytaina eucalypti in 1998 and Glycaspis brimblecombei in 2003.

The four eucalypt psyllid species introduced into Brazil are presented with information on distribution, hosts, biology and control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aGlycaspis brimblecombei 3ahosts 3aintegrated pest management 3aintroduced species 3aparasitoids 3aplantations 3aBrazil 0aBlastopsylla occidentalis 0aCtenarytaina eucalypti 0aCtenarytaina spatulata 0aEucalypt pests 0aGlycaspis brimblecombei1 aBurckhardt, Daniel0 tJournal of forest research.g2007 Oct. 1, v. 12, no. 5 p.337-344dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-007-0035-73Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03165naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011600170300001600286520194400302592002802246650001702274650001702291650001602308650001402324650001102338650001102349650001302360650002102373650004402394650001702438650001602455650002702471650000902498700002402507700001902531700002302550773009202573856008102665852000902746655001202755IND60080114320221120105841.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008011432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2119-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonanomi, Giuliano10aNitrogen transfer in litter mixture enhances decomposition rate, temperature sensitivity, and C quality changes  ap. 307-321.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Litter decomposition is a critical process in terrestrial ecosystems and, since in natural conditions plant litter occurs in mixtures, understanding the interactive effects of mixed litter is of great ecological relevance. In this context, we test the hypothesis that N transfer between high quality litter to N-poor substrates are at the base of synergistic interactions, positively affecting litter decay rate, temperature sensitivity, and changes of organic C quality. METHODS: We carried out a manipulative experiment using four organic substrates, encompassing a wide range of biochemical quality (Hedera helix and Quercus ilex leaf litter, cellulose strips and woody sticks), each decomposing either separately or in matched pair mixtures for 360 days. Organic substrates were characterized for mass loss, C and N content and by¹³C CPMAS NMR to assess biochemical quality changes. RESULTS: Litter response to mixing was related to the biochemical quality of the components in the mixture: additive when substrates with similarly high (H. helix and Q. ilex) or low (cellulose and wood) N content were paired, but synergistic when substrates with contrasting N content were associated (either of the two leaf litters with either cellulose or wood). Overall, no antagonist effects were observed in this experiment. Interestingly, decomposition of cellulose and wood showed an higher temperature sensitivity, compared to monospecific substrates, when paired with N rich materials. Significant N transfer was found from N rich litter to N poor substrates and¹³C CPMAS NMR showed rapid changes of C quality of cellulose and wood sticks only when paired with N rich litter. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that mixing litters of different quality, with quality expressed in terms of C/N ratio and N content, increases decomposition rate and temperature sensitivity of the lower quality substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHedera helix 3aQuercus ilex 3aantagonists 3acellulose 3aleaves 3amixing 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant litter 3atemperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awood1 aCapodilupo, Manuela1 aIncerti, Guido1 aMazzoleni, Stefano0 tPlant and soil.g2014 Aug., v. 381, no. 1-2 p.307-321dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2119-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015300165300001600318520134000334592002801674653002201702653003001724653001701754653002901771653002901800700002901829700002401858773009801882856008101980852000902061655001202070IND60544274120221119235832.0161025e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054427412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.als.2015.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZouari, Raida10aOptimization of Bacillus subtilis SPB1 Biosurfactant Production Under Solid-state Fermentation Using By-products of a Traditional Olive Mill Factory  ap. 162-169.  aBacillus subtilis SPB1 is known to produce a highly effective biosurfactant that belongs to the class of lipopeptides. This biosurfactant has shown relevant properties that could be efficiently applied in various domains. However, high production and purification costs limit the use of B. subtilis SPB1 in high-volume applications. The present work aimed to promote an economical production of this lipopeptide biosurfactant. Statistical experimental designs and response surface methodology were employed to optimize the concentrations of agro-industrial residues, inoculum size and humidity for B. subtilis SPB1 biosurfactant production under solid-state fermentation. The best production yield was approximately 30.67mg of crude lipopeptide biosurfactant per gram of solid material. This yield was obtained using a solid substrate ratio of 1.5, a moisture content of 90% and an inoculum size (OD600) of 0.08. These data support the utilization of a mixture of 6g of olive leaf residue flour and 4g of olive cake flour with a 10g total weight of the solid substrate. A mixture of two by-products of a traditional olive mill factory was demonstrated to be a suitable substrate for biosurfactant biosynthesis, providing enhanced bacterial growth and leading to a strong improvement in the yield of tensioactive lipopeptide production.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBacillus subtilis 0aLipopeptide biosurfactant 0aOptimization 0aCentral composite design 0aSolid state fermentation1 aEllouze-Chaabouni, Semia1 aGhribi-Aydi, Dhouha0 tAchievements in the Life Sciences.g2014 Oct., v. 8 p.162-169dElsevier B.V.x2078-15207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2015.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245007300181520127500254592002801529650002501557650001301582650001201595650001601607650002701623650001401650650001701664650001801681650002701699650003001726650003001756650001201786650001501798653001201813653001401825653001401839653001801853653001401871653001201885653002201897653003001919653002301949700006201972700002402034773010302058856008602161852000902247655001202256IND60710819520221119075733.0220103e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071081952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1044752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMungroo, Mohammad Ridwane10aMycobacterium leprae: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment options  aMycobacterium leprae is known to cause leprosy, a neurological and dermatological disease. In the past 20 years, 16 million leprosy cases have been recorded and more than 200,000 new cases were registered each year, indicating that the disease is still progressing without hindrance. M. leprae, an intracellular bacterium, infects the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system. Several types of leprosy have been described, including indeterminate, tuberculoid, borderline tuberculoid, mid-borderline, borderline lepromatous and lepromatous, and three different forms of leprosy reactions, namely type 1, 2 and 3, have been designated. Microscopic detection, serological diagnostic test, polymerase chain reaction and flow tests are employed in the diagnosis of leprosy. The recommended treatment for leprosy consists of rifampicin, dapsone, clofazimine, ofloxacin and minocycline and vaccines are also available. However, relapse may occur after treatment has been halted and hence patients must be educated on the signs of relapse to allow proper treatment and reduce severity. In this review, we depict the current understanding of M. leprae pathogenicity, clinical aspects and manifestations. Transmission of leprosy, diagnosis and treatment are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium leprae 3abacteria 3adapsone 3aminocycline 3amultibacillary leprosy 3aofloxacin 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3apaucibacillary leprosy 3aperipheral nervous system 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arelapse 3arifampicin 0aLeprosy 0aM. leprae 0aDiagnosis 0aPathogenicity 0aTreatment 0aVaccine 0aLeprosy reactions 0aErythema nodosum leprosum 0aLucio's phenomenon1 aKhan, Naveed Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7667-85531 aSiddiqui, Ruqaiyyah0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Dec., v. 149 p.104475-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1044753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245016700218520181800385592002802203650002102231650001902252650002002271650002302291650002602314650001502340650002202355650001802377650001002395650002202405650001702427650001902444650001602463650002002479650002202499650001402521653002102535653001802556653001502574653001402589653001802603653002202621700006602643700008102709700002802790700003202818700002902850773010302879856008602982852000903068655001203077IND60710819620221119075819.0220103e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071081962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1044772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrlandini, Renata Klemp1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4002-596910aAre Candida albicans isolates from the oral cavity of HIV-infected patients more virulent than from non-HIV-infected patients? Systematic review and meta-analysis  aCandida albicans is the main causative agent of oral lesions in HIV-infected patients and its oral colonization is a potential source of systemic dissemination. Although the high prevalence of lesions in HIV patients can be explained by the immunosuppressive condition, several studies have reported that natural selection can make C. albicans more virulent in this group of patients. Comparisons of the activity of exoenzymes (phospholipase, proteinase and hemolysin) in C. albicans isolated from HIV-infected and uninfected patients have yielded conflicting results. This study aimed, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, to answer the question: “Is the hydrolytic enzymatic activity of C. albicans, isolated from the oral cavity, different in individuals infected and not infected with HIV?” The question was addressed using the PECO framework: P (Population): children and adults, E (Exposure): HIV infection, C (Comparator): non-HIV-infected patients; O (Outcomes): exoenzymes activity i.e. phospholipase, proteinase and hemolysin. We conducted a systematic search on Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Livivo, Lilacs, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases, and Google Scholar. The MAStARI tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in the selected studies. From 2259 studies, 19 were included in this review and 11 comprised the meta-analysis. The activity of phospholipase (M-H = 0.15; Z = 2,76; p = 0.0006) and hemolysin exoenzymes (M-H = 0.07; z = 1,94; p = 0.05) was higher in C. albicans isolated from the oral cavity of HIV-infected patients, whereas the levels of protease activity were not different compared with non-HIV-infected individuals.This study showed a higher phospholipase and hemolysin activity in C. albicans isolates from the oral cavity of HIV-infected patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aHIV infections 3aenzyme activity 3aetiological agents 3aextracellular enzymes 3ahemolysins 3aimmunosuppression 3ameta-analysis 3amouth 3anatural selection 3apathogenesis 3aphospholipases 3aproteinases 3arisk assessment 3asystematic review 3avirulence 0aCandida albicans 0aPhospholipase 0aProteinase 0aHemolysin 0aHIV infection 0aSystematic review1 aBepu, Davi Ariel Nobuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8262-05151 aSaraiva, Maria da Conceição Pereira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6858-70291 aBollela, Valdes Roberto1 aMotta, Ana Carolina Fragoso1 aLourenço, Alan Grupioni0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Dec., v. 149 p.104477-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1044773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245013600165300001800301520178100319592002802100650002602128650001402154650002002168650001202188650001302200650001802213650001502231650002202246650001902268700002202287700002102309700001502330773014202345856007402487852000902561655001202570IND60642777220221120035637.0190508e20171011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064277722DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb01654a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, Sebastián A.10aUnderstanding energy transfer with luminescent gold nanoclusters: a promising new transduction modality for biorelated applications  ap. 7907-7926.  aUltrasmall noble metal and especially gold nanoclusters (AuNCs, ≤2 nm diameter in size) display a range of unique quantum confined and photophysical properties which are far different from their larger-sized nanoparticle counterparts or that of the bulk parent material. Amongst these properties, the photoluminescence of gold AuNCs has stimulated much interest for biological applications due to a combination of their small size, high photostability and range of emissions depending on size and surface stabilizing ligands, including near-IR emission. The dearth of robust Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donors and acceptors available to populate the latter spectral range is also driving strong interest in applying AuNCs for similar utility and especially for biosensing. However, the exact mechanism of how AuNCs engage in this type of energy transfer (ET) is still not defined and accumulating evidence indicates that it is not by a classical Förster process although, interestingly, many of the same characteristics and photophysical requirements seem to be present and even many-times required. Here, we summarize the state of the art in AuNC ET studies with a special emphasis on relevance to biological utility ranging from diagnostics to distance measurements along with describing the different ET mechanisms that have been ascribed with their use. Due to its corresponding importance in this discussion, we provide a brief overview of how these materials are synthesized, the current understanding of how their photoluminescence originates, and some related information on silver nanocluster (AgNC) ET along with related processes such as chemically-induced ET. A perspective and outlook on how this area will develop in the future is also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3aemissions 3aenergy transfer 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotostability1 aHastman, David A.1 aMedintz, Igor L.1 aOh, Eunkeu0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Oct. 11, v. 5, no. 39 p.7907-7926dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb01654a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245019100176300001600367520200100383536007802384592002802462596001602490650001802506650002702524650001502551650001502566650001402581650001002595650001902605650001002624650002602634650001502660650001102675650002302686650001602709650001002725651001302735653000902748653001202757653001802769653002102787653001502808700001902823700002202842773012802864856008602992852000903078655001203087IND60566915320221118012210.0220311e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056691532DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2016.12660352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergey, Elizabeth A.10aCharacterization of the diatom flora in the Lower Mountain Fork (Oklahoma, USA), a novel regulated river with a disjunct population of the diatom Didymosphenia geminata (Bacillariophyta)  ap. 225-237.  aRegulated rivers are novel ecosystems with altered temperature and flow regimes that can be used to test distribution patterns of microscopic organisms, such as diatoms. Our objective was to describe the spatial and seasonal patterns of diatoms in a cold-water, oligotrophic river within a region of warm-water, mesotrophic rivers. The Lower Mountain Fork, in south-east Oklahoma (USA), is maintained as a year-around, stocked fishery by the release of cold, hypolimnetic water from Broken Bow Lake and is the southern-most known site of Didymosphenia geminata in North America. Epilithic diatoms were sampled six times at nine sites over a distance of 15.5 km and, within this area, 27 times at the site of the main Didymosphenia bloom. Percentage composition data were analysed for assemblage composition using multivariate analysis, nutrient specificity using a diatom-based metric, and species associations using similarity profiles. Eighty-eight taxa were found, of which 10 were unidentifiable and included local undescribed species and species clusters. Three species [Gomphonema (parvulum morph), Achnanthidium rivulare and Achnanthidium minutissimum] comprised over 60% of the diatom abundance at all sites, and downstream and seasonal patterns were evident for both these and less abundant taxa. Notably, diatom assemblages in the three sites below the dam were similar to that at the lowermost site, below a much smaller dam. The oligotraphentic diatom assemblage reflected the water chemistry of the river. The Didymosphenia bloom had been scoured by a large spate prior to the study and the species was present at two of the nine sites in low numbers but failed to bloom during the study, possibly because of a trend towards increasing phosphorus concentrations in the reservoir (Didymosphenia blooms under low P concentrations). No other species shared Didymosphenia’s distribution pattern over the study reach, highlighting the novelty of Didymosphenia’s presence in the river.  aFunding was provided by NSF grant DEB-0447449 and Oklahoma EPSCoR to EAB.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB-0447449 3aAchnanthidium 3aDidymosphenia geminata 3aGomphonema 3aecosystems 3afisheries 3aflora 3ahydrochemistry 3alakes 3amultivariate analysis 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3awater 3aOklahoma 0adams 0adiatoms 0adistributions 0anovel ecosystems 0atailwaters1 aDesianti, Nina1 aCooper, Joshua T.0 tEuropean journal of phycology.g2017 Apr. 03, v. 52, no. 2 p.225-237dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000069x1469-44337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2016.12660353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024004600175040001800221100001200239245012300251300001400374520113000388592002801518596003501546650001201581650002301593650001101616650001501627650001101642650001501653650001701668650001101685651001101696651001401707651001801721651001801739651002001757653002201777653002501799653001101824653003301835700002101868773010301889856008601992852000902078655001202087IND60563376120221119124012.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056337612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.0362chorus7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.0362doi7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.0362chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Di10aPerformance of AMSR_E soil moisture data assimilation in CLM4.5 model for monitoring hydrologic fluxes at global scale  ap. 67-79.  aIn this study, we evaluated the performance of community land surface model (CLM4.5) to simulate the hydrologic fluxes, such as, soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff with (without) remote sensing data assimilation. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR_E) daily SM (both ascending and descending) are incorporated into the CLM4.5 model using data assimilation (DA) technique. The GLDAS data is used to validate the AMSR_E SM data and evaluate the performance of CLM4.5 simulations. The AMSR_E SM data are rescaled to meet the resolution of CLM4.5 model. By assimilating the AMSR_E SM data into the CLM4.5 model can improve the SM simulations, especially over the climate transition zones in Africa, East Australia, South South America, Southeast Asia, and East North America in summer season. The Local Ensemble Kalman Filter (LEnKF) technique improves the performance of CLM4.5 model compared to the directly substituted method. The improvement in ET and surface runoff simulations from CLM4.5 model assimilated with AMSR_E SM data shares similar spatial patterns with SM.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Department of Agriculture 3aclimate 3aevapotranspiration 3amodels 3amonitoring 3arunoff 3asoil water 3aspatial data 3asummer 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 3aSouth East Asia 0aData assimilation 0aAMSR_E soil moisture 0aCLM4.5 0aLocal Ensemble Kalman Filter1 aMishra, Ashok K.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Apr., v. 547 p.67-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015600166506031000322520118200632592002801814650001401842650001301856650002901869650000901898650001001907650002801917650002301945650002101968650002401989650001802013650001202031651001102043651002902054651002002083653001802103653001402121653002002135653002002155700002102175773011002196856008102306852000902387655001202396IND60478807820221119060117.0160114e20140912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047880782DNAL7 a10.4081/jlimnol.2014.10372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHARMA, Pranay10aEstablishment of Chydorus Sphaericus (O.F.

Müller, 1785) morphologically undistinguishable from European ones. Our genetic study of C. sphaericus from two large artificial water bodies in the Adelaide region of South Australia led us to conclude the taxon was introduced to Australia from Europe by human activity, at least in the two studied water bodies. To provide a comprehensive sister-taxa coverage and survey of intraspecific variation, our data were complemented by sequences on Chydorus sphaericus-group from GenBank and Barcode of Life Data Systems website. We speculate that it was related to a mass stocking of introduced species of fishes from Europe. To confirm whether C. sphaericus is an invasive species due to human-mediated introductions, or whether it is a native Australian taxon, further extensive molecular studies (involving nuclear genes) and detailed morphological comparisons are needed. This is a first report on the invasion of a non-daphniid species of Cladocera to Australia. Its significance for Australian ecosystems needs special future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aInternet 3aanthropogenic activities 3afish 3agenes 3aintraspecific variation 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aspecies recruitment 3asurface water 3asurveys 3aEurope 3aNorthern European region 3aSouth Australia 0aC. sphaericus 0aAustralia 0aNorthern Europe 0aSouth Australia1 aKOTOV, Alexey A.0 tJournal of limnology.g2014 Sept. 12, v. 74, no. 2dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx1723-86337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.10373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245004800164520167600212592002801888650002501916650002301941650001601964650002001980650003102000650001302031650003002044650001102074650001602085650002302101650002202124650000902146650001502155650001602170653001202186653002902198653004202227653002902269700002702298700002102325700002302346773011902369856008502488852000902573655001202582IND60727610420221119161235.0220816e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072761042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2021.1298672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aSUV39H2 controls trophoblast stem cell fate  aThe placenta is formed by the coordinated expansion and differentiation of trophoblast stem (TS) cells along a multi-lineage pathway. Dynamic regulation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is pivotal to cell differentiation for many cell lineages, but little is known about its involvement in trophoblast cell development. Expression of H3K9 methyltransferases was surveyed in rat TS cells maintained in the stem state and following differentiation. The role of suppressor of variegation 3–9 homolog 2 (SUV39H2) in the regulation of trophoblast cell lineage development was investigated using a loss-of-function approach in rat TS cells and ex vivo cultured rat blastocysts. Among the twelve-known H3K9 methyltransferases, only SUV39H2 exhibited robust differential expression in stem versus differentiated TS cells. SUV39H2 transcript and protein expression were high in the stem state and declined as TS cells differentiated. Disruption of SUV39H2 expression in TS cells led to an arrest in TS cell proliferation and activation of trophoblast cell differentiation. SUV39H2 regulated H3K9 methylation status at loci exhibiting differentiation-dependent gene expression. Analyses of SUV39H2 on ex vivo rat blastocyst development supported its role in regulating TS cell expansion and differentiation. We further identified SUV39H2 as a downstream target of caudal type homeobox 2, a master regulator of trophoblast lineage development. Our findings indicate that SUV39H2 contributes to the maintenance of TS cells and restrains trophoblast cell differentiation. SUV39H2 serves as a contributor to the epigenetic regulation of hemochorial placental development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell differentiation 3acell proliferation 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahistones 3aloss-of-function mutation 3alysine 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3astem cells 3atrophoblast 0aSUV39H2 0aHistone H3K9 methylation 0aTrophoblast stem cell differentiation 0aHemochorial placentation1 aChakraborty, Damayanti1 aIqbal, Khursheed1 aSoares, Michael J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 June, v. 1865, no. 6 p.129867-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2021.1298673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01360naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008600166300001300252500001400265520027100279592002800550650001300578650001000591650002800601650001000629650002000639653001600659653004900675653001500724653001500739653002200754700001700776773009100793856008000884961001300964852000900977655001200986IND60698690820221120175923.0210303e20140109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069869082DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.8.40402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJudith, Caroline10aRevised scientific names of the genus Hemileia (Pucciniales) based on the new ICN  ap. 1-10.  aNAL-light  aBased on the new International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, specifically the effective deletion of Article 59, we provide a list of the revised scientific names of species in the genus Hemileia (Pucciniales).

Although the key to their catalytic cycle is the fact that binding and positioning of primary substrate precede O₂ activation, the means by which substrate binding stimulates turnover is not well understood. Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH) is a Fe(II)/αKG-dependent oxygenase that acts as a cellular oxygen sensor in humans by hydroxylating the target residue Asn⁸⁰³, found in the C-terminal transactivation domain (CTAD) of hypoxia inducible factor-1. FIH-Gln²³⁹ makes two hydrogen bonds with CTAD-Asn⁸⁰³, positioning this target residue over the Fe(II). We hypothesized the positioning of the side chain of CTAD-Asn⁸⁰³ by FIH-Gln²³⁹ was critical for stimulating O₂ activation and subsequent substrate hydroxylation. The steady-state characterization of five FIH-Gln²³⁹ variants (Ala, Asn, Glu, His, and Leu) tested the role of hydrogen bonding potential and sterics near the target residue. Each variant exhibited a 20–1200-fold decrease in kcₐₜ and kcₐₜ/KM₍CTAD₎, but no change in KM₍CTAD₎, indicating that the step after CTAD binding was affected by point mutation. Uncoupled O₂ activation was prominent in these variants, as shown by large coupling ratios (C = [succinate]/[CTAD-OH] = 3–5) for each of the FIH-Gln²³⁹ → X variants. The coupling ratios decreased in D₂O, indicating an isotope-sensitive inactivation for variants, not observed in the wild type. The data presented indicate that the proper positioning of CTAD-Asn⁸⁰³ by FIH-Gln²³⁹ is necessary to suppress uncoupled turnover and to support substrate hydroxylation, suggesting substrate positioning may be crucial for directing O₂ reactivity within the broader class of αKG hydroxylases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adeuterium oxide 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydroxylation 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3airon 3aoxygen 3aoxygenases 3apoint mutation 3asuccinic acid 3atranscriptional activation1 aIvison, Geoffrey

This is accomplished by selfing, or selfing and testcrossing to N. tabacum, pentaploid F₁ interspecific hybrids of 8x N. tabacum ✕ 2x N. sylvestris and 8x N. tabacum ✕ 2x N. otophora.

We measured plant height, density, species richness and aboveground plant biomass (AGB) at the small (0.25 × 0.5 km), medium (0.5 × 0.5 km) and large (0.5 × 1 km) spatial scales in two adjacent plant communities (shrub- and grass-dominated) in desert steppe, Inner Mongolia. We used the geostatistical methods to examine the magnitude and degree of spatial heterogeneity of herbaceous vegetation characteristics with the increasing scale in both two plant communities. We found that compared to grass-dominated community, shrub-dominated community had the lower plant height and density at the large scale, the higher AGB at the small or medium scale, and the lower species richness at all three scales. Plant height, density and AGB in grass-dominated community were higher at the large scale than at the small scale, but they did not differ across three scales in shrub-dominated community. Species richness in both two communities were higher at the small scale than at the medium or large scale. All vegetation characteristics at three scales had the higher spatial heterogeneity in shrub- than in grass-dominated community. Spatial heterogeneity of all vegetation characteristics in shrub-dominated community decreased from the small to the large scale, while their spatial heterogeneity of plant height, density and species richness in grass-dominated community increased with the increasing scale. Our study highlights that shrub encroachment can simplify community composition and amplify spatial heterogeneity of herbaceous vegetation at multiple scales. Scale effects on spatial heterogeneity of herbaceous vegetation in desert steppe are dependent on plant community dominated by shrub or grass.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3ageostatistics 3agrasses 3aphytomass 3aplant communities 3aplant height 3ashrubs 3aspatial variation 3aspecies richness 3asteppes 3aChina 0aConceptual model 0aGeostatistical analysis 0aGrassland 0aMultiple spatial-scale 0aShrub community 0aSpatial dependence1 aMao, Wei1 aQu, Hao1 aChen, Min1 aZhao, Shenglong1 aLiu, Lianxu1 aWang, Shaokun1 aYue, Ping1 aMa, Xujun1 aZhao, Xueyong1 aMedina Roldan, Eduardo,1 aAllington, Ginger R.H.0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Aug., v. 127 p.107769-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1077693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245008900158300001800247500001500265520166400280592002801944650001901972650002601991650001602017650001302033650000902046650001102055650001302066650001202079650002202091650001502113653002302128653002302151653002802174653003802202700001702240700001902257700001102276773011302287856008002400852000902480655001202489IND60616440220221121023645.0181016e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061644022DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166585092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Su10aSmart E-textile: Resistance properties of conductive knitted fabric – Single pique  ap. 1669-1684.  a2019-12-06  aWearable electronics textiles are a new emerging phenomenon. These are textiles that incorporate electrical properties, for example heating, light emitting, sensing, etc., and are now being rapidly developed due to the creation of new types of fibers and fiber composites. The different ways that can be used to combine conductive fibers with electronics components have been receiving much attention in wearable electronics research. However, to meet the requirements for both aesthetics and function, textiles technology and the garment design method are important for commercial success. In order to apply electronics to fabrics with the use of conductive fibers, complex and elastic fabric structures both need to be modeled. Therefore, the focus of this study is to examine the resistance properties of single pique, a fabric that is conductive and has a knitted structure that uses tuck stitches, a typical structure in knitting. A planar geometric model is established for a single pique structure based on the loop construction of this knitted fabric. Subsequently, resistive network models are developed for different cases of external voltages to calculate the resistance values of single pique fabrics with different numbers of wales and courses. Corresponding experiments are carried out to verify the proposed resistive network modeling. The newly developed resistance model in this study will provide significant benefits to the industrialization of wearable electronics textiles and the apparel industry as they can offer commercial apparel products that are not only aesthetically pleasing and multi-functional, but also have high added value.  aPublisher supplied data 3atextile fibers 3aelectrical properties 3aelectronics 3aindustry 3aheat 3amodels 3aclothing 3afabrics 3aindustrialization 3aaesthetics 0aelectric potential 0ageometric modeling 0aresistive network model 0aconductive single pique structure1 aTong, Jiahui1 aYang, Chenxiao1 aLi, Li0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 14 p.1669-1684dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166585093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014900161300001800310500002000328500001500348520131800363592002801681650001801709650001801727650001801745650000901763650001201772650002701784650002001811650002801831650003101859650002001890650002001910650001601930650001801946650001801964650002701982650001102009650002802020653001002048700002002058700001602078700001902094700002402113773010902137856007302246852000902319655001202328IND60580118320221121115102.0170909e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058011832DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.127752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatun, Jannatara10aFatty acid composition, fat deposition, lipogenic gene expression and performance of broiler fed diet supplemented with different sources of oil  ap. 1406-1413.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aThe present study assessed the effect of feeding palm oil (PO), sunflower oil (SO) and their combination on performance, fat deposition, fatty acid composition and lipogenic gene expression of broilers reared for 42 days. A total of 144 1‐day‐old broilers (Cobb500) were randomly allotted into four treatment diets with each having six replicates of six chicks in each replicate following a completely randomized design. Live weight gain and feed efficiency was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in birds fed with a combination of oil sources compared to controls. Birds fed with the combination of oil and SO alone had higher carcass yield and lower abdominal fat. Higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and lower concentrations of palmitic acid and saturated fatty acid (SFA) was found in birds fed SO alone and combinations of SO and PO. Furthermore, the outcomes showed that birds fed diet supplemented with SO and the combination of SO and PO down‐regulated gene expression of key hepatic lipogenic enzymes of fatty acids synthase (FAS), acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACC) and stearoyl‐CoA desaturase (SCD). These findings suggest that the diet containing the combination of 2% PO and 4% SO may reduce hepatic lipogenesis, as well as lower abdominal fat content of broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid content 3asunflower oil 3acarcass yield 3adiet 3arearing 3afatty acid composition 3afeed conversion 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3agene expression 3aliveweight gain 3alipogenesis 3aabdominal fat 3apalmitic acid 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3achicks 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 0abirds1 aLoh, Teck Chwen1 aAkit, Henny1 aFoo, Hooi Ling1 aMohamad, Rosfarizan0 tAnimal science journal =.g2017 Sept., v. 88, no. 9 p.1406-1413dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.127753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002100173245010800194300001600302520187300318592002802191650002302219650002002242650002402262650001602286650001302302650002302315650002602338650001502364650001002379650001602389650004802405650004802453650001102501650001102512650000902523650001602532650002602548650005502574650002802629650004002657650003302697651002902730700002402759773010702783856005502890852000902945655001202954IND50064712620221120172614.0130408e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006471262DNAL7 a235516432pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.2012.00419.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Hayden L.10aTrauma Patients Over‐Triaged to Helicopter Transport in an Established Midwestern State Trauma System  ap. 132-139.  aPurpose: To characterize helicopter transport use in a mature Midwestern trauma system located in a low population density state, examine characteristics of patients over‐triaged to helicopter transport, and determine predictors of over‐triage to helicopter transport. Methods: A retrospective observational study conducted using State Trauma Registry data for years 2008‐2009. Study sample included patients with medical helicopter transportation. Bivariate analyses compared patients defined and not defined as over‐triaged to helicopter transport. Multivariate regression was used to determine predictors of over‐triage. Findings: Of the 2,084 helicopter‐transported study patients, 552 (26%) were defined as over‐triaged. Differences in patients based on over‐triaged status included race, age, injury mechanism, injury type, and injury intent (P < .05). Multivariate‐based significant predictors of over‐triage were transfer status, patient age, and injury mechanism (P= .0223; <.0001; and .0007, respectively). Patients transported from scene had a greater odds (OR: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.60) of being over‐triaged to helicopter transport than interfacility transfers. Younger patients were also more likely to be over‐triaged. Interactions between patient age and injury mechanism demonstrated varied likelihoods for over‐triage. Younger patients injured in falls were more likely over‐triaged than younger patients injured in a motor vehicle crash or by other non‐fall causes. Conclusion: Study data showed over‐triage to helicopter transport was substantial in a mature trauma system. It is recommended that trauma systems develop and monitor compliance with criteria for appropriate use of air medical transport. These actions can assist in refinements to prehospital and interfacility transfer protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair transportation 3aanimal injuries 3aconfidence interval 3ahelicopters 3apatients 3apopulation density 3aretrospective studies 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAir Ambulancesxstatistics & numerical data 2aRacial Groupsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRetrospective Studies 2aRural Health Servicesxstatistics & numerical data 2aTrauma Severity Indices 2aTriagexstatistics & numerical data 2aWounds and Injuriesxtherapy 0aMidwestern United States1 aSidwell, Richard A.0 tJournal of rural health.g2013 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.132-139dBlackwell Publishing Incx0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.2012.00419.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011300163300001800276520137700294592002801671650001301699650000801712650002501720650001101745650001201756650001501768650001401783650001301797650002101810650001501831650001201846650001701858650002201875650001601897650001901913653002101932653003101953653002701984653001402011653001302025700001202038700001702050773011302067856008002180852000902260655001202269IND60616440320221121033136.0181016e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061644032DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166585102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chuchu10aAdhesion and protective properties of electrospun PVA/ES composites obtained by using spiral disk spinnerets  ap. 1685-1695.  aThe parameters of electrospinning polyvinylalcohol (PVA) of different molecular weights using spiral disk spinnerets were explored. Ethylene-propylene side-by-side (ES) nonwoven was used as the substrate. Electrospun PVA/ES composite membranes were fabricated by laminating a nanofiber web onto the nonwoven substrate via the hot-press method. The adhesion properties between the PVA nanofiber mat and the ES nonwoven were studied. The results showed that the adhesion properties were significantly affected by temperature, pressure, and processing time. The resultant composite membranes, when treated at 145℃ with a pressure of 100 Pa for 10 minutes, exhibited a preferable adhesion energy of 7.95 J/m² and a maximum peeling strength of 20.17 cN, as well as a maximum air permeability of 73.92 dm³/(m²s). Simultaneously, the effect of electrospinning time on the characteristics of PVA/ES composites was also explored. The filtration efficiency increased with the prolongation of the electrospinning time, whereas the air permeability decreased. All of the samples were grade A in terms of the electrostatic half-life period (which was less than two seconds), and the softness slowly declined with the addition of nanofibrous layers. The breaking stress, the initial modulus, and the elongation were enhanced with the prolongation of electrospinning time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aair 3aasymmetric membranes 3aenergy 3afabrics 3afiltration 3ahalf life 3ahardness 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3apeeling 3apermeability 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 0apolyvinylalcohol 0aneedleless electrospinning 0aspiral disk spinnerets 0ahot-press 0aadhesion1 aLu, Yao1 aPan, Zhijuan0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 14 p.1685-1695dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166585103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001400260500001900274520078100293592002801074650001101102650000801113650001701121650001401138650001201152650001601164650002501180650001401205651001101219651001401230651001101244651001801255653001601273653001501289653000801304700002301312700001901335700002601354700002101380700001801401773009501419856008201514852000901596655001201605IND60698691220221120055623.0210303e20180926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069869122DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.40.260252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKistenich, Sonja10aThree new species of Krogia (Ramalinaceae, lichenised Ascomycota) from the Paleotropics  ap. 69-88.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKrogia borneensis Kistenich & Timdal, K. isidiata Kistenich & Timdal and K. macrophylla Kistenich & Timdal are described as new species, the first from Borneo and the two latter from New Caledonia.

However, due to climate change and human water withdrawal activities, no-flow events of the Yellow River occurred frequently since the 1970s, resulting in serious wetland degradation and biodiversity losses. Ecological water supplement has been regarded as one of the most effective measures to cope with these environmental problems. Accordingly, how much water is required for the ecological restoration becomes an essential question to be answered. Since the primary function of the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve (YRDNR), the typical wetland in the Yellow River Delta, is to provide suitable habitats for various rare birds, the purpose of this paper is to propose a method based on water balance analysis to specify monthly ecological water supplement for the habitats of typical birds in the YRDNR. Specifically, three typical birds were selected as the protection objects, including Grus japonensis, Ciconia boyciana, and Larus saundersi. Monthly water supplement was determined by monthly long-term time series data (2003–2018) of evapotranspiration product derived from remote sensing and meteorological data (precipitation and pan evaporation) acquired from National Meteorological Information Center. The results showed that the annual ecological water supplement for 10 km² ideal habitats was 666.17×104 m³, 1165.22×104 m³, and 664.48×104 m³ for G. japonensis, C. boyciana, and L. saundersi, respectively. Besides, it was found that annual precipitation generally had a significant negative relation with annual ecological water supplement, which suggested that local precipitation should be considered as a key factor in determining the amount of annual water supplement. The frequency analysis was then implemented to provide reasonable scheme of actual ecological water supplement under different precipitation scenarios. The results indicated that annual ecological water supplement for the whole YRDNR was 1.81×10⁸ m³, 1.94×10⁸ m³, 2.10×10⁸ m³ and 2.25×10⁸ m³ respectively under wet, average, dry and extreme dry conditions. If water storage measurements are implemented to store surplus precipitation under rainy season, the average volume would reduce by nearly 10%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiconia boyciana 3aGrus japonensis 3aLarus 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3aclimate change 3aecological restoration 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahumans 3ameteorological data 3ariver deltas 3atime series analysis 3awater storage 3awet season 3awetlands 3aYellow River 0aYellow River Delta 0aWetland 0aEcological water supplement 0aWater balance method 0aWaterbirds1 aZhu, Wenbin1 aWei, Jiaxing1 aJia, Shaofeng1 aWang, Andong1 aHuang, Yanbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1409-88681 aZhao, Yajie0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Aug., v. 127 p.107783-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1077833Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73676373Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245010800158300001600266506011700282506007600399520122700475592002801702506003701730650002301767650001301790650001801803650001001821650003401831650001401865650000901879650000901888650001401897650001501911650002501926650001001951651001501961651001201976651001001988653004201998653002002040653001602060653000902076700001502085700002702100700002002127700002102147700005602168700001102224700001602235700001402251700005902265773016102324856008102485852000902566655001202575IND60749109820221207130044.0220711e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074910982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2021.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lei10aGenetic sources and loci for wheat head blast resistance identified by genome-wide association analysis  ap. 793-801.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe emergence and spread of wheat blast caused by fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae pathotype Triticum is a threat to global wheat production. The resistance level and genetic loci for blast resistance in Chinese germplasm remain unknown. A panel of 266 bread wheat accessions from China, CIMMYT-Mexico and other countries was screened for head blast resistance under 12 field experiments in Bolivia and Bangladesh. Subsequently, a genome-wide association study was performed to understand the genetic basis of wheat blast resistance. The average blast index of all the accessions was 53.7% ± 12.7%, and 10 accessions including Chinese accessions Yumai 10 and Yu 02321 showed moderate to high levels of blast resistance, accounting for only 3.8% in the panel. Fifty-eight significant SNPs clustered in a 28.9 Mb interval on the 2AS/2NS translocation region, explaining phenotypic variation between 10.0% and 35.0%. The frequency of the 2AS/2NS translocation in the Chinese accessions was as low as 4.5%. These results indicated that the 2NS fragment was the only major locus conferring resistance to wheat blast in this panel, and the resistant and moderately resistant lines identified could be deployed in breeding.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aTriticum 3ablast disease 3afungi 3agenome-wide association study 3agermplasm 3ahead 3aloci 3apathogens 3apathotypes 3aphenotypic variation 3awheat 3aBangladesh 3aBolivia 3aChina 0aMagnaporthe oryzae pathotype Triticum 0aHost resistance 0aWheat blast 0aGWAS1 aHe, Xinyao1 aKabir, Muhammad Rezaul1 aRoy, Krishna K.1 aAnwar, Md.

The novel genus, represented by type strain G1SC, showed filamentous monocentric thallus development and produced uniflagellate zoospores, hence, showing morphological similarity to the genera Piromyces , Buwchfawromyces , Oontomyces and Pecoramyces . However, strain G1SC showed genetic similarity to the genus Anaeromyces , which, though produces uniflagellate zoospore, also exhibits polycentric thallus development. Moreover, unlike Anaeromyces , strain G1SC did not show hyphal constrictions, instead produced a branched, determinate and anucleate rhizoidal system. This fungus also displayed extensive sporangial variations, both exogenous and endogenous type of development, short and long sporangiophores and produced septate sporangia. G1SC utilised various complex and simple substrates, including rice straw and wheat straw and produced H₂, CO₂, formate, acetate, lactate, succinate and ethanol. Phylogenetic analysis, using internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and D1/D2 domain of large-subunit (LSU) rRNA locus, clearly showed a separate lineage for this strain, near Anaeromyces . The ITS1 based geographical distribution studies indicated detection of environmental sequences similar (93–96%) to this strain from cattle faeces. Based on morphological and molecular characterisation results of strain G1SC, we propose a novel anaerobic fungus Liebetanzomyces polymorphus gen. et sp. nov., in the phylum Neocallimastigomycota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPiromyces 3aacetates 3acarbon dioxide 3acattle 3adetection 3aethanol 3aexhibitions 3afeces 3aformates 3afungi 3agenetic similarity 3ageographical distribution 3agoats 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alactic acid 3aloci 3anew genus 3aphylogeny 3arice straw 3arumen 3asporangia 3asuccinic acid 3athallus 3awheat straw 3azoospores 0aAnaerobe 0afungal diversity 0anovel genus 0arumen fungi 0ataxonomy1 aLanjekar, Vikram B.1 aDhakephalkar, Prashant K.1 aCallaghan, Tony M.1 aGriffith, Gareth W.1 aDagar, Sumit Singh0 tMycoKeys.g2018 Oct. 10, v. 40 p.89-110dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.40.283373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169300001600272520099500288592002801283650001101311650001101322650001901333650001201352650001201364650001401376650001601390650002201406650001001428650000901438650001101447650001101458650001101469650001601480650001101496651001601507653001501523653001001538653001901548653001401567653001601581700001801597700001601615700002201631773012201653856008501775852000901860655001201869IND60566916120221118012140.0170414e20170426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056691612DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2016.12678602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaruso, Brian10aModelling climate change impacts on hydropower lake inflows and braided rivers in a mountain basin  ap. 928-946.  aThis study models climate change impacts on the natural flow regime of braided rivers and inflows to hydropower lakes in a New Zealand mountain basin. Flow metrics include the magnitude, frequency, timing and duration of unaltered flows. The TopNet hydrological model was used to simulate impacts in the Upper Waitaki Basin of the South Island for the 1990s, 2040s and 2090s. An average emissions scenario and results from 12 global circulation models were used as input. Indicators of hydrological alteration and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate flow differences. Modelled total inflows increase over time for all lakes, with most increases in winter/early spring and small decreases in summer/autumn. High flows generally increase, while low flows decrease. Although these changes may benefit hydropower and floodplain ecology, they may increase flood risk in winter and spring and drought risk in summer and autumn, causing additional challenges managing hydropower operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abasins 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecology 3aemissions 3afloodplains 3ahydrologic models 3alakes 3arisk 3arivers 3aspring 3asummer 3awater power 3awinter 3aNew Zealand 0aHydropower 0alakes 0aclimate change 0amountains 0aNew Zealand1 aNewton, Simon1 aKing, Regan1 aZammit, Christian0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2017 Apr. 26, v. 62, no. 6 p.928-946dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2016.12678603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04210naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011300172500001900285520279100304592002803095650002303123650001703146650001203163650001103175650001303186650001103199650002203210650001103232650002003243650001503263650001903278650002803297650002603325653002203351653002603373653002903399653001703428700002503445700002303470700006403493773010103557856008503658852000903743655001203752IND60736763920221119214257.0210608e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073676392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2021.1009282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuonocore, Elvira10aExploring the convergence of natural flows for the generation of natural capital stocks in marine ecosystems  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMarine ecosystems are open, complex, adaptive, and hierarchical systems highly integrated through the exchange of matter and energy flows. This flows exchange allows marine ecosystems to operate at different scales acting as dissipative structures, building natural capital stocks capable of generating several ecosystem services vital for human well-being. Humans derive a wide range of goods and services from marine ecosystems while, at the same time, generate several impacts causing biodiversity loss and seriously affecting their capacity to provide benefits to humans. Effective management strategies are crucial to conserve healthy and diverse marine and coastal ecosystems, maintain the valuable functions and services they provide, and allow for sustainable human activities. In recent years, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been increasingly acknowledged worldwide as important tools to conserve biodiversity and achieve human well-being and sustainable development goals. Assessing the value of natural capital and ecosystem services is crucial to raise awareness on their importance, support conservation strategies, and ensure the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. This study aimed at calculating biomass and emergy-based indicators to assess the value of natural capital stocks in a Mediterranean MPA. The assessment was performed through a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model fed with field biomass data collected through ad hoc sampling campaigns performed in the MPA. Four main macro-habitats were investigated: sciaphilic hard bottom (coralligenous bioconstructions), photophilic hard bottom, soft bottom, and Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds. The biomass density of the main autotrophic and heterotrophic taxonomic groups identified in the four macro-habitats of the MPA was evaluated. Based on this biomass matrix, the emergy value of natural capital stocks was assessed. The Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds habitat showed the highest biophysical value (2.32·10¹⁹ sej) at MPA scale, while coralligenous bioconstructions resulted the habitat with the highest biophysical value per unit area (2.72·10¹² sej m⁻²). In addition, to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective, the emergy-based indicators were converted into monetary units. The total value of natural capital of the whole MPA resulted in about 46 M€. The results of this study can support local managers and policy makers in the development of management strategies to ensure nature conservation and sustainable human activities. They can be also used as a benchmark for the assessment of natural capital value at larger scales in support of a proper consideration and inclusion of nature value into processes of policy making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPosidonia oceanica 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aemergy 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anatural capital 3aseagrasses 3asocial welfare 3asustainable development 3atrophic relationships 0aMarine ecosystems 0aEcological complexity 0aEnvironmental accounting 0aNature value1 aBuia, Maria Cristina1 aRusso, Giovanni F.1 aFranzese, Pier Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2156-63800 tEcological complexity.g2021 Mar., v. 46 p.100928-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2021.1009283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002300162245019100185300001600376520170900392592002802101650003002129650001102159650001902170650001602189650001202205650002002217650002402237650000902261650001102270650002402281650001502305650000902320650001102329650002102340650002002361650002602381650002502407650002302432650001302455650001502468650001202483650001402495650000902509650003002518650006402548650002102612650002502633650003802658650001102696650002102707650001102728650001102739650004402750650006502794650005802859650000902917650002302926650002102949650004002970650002003010650002703030650003003057651001403087700002303101773013703124856004603261852000903307655001203316IND4470570020221119202919.0120419e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447057002DNAL7 a223787322pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.111.0236892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVossenaar, Marieke14aThe concept of "critical nutrient density" in complementary feeding: the demands on the "family foods" for the nutrient adequacy of young Guatemalan children with continued breastfeeding  ap. 859-866.  aBACKGROUND: The WHO recommends the introduction of nutritionally adequate, safe, and appropriate complementary foods at 6 mo of age, with continued breastfeeding up to 2 y and beyond. Suggested strategies to support continued breastfeeding often postulate optimal use of customary "family foods" and adequate amounts of indigenous foodstuffs and local foods. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the nutrient adequacy of the diet of Guatemalan children aged 6–24 mo receiving continued breastfeeding and "family foods" rather than specially formulated "baby foods" as complementary foods. DESIGN: "Critical nutrient densities" for complementary foods were determined by using specific energy and protein requirements, assuming children to be in the 50th or 15th weight percentile of the 2006 WHO standards. Nutrient requirements for the total diet were determined by using the recommended nutrient intakes. Breast milk was assumed to provide 75% of total energy between 7 and 9 mo, 50% between 10 and 12 mo, and 40% between 13 and 24 mo. Gaps between computed critical nutrient densities and the best-scenario Guatemalan adult's diet, as a proxy for family foods, were examined. RESULTS: Energy complementation with these diets provided adequate nutrient density for protein, thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamins B-6, B-12, and C but not vitamin A, niacin, and folate in some groups. Major gaps for calcium, iron, and zinc were ubiquitous. CONCLUSIONS: The critical nutrient density concept is useful to evaluate the nutrient adequacy of the young child's diet. Multiple micronutrients are likely to be limited in the diets of Guatemalan young children with continued breastfeeding and family foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3acalcium 3achild nutrition 3acomplementary foods 3adiet 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3afolic acid 3airon 3aniacin 3anutrient density 3anutrient intake 3anutrient requirements 3anutritional adequacy 3apreschool children 3aproteins 3ariboflavin 3athiamin 3avitamin A 3azinc 2aBreast Feedingxethnology 2aChild Nutrition Disordersxethnologyxprevention & control. 2aChild, Preschool 2aDeveloping Countries 2aDietxadverse effectsxethnology. 2aFemale 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Foodxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aInfant Nutrition Disordersxethnologyxprevention & control. 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxethnology 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutritional Requirementsxethnology 2aNutritive Value 2aSocioeconomic Factors. 2aWorld Health Organization 0aGuatemala1 aSolomons, Noel W.,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2012 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.859-866dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.023689  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006700171300001600238520087500254592002801129596003901157596006701196596003901263596006701302650002101369650001301390650001601403650001801419650001201437650001101449650001401460650001001474651001001484651001301494700002601507700001901533700002601552700001701578700002301595700005901618773012501677856008201802852000901884655001201893IND60637229420221119103107.0190416e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063722942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-019-01474-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuankid, Boontiya10aThree new Phylloporus species from tropical China and Thailand  ap. 603-614.  aWe introduce three new Phylloporus species, P. pusillus, P. subbacillisporus and P. subrubeolus, from southwestern China and northern Thailand with macro- and micro-descriptions and illustrations. They are found mostly in forests dominated by Fagaceae or Dipterocarpaceae trees. A three-gene phylogenetic analysis of the new Phylloporus species along with other selected Phylloporus species confirmed that all new Phylloporus species are related to previously described Phylloporus species. Phylloporus pusillus and P. subrubeolus are morphologically similar, but the former can be separated by very small basidiomata, lamellae becoming deeper yellow to reddish with age and less densely encrusted walls of pileipellis hyphae. Phylloporus subbacillisporus can be easily distinguished from other species by shallowly intervenose lamellae and subbacilliform basidiospores.  aPublisher supplied data  aPHD57I0015cThailand Research Fund  aResearch Team Association grant 588006cThailand Research Fund  aPHD57I0015cThailand Research Fund  aResearch Team Association grant 588006cThailand Research Fund 3aDipterocarpaceae 3aFagaceae 3abasidiomata 3abasidiospores 3aforests 3ahyphae 3aphylogeny 3atrees 3aChina 3aThailand1 aVadthanarat, Santhiti1 aHyde, Kevin D.1 aThongklang, Naritsada1 aZhao, Ruilin1 aLumyong, Saisamorn1 aRaspé, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8426-21330 tMycological progress.g2019 May, v. 18, no. 5 p.603-614dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000124x1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-019-01474-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012700154300001800281500002000299520146400319592002801783650001601811650001401827650001801841650001001859650001301869650001201882650001401894650001401908650001201922650002001934650001001954700001801964700001201982700001701994700001502011700001802026700001202044700001502056700001602071700001902087700002002106700001802126773010902144856007302253852000902326655001202335IND60580118620221121081532.0170909e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058011862DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.127792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhen10aEffects of melatonin on maturation, histone acetylation, autophagy of porcine oocytes and subsequent embryonic development  ap. 1298-1310.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMelatonin (MLT) is an endogenous hormone with roles in animal germ cell development. However, the effect of MLT on porcine oocyte maturation and its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of exogenous MLT on oocyte maturation, histone acetylation, autophagy and subsequent embryonic development. We found that 1 nmol/L MLT supplemented in maturation medium was the optimal concentration to promote porcine oocyte maturation and subsequent developmental competence and quality of parthenogenetic embryos. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of 1 nmol/L MLT treatment on porcine oocyte maturation and embryo development were mainly attributed to the first half period of in vitro maturation. Simultaneously, MLT treatment could also improve maturation of small follicle‐derived oocytes, morphologically poor (cumulus cell layer ≤1) and even artificially denuded oocytes and their subsequent embryo development. Furthermore, MLT treatment not only could decrease the levels of H3K27ac and H4K16ac in metaphase II (MII) oocytes, but also could increase the expression abundances of genes associated with cumulus cell expansion, meiotic maturation, histone acetylation and autophagy in cumulus cells or MII oocytes. These results indicate that MLT treatment can facilitate porcine oocyte maturation and subsequent embryonic development probably, through improvements in histone acetylation and autophagy in oocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3aautophagy 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3ahistones 3ameiosis 3amelatonin 3ametaphase 3aoocytes 3aparthenogenesis 3aswine1 aZuo, Xiaoyuan1 aLi, Hui1 aHong, Renyun1 aDing, Biao1 aLiu, Chengxue1 aGao, Di1 aShang, Hui1 aCao, Zubing1 aHuang, Weiping1 aZhang, Xiaorong1 aZhang, Yunhai0 tAnimal science journal =.g2017 Sept., v. 88, no. 9 p.1298-1310dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.127793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009700164300001800261520175700279592002802036650000802064650002202072650002502094650002702119650002602146650002402172650001302196650001102209650001802220650002502238650002002263650001402283650001302297650001402310650001402324650001802338650002202356650002002378650002402398650001902422653001302441653001102454653002302465653002502488653002602513653002702539700001702566700002402583773011302607856008002720852000902800655001202809IND60616440720221121023558.0181016e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061644072DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166585142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFijan, Sabina10aSurvival of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on cotton  ap. 1711-1721.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of three challenge bacteria stored at 25℃, 5℃, and 50℃ up to 21 days on 100% cotton textile swatches. The survival of each chosen challenge bacteria was determined by the classical phenotype colony counting method through growth on selective media, and the molecular method of detecting Staphylococcus aureus-, Enterococcus faecium-, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-specific DNA. E. faecium proved to be the most persistent chosen challenge bacteria at all three chosen storage temperatures. Both E. faecium and S. aureus survived on textile swatches up to 21 days at 25℃ at the highest inoculum. E. faecium and P. aeruginosa persisted at 50℃ only up to 9 and 3 days, respectively. All challenge bacteria survived on textile swatches at 5℃ (E. faecium 12 days, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus less than 6 days). The results of survival at lower initial inoculum were lower and less dependent on temperature. Dehydration phenomena or fluctuation in relative humidity in the refrigerator at 5℃ possibly explains lower survival than at room temperature. Positive results for the detection of E. faecium- and P. aeruginosa-specific DNA were found for some samples with negative results for classical phenotype counting methods, perhaps owing to the fact that the bacterial cells, due to adverse environmental conditions, reached a viable, but noncultivable (VBNC) state, or that the extracellular DNA fragments persisted on the textiles. Survival of the challenge bacteria for more than 3 days regardless of temperature proves that hospital textiles as an inanimate surface should not be neglected as one of the possible vectors for transmission of pathogens causing healthcare associated infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3adisease transmission 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3ainoculum 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3arefrigerators 3arelative humidity 3aselective media 3astorage temperature 3atextile fibers 0atextiles 0acotton 0abacterial survival 0aEnterococcus faecium 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa1 aPahor, Dunja1 aŠostar Turk, Sonja0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 14 p.1711-1721dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166585143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011000168520129500278592002801573650000801601650002201609650000801631650001201639650002301651650002601674650001101700650002001711650001501731650001401746650001101760650001501771650001201786653002001798653002501818653001601843653001501859653010501874700002101979700005902000700002902059700006402088773008302152856008202235852000902317655001202326IND60749110220221120234427.0220214s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074911022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2021.1014962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez, Jenyfer13aAn optimized nucleic acid isolation protocol for virus diagnostics in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.)  aOur group works on the detection and characterization of cassava viruses, supporting projects that involve large scale pathogen surveillance activities and resistance screening assays in multiple and remote locations.

The method we describe here has been widely used and validated using different downstream tests (including, but not limited to, Rolling Circle Amplification and Illumina and Nanopore sequencing), but is currently unpublished.

Employing nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular modeling, we characterize the mode of binding that involves the GYGF loop important for the association of the C-terminus of PTH1R. We demonstrate that the common core of the small molecules binds to the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1 and displaces a ¹⁵N-labeled peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of PTH1R. The small size (molecular weight of 192) of this core scaffold makes it an excellent candidate for further elaboration in the development of an inhibitor for this important protein–protein interaction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amolecular models 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparathyroid hormone 3aprotein-protein interactions1 aPellegrini, Maria1 aCushing, Patrick R.1 aMierke, Dale F.0 tBiochemistry.g2014 Sept. 23, v. 53, no. 37 p.5916-5922dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi500368k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001400141245015600155300001600311520159600327592002801923653003301951653003201984653002902016653001902045653001502064700001702079700001602096700001702112700001402129773012402143856007602267852000902343655001202352IND60681607220221119183635.0200226e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068160722DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2015.00312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorii, Y.14aThe serotonin receptor mediates changes in autonomic neurotransmission and gastrointestinal transit induced by heat-killed Lactobacillus brevis SBC8803  ap. 817-822.  aLactobacilli exhibit several health benefits in mammals, including humans. Our previous reports established that heat-killed Lactobacillus brevis SBC8803 (SBC8803) increased both efferent gastric vagal nerve activity and afferent intestinal vagal nerve activity in rats. We speculated that this strain could be useful for the treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. In this study, we examined the effects of SBC8803 on peristalsis and the activity of the efferent celiac vagal nerve innervating the intestine in rats. First, we examined the effects of intraduodenal (ID) administration of SBC8803 on efferent celiac vagal nerve activity (efferent CVNA) in urethane-anesthetised rats using electrophysiological studies. The effects of intravenous injection of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron on changes in efferent CVNA due to ID administration of SBC8803 were also investigated. Finally, the effects of oral gavage of SBC8803 on GI transit were analysed using the charcoal propulsion method in conscious rats treated with or without granisetron. ID administration of SBC8803 increased efferent CVNA. Pretreatment with granisetron eliminated SBC8803-dependent changes in efferent CVNA. Furthermore, oral gavage of SBC8803 significantly accelerated GI transit, while pretreatment with granisetron inhibited GI transit. Our findings suggested that SBC8803 increased efferent CVNA and GI transit of charcoal meal via 5-HT3 receptors. Moreover, SBC8803 enhanced the activity of efferent vagal nerve innervating the intestine and promoted peristalsis via 5-HT3 receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLactobacillus brevis SBC8803 0aceliac vagal nerve activity 0agastrointestinal transit 0a5-HT3 receptor 0agranistron1 aNakakita, Y.1 aMisonou, Y.1 aNakamura, T.1 aNagai, K.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2015 Dec. 1, v. 6, no. 6 p.817-822dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2015.00313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100001600187245008500203300001800288500001900306506002800325506006400353520158700417592002802004596008302032596006502115506003702180650002202217650001102239650001202250650002202262650001602284650001402300650002102314650001002335650002602345650001502371650001202386650001402398650001902412650001302431650002102444650001702465651001302482700001302495700001602508700001802524700002202542700002102564700005602585773013802641856008202779903002202861852000902883655001202892IND60699920820221207112448.0200624e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069992082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-020-03589-x2chorus7 a10.1007/s00122-020-03589-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Tilin10aDevelopment and deployment of KASP markers for multiple alleles of Lr34 in wheat  ap. 2183-2195.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aSpringer Science and Business Media LLC License Information  aKEY MESSAGE: Heterogeneous Lr34 genes for leaf rust in winter wheat cultivar ‘Duster’ and KASP markers for allelic variation in exon 11 and exon 22 of Lr34. Wheat, Triticum aestivum (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD), is a hexaploid species, and each of three homoeologous genomes A, B, and D should have one copy for a gene in its ancestral form if the gene has no duplication. Previously reported leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 has one copy on the short arm of chromosome 7D in hexaploid wheat, and allelic variation in Lr34 is in intron 4, exon 11, exon 12, or exon 22. In this study, we discovered that Oklahoma hard red winter wheat cultivar ‘Duster’ (PI 644,016) has two copies of the Lr34 gene, the resistance allele Lr34a and the susceptibility allele Lr34b. Both Lr34a and Lr34b were mapped in the same linkage group on chromosome 7D in a doubled-haploid population generated from a cross between Duster and a winter wheat cultivar ‘Billings’ which carries the susceptibility allele Lr34c. A chromosomal fragment including Lr34 and at least two neighboring genes on its proximal side but excluding genes on its distal side was duplicated in Duster. The Duster Lr34ab allele was associated with tip necrosis and increased resistance against leaf rust at adult plants in the Duster × Billings DH population tested in the field, demonstrating the function of the Duster Lr34ab allele in wheat. We have developed KASP markers for allelic variation in exon 11 and exon 22 of Lr34 in wheat. These markers can be utilized to accelerate the selection of Lr34 in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  a2011-68002-30029cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriticum aestivum 3aadults 3aalleles 3aallelic variation 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3adoubled haploids 3aexons 3ahard red winter wheat 3ahexaploidy 3aintrons 3aleaf rust 3alinkage groups 3anecrosis 3aresistance genes 3awinter wheat 3aOklahoma1 aLei, Lei1 aLi, Genqiao1 aPowers, Carol1 aHunger, Robert M.1 aCarver, Brett F.1 aYan, Liuling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1957-260X0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 July, v. 133, no. 7 p.2183-2195dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03589-x3Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245006500173300001600238520146200254592002801716650001101744650001501755650002001770650001001790650001001800650001601810650001901826650001801845650002101863650001201884650001001896650001201906650001301918650002101931650001201952650001401964650002001978650001901998650001302017650001102030650001702041653002502058653002302083653002002106653001502126653002302141773008202164856008102246852000902327655001202336IND60638253920221120115019.0190427s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063825392DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamopoulos, Stergios10aIdentification of Fibre Components in Packaging Grade Papers  ap. 153-172.  aEnvironmental and economic issues have led to a significant increase of recycled paper as the main fibrous component of corrugated board the last years. Qualitative data on the different fibre types are needed for the evaluation of packaging fibre supply sources, which are becoming numerous and heterogeneous. Fifteen different packaging grade papers (7 linerboards and 8 corrugating medium) were selected to represent all the variety of papers available on the Spanish market. The origin of virgin and recycled fibres was identified by their morphological characteristics employing light microscopy and standard fibre analysis techniques. The waste-based papers (Waste based-liners and Fluting), Kraft-liners and Test-liner were highly variable containing 9–18 different wood and nonwood components. Semi-chemical, with 5–13 components, was the less variable grade. Hardwoods were identified as the most important fibre component from a quantitative standpoint. All papers contained in their hardwood mix Betula, Eucalyptus and Populus in significant amounts. Fagus sylvatica and Tilia were also frequently observed and in some papers were amongst major hardwood components. Prominent softwood components were found to be Pinus sylvestris, P. pinaster, P. radiata, Picea, Larix and in some papers Pinus nigra. The lower presence of a variety of softwood, hardwood and nonwood (mainly grasses) species and genera was due to the paper recycling process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aEucalyptus 3aFagus sylvatica 3aLarix 3aPicea 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus pinaster 3aPinus radiata 3aPinus sylvestris 3aPopulus 3aTilia 3agrasses 3ahardwood 3alight microscopy 3amarkets 3apackaging 3apaper recycling 3arecycled paper 3asoftwood 3awastes 3awood anatomy 0aFibre identification 0apapermaking fibres 0arecycled fibres 0alinerboard 0acorrugating medium0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 27, no. 2 p.153-172dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009900170300001600269520083600285592002801121650000901149650002601158650001701184650002501201650001101226650001401237650001701251653002301268653002101291653002001312653001001332653002201342653001801364700002101382773008201403856008101485852000901566655001201575IND60638254020221120114805.0190427s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063825402DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazquez-Cooz, Iris10aDistribution of Libriform Fibers and Presence of Spiral Thickenings in Fifteen Species of Acer  ap. 173-182.  aFifteen Acer species were examined to study distribution and percentage by area of their libriform fibers. Safranin-O and astra blue dissolved in alcohol solution is an effective differential staining method to identify and localize libriform fibers. They have larger lumens than fiber tracheids, intercellular spaces, and occur in various patterns, ranging from large groups to wavy bands. In some cases they occur in radial files. The percentage by area of libriform fibers ranges from 14 to 40%. Inconspicuous to moderately visible spiral thickenings are part of the Acer libriform fibers and fiber tracheids. Differences in stain reactions and fluorescence indicate that libriform fibers differ in lignin concentration or composition from fiber tracheids – the concentration of syringyl lignin is greater in libriform fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3adifferential staining 3afluorescence 3aintercellular spaces 3alignin 3atracheids 3awood anatomy 0afiber distribution 0alibriform fibers 0afiber tracheids 0amaple 0aspiral thickening 0alignification1 aMeyer, Robert W.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 27, no. 2 p.173-182dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01659naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002100162245008400183300001200267500000900279520067900288592002800967650001200995650001501007650001201022650002601034650002001060650001801080700002301098773011801121856009701239852000901336655001201345IND60663379520221118063952.0191122e196601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066337952DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1966.00021962005800010002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, Roger G.10aSoil and Alfalfa Plant Characteristics as Affected by a Decade of Fertilization  ap. 3-5.  aepub  aThe 10-year field study indicates annual top-dressings of K are needed to maintain a dense stand for high yields of quality alfalfa on sloping Port Byron silt loam.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, COPI is required for retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi maintenance, and cell plate formation. During compatible pollination, vesicle recruitment to the pollen contact point is required for pollen hydration and pollen tube penetration. Here, to identify other aspects of trafficking involved in the acceptance of compatible pollen by stigmatic papillae and to determine their roles in compatible pollination, we characterized knockout lines of several isoforms of the COPI complex, including α1-COP, γ-COP, and ε-COP. Specifically, we characterized pollen grain adherence, pollen tube penetration, and seed set in the mutants. Of the mutant lines examined, α1-cop had the most severe phenotypes, including altered compatible pollen grain adherence and tube germination and reduced seed set, whereas the other lines had milder phenotypes but visibly retarded compatible pollen acceptance. This is the first study demonstrating that COPI complex subunits are required for the acceptance of compatible pollen.  aPublisher supplied data  a52006932cHoward Hughes Medical Institute (US)  a52008103cHoward Hughes Medical Institute  a52008103cHoward Hughes Medical Institute  a52008103cHoward Hughes Medical Institute  astart-up fundscNew Mexico State University 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acoat proteins 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3amutants 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apollination 3aseed set1 aChavez, M.

We report here a condition that decreases liver damage in intrahepatic cholestasis based on a mouse model that lacks multiple drug resistant protein 2 (ABCB4). We found that lack of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) decreased liver damage in Abcb4⁻/⁻ mice caused by exposure of the liver to excess bile acids. The protective effect was not related to hepatic ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine or the level of cholesterol. The decreased concentration of bile acids in liver was related to impaired re-absorption of bile acids in intestine and increased disposal of bile acids in feces in Abcb4⁻/⁻/Pemt⁻/⁻ mice as compared to Abcb4⁻/⁻ mice. PEMT deficiency affected intestinal Na⁺ absorption resulting in an impaired Na⁺ concentration gradient along the length of the small intestine and abnormal absorption of bile acids mediated by apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT).

Both phylogenetic analyses and the dominant terminal restriction fragments showed that archaeal ammonia oxidizers belonged to the Crenarchaeota Group I.1a and Crenarchaeota Group I.1b, while bacterial ammonia oxidizers included both Nitrosomonas-like and Nitrosospira-like species. The bacterial ammonia oxidizers were more diverse but less abundant than the ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Significant spatial differences in the ammonia-oxidizing archaeal community structure and abundance were found between the algae-dominated and the macrophyte-dominated regions, which suggest sedimentary trophic status is an important influence. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between bacterial ammonia oxidizer communities and sedimentary trophic status. There were pronounced seasonal variations in ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community structures, reflected by the absence of the Nitrosospira-like species in August and their presence in other months. Both the abundances of archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers were highest in February. The correlation analyses between prokaryotic ammonia oxidizer communities and the investigated physicochemical variables demonstrated that the overlying water temperature was the dominant factor influencing the seasonal variations in ammonia oxidizer community structure and abundance.Supplemental materials are available for this article.

Nonetheless, N application should be justified by economic benefit to the cropping system. This study evaluated the productivity, nutritive value, and cost implications of N application in sainfoin under rainfed conditions at high elevations in Wyoming. The study was a 2-factorial experiment set in a randomized complete block design with four replications, where four cultivars (Delaney, Remont, Rocky Mountain, and Shoshone) and four N rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha⁻¹) were the treatments. Sainfoin was established in 2012, and N was broadcast-applied in May 2013 and 2014 using urea as the N source. The profitability of the N application was assessed using a benefit–cost ratio analysis. Sainfoin yield and nutritive value was affected by cultivar and N application. Remont (1.08 Mg ha⁻¹), Rocky Mountain (1.17 Mg ha⁻¹), and Shoshone (1.16 Mg ha⁻¹) produced higher forage dry matter (DM) than Delaney (0.84 Mg ha⁻¹). The effect of N application on the forage DM was linear, but applying >80 kg N ha⁻¹ did not result in significant increase in the forage DM. The benefit–cost ratios for the three N rates were less than one in both years, which indicated a net loss in revenue. In general, sainfoin DM and crude protein (CP) increased with N; however, the increase in forage DM with N application was not economical due to higher production costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOnobrychis viciifolia 3aaltitude 3acost benefit analysis 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3acrops 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3afinancial economics 3aincome 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anutritive value 3aproduction costs 3aprofitability 3aurea 3aWyoming1 aAdjesiwor, Albert T.1 aJeliazkov, Valtcho D.,1 aIslam, Anowar,1 aObour, Augustine K.0 tAgronomy journal.g2016 Jan., v. 108, no. 1 p.294-300dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2015.03173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245005800173300001600231520090300247592002801150650002301178650000801201650001401209650001701223650001401240650001201254650001901266650002101285650001201306650001001318650002001328650000901348651001101357653001001368700002601378700002301404773008201427856008101509852000901590655001201599IND60638254220221120114957.0190427s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063825422DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestbrook, Jessica A.10aAnnual Growth Rings in a Sample of Hymenaea Courbaril  ap. 193-197.  aSeveral tropical tree species form regular growth rings that may be annual and thus be useful in paleoclimate reconstructions. Regular growth rings were observed in one stem disk of the tropical legume Hymenaea courbaril harvested near the city of David, Panama. By comparison to annual reference Δ₁₄C values from temperate tree wood and air, Δ₁₄C values from the growth rings in this H. courbaril sample indicated the rings were annual. During this study, H. courbaril was also observed to translocate recently produced photosynthate into older growth rings as sapwood is converted to heartwood. This process alters the overall Δ₁₄C values of these transitional growth rings as organic carbon with a higher Δ₁₄C content is translocated into growth rings with relatively lower Δ₁₄C content. Proper chemical pretreatment can recover the original cellulose Δ₁₄C content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHymenaea courbaril 3aair 3acellulose 3agrowth rings 3aheartwood 3alegumes 3aorganic carbon 3apaleoclimatology 3asapwood 3atrees 3atropical plants 3awood 3aPanama 0aΔ14C1 aGuilderson, Thomas P.1 aColinvaux, Paul A.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 27, no. 2 p.193-197dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015800170300001800328520093400346592002801280650002301308650001801331650001101349650002501360650001101385650001101396650001501407650001201422650001301434650001801447650001801465650001101483650001301494653001901507653001001526653002301536653001001559653001801569700001601587700001601603773012801619856008501747852000901832655001201841IND60746331920221122190811.0210731e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074633192DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2021.19332072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Nisar10aSynthesis of bimetallic core-shelled nanoparticles modified by 2-mercaptoethanol as SERS substrates for detecting ferbam and thiabendazole in apple puree  ap. 1386-1399.  aModification of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates with thiol ligands is an emerging approach in enhancing the stability and sensitivity of metal substrates due to their good affinity with metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu. Thus, in the current study, 2-mercaptoethanol was used to modify the surface of silver-coated gold nanoparticles to develop a novel SERS substrate for the rapid assessment of fungicide residues in fruit samples. Results showed that the substrate could achieve the detection of ferbam and thiabendazole residues in apple puree with limits of detection of approximately 0.0042 and 0.0064 ppm, high coefficients of determination of 0.9946 and 0.9968, good recoveries ranging from 80 to 105 and 81 to 107% and relative standard deviations of 3.5–7.5 and 3.8–7.9 %, respectively.

This method of fabrication does away with the need for combustible reactants such as hydrogen or oxygen, either as a precursor or as an annealing agent. All previous studies using only ozone could not yield metallic films, and required post treatment using hydrogen or oxygen. In this work, it was discovered that the concentration level of ozone used in the ALD process was critical in determining whether the pure metal film was formed, and whether the metal film was oxidized. By controlling the ozone concentration under a critical limit, the fabrication of these noble metal films was successful. Rhodium thin films were deposited between 200 and 220 °C, whereas palladium thin films were deposited between 180 and 220 °C. A precisely controlled low ozone concentration of 1.22 g m⁻³ was applied to prevent the oxidation of the noble metallic film, and to ensure fast growth rates of 0.42 Å per cycle for Rh, and 0.22 Å per cycle for Pd. When low-concentration ozone was applied to react with ligand, no excess ozone was available to oxidize the metal products. The surfaces of deposited films obtained the RMS roughness values of 0.30 nm for Rh and 0.13 nm for Pd films. The resistivities of 18 nm Rh and 22 nm Pd thin films were 17 μΩ cm and 63 μΩ cm.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrogen 3aligands 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aozone 3apalladium 3arhodium 3aroughness1 aCheng, Chunyu1 aGuo, Yuanyuan1 aOng, Amanda Jiamin1 aGoei, Ronn1 aLi, Shuzhou1 aYoong Tok, Alfred Iing0 tRSC advances.g2021 June 28, v. 11, no. 37 p.22773-22779dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra03942c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014100170300001600311520178500327592002802112650001602140650001402156650001302170650001202183650001302195650001602208650001502224650001202239651001002251653001202261653001802273653002102291653001702312653001502329700002302344700002202367700001802389700002002407773010902427856005102536852000902587655001202596IND50088342320221119040244.0140414e20131126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008834232DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2013.7913552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkumura, Tomoyo10aProcesses Forming Daily Lamination in a Microbe-Rich Travertine Under Low Flow Condition at the Nagano-yu Hot Spring, Southwestern Japan  ap. 910-927.  aA daily rhythm of microbial processes, in terms of sub-mm order lamination, was identified for a microbe-rich aragonite travertine formed at a low-flow site of the Nagano-yu Hot Spring in Southwestern Japan. Continuous observation and sampling clearly showed that the lamination consisted of diurnal microbe-rich layers (M-layers) and nocturnal crystalline layers (C-layers). The M-layers originated from biofilm formed by growth and upward migration of filamentous cyanobacteria related to Microcoleus sp., which can rapidly glide and secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). During the daytime, cyanobacterial biofilm development inhibited aragonite precipitation on the travertine surface due to the calcium-binding ability of EPS. After sunset, aragonite precipitation started on the surface where aerobic heterotrophic bacteria decomposed EPS, which induced precipitation of micritic crystals. This early stage of C-layer formation was followed by abiotic precipitation of fan-shaped aragonite aggregates. Despite their major role in lamina formation, the cyanobacteria were readily degraded within 6–10 days after embedding, and the remaining open spaces in the M-layers were sparsely filled with crystal clots. These lamina-forming processes were different from those observed in a high-flow site where the travertine has a dense texture of aragonite crystals. The microbial travertine at Nagano-yu is similar to some Precambrian stromatolites in terms of in situ mineral precipitation, regular sub-mm order lamination, and arrangement of filamentous microbes; therefore, the lamination of these stromatolites possibly occur with a daily rhythm. The microbial processes demonstrated in this study may revise the interpretation of ancient stromatolite formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocoleus 3aaragonite 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acrystals 3ahot springs 3aopen space 3atexture 3aJapan 0abiofilm 0acyanobacteria 0adaily lamination 0astromatolite 0atravertine1 aTakashima, Chizuru1 aShiraishi, Fumito1 aNishida, Shin1 aKanō, Akihiro,0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2013 Nov. 26, v. 30, no. 10 p.910-927dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2013.791355  aDNAL 7aarticle01601naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005500173300001800228500001400246520034100260592002800601650002500629650001000654650002200664650001200686650001500698650000900713650002100722650001300743650001000756650001200766653002100778653002000799653001400819653002500833700001800858700002500876700002600901700001700927773011600944856008601060852000901146655001201155IND60709520720221120160406.0201025e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070952072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2020.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhury, Deepak10aCommercialization of Plant-Based Meat Alternatives  ap. 1055-1058.  aNAL-light  aPlant-based meat alternatives are a sustainable source of proteins that can match the taste and texture, color, and nutritional profile of specific types of meat.

It is urgently needed to explore the variances of metabolic profiles for early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. In current study, we applied a GC–MS based metabolomics platform coupled with a network approach to analyze plasma samples from young hypertensive men and age-matched healthy controls. Our findings confirmed distinct metabolic footprints of young hypertensive men. The significantly altered metabolites between two groups were enriched for the biological module of amino acids biosynthesis. The correlations of GC–MS metabolomics data were then visualized as networks based on Pearson correlation coefficient (threshold=0.6). The plasma metabolites identified by GC–MS and the significantly altered metabolites (P<0.05) between patients and controls were respectively included as nodes of a network. Statistical and topological characteristics of the networks were studied in detail. A few amino acids, glycine, lysine, and cystine, were screened as hub metabolites with higher values of degree (k), and also obtained highest scores of three centrality indices. The short average path lengths and high clustering coefficients of the networks revealed a small-world property, indicating that variances of these amino acids have a major impact on the metabolic change in young hypertensive men. These results suggested that disorders of amino acid metabolism might play an important role in predisposing young men to developing hypertension. The combination of metabolomics and network methods would provide another perspective on expounding the molecular mechanism underlying complex diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acid metabolism 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiosynthesis 3acorrelation 3acystine 3aearly diagnosis 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahypertension 3alysine 3amen 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3apatients 3atopology 3ayoung adults 0aMetabolomics 0aGC–MS 0aCorrelation network 0aCentrality indices 0aHypertension 0aHub metabolites1 aHou, Entai1 aWang, Lijun1 aWang, Yanjun1 aYang, Lingjian1 aZheng, Xiaohui1 aXie, Guangqi1 aSun, Qiong1 aLiang, Mingyu1 aTian, Zhongmin0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Jan. 07, v. 854 p.95-105dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011000166300001600276520111500292592002801407650001101435650003501446650001301481650002201494650001701516650001401533650001401547650001401561650000901575650002001584650001601604650001601620651001001636653001201646653003001658653002201688653001701710653002701727700001701754700001401771700001701785700001701802700001801819700001301837700001701850773011401867856008501981852000902066655001202075IND60515399520221118173600.0160315e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051539952DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2015.11046252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Beibei10aHealth risk assessment on heavy metals in urban street dust of Tianjin based on trapezoidal fuzzy numbers  ap. 678-692.  aThe aims of this article were to investigate heavy metals concentrations in urban street dust of Tianjin, to examine spatial variations of heavy metals pollution, and to assess their health risk to local populations. Urban street dust samples were collected from 144 typical crossroads in an urban area of Tianjin. Levels of heavy metals were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer analyzer. Given comprehensive consideration of the complexity and uncertainty of health risk assessment, trapezoidal fuzzy number was introduced to assess the health risk of heavy metals in the urban street dust of Tianjin. The results showed that the pollution of heavy metals in the urban street dust of Tianjin was serious. The relatively serious metal pollution tended to be located in the center, north, northeast, and southeast of the study area. The research indicated that heavy metals in street dust had caused non-cancer hazard to children but had not caused non-cancer or cancer hazard to adults. The direct ingestion of dust via hand-mouth contact behaviors was the major exposure pathway for health risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achildren 3aexposure pathways 3aheavy metals 3aingestion 3aneoplasms 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3auncertainty 3aurban areas 3aChina 0aTianjin 0atrapezoidal fuzzy numbers 0aurban street dust 0aheavy metals 0ahealth risk assessment1 aLiu, Baiqiao1 aZhou, Jun1 aGuo, Jinting1 aSun, Zongbin1 aMeng, Weiqing1 aGuo, Xin1 aDuan, Jiahao0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 22, no. 3 p.678-692dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2015.11046253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245006100178300001600239500001900255520123600274592002801510596007601538650001401614650000901628650001701637650002001654650001901674650002001693650001201713650000901725650003101734650001101765650001601776700002801792700002301820773012001843856008201963852000902045655001202054IND60718370820221119074657.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071837082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-020-00853-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManassero, Carlos Alberto10aDevelopment of a High Protein Beverage Based on Amaranth  ap. 599-607.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to formulate a beverage based on amaranth proteins, stable and nutritious. The process of obtaining the beverage was based on the existing knowledge about starch separation techniques and techno-functional properties of the amaranth proteins. Gums, gellan and xanthan were added to the protein extract and it was heat-treated at 80 °C during 20 min. A beverage with a composition similar to skim cow’s milk was obtained (3.42 ± 0.08; 0.60 ± 0.06; 1.9 ± 0.4; 0.43 ± 0.01; 3 and 90.58 ± 0.01% for proteins, lipids, fiber, ashes, carbohydrates and water, respectively). Thermal treatment caused the denaturation and aggregation of the proteins, while the addition of gums induced a decrease in the sensitivity to heat treatment of the proteins. Formation of protein aggregates and gum-protein complexes was characterized by electrophoresis, differential scanning calorimetry, and particle size distribution. Heat treatment and addition of gums generated macrocomplexes with enhanced absolute value of ζ-potential, which contributed to the high colloidal stability of amaranth-based beverage. This beverage is suitable for vegans, celiac patients, and lactose intolerants.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 2016 1537cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3abeverages 3acows 3adenaturation 3aelectrophoresis 3aheat treatment 3ahuman nutrition 3alactose 3amilk 3aparticle size distribution 3astarch 3axanthan gum1 aAñón, María Cristina1 aSperoni, Francisco0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 75, no. 4 p.599-607dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-020-00853-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009500165300001800260520122900278592002801507650002701535650002601562650002701588650001501615650002701630650002001657650002101677650002601698650001001724650001101734650001301745650001001758650000901768650001501777650001101792650002301803650001101826650001001837651001101847700002601858700001601884700002301900700002101923773010701944856008202051852000902133655001202142IND60549226420221118160420.0160907e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054922642DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-15-0250-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuig, Mireia10aControlling Brown Spot of Pear by a Synthetic Antimicrobial Peptide Under Field Conditions  ap. 1816-1822.  aBrown spot of pear, caused by Stemphylium vesicarium, is a fungal disease of increasing importance in several pear-growing areas of Europe. Disease control measures include the application of fungicides and sanitation methods. Antimicrobial peptides may be a complement or alternative to conventional fungicides used to manage brown spot disease. In a previous study, the synthetic peptide BP15 showed postinfection fungicidal activity against S. vesicarium in in vitro and detached-leaf assays. In the present study, the efficacy of BP15 (KKLFKKILKVL-NH₂) in controlling brown spot of pear was evaluated under field conditions using potted plants and pear trees in orchards. In field trials, the treatments with BP15 or with the fungicide thiram were scheduled according to the infection risk predicted by the BSPcast model. Potted pear plants treated with BP15 showed a disease reduction of about 42 to 60% in five of seven trials. In three of four tree trials, the disease severity on shoots treated with BP15 was significantly lower than in the nontreated controls, with a mean efficacy of 38.2%. It was concluded that BP15 is a good candidate to be further developed as a fungicide for controlling brown spot of pear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStemphylium vesicarium 3aantifungal properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acomplement 3acontainer-grown plants 3acontrol methods 3adisease severity 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3amodels 3aorchards 3apears 3arisk 3asanitation 3ashoots 3asynthetic peptides 3athiram 3atrees 3aEurope1 aMoragrega, Concepció1 aRuz, Lídia1 aMontesinos, Emilio1 aLlorente, Isidre0 tPlant disease.g2015 Dec., v. 99, no. 12 p.1816-1822dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-15-0250-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01842naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014700171300001600318520047100334592002800805650001900833650002000852650000900872650000900881650001300890650001200903650001100915650002000926650001100946650001400957650001000971651001200981651001100993653002201004653002301026653002101049653002001070653002401090653001201114653001901126653001601145700002701161773008201188856008101270852000901351655001201360IND60638254520221120115026.0190427s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063825452DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCreber, Geoffrey T.10aEpicormic Shoot Traces in the Secondary Xylem of the Triassic and Permian Fossil Conifer Species Woodworthia Arizonica — Short Communication  ap. 237-241.  aSpecimens of Woodworthia arizonica Jeffrey trees from the Late Triassic of Arizona, U.S.A. and the Permian of Brazil, typically have horizontal vascular traces that have extremely close contacts with the tracheids of the secondary xylem.

The results showed that BN-codoping can significantly modify the properties of C₆₀ fullerene by breaking local charge neutrality and creating active sites. The codoping of B and N enhances the formation energy of fullerenes, indicating that the synergistic effects of these atoms helps to stabilize the C₅₉₋ₙBNₙ structures. The stepwise addition of N atoms around the B atom improves catalytic activities of C₅₉₋ₙBNₙ in N₂O reduction. The reduction of N₂O over C₅₈BN and C₅₇BN₂ begins with its chemisorption on the B–C bond of the fullerene, followed by the concerted interaction of CO with N₂O and the release of N₂. The resulting OCO intermediate is subsequently transformed into a CO₂ molecule, which is weakly adsorbed on the B atom of the fullerene. On the contrary, nitrogen-rich C₅₆BN₃ fullerene is found to decompose N₂O into N₂ and O* species without the requirement for activation energy. The CO molecule then removes the O* species with a low activation barrier. The activation barrier of the N₂O reduction on C₅₆BN₃ fullerene is just 0.28 eV, which is lower than that of noble metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aboron 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3afullerene 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen1 aKhan, Adnan Ali1 aMousavian, Parisasadat0 tRSC advances.g2021 June 28, v. 11, no. 37 p.22598-22610dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra04046d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245016100174300001400335520099200349592002801341650001301369650001301382650001701395650002501412650001701437650001101454650001101465650000901476650001001485650001601495650001301511650001301524651001901537653002501556653001901581653002201600653002001622700002001642773011101662856005101773852000901824655001201833IND50088342720221119040146.0140414e20110118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008834272DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2010.5239242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Vliet, Nathalie10aRecognizing the Multiple Reasons for Bushmeat Consumption in Urban Areas: A Necessary Step Toward the Sustainable Use of Wildlife for Food in Central Africa  ap. 45-54.  aHunting in Central Africa poses a threat to several species and remains a crucial source of protein and income for African communities. However, we lack sufficient knowledge of the drivers of consumption to provide innovative strategies for sustainable use. Our literature review draws several conclusions based on available case studies. First, as the most highly valued bushmeat species are among the most common, there is a non-negligible potential to reduce the trade to the most resilient species without having to ban all bushmeat trade. Second, because bushmeat serves multiple functions above the purely consumptive, there is no guarantee that demand for bushmeat will decline. Third, bushmeat is perceived by consumers as a healthy food compared to industrial meats and consumer choices ignore the risks associated with zoonotic diseases. Multidisciplinary approaches that incorporate the human dimensions of wildlife are to be encouraged for a more sustainable use of bushmeat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3abushmeat 3acase studies 3aconsumer preferences 3ahealthy diet 3ahumans 3aincome 3arisk 3atrade 3aurban areas 3awildlife 3azoonoses 3aCentral Africa 0abushmeat consumption 0acentral Africa 0aconsumer behavior 0asustainable use1 aMbazza, Prosper0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2011 Jan. 18, v. 16, no. 1 p.45-54dTaylor & Francis Groupx1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2010.523924  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014100172300001800313520099500331592002801326650001501354650002101369650001801390650000901408650001301417650001501430650002701445650001101472650003101483650001901514650001501533650001201548650001101560650001501571653001201586653002001598653001001618653001801628773010801646856008401754852000901838655001201847IND60122418720221119044817.0150325e20140824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012241872DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2014.9113182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayasinghe, G.

Agricultural waste compost was prepared from poultry litter, sawdust, rice straw, gliricidia, and cow dung. Seven different potting media were prepared by mixing compost at the rates of 0%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% with coir dust at the rate of 100%, 90%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0%, respectively. Developed potting media showed adequate physical and chemical properties for Ipomea aquatica cultivation. Crop yield showed significant differences among all treatments and treatment with 100% compost gave the best growth and yield parameters. The highest plant height, shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight obtained from the 100% compost were increased by 2.70, 18.07, and 18.02 times in comparison to the 100% coir with chemical fertilizer control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGliricidia 3aIpomoea aquatica 3acattle manure 3acoir 3acomposts 3acrop yield 3agrowth and development 3amixing 3aphysicochemical properties 3apoultry manure 3arice straw 3asawdust 3ashoots 3avegetables 0acompost 0aleafy vegetable 0awaste 0apotting media0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2014 Aug. 24, v. 37, no. 10 p.1601-1611dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2014.9113183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014500169300001400314520100700328592002801335650002701363650001301390650001101403650001201414650001301426650002401439651001001463653001301473653001401486653001301500653003301513653001001546700001801556773011101574856005101685852000901736655001201745IND50088342820221119040042.0140414e20110118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008834282DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2011.5315162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeguro, Toshio10aConservation Goals Betrayed by the Uses of Wildlife Benefits in Community-based Conservation: The Case of Kimana Sanctuary in Southern Kenya  ap. 30-44.  aSince the 1990s, many empirical studies of “community-based conservation” (CBC) have discussed the relationship of benefits from wildlife to local attitudes. In addition to that relationship, this article examines the use of benefits and the consistency of that use with wildlife conservation goals in a CBC project in Kenya. Kimana Sanctuary is a flagship CBC project in Kenya. In partnership with a tourism company, the community earned sufficient monetary benefit and realized hoped-for development. While CBC is an attempt to conserve wildlife over its entire habitat in partnership with local communities, it failed to attain the expected goal of the local conservation initiative. Wildlife benefits betrayed the assumption of CBC because involved parties overlooked the discrepancy between the definitions of conservation by local people and outsiders, and the function of monetary benefits as a trigger for future change. The design of CBC projects should be based more on local subsistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3ahabitats 3apeople 3atourism 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aKenya 0aAmboseli 0aattitudes 0abenefits 0acommunity-based conservation 0aKenya1 aInoue, Makoto0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2011 Jan. 18, v. 16, no. 1 p.30-44dTaylor & Francis Groupx1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2011.531516  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002100171245010100192300001800293520179700311592002802108650001502136650002402151650001502175650001402190650001802204650001202222650001202234650002202246650001202268650003102280650001102311650003402322650003202356650000902388650002102397700002202418700002002440773010302460856008602563852000902649655001202658IND60112339420221120115417.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011233942DNAL7 a230733932pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenick, Clint A.10aJuvenile hormone induces queen development in late-stage larvae of the ant Harpegnathos saltator  ap. 1643-1649.  aA link between hormones and developmental plasticity has long been established, but understanding how evolution has shaped the physiological systems underlying plasticity remains a major question. Within the eusocial insects, developmental plasticity helps define a reproductive division of labor through the production of distinct queen and worker castes. Caste determination may be triggered via changes in juvenile hormone (JH) levels during specific JH-sensitive periods in development. The timing of these periods, however, can vary and may relate to phenotypic differences observed among species. In order to gain insight into the evolution of caste determining systems in eusocial insects, we investigated the presence of a JH-sensitive period for queen determination in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. This species displays a number of ancestral characteristics, including low queen–worker dimorphism, and should allow insight into the early evolution of caste determining systems in ants. We identified four larval instars in H. saltator, and we found that the application of a JH analog (JHA) to third and fourth instar larvae induced queen development while treatment of early instars did not. This indicated the presence of a JH-sensitive period for queen determination at the end of the larval stage. These results contrast with what has been found in other ant species, where queen determination occurs much earlier in development. Therefore, our results suggest that caste determination originally occurred late in the larval stage in the ancestral condition but has shifted earlier in development in species that began to acquire advanced characteristics. This shift may have facilitated the development of greater queen–worker dimorphism as well as multiple worker castes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3acaste determination 3adimorphism 3aevolution 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3ainstars 3ajuvenile hormones 2aAnimals 2aAntsxgrowth & development 2aFemale 2aJuvenile Hormonesxphysiology 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aMale 2aSocial Dominance1 aPrager, Steven S.1 aLiebig, Jürgen0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2012 Dec., v. 58, no. 12 p.1643-1649dElsevier Ltdx0022-19107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010800155300002000263520138500283592002801668650002401696650001101720650001201731650002101743650002101764650001301785650001201798700001801810700001301828700002201841773014401863856007402007852000902081655001202090IND60744759520221119110216.0210716e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074475952DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta01088c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Yixuan12aA non-flammable electrolyte for long-life lithium ion batteries operating over a wide-temperature range  ap. 15363-15372.  a(Phenoxy)pentafluorocyclotriphosphazene (FPPN), a kind of flame retardant, is initially mixed with gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) to formulate a new safe electrolyte, in which lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiODFB) is used as the additive to improve the electrode interfacial properties. It is found that the addition of FPPN ensures that this electrolyte is totally non-flammable, and the conductivity of this electrolyte is about 10 mS cm⁻¹, which is equivalent to that of most commercial electrolytes. More significant, this high safety electrolyte helps graphite/LiNi₀.₅Co₀.₂Mn₀.₃O₂ full cells to obtain preeminent electrochemical performance. The capacity retention of the cells reaches 85.4% after 500 cycles at 1C and room temperature, which is apparently better than that of a commercial electrolyte. Its cycle performance at elevated temperature (60 °C) exceeds that of a commercial electrolyte. Furthermore, the cell with this electrolyte can deliver a discharge capacity of about 90 mA h g⁻¹ at low temperature (−40 °C). To sum up, such an electrolyte can ensure safety and electrochemical performance in a wide-temperature range of operating conditions. The interfacial properties of electrodes are also tested by XPS and SEM measurements, and this is the first time to analyze the influence of fluorinated cyclophosphazenes on the graphite anode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanodes 3aborates 3aelectrochemistry 3aflame retardants 3agraphene 3alithium1 aFang, Shaohua1 aYang, Li1 aHirano, Shin-ichi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 14, v. 9, no. 27 p.15363-15372dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta01088c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245014900204300001600353500001900369520167700388592002802065650002502093650001202118650003602130650001802166650001702184650001702201650001602218650001102234650001402245650002002259650001102279650001102290650004302301650001102344700006002355700006302415700005502478773012002533856008202653852000902735655001202744IND60718371320221119074646.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071837132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-020-00858-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sangseo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4773-662710aAntioxidant and Antiglycation Activities of Syzygium paniculatum Gaertn and Inhibition of Digestive Enzymes Relevant to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  ap. 621-627.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAdvanced glycation end-products (AGEs) may be a contributing factor in the development of diabetes-specific vascular pathologies that affect the retina, glomerulus and peripheral nerves. In this study, Australian native food plant species Syzygium paniculatum was investigated for activities relevant to Type 2 diabetes mellitus including inhibition of α-amylase, α-glucosidase and protein glycation. A methanolic extract of the leaves showed the strongest α-amylase inhibition (IC₅₀ = 14.29 ± 0.82 μg/mL, p < 0.05) when compared with other extracts. For inhibition of α-glucosidase, the strongest inhibition was shown for the water, methanolic and acetone extracts of leaves with IC₅₀ values ranging from 4.73 ± 0.96 to 7.26 ± 0.92 μg/mL. In the BSA-glucose model, fruit and leaf extracts inhibited formation of protein-bound fluorescent AGEs with IC₅₀ values ranging between 11.82 ± 0.71 and 96.80 ± 13.41 μg/mL. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that the AGE inhibition significantly correlated with DPPH (rₚ = −0.8964, p < 0.05) and ABTS (rₚ = −0.8326, p < 0.05). α-amylase inhibitory activities strongly correlated with DPPH (rₚ = −0.8964, p < 0.001). α-glucosidase inhibition strongly correlated with TPC (rₚ = −0.9243, p < 0.05), FRAP (rₚ = −0.9502, p < 0.01), DPPH (rₚ = −0.9317, p < 0.01) and ABTS (rₚ = −0.9486, p < 0.01).

Between the late 1930s and the early 1950s it became one of the more problematic bacterial diseases of dry beans. It became an endemic problem in dry bean production throughout western Nebraska and other areas of the central high plains during the 1960s and early 1970s. By the early 1980s, the disease had virtually disappeared with the implementation of cultural practices. The disease was rediscovered in two fields in Nebraska late in the 2003 season. It was assumed to be an isolated incident. However, the next season the pathogen was widespread throughout western Nebraska production fields. Our research suggests that the return of bean wilt throughout the central high plains over the last decade is not due to a single factor but a combination of new changes in cultural practices, environmental stresses, and unfamiliarity with the pathogen and its past history.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens 3abacterial wilt 3acrop production 3adry beans 3afarms 3aforage 3agrowing season 3apathogens 3aNebraska 3aSouth Dakota1 aSchwartz, Howard F.1 aUrrea, Carlos A.1 aYonts, C.

A GUI is generally user-friendly for novice users but opens sources of irreproducible research. We illustrate that none of the 10 Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models over the Upper Blue Nile can easily be reproduced. Scripted workflows provide the ability to reproduce model set-ups, but they may be less user-friendly especially to novice users. We present a software (SWAT + AW) that promotes reproducible SWAT + model studies while remaining user-friendly for both novice and expert users. SWAT + AW uses a configuration file to create models that are compatible with GUI. We applied the workflow to the Blue Nile catchment and show that it yields the same results the SWAT + GUI. We conclude that such user-friendly scripted workflows enhance reproducibility, transparency and reusability of hydrological models.

Cognitive mechanisms of learning and memory play a pivotal role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety since exposure to cues related to aversive situations induces high arousal and anticipatory anxiety. Memory become labile after its reactivation and can be modulated by reconsolidation or extinction. Inhibition of memory reconsolidation or facilitation of memory extinction may be effective in preventing or minimizing the effect of contextual cues on anticipatory anxiety.We investigated the effect of Lavandula angustifolia EO in the memory updating of conditioned contextual fear.Adult male C57Bl6 mice were submitted to fear conditioning. Two days after conditioning the mice underwent a reactivation session in a hybrid context and were then immediately exposed to vaporized water or essential oil at concentrations of 1%, 2.5% or 5% for 3 h. Two days later, the mice were tested in the original or an altered context and their freezing behavior was measured. In addition, mice were subjected to a fear memory recovery protocol followed by a reinstatement session.In the contextual fear test, 1% essential oil, but not 2.5% or 5%, reduced the freezing behavior response, whereas after a reinstatement session, exposure to 1% essential oil increased the freezing behavior response.These results suggest that Lavandula angustifolia essential oil enhances memory extinction and, consequently, inhibits memory updating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aanxiety 3abehavior disorders 3acognition 3aessential oils 3aetiology 3afearfulness 3afreezing 3ahybrids 3amales 3amemory 3amice 3atraditional medicine 0aAnxiety 0aAromatherapy 0aFear memory 0aLavender 0aAP5 0aDMSO 0aEO 0aLVGCCs 0aNMDA1 aCorrea-Netto, Nelson Francisco1 aMasukawa, Márcia Yuriko1 aRuzzi, André1 aLinardi, Alessandra1 aSantos-Junior, Jair Guilherme0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Oct. 05, v. 260 p.113048-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1130483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245013700164300001800301500000900319520170100328592002802029650001602057650002202073650001902095650001602114650001002130650001402140650002702154650001602181650001902197650001802216650001102234650002502245650002202270650001502292650002102307650002302328650000902351650001902360650001802379650001702397650001302414650002002427650001602447650001002463650002402473650002102497650001302518650002502531650002002556650002502576650001002601650002102611700002602632700002602658700002702684773013502711856007802846852000902924655001202933IND60663380420221118064332.0191122e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066338042DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj15.01212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Adonis,10aEffect of Nitrogen, Row Spacing, and Plant Density on Yield, Yield Components, and Plant Physiology in Soybean–Wheat Intercropping  ap. 2162-2170.  aepub  aThe introduction of cultivars with earlier development and greater productivity has raised questions about the effect of management practices on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] yield in a no-till (NT) system. The objective of the study was to evaluate the interaction between N fertilization, row spacing, and plant density on photosynthetic index, yield components, yield, and nutritional status of soybean–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) intercropping. For soybean cultivation, three N rates, three row spacing, and three planting densities were assessed during two growing seasons, while for wheat, 17.5-cm row spacing and no N fertilization were used. No significant effects of row spacing and plant density were detected. The yields for 0 and 40 kg N ha–¹ rates were similar, while applying 20 kg N ha–¹ reduced, on average, soybean yield by 14.5%. The planting densities, row spacing, and N rates did not affect wheat yield, or oil and protein content in soybean seeds. Soil temperature (ST), intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci), and intrinsic water use efficiency (IWUE) increased, while plant height, chlorophyll content (CC), and transpiration rate (Trmmol) decreased with increasing spacing of soybean. Plant density changed ST, Ci, chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance (gs). Leaf tissue analysis indicated adequate nutrient levels in soybean and wheat. The current management practice with 50-cm row spacing, no N fertilization to complement biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), and 333,000 plants ha–¹ is adequate for soybean cultivation, while N supplied from soil organic matter (SOM) and BNF is sufficient to meet requirements of associated wheat crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aTriticum aestivum 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3acultivars 3afertilizer application 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3aintercropping 3aleaves 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen fixation 3ano-tillage 3anutrient content 3anutritional status 3aoils 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant density 3aplant height 3aplanting 3aprotein content 3arow spacing 3aseeds 3asoil organic matter 3asoil temperature 3asoybeans 3astomatal conductance 3atissue analysis 3awater use efficiency 3awheat 3ayield components1 aMoraes, Larissa A.

Qualitative and quantitative measurements of SCFAs in the intestinal tract and the fecal samples are important to understand the complex interplay between diet, gut microbiota and host metabolism homeostasis. To develop a new LC-MS/MS method for sensitive and reliable analysis of SCFAs in human fecal samples, 3-nitrophenylhydrazine (3NPH) was employed for pre-analytical derivatization to convert ten C2–C6 SCFAs to their 3-nitrophenylhydrazones under a single set of optimized reaction conditions and without the need of reaction quenching. The derivatives showed excellent in-solution chemical stability. They were separated on a reversed-phase C18 column and quantitated by negative-ion electrospray ionization – multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM)/MS. To achieve accurate quantitation, the stable isotope-labeled versions of the derivatives were synthesized in a single reaction vessel from 13C6-3NPH, and were used as internal standard to compensate for the matrix effects in ESI. Method validation showed on-column limits of detection and quantitation over the range from low to high femtomoles for the ten SCFAs, and the intra-day and inter-day precision for determination of nine of the ten SCFAs in human fecal samples was ≤8.8% (n=6). The quantitation accuracy ranged from 93.1% to 108.4% (CVs≤4.6%, n=6). This method was used to determine the SCFA concentrations and compositions in six human fecal samples. One of the six samples, which was collected from a clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes patient showed a significantly high molar ratio of branch-chain SCFAs to straight-chain SCFAs than the others. In summary, this work provides a new LC-MS/MS method for precise and accurate quantitation of SCFAs in human feces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acecum 3acolon 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3adiet 3afeces 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3amonitoring 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aquantitative analysis 3ashort chain fatty acids 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aShort-chain fatty acid 0aIsotope labeling 0aChemical derivatization 0a3-Nitrophenylhydrazine 0aUltrahigh performance liquid chromatography–multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry1 aLin, Karen1 aSequeira, Carita1 aBorchers, Christoph H.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Jan. 07, v. 854 p.86-94dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170520109200269592002801361650001601389650002201405650002501427650002001452650001601472650002401488653002201512653001701534653002701551653003001578653002501608700001801633700001601651700001901667773011501686856008601801852000901887655001201896IND60709521320221120165912.0201223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070952132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1048312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, T.G.10aAssessing model equifinality for robust policy analysis in complex socio-environmental systems  aEquifinality—a situation in which multiple plausible explanations exist for a single outcome—presents a challenge for socio-environmental systems modeling. When equifinality is ignored in model calibration, subsequent policy analyses may mis-estimate the range of potential policy effects. In this paper, we present and demonstrate an approach—called DMC-RPA—for generating a set of diverse model calibrations (DMC) to enable more robust policy analysis (RPA). The optimization-based approach maximizes diversity in the model parameters and/or structural configurations to efficiently represent any equifinality in the model set. We demonstrate the approach for an agent-based model that is used to compare resilience-enhancing strategies in a smallholder farming system. Results over the set of diverse model calibrations demonstrate consistent policy effects, enabling stronger conclusions than a single model analysis. Going forward, this approach can be applied in the development of socio-environmental systems models to facilitate more robust policy analysis and inference.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3apolicy analysis 3asmall farms 3asmall-scale farming 0aModel calibration 0aEquifinality 0aEvolutionary algorithm 0aPattern-oriented modeling 0aAgent-based modeling1 aGuikema, S.D.1 aBrown, D.G.1 aAgrawal, Anup,0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2020 Dec., v. 134 p.104831-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1048313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011900168300001800287520100800305592002801313650001401341650001601355650001401371650002301385650001601408650001401424650000901438650001401447653002501461653001601486653002001502653002001522700002101542700002201563773010901585856008401694852000901778655001201787IND60122419220221119044900.0150325e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012241922DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2014.8891512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShankar, Arun10aContribution of Post-Anthesis Growth and Manganese Dynamics to Differential Grain Yield in Different Wheat Species  ap. 1770-1781.  aManganese (Mn) deficiency has become a serious nutritional problem for wheat grown in alkaline coarse textured soil. The study aimed to investigate post-anthesis Mn partitioning in different wheat species. Cultivars of bread wheat (‘PBW509’, ‘DBW17’, ‘PBW550’ and ‘PBW636’); durum wheat (‘PDW291’) and triticale (‘TL2908’) were grown in 6.5 L pots with two treatments of Mn (0 and 50 mg Mn kg ⁻¹ soil) in screen house and harvested at anthesis, 18- days post-anthesis, and maturity to record Mn uptake. Durum cv. ‘PDW291’ retained highest proportion of Mn in its vegetative parts under Mn deficiency resulting into lowest partitioning to the grain and had the lowest grain yield. All bread wheat cv. facilitated superior Mn partitioning to the grain, lesser retention in vegetative organs and higher Mn utilization efficiency, than triticale and durum wheat species. Cultivars producing higher yield on Mn deficit soils are viable alternative to foliar application of Mn.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3aflowering 3afoliar application 3agrain yield 3amanganese 3asoil 3atriticale 0amanganese efficiency 0aMn dynamics 0aMn partitioning 0awheat cultivars1 aSadana, Upkar S.1 aSekhon, Nirmal K.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2014 Sept. 19, v. 37, no. 11 p.1770-1781dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2014.8891513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017000160520155600330592002801886650001101914650001801925650001701943650002301960650001801983650001802001650000902019650002202028700001902050700002102069700002202090700002602112700002502138700001502163700001902178700002302197700001802220773012302238856007502361852000902436655001202445IND60792708820221120100421.0220908e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079270882DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141735292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugustus, Eden 14aThe Impact of Nutrition-Based Interventions on Nutritional Status and Metabolic Health in Small Island Developing States: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis  aSmall island developing states (SIDS) have a high burden of nutrition-related disease associated with nutrient-poor, energy-dense diets. In response to these issues, we assessed the effectiveness of nutrition-based interventions on nutritional status (under-nutrition) and metabolic health (over-nutrition) among persons in SIDS. We included SIDS-based nutrition studies with change in nutrition status (e.g., markers of anaemia) or metabolic status (e.g., markers of glycaemia) as outcomes. The PRISMA framework was applied and MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, OARE library, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA, EconLit, AGORA, AGRICOLA, AGRIS, WHO-EMRO, and LILACS were searched (2000–2020). Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) and Cochrane ROBINS-I tools assessed ROB for randomised and non-randomised studies, respectively. PROSPERO registration (CRD42021236396) was undertaken. We included 50 eligible interventions, involving 37,591 participants: 14 trials reported on nutritional status, 36 on metabolic health. Effective interventions, evaluated at the individual level, took a multifaceted approach for metabolic outcomes; while nutrition outcomes utilised supplements. Most intervention types were suitable for issues related to ‘over’ nutrition versus ‘under’ nutrition. Twenty-six studies (nutrition status (six); metabolic health (twenty)) were effective (p < 0.05). With the current rise of nutrition-related public health challenges, there is a need for further development and evaluation of these and related interventions at the population level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3ablood glucose 3amalnutrition 3anutritional status 3aovernutrition 3apublic health 3arisk 3asystematic review1 aHaynes, Emily 1 aGuell, Cornelia 1 aMorrissey, Karyn 1 aMurphy, Madhuvanti M.1 aHalliday, Cassandra 1 aJia, Lili 1 aIese, Viliamu 1 aAnderson, Simon G.1 aUnwin, Nigel 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141735293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012400166300001600290500002000306500000900326520190600335592002802241596006602269596005902335596005902394596009602453596007602549596004702625650001402672650002302686650001802709650002002727650001302747650002402760650000902784650001902793650002402812700001902836700001802855700001802873700001502891773013302906856008303039852000903122655001203131IND60663380620221118064033.0220803e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066338062DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2018.03.01502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhanhui10aEffects of Substituting Manure for Fertilizer on Aggregation and Aggregate Associated Carbon and Nitrogen in a Vertisol  ap. 368-377.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Manure improved soil aggregate‐associated C and N sequestration. Fertilizer substituted with manure in increasing C and N concentrations used. Manure improved water stable soil aggregate stability. Fertilizer management influences the accumulation of soil organic C and N in agricultural soils. The combined use of chemical and organic fertilizers is considered a good method to enhance soil fertility, but it is still unclear about the effects of substituting manure for fertilizer on aggregation and aggregate associated organic C and N. We selected a 4‐yr‐old soil fertility experiment to examine the aggregation and aggregate associated organic C and N in response to substituting manure for fertilizer. In comparison to control, no fertilizer added (CK); substituting manure for fertilizer significantly increased organic C and N by 11.61 to 47.97% and 21.05 to 32.63% in 0‐ to 20‐cm bulk soil, respectively. It promoted organic C in the silt + clay fraction, microaggregates, small macroaggregates, and large macroaggregates by 3.17 to 17.15%, 12.94 to 34.09%, 10.99 to 50.20%, and 25.32 to 52.09%, respectively. Aggregate associated N also presented significant increases under substituting manure for fertilizer compared to CK. The mass distribution of small and large macroaggregates were 8.16 to 15.54% and 8.89 to 49.51% higher in the manure‐substituted plots than CK, respectively. Organic C and labile C were generally greater in macro‐ than microaggregates in the manure‐substituted plots; redundancy analysis confirmed that macroaggregates had positive effects on organic C and N sequestration in bulk soil and aggregates. Based on these results we suggested that substituting manure increases macroaggregate associated organic C and N, and the formation of small and large macroaggregates is accelerated by organic amendment in the test soil compared to CK.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0200107cNational Key Research and Development Program  a41877020cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41471182cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXDB15030302cStrategic Pilot and Technology Special funds of the Chinese Academy of Science  a2017CXGC0303cKey Research and Development Program of Shandong Province  aCARS-03cChina Agriculture Research System 3aVertisols 3aagricultural soils 3aclay fraction 3amicroaggregates 3anitrogen 3aorganic fertilizers 3asilt 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon1 aZhang, Congzhi1 aZhang, Jiabao1 aLiu, Changhua1 aWu, Qicong0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Jan., v. 111, no. 1 p.368-377dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.03.01503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245017600161300002000337520192500357592002802282650001502310650002602325650003102351650002102382650001102403700001902414700002002433700002102453700002402474773014402498856007402642852000902716655001202725IND60744759820221119110451.0210716e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074475982DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta01724a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhamari, Fatemeh10aConstruction of highly efficient new binder-free bimetallic metal–organic framework symmetric supercapacitors: considering surface statistical and morphological analyses  ap. 15381-15393.  aHighly efficient new binder-free bimetallic metal–organic framework (bi-MMOF) symmetric supercapacitors were fabricated. Besides, a new and influential strategy of surface statistical and morphological studies was developed to predict the superior electrochemical performance of the bi-MMOF electrodes as energy storage materials. In this regard, a one-step, in situ, binder-free, green, and efficient process was employed for tuning the conductivity of MOFs by changing metallic cations in the inorganic nodes. New binder-free Ni/Zn-BTC and Ni/Co-BTC bi-MMOF modified electrodes were constructed and compared with the as-prepared homologues mono-metallic MOF (m-MMOF) modified electrodes. According to our studies, the simultaneous participation of two metallic cations along with the integrated, binder-free, and stable films of the designed bi-MMOF modified electrodes revealed superior and enhanced features. For more information about the textural characteristic effects of MOF modified electrodes on electrochemical (EC) performance, statistical and stereometric studies were performed on the recorded AFM data based on the Bearing Area Curve (BAC), watershed algorithm, and fractal theory. As expected, the obtained data confirmed the excellent EC performance of the bi-MMOF electrodes compared to parent m-MMOF electrodes. Among the surveyed cases, Ni/Co-BTC and Ni/Zn-BTC bi-MMOF electrodes revealed the excellent specific capacities of 263.8 and 203.3 mA h g⁻¹ at 2.5 A g⁻¹, suitable rate performances of 211.0 and 134.6 mA h g⁻¹ at 20.0 A g⁻¹, and remarkable cycle-life stabilities of 95.5 and 92.0% capacity retention up to 5000 cycles. The configured symmetric supercapacitors of Ni/Co-BTC and Ni/Zn-BTC bi-MMOF provided superior energy densities of 48.6 and 25.0 W h kg⁻¹ at 2500 W kg⁻¹ power density, and excellent self-stabilities of 97.6 and 92.0% up to 5000 cycles at 30.0 A g⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy1 aRaoufi, Davood1 aAlizadeh, Saber1 aArjomandi, Jalal1 aNematollahi, Davood0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 14, v. 9, no. 27 p.15381-15393dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta01724a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03876naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245013000158300001600288520194800304592002802252650002502280650002102305650002202326650002002348650001702368650002002385650001002405650004502415650001102460650001802471650002602489650001902515650001702534650002902551653000802580653000902588653000902597653000902606653000902615653000902624653001002633653000902643653001002652653000802662653000902670653000802679653000802687653000702695653001202702653001002714653001002724653000702734653001002741653000802751653001002759653000902769653003002778653002102808653003202829653001702861700001802878700001802896700001802914700001602932773009202948856008103040852000903121655001203130IND60544753620221116145914.0160901e20150107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054475362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lu10aSingle-cell multiple gene expression analysis based on single-molecule-detection microarray assay for multi-DNA determination  ap. 122-128.  aWe report a novel ultra-sensitive and high-selective single-molecule-detection microarray assay (SMA) for multiple DNA determination. In the SMA, a capture DNA (DNAc) microarray consisting of 10 subarrays with 9 spots for each subarray is fabricated on a silanized glass coverslip as the substrate. On the subarrays, the spot-to-spot spacing is 500μm and each spot has a diameter of ∼300μm. The sequence of the DNAcs on the 9 spots of a subarray is different, to determine 8 types of target DNAs (DNAts). Thus, 8 types of DNAts are captured to their complementary DNAcs at 8 spots of a subarray, respectively, and then labeled with quantum dots (QDs) attached to 8 types of detection DNAs (DNAds) with different sequences. The ninth spot is used to detect the blank value. In order to determine the same 8 types of DNAts in 10 samples, the 10 DNAc-modified subarrays on the microarray are identical. Fluorescence single-molecule images of the QD-labeled DNAts on each spot of the subarray are acquired using a home-made single-molecule microarray reader. The amounts of the DNAts are quantified by counting the bright dots from the QDs. For a microarray, 8 types of DNAts in 10 samples can be quantified in parallel. The limit of detection of the SMA for DNA determination is as low as 1.3×10−16molL−1. The SMA for multi-DNA determination can also be applied in single-cell multiple gene expression analysis through quantification of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) corresponding to multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in single cells. To do so, total RNA in single cells is extracted and reversely transcribed into their cDNAs. Three types of cDNAs corresponding to beta-2-microglobulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribosomal protein, large, P2 mRNAs in single human breast cancer cells and 5 random synthetic DNAts are simultaneously quantified to examine the SMA and SMA-based single-cell multiple gene expression analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abreast neoplasms 3acomplementary DNA 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3aglass 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm cells 3aquantum dots 3atranscription (genetics) 0aBSA 0acDNA 0aDNAc 0aDNAd 0aDNAt 0adNTP 0aEMCCD 0aFISH 0aGAPDH 0aLOD 0amRNA 0aPBS 0aPCR 0aQD 0aqRT-PCR 0aRNase 0aRPLP2 0aRT 0aSA-QD 0aSMA 0aTIRFM 0aβ2M 0aSingle-molecule detection 0aMicroarray assay 0aSingle-cell gene expression 0aQuantum dots1 aWang, Xianwei1 aZhang, Xiaoli1 aWang, Jinxing1 aJin, Wenrui0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Jan. 07, v. 854 p.122-128dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01246naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245008700156300001600243520040200259592002800661650001800689650001200707650001000719650001100729650002600740650001400766773009600780856007100876852000900947655001200956IND60518544320221119065458.0160418e197111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051854432DNAL7 a10.2307/19338012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanger, Jon E.10aIdentification and Quantitative Measurement of Plant Pigments in Soil Humus Layers  ap. 959-963.  aPigments in soil organic matter layers of an oak forest, a spruce—cedar woodland, and a prairie have been identified and measured quantitatively.

The addition of bactridine 2 to DUM neurons induced a large current component with a reversal potential more negative than −30mV, most evident at the end of the pulses. This current was completely suppressed when 1μM amiloride was applied before adding the bactridines. Since the amiloride sensitive current is able to distort the aim of our study, i.e. the effect of bactridines on sodium channels, all experiments were done in the presence of 1μM amiloride. Most bactridines induced voltage shifts of V₁/₂ of the Boltzmann inactivation voltage dependency curves in the hyperpolarizing direction. Bactridines 1, 4 and 6 reduced Na current peak by 65, 80 and 24% of the control, respectively. The sodium conductance blockage by bactridines was voltage independent at potentials >20mV. Bactridines effect on cricket DUM neurons does not correspond to neither α- nor β-toxins. Most bactridines shifted the inactivation curves in the hyperpolarizing direction without any effects on the activation m∞-like curves. Also bactridines differ from other NaScpTx in that they increased an amiloride-sensitive conductance in DUM neurons. Our result suggest that the α/β classification of sodium scorpion toxins is not all encompassing. The present work shows that bactridines target more than one site: insect voltage dependent Na channels and an amiloride-sensitive ionic pathway which is under study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGryllidae 3aScorpiones 3ainsects 3aneurons 3asodium 3asodium channels 3atoxins 2aAmiloride 2aAnimals 2aGryllidae 2aNeuronsxdrug effects 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPeptidesxpharmacology 2aScorpion Venomsxpharmacology 2aScorpions 2aSodium Channelsxdrug effects1 aSevcik, C.1 aMartı´nez, R.1 aCastillo, C.1 aD’Suze, G.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2012 Dec., v. 58, no. 12 p.1676-1685dElsevier Ltdx0022-19107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245008500176300001600261500001900277520105500296592002801351650002301379650001201402650001001414650001001424650002001434650001601454650002401470650001601494650001601510650001101526650001401537650000901551700006101560700006101621700005801682700006701740700006101807773012001868856008201988852000902070655001202079IND60718371820221119074554.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071837182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-020-00864-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuárez-Estrella, Diego10aEffect of Sprouting on Proteins and Starch in Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)  ap. 635-641.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aims at understanding the relation among sprouting time (from 12 up to 72 h), changes in protein and starch components, and flour functionality in quinoa. Changes related to the activity of sprouting-related proteases were observed after 48 h of sprouting in all protein fractions. Progressive proteolysis resulted in relevant modification in the organization of quinoa storage proteins, with a concomitant increase in the availability of physiologically relevant metals such as copper and zinc. Changes in the protein profile upon sprouting resulted in improved foam stability, but in impaired foaming capacity. The increased levels of amylolytic enzymes upon sprouting also made starch less prompt to gelatinize upon heating. Consequently, starch re-association in a more ordered structure upon cooling was less effective, resulting in low setback viscosity. The nature and the intensity of these modifications suggest various possibilities as for using flour from sprouted quinoa as an ingredient in the formulation of baked products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium quinoa 3acooling 3aflour 3afoams 3ahuman nutrition 3aingredients 3aprotein composition 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3astarch 3aviscosity 3azinc1 aBresciani, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9227-60841 aIametti, Stefania1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4159-37681 aMarengo, Mauro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5389-39791 aPagani, Maria Ambrogina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3772-47961 aMarti, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9483-77540 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 75, no. 4 p.635-641dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-020-00864-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165300001600283520136100299592002801660650001801688650001601706650001701722650001201739650002501751650001601776650001501792650001701807650001401824650001801838650001401856650001301870650001001883650000901893653002001902700002301922700002301945773008201968856008102050852000902131655001202140IND60638255420221120073637.0190427s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063825542DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Sergio10aAssessment of Cambial Activity and Xylogenesis by Microsampling Tree Species: An Example at the Alpine Timberline  ap. 383-394.  aMechanisms of cell production and maturation and dynamics of xylem formation have been widely studied in trees in order to better characterize stem radial growth. Histological analyses have been used in this study to describe cambial activity and xylem cell differentiation in Larix decidua, Pinus cembra and Picea abies at the Alpine timberline. Wood microcores were collected weekly from April to October 2003 and cross sections prepared to distinguish xylem cells of the growing tree ring and to determine the number of cells in the cambial zone, radial cell enlargement, secondary wall thickening and lignification and the number of mature tracheids. The anatomical changes characterizing the phases of xylem cell production and differentiation during the year are described and discussed. All species showed the same trend of xylem formation. Three delayed bell-shaped curves and an S-shaped curve were observed for cambium, enlarging and wall thickening cells and mature cells, respectively. Cells divided in the cambial zones from April-May to August, depending on the species. From 100 to 130 days were required to complete cell differentiation. Tree-ring formation ended during September. The average periods spent on radial enlargement, and secondary cell wall thickening and lignification were estimated at 7–10 and 20–25 days, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix decidua 3aPicea abies 3aPinus cembra 3acambium 3acell differentiation 3acell growth 3acell walls 3agrowth rings 3ahistology 3alignification 3atracheids 3atreeline 3atrees 3awood 0awall thickening1 aDeslauriers, Annie1 aAnfodillo, Tommaso0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 27, no. 4 p.383-394dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012300162300001600285520108400301592002801385650002301413650002001436650002101456650001501477650001301492650000701505650001301512650001501525650001101540650001301551700001401564700001701578700002301595700001601618773009301634856008101727852000901808655001201817IND60474691820221123013716.0151223e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047469182DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0184-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarahi, A.10aElectrochemical Determination of Paraquat in Tomato at Ag/NP-Modified Graphite Electrode Using Square Wave Voltammetry  ap. 139-147.  aA square wave voltammetry method for the determination of trace amounts of paraquat using carbon paste electrode modified with silver particles impregnated onto natural phosphate Ag/NP–carbon paste electrode (CPE) was proposed. The response of paraquat related to the preconcentration time, Ag/NP loading, and measuring solution pH was investigated. The results showed that the signal response is linear with the increase of paraquat concentration in the range from 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ to 1.0 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹. The detection limit (DL, 3σ) and quantification limit (QL, 10σ) for peak 1 were 1.34 × 10⁻¹⁰ and 4.49 × 10⁻¹⁰ mol L⁻¹, respectively, and for peak 2 were 5.07 × 10⁻⁹ and 16.4 × 10⁻⁹ mol L⁻¹, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of paraquat in the tomato with satisfactory results.

We evaluated a variety of manual removal methods for efficacy in reducing viable seed production in garlic mustard. Plants were uprooted and evaluated for subsequent viable seed production based on four variables: (1) height (short, tall), (2) phenological stage (flowering, early-fruiting, late-fruiting), (3) deradication (root removed from uprooted plant), and (4) disposal method (hang, scatter, pile). Uprooting plants at the flowering stage prevented production of any viable seed, while early- and late-fruiting plants were still able to produce viable seed. Fruits initiated on taller plants (≥ 40 cm) produced significantly (P < 0.01) more viable seed than those on short plants (≤ 35 cm). Deradication of uprooted plants did not offer an advantage in reducing viable seed production. There were no significant differences in viable seed production between groups of plants subjected to different disposal methods. Garlic mustard root systems left in the ground after aboveground portions of the plants were removed at four phenological stages (budding, flowering, early-fruiting, and late-fruiting) either did not resprout or produced short-lived sprouts that died without flowering. Our findings suggest that pulling garlic mustard before fruit initiation will reduce seed production, regardless of the disposal method employed or whether roots are left intact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlliaria petiolata 3aflowering 3afruits 3aroot systems 3aroots 0aAlliaria petiolata 0agarlic mustard 0ainvasive plant management 0amanual removal 0aResprouting1 aCantino, Philip D.1 aMcCarthy, Brian C.0 tNatural areas journal.g2012 July, v. 32, no. 3 p.305-315dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.032.03083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245013800162300001800300520099100318592002801309650002201337650001201359650001201371650001601383650001401399650001101413650001401424650001301438650001301451650001301464650002101477650001501498650001901513650001401532650001601546650001401562650001101576650001601587653003501603653001801638653002601656653002001682653002201702700001401724700002101738700001601759700001801775700002001793773010901813856008401922852000902006655001202015IND60122419620221119044829.0150325e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012241962DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2014.9113212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNa, Liu10aEffect of Nitrate/Ammonium Ratios on Growth, Root Morphology and Nutrient Elements Uptake of Watermelon (Citrullus Lanatus) Seedlings  ap. 1859-1872.  aNitrogen is taken up by most plant species in the form of nitrate and ammonium. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different nitrogen forms on the growth of watermelon seedlings. Plants were grown in hydroponic culture with five nitrate (NO ₃⁻)/ammonium (NH ₄⁺) ratios (100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75, 0/100). When the proportion of NH ₄⁺ was increased, the leaf number, leaf area, shoot height, net photosynthesis, biomass, and root growth were significantly decreased. Higher concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were observed when plants were supplied with mixed NO ₃⁻ and NH ₄⁺ compared to NO ₃⁻ or NH ₄⁺ alone, whereas the concentrations of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were decreased with increasing NH ₄⁺. The microelements concentrations were generally increased with more NH ₄⁺ added. In addition, plants fed with higher NO ₃⁻/NH ₄⁺ ratios resulted in more minerals accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrullus lanatus 3abiomass 3acalcium 3ahydroponics 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3aminerals 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3aroot growth 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3awatermelons 0awatermelon (Citrullus lanatus) 0anitrogen form 0adry matter production 0aroot morphology 0amineral nutrition1 aLi, Zhang1 aXiangxiang, Meng1 aAra, Neelam1 aJinghua, Yang1 aMingfang, Zhang0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2014 Sept. 19, v. 37, no. 11 p.1859-1872dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2014.9113213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245016000153300001800313520103800331592002801369650001801397650001701415650001601432650001401448650001901462650001101481650001201492650002001504650001101524650003601535650001101571700001601582700002101598700002001619773009801639856007101737852000901808655001201817IND60518544620221119065210.0160418e197111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051854462DNAL7 a10.2307/19338182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallace, A.10aCarboxydismutase and Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase Activities From Leaves of Some Plant Species from the Northern Mojave and Southern Great Basin Deserts  ap. 1093-1095.  aOf 14 xerophytic plant species studied, only two (members of the Chenopodiaceae) exhibited high phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase and low carboxydismutase activities. Three other members of the Chenopodiaceae exhibited carobyxlase activities characteristic of both the C_4—dicarboxylic acid pathway and the Calvin cycle in the same species. Activities range from high PEP carboxylase and moderately high carboxydismutase to, conversely, high carboxydismutase and moderately high PEP carboxylase activity, including moderately high levels of nearly equal activities of each enzyme. Hence, gradations between extremes of the two photosynthetic systems can occur in the same species. Members of three other families (Ephedraceae, Zygophyllaceae, and Liliaceae) had carboxylase activities characteristic of both photosynthetic systems in the same species. The enzymatic activity of plants which continue to grow during hot summers was characteristic of either the C_4—dicarboxylic acid pathway or of both photosynthetic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthaceae 3aCalvin cycle 3aEphedraceae 3aLiliaceae 3aZygophyllaceae 3abasins 3adeserts 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3asummer1 aHale, V.

We have recently reported that miglitol, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, increases fecal BA excretion and ameliorate insulin resistance and obesity in mice. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms by which miglitol affects BA metabolism. The expression of genes regulating BA metabolism, gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were examined.NSY mice, representing an obese type 2 diabetic model, were fed with a high-fat diet with or without miglitol for 4 weeks. The expression of BA-related genes in the liver and the lower intestine were measured. Alterations in fecal microbiome, fecal SCFA along with plasma lipid levels were also evaluated.Miglitol significantly increased fecal BA secretion and markedly upregulated the mRNA expression, protein levels and enzyme activity of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme of BA synthesis. In the intestine, miglitol treatment significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and ATP-binding cassette transporter G5 and G8. In fecal microbiome, the prevalence of prevotella was remarkably reduced and that of clostridium subcluster XIVa was increased by miglitol. Miglitol elevated formic and n-butyric acids along with total SCFA concentration in feces, while succinic acid was decreased. There was no change in plasma total cholesterol levels.Collectively, miglitol may affect BA metabolism via enhanced CYP7A1 activity resulting from at least in part the alterations in gut microbiome and SCFA production in obese diabetic mice.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors 0aBile acids 0aCholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 0aGut microbiome 0aShort-chain fatty acids 0aMiglitol1 aGoto, Moritaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5376-41091 aNishimura, Go1 aNagasaki, Hiroshi1 aSeino, Yusuke1 aKamiya, Hideki1 aNakamura, Jiro0 tMetabolism open.g2020 Mar., v. 5 p.100024-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27307x2589-93687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.metop.2020.1000243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012300165506031000288520147400598592002802072650001202100650001202112650001902124650001602143650001402159650000902173650002202182650001802204650001002222650001402232650001402246650001502260650001802275650002302293650002202316650001402338650001502352650001102367650002202378650001102400650001602411651001002427653001902437653002502456653002202481653000802503653001802511700002002529700001902549773010902568856008102677852000902758655001202767IND60478805820221119060126.0160114e20140820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047880582DNAL7 a10.4081/jlimnol.2014.10142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMANCA, Marina10aInter-Annual Climate Variability and Zooplankton: Applying Teleconnection Indices to Two Deep Subalpine Lakes in Italy  aThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.  aInvestigating relation between meteo-climatic indices and between-year variation in Daphnia population density and phenology is crucial for e.g. predicting impact of climate change on lake ecosystem structure and functioning. We tested whether and how two teleconnection indices calculated for the winter period, namely the East Atlantic pattern (EADJF) and the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern (EMPDJF) were correlated with Daphnia population growth in two Italian subalpine lakes, Garda and Maggiore. We investigated between-lake temporal coherence in: i) water temperature within the water layer in which Daphnia is distributed; ii) timing of Daphnia initial and spring maximum population density peak and iii) the level of Daphnia spring maximum population density peak over an eleven-year period (1998-2008) of unchanged predation pressure by fish and invertebrates, and of common oligotrophy. Between-lake temporal coherence was high for an earlier start, and earlier, and lower, Daphnia population spring density peak after milder winters. Peak density level was coherently, positively correlated with soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration. We hypothesized that Daphnia peak densities were related to atmospheric modes of variability in winter and to the degree of late winter mixing promoting replenishment of algal nutrients into upper water layers and phytoplankton growth, enhancing food availability and Daphnia fecundity, promoting and Daphnia peak.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3afecundity 3afish 3afood availability 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3anutrients 3aphenology 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3aprediction 3aspring 3awater temperature 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aItaly 0aClimate change 0apopulation phenology 0aDaphnia fecundity 0aSRP 0aphytoplankton1 aROGORA, Michela1 aSalmaso, Nico,0 tJournal of limnology.g2014 Aug. 20, v. 74, no. 1dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx1723-86337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.10143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245007900167300001800246500001900264500000900283520151500292592002801807650002301835650001001858650001901868650002201887650002201909650001501931650001401946650000901960650002701969650001401996650002502010651001402035700002202049700003102071700002002102773012302122856008102245852000902326655001202335IND60665234520221118150228.0191228e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066523452DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.14122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, Oscar J.10aMolecular and Phenotypic Diversity of Common Bean Landraces from Nicaragua  ap. 1412-1418.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aThe knowledge and understanding of the genetic structure of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) landraces is important for the implementation of measures addressed to their management and conservation. The purpose of this paper was to study the pattern of genetic variation in nine red-seeded landraces currently grown by farmers with molecular and phenotypic markers. Twelve individuals per landrace were genotyped with seven bean microsatellite markers. Fourteen phenotypic traits were additionally measured in a field study in two localities. An important finding of this study was the complementary information obtained with both kinds of markers. Most of the variation at the molecular level was explained by differences within or among landraces but not among agroecological zones, while at the phenotypic level most of the variation was attributed to differences among agroecological zones. This suggests that molecular differentiation of landraces [coancestry coefficient (F ST) = 0.34] was due to founder effect while phenotypic differentiation was due to the effect of adaptation. Within landraces, an average of 5.7 alleles per locus was identified, with a range from 2 to 13 alleles depending on the individual microsatellite. The average gene diversity within landraces and total gene diversity was 0.35 and 0.51, respectively. Implications of the findings in planning future collections of genetic resources of common bean as well as the effect of sites on uncovering adaptive traits are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3afounder effect 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3alandraces 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aNicaragua1 aBlair, Matthew W.1 aFrankow-Lindberg, Bodil E.1 aGullberg, Urban0 tCrop science.g2004 July, v. 44, no. 4 p.1412-1418dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.14123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011800175300001600293520144100309592002801750650002501778650002501803650002801828650001401856650001901870650002001889650001501909650001301924650000901937650003801946650001201984650001001996651001102006653001902017653002502036653002202061653001502083700002402098700002502122700002602147700002102173700002602194700002302220773012102243856008502364852000902449655001202458IND60566913320221119040118.0170414e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056691332DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2016.12706822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarques, Leandro N.10aOccurrence of mycotoxins in wheat grains exposed to fungicides on fusarium head blight control in southern Brazil  ap. 244-250.  aMycotoxins occurrence in wheat grains impose risks to human and animal health. The southern Brazil has favorable weather conditions for Fusarium graminearum infections and consequently for mycotoxins accumulation on grains. The goal of this study was to evaluate the behavior of new wheat commercial genotypes to Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), to control performance of new fungicide formulations and their relationship with mycotoxins concentration in grains. The manly mycotoxin occurrence on wheat grains in southern Brazil was deoxynivalenol (DON). Two cultivars showed high DON concentration above the tolerance limits (>3000 μg kg ⁻¹). Many other mycotoxins monitored presented concentrations below method detection limit. Satisfactory levels of fungicide effectiveness were achieved against F. graminearum . Some fungicides promoted a satisfactory decrease on DON accumulation in grains. The best results were obtained when prothioconazole was present. SDHI (Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors) + QoI (Quinone outside inhibitors) fungicides showed benefic effects at FHB control at field, but it did not promote satisfactory reduction on DON contamination. Fungicides can be used satisfactory for FHB control and reduce DON contamination in grains in southern Brazil. The presence of prothioconazole should be recommended. Some genotypes showed high DON concentration and it was not directly related with FHB severity at field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aanimal and human health 3acultivars 3adeoxynivalenol 3adetection limit 3afungicides 3agenotype 3arisk 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aweather 3awheat 3aBrazil 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aFusarium graminearum 0aTriticum aestivum 0afungicides1 aPizzutti, Ionara R.1 aBalardin, Ricardo S.1 aDos Santos, Ingrid D.1 aDias, Jonatan V.1 aStefanello, Marlon T.1 aSerafini, Pablo T.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 52, no. 4 p.244-250dTaylor & Francisx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2016.12706823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167520183700297592002802134650002302162650001402185650001702199650001802216650001502234650001302249650003102262650001002293650001602303650001002319650003602329650004302365650000902408650002602417650002202443650001802465650002002483651000902503653002302512653001702535653001802552653001902570653002002589653002302609700001802632700001602650773012002666856008202786852000902868655001202877IND60749106620221120022645.0220614e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074910662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1009032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Chuan-Lei10aTranscriptomic analysis of pre-diapause larvae of Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in natural populations  aChilo suppressalis Walker is a devastating pest of rice in Asia and exhibits facultative diapause in the larval stage. Most prior experiments on diapausing and non-diapausing C. suppressalis were conducted in the laboratory. In this study, transcriptome analyses were performed on pre-diapausing larvae collected from field populations of C. suppressalis and compared to laboratory populations. Among 2674 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 32 DEGs related to pre-diapause and 239 universally expressed genes were screened; these were primarily enriched in “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction”, “lysosome” and “glycerolipid metabolism” in KEGG pathway analysis. With respect to clusters of orthologous genes (COG), DEGs were assigned to “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”, “carbohydrate transport and metabolism”, and “secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism” categories. Further analysis also revealed that a key “circadian clock-controlled protein” gene is sensitive to photoperiod and significantly decreased during the pre-diapause phase. Genes encoding two small heat shock proteins, hsp21.4 and hsp27.2, were significantly expressed on August 15 as compared to three other sampling times in August 2018. Eight DEGs were randomly chosen and evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to validate the accuracy of the transcriptome data. The expression of six DEGs (gene-evm_000752, gene-evm_006486, gene-evm_008626, gene-evm_002485, gene-evm_011981 and Chilo_suppressalis_newGene_18103) showed significant same patterns of differential expression in both the RT-qPCR and RNA-Seq analyses. This study increases our understanding of the complex physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in C. suppressalis at the pre-diapause phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChilo suppressalis 3aPyralidae 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrates 3acatabolism 3adiapause 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat stress 3apests 3apost-translational modification 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aAsia 0aChilo suppressalis 0aPre-diapause 0aTranscriptome 0aEnergy storage 0aCircadian clock 0aHeat shock protein1 aLu, Ming-Xing1 aDu, Yu-Zhou0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Dec., v. 40 p.100903-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1009033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245017100161300001200332500001900344520122700363592002801590650002001618650001301638650002101651650002201672650001501694650001301709650001901722650001901741651001101760653003101771653001601802653001401818653002201832653001701854700002001871700002301891700002301914700002701937700002101964773011501985856007502100852000902175655001202184IND60698688620221116232951.0200615e20140612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069868862DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.38.73022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Geice R.10aNew molecular evidence for fragmentation between two distant populations of the threatened stingless bee Melipona subnitida Ducke (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini)  ap. 1-9.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFor a snapshot assessment of the genetic diversity present within Melipona subnitida, an endemic stingless bee distributed in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil, populations separated by over 1,000 km distance were analyzed by ISSR genotyping. This is a prerequisite for the establishment of efficient management and conservation practices. From 21 ISSR primers tested, only nine revealed consistent and polymorphic bands (loci). PCR reactions resulted in 165 loci, of which 92 were polymorphic (57.5%). Both ΦST (ARLEQUIN) and θᴮ (HICKORY) presented high values of similar magnitude (0.34, p<0.0001 and 0.33, p<0.0001, respectively), showing that these two groups were highly structured. The dendrogram obtained by the cluster analysis and the scatter-plot of the PCoA corroborate with the data presented by the AMOVA and θᴮ tests. Clear evidence of subdivision among sampling sites was also observed by the Bayesian grouping model analysis (STRUCTURE) of the ISSR data. It is clear from this study that conservation strategies should take into account the heterogeneity of these two separate populations, and address actions towards their sustainability by integrating our findings with ecological tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMelipona 3acluster analysis 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aresearch 3asemiarid zones 3astingless bees 3aBrazil 0aPopulation differentiation 0aHymenoptera 0aJandaíra 0agenetic diversity 0aISSR markers1 aSouza, Bruno A.1 aPereira, Fábia M.1 aLopes, Maria T.

Merrill] are needed to manage Phytopthora stem and root rot (PRR). This study used an inoculum source composed of multiple isolates of the pathogen to characterize partial resistance (PR) to P. sojae in plant introduction (PI) 399036. Two recombinant inbred line (RIL) F₅:₇ populations developed by crossing PI 399036 (high PR), with two germplasm lines (low PR), AR2 (AX20925) and AR3 (AX20931), were screened. Corrected dry weights (CDW—root and shoot) and percentage root rot data were collected. Inclusive composite interval mapping identified one putative quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 2 by all disease assessment parameters in the AX20925 population that explained 6 to 14% of the total phenotypic variation and five putative minor QTL on 5 chromosomes (3, 6, 12, 15, and 19) that individually explained 5 to 9% of the phenotypic variation. In the AX20931 population, two QTL, mapped to chromosome 9 and 17, were commonly identified by CDW while the QTL identified on chromosome 9 accounted for 21 to 30% of the total phenotypic variation. Additional QTL identified by CDW on chromosomes 9, 13, 14, and 15 individually accounted for 5 to 8% of the phenotypic variation. PI 399036 contributed the favorable alleles for the majority of the identified QTL. This study demonstrates the usefulness of PI 399036 as a novel source for breeding for resistance to PRR and that an inoculum mixture of P. sojae isolates with varying pathotypes can be used to identify putative QTL for PR to P. sojae using the rice (Oryza sativa) method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aOryza sativa 3aPhytophthora sojae 3achromosomes 3agermplasm 3ainbred lines 3ainoculum 3aintroduced plants 3apathogens 3apathotypes 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3aroot rot 3asoybeans1 aMatthiesen, Rashelle L.1 aCianzio, Silvia R.1 aBhattacharyya, Madan K.1 aRobertson, Alison E.0 tCrop science.g2016 Sept., v. 56, no. 5 p.2322-2335dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2015.09.05783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245008100201300001800282500001500300506007600315520144500391592002801836506003701864650004501901650001201946650001801958650001801976650002601994650001102020650001402031650002902045650002202074650001002096650002302106650001602129650001502145650002902160650001302189650002002202653002502222700001802247700002002265700001902285700002502304700002502329773013602354856008002490852000902570655001202579IND4469221020221207064741.0120326e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446922102DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00651-112doi7 aPMC31871042pmcid7 a218217522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeshita, Toru10aEnteral Tube Feeding Alters the Oral Indigenous Microbiota in Elderly Adults  ap. 6739-6745.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnteral tube feeding is widely used to maintain nutrition for elderly adults with eating difficulties, but its long-term use alters the environment of the oral ecosystem. This study characterized the tongue microbiota of tube-fed elderly adults by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of 44 tube-fed subjects were compared with those of 54 subjects fed orally (average age, 86.4 Â± 6.9 years). Bar-coded pyrosequencing data were also obtained for a subset of the subjects from each group (15 tube-fed subjects and 16 subjects fed orally). The T-RFLP profiles demonstrated that the microbiota of the tube-fed subjects was distinct from that of the subjects fed orally (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [perMANOVA], P < 0.001). The pyrosequencing data revealed that 22 bacterial genera, including Corynebacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Fusobacterium, were significantly more predominant in tube-fed subjects, whereas the dominant genera in the subjects fed orally, such as Streptococcus and Veillonella, were present in much lower proportions. Opportunistic pathogens rarely detected in the normal oral microbiota, such as Corynebacterium striatum and Streptococcus agalactiae, were often found in high proportions in tube-fed subjects. The oral indigenous microbiota is disrupted by the use of enteral feeding, allowing health-threatening bacteria to thrive.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aelderly 3aribosomal RNA 3aFusobacterium 3amultivariate analysis 3atongue 3apathogens 3aCorynebacterium striatum 3aelderly nutrition 3agenes 3aPeptostreptococcus 3aVeillonella 3aecosystems 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3abacteria 3aenteral feeding 0aanalysis of variance1 aYasui, Masaki1 aTomioka, Mikiko1 aNakano, Yoshio1 aShimazaki, Yoshihiro1 aYamashita, Yoshihisa0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 77, no. 19 p.6739-6745dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00651-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014100169520150800310592002801818650001501846650001901861650001301880650001601893650001001909650001901919650001501938650001901953650001901972650001501991650001402006650001602020650001702036650001702053650001502070653001902085653002602104653001902130653001902149653002902168700001702197700001702214700001302231700001602244700002002260700005302280773011402333856008602447852000902533655001202542IND60727608420221117083750.0210918e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072760842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1253762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Quanhao10aBoosting photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline under visible light over hierarchical carbon nitride microrods with carbon vacancies  aGraphitic carbon nitride is considered as one of the promising photocatalysts for pollution elimination from wastewater. Manipulating the microstructure of carbon nitride remains a challengeable task, which is essential for improving light absorption, separating photogenerated carrier and creating reactive sites. Herein, a carbon vacancy modified hierarchical carbon nitride microrod (CN1.5) has been prepared templated from a melamine-NH₂OH·HCl complex. The hierarchical microrods are demonstrated to be comprised of interconnected nanosheets with rich carbon vacancies, which endows it with high specific surface area, enhanced light utilization efficiency, available reactive sites, improved charge carrier separation and numerous mass-transport channels. The resultant photocatalyst CN1.5 exhibits an excellent photodegradation efficiency of 87.9% towards tetracycline under visible light irradiation. The remarkable apparent rate constant of 4.91 × 10⁻² min⁻¹ is 7.3 times higher than that of bulk CN. In addition, the degradation pathways are deduced base on the observation of degradation intermediates generating in the photocatalytic process. Mechanism investigation indicates that the major contribution for photodegradation is attributed to ·O₂–, ¹O₂ and H₂O₂ species. This work provides new insights into advancing carbon nitride's microstructure to improve photocatalytic degradation performance for highly efficient antibiotic removal and environment remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon nitride 3agraphene 3airradiation 3alight 3amicrostructure 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollution 3aremediation 3asurface area 3atetracycline 3awastewater 0aCarbon nitride 0aHierarchical microrod 0aCarbon vacancy 0aPhotocatalysis 0aTetracycline degradation1 aWei, Lingfei1 aBibi, Rehana1 aWang, Ke1 aHao, Dandan1 aZhou, Jiancheng1 aLi, Naixu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0524-54750 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 July 05, v. 413 p.125376-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1253763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009800165300001600263520201200279592002802291650001502319650002702334650002202361650001502383650001702398650001202415650001502427650001502442650000902457650001402466650001102480650002502491650001302516650001102529650002002540700001702560700001902577700002502596700001902621700001902640700002102659700002202680700001902702773010302721856008202824852000902906655001202915IND60091536320221121191745.0141103e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009153632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoju10aMediatorless sugar/oxygen enzymatic fuel cells based on gold nanoparticle-modified electrodes  ap. 219-225.  aWe report on the fabrication and characterisation of a gold-nanoparticle (AuNP)-based mediatorless sugar/oxygen biofuel cell (BFC) operating in neutral sugar-containing buffers and human physiological fluids, such as blood and plasma. First, Corynascus thermophilus cellobiose dehydrogenase (CtCDH) and Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase (MvBOx), used as anodic and cathodic bioelements, respectively, were immobilised on gold electrodes modified with 20nm AuNPs. Detailed characterisation and optimisation of a new CDH/AuNP-based bioanode were performed and the following fundamental parameters were obtained: (i) the redox potential of the haem-containing centre of the enzyme was measured to be 75mV vs. NHE, (ii) the surface coverage of CtCDH was found to be 0.65pmolcm⁻² corresponding to a sub-monolayer coverage of the thiol-modified AuNPs by the enzyme, (iii) a turnover number for CtCDH immobilised on thiol-modified AuNPs was calculated to be ca. 0.5s⁻¹, and (iv) the maximal current densities as high as 40μAcm⁻² were registered in sugar-containing neutral buffers. Second, both biomodified electrodes, namely the CtCDH/AuNP-based bioanode and the MvBOx/AuNP-based biocathode, were combined into a functional BFC and the designed biodevices were carefully investigated. The following characteristics of the mediator-, separator- and membrane-less, miniature BFC were obtained: in phosphate buffer; an open-circuit voltage of 0.68V, a maximum power density of 15μWcm⁻² at a cell voltage of 0.52V and in human blood; an open-circuit voltage of 0.65V, a maximum power density of 3μWcm⁻² at a cell voltage of 0.45V, respectively. The estimated half-lives of the biodevices were found to be >12, <8, and <2h in a sugar-containing buffer, human plasma, and blood, respectively. The basic characteristics of mediatorless sugar/oxygen BFCs were significantly improved compared with previously designed biodevices, because of the usage of three-dimensional AuNP-modified electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynascus 3aMyrothecium verrucaria 3abilirubin oxidase 3abiosensors 3ablood plasma 3abuffers 3acellobiose 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3amicrobial fuel cells 3ananogold 3aoxygen 3aredox potential1 aFalk, Magnus1 aOrtiz, Roberto1 aMatsumura, Hirotoshi1 aBobacka, Johan1 aLudwig, Roland1 aBergelin, Mikael1 aGorton, L.q(Lo),1 aShleev, Sergey0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 31, no. 1 p.219-225dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008200161300001800243520185400261592002802115596005102143650001502194650001602209650000902225650001602234650002602250650002002276650002102296650002302317650002102340650001602361650002302377650002102400700002002421700001902441700001602460700001702476773013702493856008202630852000902712655001202721IND60637226320221119103037.0190416e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063722632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-019-02242-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuo10aClassification and characterization of bound water in marine mucky silty clay  ap. 2509-2519.  aPURPOSE: Bound water has a large impact on physical and chemical properties of clay. The objective of this study was to investigate the contents, types, and physical properties of bound water and provide insights for understanding the thermal behavior and hydration process of the marine mucky silty clay under the control of bound water. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An integrated approach incorporating isothermal adsorption, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and specific gravity testing were developed to determine the contents and the boundaries of different types of bound water in Qingdao clay and investigate their physical characteristics. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Adsorption isotherm can be divided into two phases, which are the formation of strongly bound water and some capillary water under condition of p/pₛ < 0.9 and the formation of weakly bound water in the coverage for p/pₛ > 0.9. The initial dehydration temperatures of strongly bound water range between 87 and 92 °C in the hydrated clays under condition of p/pₛ < 0.98. Weakly bound water starts to be released at temperatures near 60 °C and is completely removed at temperatures between 90 and 108 °C. Capillary water and free water are evaporated before 60 °C. The specific gravity of hydrated clay decreases linearly with adsorbed water contents. The volume of hydrated clay, volume of adsorbed water, and thickness of water film approximately linearly increase with adsorbed water contents. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative determination and classification for bound water can be implemented through thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves. The physical properties of hydrated clay and bound water film are directly affected by the adsorbed water contents. The results may contribute to environmental and engineering risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data  a41572257cNatural Science Foundations of China 3aadsorption 3abound water 3aclay 3aengineering 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk assessment 3asilty clay soils 3asorption isotherms 3aspecific gravity 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry1 aWang, Changming1 aZhang, Xianwei1 aZou, Linlin1 aDai, Zhenxue0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2019 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.2509-2519dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02242-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245016900206520143500375592002801810650001801838650001201856650001701868650001201885650001901897650001901916650001601935650001701951650004101968650001002009650002202019650000902041650001402050650001602064650001202080650001802092650002002110650001802130650001602148651002102164651001502185653001902200653002002219653002202239653002902261653001702290700001602307700005602323700005602379773011402435856008602549852000902635655001202644IND60727608520221117083600.0210918e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072760852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1253772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yifan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7360-242214aThe elucidation of the biodegradation of nitrobenzene and p-nitrophenol of nitroreductase from Antarctic psychrophile Psychrobacter sp. ANT206 under low temperature  aPsychrobacter is one important typical strain in the Antarctic environment. In our previous study, Psychrobacter sp. ANT206 from Antarctica with novel cold-adapted nitroreductase (PsNTR) could biodegrade nitrobenzene and p-nitrophenol in low temperature environment. In this study, the in-frame deletion mutant of psntr (Δpsntr-ANT206) that displayed well genetic stability and kanamycin resistance stability was constructed using allelic replacement method. Additionally, Δpsntr-ANT206 was more sensitive to nitrobenzene and p-nitrophenol in the comparison of heat and hyperosmolarity, suggesting that psntr gene participated in the regulation of the tolerance against nitro-aromatic compounds (NACs). Further analysis was conducted by integrated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and several metabolites were identified. Among them, ethylbenzene, L-Alanine, citric acid, aniline, 4-aminophenol and other metabolites were different between the wild-type strain and Δpsntr-ANT206 under nitrobenzene and p-nitrophenol stress at different time periods under low temperature, respectively. These data could increase the knowledge of the construction of deletion mutant strains and biodegradation mechanism of NACs of typical strains Psychrobacter from Antarctica, which would also provide the basis of the molecular technique on the regulation of bioremediation of the contaminants under low temperature in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsychrobacter 3aalanine 3aaminophenols 3aaniline 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acitric acid 3aethylbenzene 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenes 3agenetic stability 3aheat 3akanamycin 3ametabolites 3amutants 3anitrobenzenes 3anitroreductases 3ap-nitrophenol 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aNitroreductase 0aDeletion mutant 0aPsychrobacter sp. 0aNitro-aromatic compounds 0aMetabolomics1 aHou, Yanhua1 aWang, Quanfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3885-54641 aWang, Yatong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7360-24220 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 July 05, v. 413 p.125377-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1253773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01591naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245005200172520071500224592002800939650001300967650002100980650002501001650001001026650001701036650001001053700002401063773012301087856008201210852000901292655001201301IND60791071020221117160256.0220826e20220723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079107102DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110808272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuente, José de la,14aThe Impact of RNA Interference in Tick Research  aOver the past two decades, RNA interference (RNAi) in ticks, in combination with omics technologies, have greatly advanced the discovery of tick gene and molecular function.

Subsequently, applications of RNAi have led to the discovery of genes that impact tick function and tick-host-pathogen interactions. RNAi will continue to lead to the discovery of an array of tick genes and molecules suitable for the development of vaccines and/or pharmacologic approaches for tick control and the prevention of pathogen transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aRNA interference 3adisease transmission 3agenes 3atick control 3aticks1 aKocan, Katherine M.0 tPathogens.g2022 July 23, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110808273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245014500164300001600309520178600325592002802111650002602139650001602165650001202181650002602193650001502219650001002234650001602244650002602260650001202286650001102298650001702309650001402326650001002340650001802350650002002368650002102388650001602409653002602425653001002451653002502461653002102486700001502507700001402522700001802536700001202554700001702566700005102583773016502634856008402799852000902883655001202892IND60736761020221122094245.0211219e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073676102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2021.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mao-Ye10aIdentification of six heat shock protein 70 genes in Lasioderma serricorne (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) and their responses to temperature stress  ap. 597-605.  aHeat shock proteins (HSPs) play essential roles in stress tolerance in insects, such as the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne, which is an important pest of stored products. However, the function of HSPs in environmental stress response in L. serricorne is poorly understood. In this study, six cDNAs encoding putative HSP70s were identified in L. serricorne (LsHSP70-1 to LsHSP70-6). The LsHSP70 proteins identified have signature motifs of insect HSP70s and exhibit high amino-acid identity with their respective orthologs from other insect species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these LsHSP70s fall into three major clans: HSP70 in the cytosol (four genes), endoplasmic reticulum (one gene), and mitochondria (one gene). LsHSP70 genes are differentially expressed in different developmental stages. LsHSP70-4 and LsHSP70-5 are mainly expressed at the larval stage, while LsHSP70-3 shows the highest level at the pupal stage. The other genes are ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, the expression levels of LsHSP70-1 and LsHSP70-4 are significantly upregulated upon exposure to temperatures of both 0 and 15 °C, while LsHSP70-3 is inducible at 15 °C and LsHSP70-6 at 0 °C. In addition, treatment at 0 °C causes significant downregulation of LsHSP70-2 and LsHSP70-3. Exposure to a temperature of 30 °C upregulates LsHSP70-1 expression, while 35 and 40 °C treatments result in significantly enhanced transcription of all the LsHSP70 genes. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on the sequence characteristics, phylogenetic relationships, and expression profiles of HSP70 genes in L. serricorne. The cold- and heat-inducible regulation of LsHSP70s suggests that these genes are related to tolerance of abnormal temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasioderma serricorne 3aamino acids 3acytosol 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aentomology 3agenes 3aheat stress 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny 3apupae 3astorage pests 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 0aLasioderma serricorne 0aHSP70 0aTemperature response 0aStress tolerance1 aHuang, Yan1 aLei, Xiao1 aXu, Chuan-Tao1 aLi, Bin1 aChen, De-Xin1 aLiu, Su1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5377-63690 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2021 Aug., v. 24, no. 3 p.597-605dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2021.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03839naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013800173300001600311520230600327592002802633650001202661650001302673650001102686650001202697650001302709650001602722650001102738650001402749650001102763650001402774650000702788650001102795650000902806650001902815650002002834650001302854650001102867650001802878650001802896650001502914651002202929653001202951653001102963653001202974653001602986653000803002653002203010700001803032700002303050773010503073856008603178852000903264655001203273IND60563374420221119123805.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056337442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDogramaci, Shawan10aHydrochemical and stable isotope indicators of pyrite oxidation in carbonate-rich environment; the Hamersley Basin, Western Australia  ap. 288-298.  aSulphur (S) is a commonly occurring element in most aquifers, primarily in oxidised (sulphates) and reduced (sulphides) forms. Sulphides often constitute a risk to groundwater quality due to acid rock drainage, especially in catchments that are subject to mining excavations or groundwater injection. However, in semi-arid regions detection of the acid rock drainage risk can be challenging and traditional methods based on observations of increasing SO4 concentrations or SO4/Cl ratios in surface and groundwater, are not necessarily applicable. In addition, decreasing pH, usually accompanying pyrite oxidation, can be masked by the high pH-neutralisation capacity of carbonate and silicate minerals.Analysis of 73 surface and groundwater samples from different water bodies and aquifers located in the Hamersley Basin, Western Australia found that most of the samples are characterised by neutral pH but there was also a large spatial variability in the dissolved sulphate (SO4) concentrations that ranged from 1mg/L to 15,000mg/L. Not surprisingly, groundwater in aquifers that contained pyrite had high sulphate concentrations (>1000mg/L). This was associated with low δ34SSO4 values (+1.2‰ to +4.6‰) and was consistent with the values obtained from aquifer matrix pyritic rock samples (−1.9‰ to +4.4‰). It was also found that the SO4 concentrations and acidity levels were not only dependent on δ34SSO4 values and existence of pyrite but also on the presence of carbonate minerals in the aquifer matrix. The groundwater in aquifers containing both pyrite and carbonate minerals had a neutral pH and was also saturated with respect to gypsum and had high magnesium concentrations of up to 2200mg/L suggesting de-dolomitisation as the process buffering the acidity generated by pyrite oxidation.Based on the findings from this study, a classification scheme has been developed for identification of the acid rock drainage contribution to groundwater that encompasses a myriad of geochemical processes that occur in aqueous systems. The classification uses five proxies (SO4, SO4/Cl, SI of calcite, δ34SSO4 and δ18OSO4) to improve assessment of the oxidation of sulphide potential contribution to overall sulphate ion concentrations regardless of acidity levels of the aqueous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aaquifers 3abasins 3acalcite 3adrainage 3agroundwater 3agypsum 3amagnesium 3amining 3aoxidation 3apH 3apyrite 3arisk 3asemiarid zones 3astable isotopes 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aWestern Australia 0aSulphur 0aOxygen 0aIsotope 0aGroundwater 0aARD 0aWestern Australia1 aMcLean, Laura1 aSkrzypek, Grzegorz0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Feb., v. 545 p.288-298dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001900163245010100182300001600283500001900299500000900318520128600327592002801613650002301641650001601664650002301680650001101703650002201714650001101736650001401747650001101761650001301772650001401785650001401799650001301813650001801826650002101844650001701865650001001882700001801892773012101910856009802031852000902129655001202138IND60665234920221118145654.0191122e197907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066523492DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1979.0011183X011200190027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiland, R.

Chemiluminescent detection of chemically bound N, with O₂ present as a reactant-carrier gas, and then absent and replaced with N₂ during the pyrolysis of transpiration samples, distinguished the oxidized from the reduced N forms in the transpirate. The majority of the N in several crop and weed species was in the reduced state; however, at least 5% of the N in all species tested was in an oxidized form. The percent of loss of oxidized N was fairly constant in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), ‘Forrest’ beans [Glycine max (L) Merr.], and palmer amaranth [Amaranthus palmeri (S.) Wats.] over the solar day. Older soybean leaf tissue lost a higher percentage of oxidized forms than did younger tissue. Both younger and older soybean tissue evolved greater total amounts of N than foliage in the middle of the plant canopy; yet the rate of transpiration was maximal in the middle foliage. Water-stressed soybeans evolved greater quantities of oxidized N forms than did irrigated soybeans. The N loss increased in ‘Davis’ soybeans and transpiration decreased in the cultivar ‘Forrest’ as a result of water stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus palmeri 3aGlycine max 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acanopy 3achemiluminescence 3acotton 3acultivars 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apyrolysis 3asoybeans 3atranspiration 3awater solubility 3awater stress 3aweeds1 aStutte, C.

Consequently, investigations of thermoregulation in firefighters should not only consider climate and exercise intensity, but technical properties of textiles too. Therefore, laboratory textile performance simulations may provide additional insights into textile-dependent thermoregulatory responses to exercise. In order to investigate the thermo-physiological relevance of textile properties and to test how different garments affect thermoregulation at different exercise intensities, we analyzed the results of a standard laboratory test and human subject trials by relating functional properties of textiles to thermo-physiological responses. Ten professional, healthy, male firefighters (age: 43 ± 6 y, weight: 84.3 ± 10.3kg, height: 1.79 ± 0.05m) performed low and moderate intensity exercise wearing garments previously evaluated with a sweating torso system to characterize thermal and evaporative properties. Functional properties of PPC and the control garment differed markedly. Consequently, skin temperature was higher using PPC at both exercise intensities (low: 36.27 ± 0.32 versus 36.75 ± 0.15℃, P < 0.05; moderate: 36.53 ± 0.34 versus 37.18 ± 0.23℃, P < 0.001), while core body temperature was only higher for PPC at moderate (37.54 ± 0.24 versus 37.83 ± 0.27℃, P < 0.05), but not low-intensity exercise (37.26 ± 0.21 versus 37.21 ± 0.19, P = 0.685). Differences in thermal and evaporative properties between textiles are reflected in thermo-physiological responses during human subject trials. However, an appropriate exercise intensity has to be chosen in order to challenge textile performance during exercise tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody temperature 3aclimate 3aenvironmental factors 3aexercise 3aexercise test 3afabrics 3afire fighters 3afire fighting 3afunctional properties 3ahumans 3alaboratory experimentation 3amales 3ametabolism 3aprotective clothing 3askin temperature 3asweating 3atextile fibers 3athermoregulation 3atorso 0acore body temperature 0aexercise intensity 0aprotective clothing 0ahot exposure 0atextile properties1 aSaiani, Fabio1 aGrütter, Marc1 aCroset, Jean-Philippe1 aCapt, André1 aCamenzind, Martin1 aMorrissey, Matthew1 aRossi, René M1 aAnnaheim, Simon0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 12 p.1425-1434dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166541053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245013500185300001600320520157600336592002801912650002201940650000801962650002001970650001701990650001502007650001902022650002002041650001002061650001802071650001002089650002402099650001302123650001302136650005702149650003202206650003502238650003702273650002202310650001802332650002802350650002402378650002702402650003402429650003902463700002302502773008602525856004802611852000902659655001202668IND50066757320221119095454.0130530e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006675732DNAL7 a233152352pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-013-0876-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmene, Kenichi10aComplete nucleotide sequence of Bacillus subtilis (natto) bacteriophage PM1, a phage associated with disruption of food production  ap. 524-534.  a“Natto”, considered a traditional food, is made by fermenting boiled soybeans with Bacillus subtilis (natto), which is a natto-producing strain related to B. subtilis. The production of natto is disrupted by phage infections of B. subtilis (natto); hence, it is necessary to control phage infections. PM1, a phage of B. subtilis (natto), was isolated during interrupted natto production in a factory. In a previous study, PM1 was classified morphologically into the family Siphoviridae, and its genome, comprising approximately 50 kbp of linear double-stranded DNA, was assumed to be circularly permuted. In the present study, the complete nucleotide sequence of the PM1 genomic DNA of 50,861 bp (41.3 %G+C) was determined, and 86 open reading frames (ORFs) were deduced. Forty-one ORFs of PM1 shared similarities with proteins deduced from the genome of phages reported so far. Twenty-three ORFs of PM1 were associated with functions related to the phage multiplication process of gene control, DNA replication/modification, DNA packaging, morphogenesis, and cell lysis. Bacillus subtilis (natto) produces a capsular polypeptide of glutamate with a γ-linkage (called poly-γ-glutamate), which appears to serve as a physical barrier to phage adsorption. One ORF of PM1 had similarity with a poly-γ-glutamate hydrolase, which is assumed to degrade the capsular barrier to allow phage progenies to infect encapsulated host cells. The genome analysis of PM1 revealed the characteristics of the phage that are consistent as Bacillus subtilis (natto)-infecting phage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aSiphoviridae 3aadsorption 3abacteriophages 3afood production 3agenes 3amorphogenesis 3anatto 3aopen reading frames 3aproteins 3asoybeans 2aBacillus Phagesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBacillus subtilisxvirology 2aBacterial Capsulesxmetabolism 2aDNA, Viralxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFood Microbiology 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2agamma-Glutamyl Hydrolasexgenetics1 aShiraishi, Atsushi0 tVirus genes.g2013 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.524-534dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-013-0876-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009700170300001600267520179200283592002802075650002202103650001002125650002102135650001402156650002302170650002202193650001702215650001302232650002002245650001002265650001902275650001602294650001202310653002202322653001802344653002002362653001602382700001802398700001502416773012402431856009002555852000902645655001202654IND60532527920221120144816.0190403e20140630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053252792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraser, L.10aPost-thaw sperm characteristics following long-term storage of boar semen in liquid nitrogen  ap. 119-127.  aThis study investigated the effect of long-term liquid nitrogen storage of semen from individual boars on post-thaw sperm characteristics. Ejaculates, collected from five Polish large white (PLW) and five Polish landrace (PLR) boars, were frozen using a standard cryopreservation protocol. Post-thaw analysis was performed within a week (Period 1) and 42–48 months (Period 2) of semen storage in liquid nitrogen. Post-thaw sperm assessments included total motility, mitochondrial function (JC-1/PI assay), plasma membrane integrity (SYBR-14/PI assay), osmotic resistance test (ORT), lipid peroxidation (LPO) status and DNA fragmentation, analysed by the neutral Comet assay. Individual boar variability within breed and cryostorage periods had significant effects on the analysed parameters of frozen-thawed spermatozoa. Prolonged semen storage in liquid nitrogen (Period 2) induced a marked reduction in post-thaw sperm motility, mitochondrial function and plasma membrane integrity in most of the boars. Post-thaw semen of eight boars exhibited a marked decrease in osmotic resistance of the sperm acrosomal membrane, whereas a significant increase in the sperm cryo-susceptibility to induced LPO and DNA fragmentation was observed only in three boars after long-term semen storage. Additionally, frozen-thawed spermatozoa of PLR boars exhibited significantly lower osmotic resistance of the acrosomal membrane than PLW boars following prolonged semen storage in liquid nitrogen. The results of this study provide evidence of ageing processes in frozen-thawed boar spermatozoa following prolonged cryostorage. It seems that, even though cryopreservation allows long-term semen storage in liquid nitrogen, spermatozoa from individual boars are more susceptible to cryo-induced damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aboars 3acryopreservation 3alandraces 3alipid peroxidation 3along term effects 3amitochondria 3anitrogen 3aplasma membrane 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3astorage 0aBoar, Spermatozoa 0aSemen storage 0aLiquid nitrogen 0aCryostorage1 aStrzeżek, J.1 aKordan, W.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2014 June 30, v. 147, no. 3-4 p.119-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015200169520192900321592002802250650002602278650001802304650002602322650001402348650001202362650001402374650001602388650002902404650001802433650002502451650001402476650002102490650001402511651001502525700002202540700002302562700002402585700002902609700003002638773012302668856008202791852000902873655001202882IND60791071120221117160332.0220826e20220809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079107112DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110808902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSultana, Sharmin 10aPrevalence of Methicillin and β−Lactamase Resistant Pathogens Associated with Oral and Periodontal Disease of Children in Mymensingh, Bangladesh  aOral and periodontal diseases (OPD) is considered one of the main problems of dentistry worldwide. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of oral and periodontal pathogenic bacteria along with their antimicrobial resistance pattern in 131 children patients aged between 4–10 years who attended in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital during October 2019 to March 2020. OPD pathogens were identified through isolation, cultural and biochemical properties, and nucleic acid detection. The isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility to 12 antibiotics commonly used in dentistry. In addition, the isolates were analyzed molecularly for the presence of six virulence and three antibacterial resistance genes. Five pathogens were identified, of which Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (49%) and S. salivarius (46%) were noticed frequently; other bacteria included S. mutans (16.8%), S. sobrinus (0.8%) and L. fermentum (13.7%). The virulence genes—clumping factor A (clfA) was detected in 62.5% isolates of S. aureus, and gelatinase enzyme E (gelE) gene was detected in 5% isolates of S. salivarius, while other virulence genes were not detected. All the tested isolates were multidrug-resistant. The overall prevalence of MDR S. aureus, Streptococcus spp. and L. fermentum was 92.2%, 95.1% and 100%, respectively. It was observed that a high proportion of isolates were found resistant to 5–8 antibiotics. A majority of S. aureus, Streptococcus spp., and L. fermentum isolates tested positive for the β−lactamase resistance genes blaTEM and cfxA, as well as the methicillin resistance gene mecA. Phylogenetically, the resistance genes showed variable genetic character among Bangladeshi bacterial pathogens. In conclusion, S. aureus and S. salivarius were major OPD pathogens in patients attended in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital of Bangladesh, and most were Beta-lactam and methicillin resistant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus 3aantibiotic resistance 3adentistry 3aenzymes 3ahospitals 3amethicillin 3amultiple drug resistance 3anucleic acids 3aperiodontal diseases 3aphylogeny 3aresistance genes 3avirulence 3aBangladesh1 aParvin, Rokshana 1 aParvin, Mst.

However, the widespread applicability of this process depends on the optimization of operational factors impacting PHA productivity. This study addresses the impact of biomass withdrawal strategy on the performance of MMC selection reactors and consequently on biomass productivity and global PHA productivity. Two selection reactors were operated in parallel under similar conditions, except for the timing of biomass withdrawal, at the end of the famine phase (Reactor 1, R1) versus at the end of the feast phase (Reactor 2, R2) at an organic loading rate of 100 Cmmol.L⁻¹.d⁻¹ and solids retention time of 4 days. The biomass selected in both conditions had similar PHA storing capacity as shown by the similar yields of PHA per substrate obtained in the accumulation assays; however, R1 reached a higher biomass productivity (about 4-fold higher than R2). This study demonstrated that removing the excess biomass at the end of the famine phase resulted in a much higher global PHA productivity and that the key parameter affecting the global PHA productivity of the 2-stage system was the volumetric biomass productivity. Results obtained provide important insight into how MMC systems can be best operated to maximize PHA productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3abiotechnology 3afamine 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3aprices 0aDO 0aF/F 0aF/M 0afPHA 0a3HB 0aHRT 0a3HV 0ak 0aMMC 0aOLR 0aP(3HB-co-3HV) 0aProdPHA 0aProdX 0aqPHA 0a-qS 0aSBR 0aSRT 0aTSS 0aVFA 0aVSS 0aXA 0aXf 0aXi 0aYPHA/S 0aYX/PHA 0aΔX 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) 0aMixed microbial cultures (MMC) 0aBiomass withdrawal 0aProcess optimization 0aSequencing batch reactors (SBR) 0aBioplastics1 aOehmen, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9981-09831 aReis, Maria A.M.0 tNew biotechnology.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 66 p.8-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2021.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245012000196300001800316506007600334520073500410592002801145506003701173650001901210650001601229650002201245650001701267650002201284650001101306650004401317650001501361650002201376700002601398700001301424700002701437700002201464773010401486856007501590852000901665655001201674IND60531634720221207071638.0160724e20140909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053163472DNAL7 a10.1021/bi500420y2doi7 aPMC41592022pmcid7 a251388162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying10aStructural Analysis of Diheme Cytochrome c by Hydrogen–Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry and Homology Modeling  ap. 5619-5630.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA lack of X-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance structures of proteins inhibits their further study and characterization, motivating the development of new ways of analyzing structural information without crystal structures.

We collected diverse biophysical data to allow spatial variability of soil organic carbon and factors contributing to this variation to be determined statistically, and used well established simulation models to interpret the data, predict long-term carbon dynamics and determine the potential for improvements in soil quality and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The spatial variation in soil organic carbon in the 0–20cm soil depth was significant across study areas (P<0.01, 21.6gkg−1–37.8gkg−1), and between land-uses (P<0.05, 27.9gkg−1 in cropland and 43.0gkg−1 soil in forestland). In a multiple linear regression model, among the 11 explanatory variables used, four (total nitrogen, shrubs, trees and land use) showed a significant positive effect (P<0.01), while three (impact of grazing, impact of erosion and clay) showed a significant negative effect (P<0.01). Simulations using the assumption of steady state to estimate carbon dynamics suggested that plant inputs from croplands are generally lower than grass or shrublands, resulting in build-up of recalcitrant organic matter in shrublands compared to grass or croplands. Erosion results in a decline in both the absolute and relative amounts of carbon in recalcitrant pools, but the more active pools remained unchanged, meaning that the overall activity of soil organic matter is increased when the soil is eroded, and it becomes more difficult to sequester soil carbon. More rapid decrease in soil organic carbon is likely to be due to increased erosion, persistent removal of organic materials, grazing pressures, and higher rate of decompositions in cropland and grazing land-uses. Conversion to shrubland shows high potential to quickly restore eroded soils and build up a pool of recalcitrant soil carbon, suggesting that management of land using periodic 20 year exclosures, preventing cropping and grazing and allowing shrubland succession, could be beneficial in restoring degraded soils. Simulations using a calibration approach, rather than assuming steady state, corroborated these findings, suggesting that after 30 years of current management, croplands will deplete soil organic carbon by 5.6, 7.1 and 7.2tha−1, and grasslands by 3.5, 3.9 and 2.7tha−1, while shrublands will build-up soil organic carbon by 0.6, 0.1 and 1.3tha−1 at study sites. At one study site, forests, will further increase soil organic carbon by 6.7tha−1 after 30 years. The significant positive impact of shrubs and trees on soil organic carbon suggests the need to focus on introduction of agroforestry systems in crop and grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3aagroforestry 3asoil degradation 3aclay 3asoil depth 3atrees 3aland use 3agrasslands 3aforests 3alinear models 3anitrogen content 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aeroded soils 3asoil heterogeneity 3atemporal variation 3abasins 3agrasses 3ashrublands 3asimulation models 3asoil quality 3ahighlands 3aadverse effects 3ashrubs 3acropland 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3agrazing intensity 0aorganic matter 0acarbon 0aSpatial and temporal dynamics of soil organic carbon stocks 0aSoil organic carbon depletion 0aSoil organic carbon stock 0aSimulated soil organic carbon1 aWinowiecki, Leigh A.1 aVagen, Tor-Gunnar,1 aLangan, Simon1 aSmith, Jo U.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 218 p.190-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245006400199300001800263506007600281520183200357592002802189506003702217650001302254650001802267650002202285650002002307650001502327650001302342650002002355650001202375650001202387650001102399650004402410650001402454650001402468650001902482700002402501700002502525773010402550856007502654852000902729655001202738IND60531634820221207064542.0160724e20140909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053163482DNAL7 a10.1021/bi50050142doi7 aPMC41592042pmcid7 a251217802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPederson, Kari10aStructural Characterization of the DC-SIGN–LewisX Complex  ap. 5700-5709.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is a C-type lectin highly expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. DC-SIGN mediates interactions among dendritic cells, pathogens, and a variety of epithelia, myeloid cells, and endothelia by binding to high mannose residues on pathogenic invaders or fucosylated residues on the membranes of other immune cells. Although these interactions are normally beneficial, they can also contribute to disease. The structural characterization of binding geometries is therefore of interest as a basis for the construction of mimetics that can mediate the effects of abnormal immune response. Here, we report the structural characteristics of the interaction of the DC-SIGN carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) with a common fucosylated entity, the LewisX trisaccharide (LeX), using NMR methods. Titration of the monomeric DC-SIGN CRD with LeX monitored by 2D NMR revealed significant perturbations of DC-SIGN cross-peak positions in ¹H–¹⁵N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra and identified residues near the binding site. Additionally, saturation transfer difference (STD) and transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (trNOE) NMR experiments, using a tetrameric form of DC-SIGN, identified binding epitopes and bound conformations of the LeX ligand. The restraints derived from these multiple experiments were used to generate models for the binding of LeX to the DC-SIGN CRD. Ranking of the models based on the fit of model-based simulations of the trNOE data and STD buildup curves suggested conformations distinct from those seen in previous crystal structures. The new conformations offer insight into how differences between binding of LewisX and mannose-terminated saccharides may be propagated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3abinding sites 3acrystal structure 3adendritic cells 3aepithelium 3aepitopes 3aimmune response 3alectins 3amannose 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathogens 3atitration 3atrisaccharides1 aMitchell, Daniel

Keeping moderate WLFs approximating to its natural conditions is substantially essential to maintain its biodiversity and integrity. In this study, a hydrological index based method for determining ecologically acceptable water-level range (EAWLR) was illustrated by a case-study of Dongting Lake. This method was proposed based on a consideration of hydrological alterations induced by natural variability and human activity. It was during this process that two hydrological indices, the ratio flow deviation (RFD) and the amended annual proportional flow deviation (AAPFD), played vital roles in change point detection and the determination of EAWLR, respectively. The WLFs are closely related to species richness. The relationship between them follows a hump-backed curve and EAWLR serves as the hump part of the curve. The final results indicated that EAWLRs of Beijinggang, Nanzui and Chenglingji during flood season were 27.78-38.26 m, 25.19-38.45 m and 24.48-30.96 m, respectively, while those during non-flood season were 18.33-27.79 m, 17.68-29.19 m and 15.59-22.07 m, respectively. The response to the great flood in 1998 and the drought in 2006 of Dongting Lake region verified the rationality of the results. Within the EAWLR, ecosystems can operate normally and have stable community structures to resist external interference.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acommunity structure 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3alakes 3aspecies diversity 3asurface water level 0aWater-level fluctuations 0aecologically acceptable water-level range 0aratio flow deviation 0aamended annual proportional flow deviation 0ahydrological alteration1 aYu, Xun,1 aZENG, Guangming1 aWU, Haipeng1 aLAI, Xu1 aLi, Xiaodong,1 aHUANG, Lu1 aYUAN, Yujie1 aGUO, Shenglian1 aDAI, Juan0 tJournal of limnology.g2014 Aug. 04, v. 74, no. 1dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx1723-86337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.9143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012400155300002000279500001500299520103100314592002801345650002201373650001801395650001601413650001901429650002401448650001901472650001901491650001701510650001101527650003101538650001901569650001301588653001801601700001801619700001901637700001301656773012401669856007401793852000901867655001201876IND60640861520221123003118.0190505e20160711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064086152DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11104a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aElectrostatic fabrication of RGO-g-SSS/CdTe graphene/quantum dot nanocomposites with enhanced optoelectronic properties  ap. 65443-65449.  a2019-12-06  aWe report a simple and facile strategy for fabricating RGO-g-SSS/CdTe graphene/quantum dot nanocomposites via electrostatic interactions at room temperature.

The effects of LAB range from regulation to stimulation of the immune system. A series of studies were performed in vitro to study the effects of six lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus helveticus LH-2, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, La-115, La-116 and La-14, and Lactobacillus salivarius, on maturation and activation of mouse dendritic cells. Production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-?, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 by dendritic cells (DCs) was determined after treating cells with live LAB. The expression of DC maturation markers, CD80 and CD40, was also measured using flow cytometry after stimulation with LAB. In addition, the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4 and 9 by DCs stimulated with LAB was measured. Our results revealed that LAB act differentially on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production and induction of co-stimulatory molecules by DCs. Specifically, L. salivarius was found to be the most effective LAB to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Moreover, La-14, La-116 and La-5 induced moderate maturation and activation of DCs. On the other hand, LH-2 and La-115 were the least effective lactobacilli to induce DC responses. The present study also revealed that L. salivarius was able to induce the expression of TLR2, 4 and 9 by DCs. In conclusion, various strains and species of LAB can differentially regulate DC activation and maturation, providing further evidence that these bacteria may have the ability to influence and steer immune responses in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 0adendritic cells 0aimmune modulation 0aimmune system 0alactic acid bacteria 0aLactobacillus1 aBrisbin, J.T.1 aMallard, B.A.1 aGriffiths, M.W.1 aCorredig, M.1 aSharīf,0 tBeneficial microbes.g2014 Sept. 1, v. 5, no. 3 p.323-334dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2013.00663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011200166300002000278520103900298592002801337650001301365650001601378650002101394650001501415650001701430650001101447650001701458650001301475650002401488650001701512700001601529700002101545700001501566700001701581700001901598700001301617700001701630700002501647773012401672856007401796852000901870655001201879IND60640861620221123003204.0190505e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064086162DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11106h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhattak, Abdul Muqsit10aThree dimensional iron oxide/graphene aerogel hybrids as all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor electrodes  ap. 58994-59000.  aThree dimensional (3D) iron oxide (Fe₂O₃)/graphene aerogel (GA) hybrid (Fe₂O₃/GA) was synthesized by a novel in situ hydrothermal method. Due to the high surface area and sponge structure of GA, which facilitate the access of electrolyte to the internal surface of the graphene film, this 3D Fe₂O₃/GA composite consequently lead to a robust and superior hybrid material with higher capacitance and better rate performance compared to that of the stacked Fe₂O₃/graphene (Fe₂O₃/G) hybrid when used as electrode materials in supercapacitors (SCs). Furthermore, a highly flexible all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated by two pieces of our Fe₂O₃/GA hybrid electrode. The device is suitable for different bending angles and delivers a high specific capacitance of 440 F g⁻¹. 90% capacitance was retained over 2200 cycles, indicating good cycling stability. These excellent electrochemical performances suggest that Fe₂O₃/GA composites have an enormous potential in energy application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aferric oxide 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3asurface area1 aYin, Huajie1 aGhazi, Zahid Ali1 aLiang, Bin1 aIqbal, Azhar1 aKhan, Niaz Ali1 aGao, Yan1 aLi, Lianshan1 aTang, Z.q(Zhiyong),0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 21, v. 6, no. 64 p.58994-59000dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11106h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245022100165300001400386520113200400592002801532650001501560650001601575650002001591650002101611650001501632650001301647650001101660650001401671650000701685650001501692650001301707700001901720773010101739856008201840852000901922655001201931IND60091537020221121220137.0141103e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009153702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.09.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzcan, Ali,12aA novel approach for the selective determination of tryptophan in blood serum in the presence of tyrosine based on the electrochemical reduction of oxidation product of tryptophan formed in situ on graphite electrode  ap. 26-31.  aIn this study, a novel method was proposed for the selective determination of tryptophan (TRP) in blood serum in the presence of tyrosine. This method is based on the electrochemical reduction of 2-amino-3-(5-oxo-3,5-dihydro-2H-indol-3-yl)-propionic acid (5-O-3,5DH-TRP) formed by the oxidation of TRP on the electrochemically treated pencil graphite (ETPG) electrode surface at a suitable potential value. The parameters affecting the TRP determination were deeply investigated. The optimal pH value was determined as 3. The highest reduction current intensity was obtained at the accumulation potential and time values of +0.95V and 120s, respectively. The reduction peak current values of 5-O-3,5DH-TRP versus TRP concentration at the ETPG electrode showed linearity in the range from 0.5μM to 50.0μM (R²=0.9962) with a detection limit of 0.05μM (S/N=3). The reduction peak intensity of 5-O-3,5DH-TRP on the ETPG electrode showed no significant change in the presence of different interfering substances. The analytical application of the proposed novel method was successfully tested by using human blood serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ahumans 3aoxidation 3apH 3atryptophan 3atyrosine1 aŞahin, Yücel0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 31, no. 1 p.26-31dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.09.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245011900164300001800283520146500301592002801766650001701794650001301811650001001824650001501834650002301849650001001872650001901882650001701901650001201918650001401930650001401944650001901958650001501977650001101992650001202003650001302015651001302028700002202041700002302063700002202086700002602108700002702134700002302161773012002184856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60129779220221120055153.0151126e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012977922DNAL7 a10.1645/13-296.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPineda-Catalan, Oscar10aRevision of Hemoproteid Genera and Description and Redescription of Two Species of Chelonian Hemoproteid Parasites  ap. 1089-1098.  aPigmented hemosporidian parasites that do not exhibit erthyrocytic schizogony, and infect birds, chelonians, and squamates, have been classified in various genera over time. These classifications have reflected vertebrate hosts, insect vectors, and variations in morphology and life history observed in representative species. Side-necked turtles (Podocnemis spp.) from the Peruvian Amazon were screened for hemoparasites and 2 species of hemosporid parasites infecting these hosts were observed. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of these new isolates, along with parasites from lizards, a snake, and a variety of Haemoproteus species from birds from both the Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus subgenera, strongly support the separation of the non-avian parasites into a separate genus. The name with precedent for this group is Haemocystidium Castellani and Willey 1909, and we propose that subgeneric classification of Haemocystidium and Simondia be applied to parasites of squamates and chelonians, respectively. We offer a description of Haemocystidium (Simondia) pacayae n. sp. and a redescription of Haemocystidium (Simondia) peltocephali (Lainson and Naiff 1998, n. comb.) Morphologically, the parasites are quite similar, with H. pacayae slightly more elongated than H. peltocephali. The discovery and identification of parasite species is urgent, especially in endangered species and wildlife inhabiting rapidly declining ecosystems such as the Amazon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemoproteus 3aSquamata 3abirds 3aecosystems 3aendangered species 3ahosts 3ainsect vectors 3alife history 3alizards 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aredescriptions 3aschizogony 3asnakes 3aturtles 3awildlife 3aAmazonia1 aPerkins, Susan L.1 aPeirce, Michael A.1 aEngstrand, Rachel1 aGarcia-Davila, Carmen1 aPinedo-Vasquez, Miguel1 aAguirre, A.

Anthocyanin (ACN) pharmacokinetic studies often sample plasma and urine within hours of ingestion; these approaches do not reveal enterohepatic metabolites that may be critical for pharmacodynamic bioactivity. This study investigated ACN pharmacokinetics in healthy humans following intake of Montmorency tart cherries (Prunus cerasus). Using a within-subject crossover design, subjects (n = 12) ingested whole frozen tart cherries (45 or 90 cherries), and blood and urine samples were collected over 12 hours. LC-MS/MS identified two unmodified ACN in plasma and two ACN metabolites in urine. Intake of 45 cherries caused a biphasic antioxidant response, while 90 cherries caused a prolonged elevation over the 12 h period. The broad antioxidant peak beyond 8 h suggests that enterohepatic metabolites contribute to antioxidant pharmacodynamics. These findings should encourage extended pharmacokinetic studies with ACN-rich foods to reveal their breadth of bioavailability and bioactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus cerasus 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3ablood 3acherries 3across-over studies 3adose response 3afoods 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aingestion 3ametabolites 3aoxidative stress 3apharmacokinetics 3aurine 0aTart cherry 0aAnthocyanins 0aPharmacokinetics 0aAntioxidant1 aWarber, Sara M.1 aKirakosyan, Ara1 aNoon, Kathleen R.1 aGillespie, Brenda1 aUhley, Virginia E.1 aWunder, Jenna1 aUrcuyo, Daniel E.1 aKaufman, Peter B.1 aBolling, Steven F.0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Nov., v. 11 p.509-516dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2014.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169300001600273520147300289592002801762650001501790650001201805650002501817650001201842650001001854650002001864650001901884650001001903650001401913650000901927650001101936650002601947650002301973650001801996653001202014653002302026653002002049653002202069653002202091700002502113700001602138700001902154700001802173700002002191773009502211856008502306852000902391655001202400IND60558603320221122222729.0180831e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055860332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2016.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, Florian10aThermal co-treatment of combustible hazardous waste and waste incineration fly ash in a rotary kiln  ap. 181-190.  aAs current disposal practices for municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash are either associated with significant costs or negative environmental impacts, an alternative treatment was investigated in a field scale experiment. Thereto, two rotary kilns were fed with hazardous waste, and moistened MSWI fly ash (water content of 23%) was added to the fuel of one kiln with a ratio of 169kg/Mg hazardous waste for 54h and 300kg/Mg hazardous waste for 48h while the other kiln was used as a reference. It was shown that the vast majority (>90%) of the inserted MSWI fly ash was transferred to the bottom ash of the rotary kiln. This bottom ash complied with the legal limits for non-hazardous waste landfills, thereby demonstrating the potential of the investigated method to transfer hazardous waste (MSWI fly ash) into non-hazardous waste (bottom ash). The results of a simple mixing test (MSWI fly ash and rotary kiln bottom ash have been mixed accordingly without thermal treatment) revealed that the observed transformation of hazardous MSWI fly ash into non-hazardous bottom ash during thermal co-treatment cannot be referred to dilution, as the mixture did not comply with legal limits for non-hazardous waste landfills. For the newly generated fly ash of the kiln, an increase in the concentration of Cd, K and Pb by 54%, 57% and 22%, respectively, was observed. In general, the operation of the rotary kiln was not impaired by the MSWI fly ash addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottom ash 3acadmium 3aenvironmental impact 3afly ash 3afuels 3ahazardous waste 3aheat treatment 3akilns 3alandfills 3alead 3amixing 3amunicipal solid waste 3awaste incineration 3awater content 0aFly ash 0aWaste incineration 0aHazardous waste 0aThermal treatment 0aFly ash treatment1 aBlasenbauer, Dominik1 aMallow, Ole1 aLederer, Jakob1 aWinter, Franz1 aFellner, Johann0 tWaste management.g2016 Dec., v. 58 p.181-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2016.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100001800163245013700181300001800318500001500336520147400351592002801825650001601853650002001869650002001889650001101909650002401920650002101944650003701965650002202002650000702024650003202031650001902063650002302082653002002105700002102125700001702146700002202163773010102185856007802286852000902364655001202373IND60080707420221118054705.0140804e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008070742DNAL7 a232257202pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2012005502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnıl, Ismail10aOptimization of solid‐phase microextraction using Taguchi design to quantify trace level polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water  ap. 3561-3568.  a2019-12-06  aThis article introduces a simple, rapid, and reliable solid‐phase microextraction (SPME) method coupled with GC‐MS for the quantitative determination of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water. In this study, the Taguchi experimental design was used to optimize extraction conditions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using SPME method to obtain highly enriched analytes. Consequently, quantitative determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water was achieved by GC‐MS technique. The selected parameters affecting enrichment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were sample extraction time, stirring speed, temperature, ionic strength, and pH. The study revealed that optimal operating conditions were found to be 90‐min extraction time, 1400 rpm stirring speed, and 60°C sample temperature. The effect of ionic strength and pH were shown to be insignificant. Optimized conditions were also reevaluated by placing the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into several subgroups based on their molecular weight. The extraction efficiency of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with low molecular weight was shown to be a function of only the extracting temperature. Satisfactory results were obtained for linearity (0.983–0.999), detection limits (2.67–18.02 ng/L), accuracy (71.2–99.3%), and precision (4.3–13.5%). The optimum conditions reported by other design approaches were evaluated and generalized optimum conditions were suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3awater pollution 3adetection limit 3amixing 3aexperimental design 3amolecular weight 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3asolid phase microextraction 3aionic strength 3agas chromatography 0amicroextraction1 aÖztürk, Naciye1 aAlagha, Omar1 aErgenekon, Pınar0 tJournal of separation science.g2012 Dec., v. 35, no. 24 p.3561-3568dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2012005503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002600169245009800195300001800293500002000311520115400331592002801485650001101513650001401524650001401538650001501552650001101567650001101578650001501589650001301604650001201617650001901629650001401648650001301662650001101675650001301686700002301699700002601722700002601748700002401774773009801798856010701896852000902003655001202012IND60569939220221119071301.0170626e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056993922DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1772:SACAIL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagnusson, William E.10aSize and carbon acquisition in lizards from amazonian savanna: evidence from isotope analysis  ap. 1772-1780.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe studied the effects of lizard size, and availability of C₃ and C₄ plants, on stable carbon‐isotope (δ¹³C) ratios of lizards in an Amazonian savanna. Availability of C₃ and C₄ plants was estimated from 500‐point quadrats in each of 38 plots of 3.75 ha. Ratios of δ¹³C in muscle tissue were used to estimate the contributions of C₃‐ and C₄‐based food chains to the diets of four species of lizards: Cnemidophorus lemniscatus, Kentropyx striata, Ameiva ameiva, and Anolis auratus. The relative contributions of C₃ and C₄ plants to the diets of the lizards were affected by the extent of shrub cover in C. lemniscatus, A. auratus, and possibly in K. striata. However, there was a strong effect of lizard size among and within lizard species. These results are at variance with a previous evaluation of diet overlap among size classes of these species that was based on overlap in prey taxonomic categories. This indicates that species and/or size classes of predators on arthropods may obtain their energy from food chains based on different autotrophic sources, despite high overlap in the taxonomic categories of prey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnolis 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3aarthropods 3acarbon 3aenergy 3afood chain 3aisotopes 3alizards 3amuscle tissues 3apredators 3asavannas 3ashrubs 3avariance1 aLima, Albertina P.1 aFaria, Allessandra S.1 aVictoria, Reynaldo L.1 aMartinelli, Luiz A.0 tEcology.g2001 June, v. 82, no. 6 p.1772-1780dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B1772:SACAIL%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245003600169300001400205520099700219592002801216650001601244650001701260650002501277650001201302650001101314650002301325650001701348650001701365700002001382773012201402856007901524852000901603655001201612IND60300709720221120050522.0150703e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030070972DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12256012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivakaruni, Ajit S.12aA Mitochondrial Mystery, Solved  ap. 41-43.  aThe three-carbon molecule pyruvate is a metabolic intermediate and a central hub for cellular energy metabolism. It lies at the junction of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism and is the precursor for biosynthetic pathways including glucose, lipid, and amino acid syntheses. Given the ubiquitous role of pyruvate in cellular bioenergetics (see the figure), its subcellular localization plays a critical role in its fate. The final product of pyruvate metabolism is fundamentally altered once it enters the mitochondrion. As such, the identity of the protein that transports pyruvate from the cytoplasm into mitochondria has been eagerly anticipated, and the wait has been nearly 40 years. Two papers in this issue, by Bricker et al.

The mechanism of thermal transfer from compost to inner surface of structural layer, as a first step of heat loss, was important for improving insulation performance, which was divided into conduction and convection and discussed specifically in this study. It was found decreasing conductive resistance was responsible for the drop of insulation between compost and reactor wall. Increasing compost porosity or manufacturing a curved surface, decreasing the contact area of compost and the reactor wall, might improve the insulation performance. Upon modeling of heat transfers from compost to ambient environment, the study yielded a condensed and simplified model that could be used to conduct thermal resistance analysis for composting reactor. With theoretical derivations and a case application, the model was applicable for both dynamic estimation and typical composting scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal conductivity 3aheat tolerance 3acomposts 3aporosity 3amodels 3amanufacturing 3aconvection 3atemperature 3ainsulating materials 3acomposting 0aModeling 0aThermal resistance 0aReactor composting 0aHeat transfer 0aheat transfer1 aNiu, Wenjuan1 aAi, Ping0 tWaste management.g2016 Dec., v. 58 p.144-151dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2016.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245014200205300001600347520118300363592002801546650003401574650002201608650001401630650001801644650002201662650002501684650001901709650001801728650002801746650004301774650001301817650001701830650004301847650001401890650001301904653002301917653001601940653001601956653001301972653000901985700002301994700002602017700005902043773011202102856008202214852000902296655001202305IND60544109920221122065646.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054410992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZengin, Gokhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6548-782310aSideritis galatica Bornm.: A source of multifunctional agents for the management of oxidative damage, Alzheimer's's and diabetes mellitus  ap. 538-547.  aThe antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory potential of different solvent extracts (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol and water) from Sideritis galatica were evaluated.

Potato root system architecture (RSA) refers to its 3-dimensional structure as determined by adventitious root (AR) growth and branching through lateral roots (LR). Understanding how the root system develops holds potential to increase plant yield and optimize agricultural land use. Root system development was monitored in greenhouse-grown potato while a root-on-a-plate assay was developed to explore factors that affect AR and LR development. Expression study of LR-related genes was conducted. Transgenic plants carrying DR5:GFP and CycB1:GUS reporter genes were used to monitor auxin signaling and cell division during root primordia formation, respectively. Maximum root development occurred mainly during the 6-week post seed-tuber planting and slowed during the onset of tuberization. AR and LR development was coordinated − a positive correlation was found between the length of AR and LR and between LR length and number. The expression of LR-related genes was higher in LR than in AR. High nitrate levels reduced LR number and length, however ablation of root-cap by high temperature (33°C) or cutting resulted with enhanced formation of LR. Growth conditions affect AR and LR development in potato, determining the final architecture of its root system. The overall results indicate that LR formation in potato follows similar pattern as in model plants, facilitating study and manipulation of its RSA to improve soil exploitation and yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadventitious roots 3aagricultural land 3aauxins 3abranching 3acell division 3acutting 3aland use 3aminerals 3anitrates 3aplanting 3apotatoes 3areporter genes 3aroot cap 3aroot primordia 3aroot systems 3asoil 3atemperature 3atransgenic plants 0aAdventitious root 0aCycB1 0aDR5 0aLateral root 0aRoot-on-a-plate assay 0aSolanum tuberosum1 aFogelman, Edna1 aBelausov, Eduard1 aGinzberg, Idit0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2016 Oct. 20, v. 205 p.113-123dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245005100166300001600217520132500233592002801558650001301586650001101599650001101610650000901621650002601630650001201656650003101668650001401699650001801713650001601731650002501747650001801772653002401790653001401814653001801828653001201846653001301858700001501871700001301886700001801899700001701917700001701934700001501951773009501966856008502061852000902146655001202155IND60558603920221122222717.0180831e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055860392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2016.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Wenchao10aSupercritical water pyrolysis of sewage sludge  ap. 371-378.  aMunicipal sewage sludge (SS) from wastewater treatment plant containing high water content (>85wt.%), lead to the difficulty of co-combustion with MSW or coal due to the high cost of drying. This study explores an alternative method by supercritical water (SCW) pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) in a high pressure reaction vessel. The effects of temperature and moisture content of SS on yield and composition of the products (bio-oil, bio char and non-condensable gas) were studied. A temperature of 385°C and moisture content of 85wt.% were found to be the optimum conditions for the maximum bio-oil production of 37.23wt.%, with a higher heating value of 31.08MJ/kg. In the optimum condition, the yields of aliphatic hydrocarbon and phenols were about 29.23wt.% and 12.51wt.%, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of bio-char were analyzed by using XRF and BET. Results of GC analyses of NCG showed that it has the maximum HHV of 13.39MJ/m³ at 445°C and moisture content of 85wt.%. The reaction path from SS to bio-oil through SCW pyrolysis was given. Moreover, carbon balance was calculated for the optimal condition, and finding out that 64.27wt.% of the carbon content was transferred from SS to bio-oil. Finally, this work demonstrates that the SCW pyrolysis is a promising disposal method for SS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3adrying 3aheat 3amunicipal solid waste 3aphenols 3aphysicochemical properties 3apyrolysis 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 3awater content 0aSupercritical water 0aPyrolysis 0aSewage sludge 0aBio-oil 0aBio-char1 aDu, Guiyue1 aLi, Jian1 aFang, Yuanhao1 aHou, Li’an1 aChen, Guanyi1 aMa, Degang0 tWaste management.g2017 Jan., v. 59 p.371-378dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2016.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013600169300001600305520097600321592002801297650002701325650001801352650001701370650001801387650000901405650001201414650001801426650001401444650001001458650002401468650001401492700002001506700001801526700001901544700002201563700001901585700001701604700002201621773013401643856008301777852000901860655001201869IND60087172120221122193223.0141102e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008717212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2011.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaneda, Takeshi10aEvaluation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Choleraesuis slyA mutant strains for use in live attenuated oral vaccines  ap. 399-409.  aSlyA protein plays a key role in virulence in Salmonella enterica. In this study, we evaluated the ability of the slyA mutant strain of S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. choleraesuis) to protect against swine salmonellosis. Using a murine model infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), we showed that the Salmonella strain with a deletion of slyA could be used as a highly immunogenic, effective and safe vaccine in mice. Based on these data, a slyA mutant of S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis strain RF-1 was constructed, and the ability of this mutant to protect immunized pigs from S. choleraesuis infection was examined. As with the S. typhimurium slyA mutant, immunization of pigs with the S. choleraesuis slyA mutant strain provided significant protection against subsequent challenge by the wild-type RF-1. These results demonstrate that SlyA is a potential target in the development of a novel live attenuated vaccine against S. enterica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aanimal models 3aimmunization 3alive vaccines 3amice 3amutants 3asalmonellosis 3aserotypes 3aswine 3avaccine development 3avirulence1 aOkada, Nobuhiko1 aKikuchi, Yuji1 aTakagi, Masami1 aKurotaki, Tetsuro1 aMiki, Tsuyoshi1 aArai, Setsuo1 aDanbara, Hirofumi0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2011 Sept., v. 34, no. 5 p.399-409dElsevier Ltdx0147-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03793naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245009500188300001800283500002000301520238100321592002802702650002302730650002402753650002302777650001802800650001302818650001302831650001502844650001002859650001102869650001302880650001402893650001802907650001002925650002102935650001102956700002202967700002202989700002503011700002103036700002303057700001703080773009803097856010703195852000903302655001203311IND60569939620221119071413.0170626e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056993962DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1655:SVITDB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNolet, Bart A.10aSpatial variation in tuber depletion by swans explained by differences in net intake rates  ap. 1655-1667.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe tested whether the spatial variation in resource depletion by Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus) foraging on belowground tubers of sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) was caused by differences in net energy intake rates. The variation in giving‐up densities within the confines of one lake was nearly eightfold, the giving‐up density being positively related to water depth and, to a lesser extent, the silt content of the sediment. The swans' preference (measured as cumulative foraging pressure) was negatively related to these variables. We adjusted a model developed for diving birds to predict changes in the time allocation of foraging swans with changes in power requirements and harvest rate. First, we compared the behavior of free‐living swans foraging in shallow and deep water, where they feed by head‐dipping and up‐ending, respectively. Up‐ending swans had 1.3–2.1 times longer feeding times than head‐dipping swans. This was contrary to our expectation, since the model predicted a decrease in feeding time with an increase in feeding power. However, up‐ending swans also had 1.9 times longer trampling times than head‐dipping swans. The model predicted a strong positive correlation between trampling time and feeding time, and the longer trampling times may thus have masked any effect of an increase in feeding power. Heart rate measurements showed that trampling was the most energetically costly part of foraging. However, because the feeding time and trampling time changed concurrently, the rate of energy expenditure was only slightly higher in deep water (1.03–1.06 times). This is a conservative estimate since it does not take into account that the feeding costs of up‐ending are possibly higher than that of head‐dipping. Second, we compared captive swans foraging on sandy and clayey sediments. We found that the harvest rate on clayey sediment was only 0.6 times that on sandy sediment and that the power requirements for foraging were 1.2–1.4 times greater. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the hypothesis that the large spatial variation in giving‐up densities was caused by differences in net rates of energy intake. This potentially has important implications for the prey dynamics, because plant regrowth has been shown to be related to the same habitat factors (water depth and sediment type).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCygnus columbianus 3aStuckenia pectinata 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy intake 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3aheart rate 3alakes 3amodels 3aregrowth 3asediments 3asilt fraction 3aswans 3atrampling damage 3atubers1 aLangevoord, Oscar1 aBevan, Richard M.1 aEngelaar, Kirsten R.1 aKlaassen, Marcel1 aMulder, Roef J.

This paper presents the results of research to evaluate a mechanical non-penetrating captive bolt (the Accles and Shelvoke CASH small animal tool, Birmingham, UK) to produce an immediate stun/kill with neonate piglets. One hundred and forty-seven piglets (average dead weight = 1.20 kg ± 0.58 (standard deviation, SD), mean age = 5.8 days (median = 3)) were euthanized with the device and demonstrated immediate loss of consciousness, subjectively assessed by behavioural signs and no recovery. The result that 147 out of 147 animals were effectively stun/killed gives a 95% confidence interval for the true percentage of animals that would be effectively stun/killed of 97.5–100% with the use of the CASH small animal tool under the conditions of the current study. This research concludes that the CASH small animal tool, using a 1 grain brown coded cartridge, is suitable for producing a stun/kill in neonate piglets when applied in a frontal/parietal position.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconfidence interval 3aconsciousness 3aeuthanasia 3aneonates 3apiglets 3astandard deviation 3aUnited Kingdom1 aLines, Jeff A.1 aKnowles, Toby G.1 aMason, Charles W.1 aWotton, Stephen B.0 tAnimals.g2018 Apr. 02, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani80400483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245006300175300001600238500001500254520098200269592002801251650001401279650002501293650002601318650001201344650002801356650001801384650001101402650001601413650001401429650001401443650002101457650001101478650002901489650001401518650001701532650002401549650002301573653001801596653002201614653002101636653001301657653002401670653001101694653001801705700005601723700002301779700002801802773011201830856008201942852000902024655001202033IND60544110420221118230514.0190415e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054411042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Mohammad Ashiqul10aEx vivo digestion of omega-3 enriched buffalo skimmed milk  ap. 842-851.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to investigate whether the protein digestion in skimmed buffalo milk was affected by adding cod liver oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acid to the milk. Human gastrointestinal enzymes were used in ex vivo digestion. After gastric and duodenal digestion, 32% of the neutral lipid underwent lipolysis. Both the omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic (C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6 n-3) acid showed 23% lipolysis. Most of the caseins were degraded after 20 min gastric digestion; the tiny traces found after 40 min gastric digestion were digested completely after 5 min duodenal digestion. The α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were resistant to gastric digestion, however, readily digested after 5 min duodenal digestion. Addition of cod liver oil did not affect the milk protein digestion and subsequent peptide generation. Thereby, enrichment of skimmed milk by cod liver oil could be a good nutritional source of omega-3 fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffaloes 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenzymes 3agastrointestinal system 3acod liver oil 3ahumans 3alactalbumin 3askim milk 3adigestion 3amilk fatty acids 3acasein 3adietary nutrient sources 3alipolysis 3abuffalo milk 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3abeta-lactoglobulin 0adairy protein 0aEx vivo digestion 0aβ-Lactoglobulin 0aPeptides 0aOmega-3 fatty acids 0aCasein 0aFortification1 aEkeberg, Dag1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0502-71681 aRukke, Elling-Olav1 aVegarud, Gerd Elisabeth0 tJournal of functional foods.g2015 Dec., v. 19 p.842-851dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2014.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011300166300001800279500002000297520169800317592002802015596005902043596005902102596012602161596007802287596005802365596009402423650001202517650001202529650002102541650002602562650001202588650002402600650001502624650001802639650001302657650001402670650000702684650004302691650002202734650001502756650001202771650001202783651001002795700001602805700001702821700001602838700001802854700001802872700001702890773016002907856008203067852000903149655001203158IND60788414220221120173107.0220813e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078841422DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2019.05.01342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guogang10aAmmonia‐Oxidizing Bacteria and Archaea: Response to Simulated Climate Warming and Nitrogen Supplementation  ap. 1683-1695.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAmmonia oxidation, the first and rate‐limiting step of the nitrification process, is driven by ammonia‐oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia‐oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Numerous studies on the response of aboveground plant and soil microbial communities to climate change have been conducted, but the effects of climate warming and nitrogen (N) supplementation on the abundance, community composition, and diversity of AOA and AOB in arid and semiarid steppe ecosystem remain elusive. In this study, we examined these effects on soil samples from the Inner Mongolia desert steppe after 11 consecutive years of simulated climate warming and N supplementation (ammonium nitrate), using real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and high throughput sequencing technique. We observed that the amoA abundance of AOA outnumbered that of AOB in this desert steppe, with N supplementation having a significant effect on amoA abundance. The effect of climate warming on the amoA abundance of AOA or AOB depended on soil depth. Eleven years of simulated climate warming and N supplementation had varying effects on the amoA abundance of AOA and AOB. Nitrogen supplementation shifted ammonia‐oxidizing bacterial community structure, increased potential nitrification rates, and affected ammonia‐oxidizing microbial α diversity at topsoil. The dominating factors shaping AOB community structure among the treatments were NH₄⁺–N, NO₃⁻–N, and pH, whereas pH was the significant factor in shaping AOA community structure. Our results indicate that N supplementation might be the driving factor aiding oxidation of ammonia at topsoil of arid and semiarid steppe ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data  a31500365cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31770499cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2012BAD13B02cNational Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China  a15ZCZDSF00410cKey Technology Research and Development Program of Tianjin  a18JCYBJC96500cNational Science Foundation of Tianjin  aIRT_17R59cInnovative Team of Grassland Resources from the Ministry of Education of China 3aArchaea 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrate 3abacterial communities 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apH 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areaction kinetics 3asoil depth 3asteppes 3atopsoil 3aChina1 aHuang, Jing1 aJia, Meiqing1 aLiu, Fanhui1 aYang, Yinghua1 aWang, Zhongwu1 aHan, Guodong0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2019 Nov., v. 83, no. 6 p.1683-1695dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2019.05.01343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01299naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007000158300001400228520043000242592002800672650001400700650001200714650001100726650001600737650002700753651001000780700001900790773010600809856007300915852000900988655001200997IND60132251420221120133514.0150505e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013225142DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.005812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Yi‐Hua10aVaccinium damingshanense sp. nov.

Over the decades, the decoction of GD has been consumed as a tea protective against diabetes. Furthermore, GD has traditionally been used as an anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diarrheal folk medicine. However, there is little scientific evidence elucidating its effects. This study aimed to test the effect of the GD extract on the intestinal environment. In male Sprague–Dawley rats, GD extract increased levels of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli and decreased levels of Clostridium leptum subgroup and Bacteroides group in the intestine. Furthermore, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was present at high concentrations in the caecal content of GD extract intake group. Through the above changes in microbiota and microbial metabolites, faecal bulk and moisture increased and caecal pH and putrefactive products decreased. These results suggest that GD extract has a potent prebiotic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aBifidobacterium 3aClostridium leptum 3aGeranium 3aLactobacillus 3acecum 3adiabetes 3ahighlands 3amales 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3aperennials 3aprebiotics 3arats 3atea 3atraditional medicine 3aAndes region 3aPeru 0aGeranium dielsianum 0aPolyphenol 0aPrebiotic effect 0aMicrobiota 0a3-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid1 aTanaka, Yuji1 aYamamoto, Kazuo1 aMorii, Hiroko1 aKamisako, Toshinori1 aOgawa, Hiroshi0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Nov., v. 11 p.12-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2014.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200937 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008300167300001400250500001500264520128800279592002801567650002101595650001801616650001301634650002201647650001101669650002001680650001601700650002401716650001401740650001501754650002901769650002101798650001401819653000801833653000901841653000901850653000901859653000801868653001401876653000801890653000901898653000701907653000801914653000801922653001001930653000801940653002101948653000801969653000801977653000801985653000801993653000802001653000802009653001202017653001002029653000902039653001102048653000802059653001202067653000802079653000802087653000802095653001002103653002402113653000902137653001002146653000902156653000802165653000702173653000902180653001302189653001202202653001802214653000902232653000802241700001702249700001902266700001902285700002102304700002002325773011302345856008402458852000902542655001202551IND60557055220221122030806.0190318e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055705522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2016.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Heng-Heng10aProteome changes associated with dormancy release of Dongxiang wild rice seeds  ap. 68-86.  a2019-12-06  aSeed dormancy provides optimum timing for seed germination and subsequent seedling growth, but the mechanism of seed dormancy is still poorly understood. Here, we used Dongxiang wild rice (DXWR) seeds to investigate the dormancy behavior and the differentially changed proteome in embryo and endosperm during dormancy release. DXWR seed dormancy was caused by interaction of embryo and its surrounding structure, and was an intermediate physiological dormancy. During seed dormancy release, a total of 109 and 97 protein spots showed significant change in abundance and were successfully identified in embryo and endosperm, respectively. As a result of dormancy release, the abundance of nine proteins involved in storage protein, cell defense and rescue and energy changed in the same way in both embryo and endosperm, while 67 and 49 protein spots changed differentially in embryo and endosperm, respectively. Dormancy release of DXWR seeds was closely associated with degradation of storage proteins in both embryo and endosperm. At the same time, the abundance of proteins involved in metabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle, cell growth and division, protein synthesis and destination and signal transduction increased in embryos while staying constant or decreasing in endosperms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseed germination 3aseed dormancy 3aproteome 3aprotein synthesis 3aenergy 3aseedling growth 3acell growth 3asignal transduction 3aendosperm 3aglycolysis 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3astorage proteins 3awild rice 0aTFA 0aUDPG 0aGBSS 0aMDHA 0aCDC 0aEndosperm 0aABA 0aNDPK 0aGA 0aTCP 0aLAP 0aASADH 0aMFT 0aDormancy release 0aPrx 0aGST 0aIEF 0a2-D 0aeIF 0aHSP 0aGlc-1-P 0aseeds 0aIPMS 0aEmbryo 0aDTT 0aGlc-6-P 0aASA 0aDOG 0aAPX 0aMDHAR 0aDongxiang wild rice 0aKARI 0aCysPI 0aDXWR 0aTCA 0aMS 0aPEBP 0aProteome 0aGly-3-P 0aSeed dormancy 0a2-DE 0aCBB1 aLiu, Shu-Jun1 aSong, Shun-Hua1 aWang, Wei-Qing1 aMøller, Ian Max1 aSong, Song-Quan0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 206 p.68-86dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245011400204506007600318520119000394592002801584506003701612650001301649650001001662650001601672650001601688650002301704650000701727650001601734650001201750650000901762650001301771650001901784700002101803700002201824700002101846773011901867856007401986852000902060655001202069IND60647200620221207082041.0190617e20180424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064720062DNAL7 a10.3390/ani80500602doi7 aPMC59812712pmcid7 a296950602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangendijk, Pieter14aThe Course of Parturition Affects Piglet Condition at Birth and Survival and Growth through the Nursery Phase  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to relate the course of parturition to the condition of piglets at birth, based on umbilical cord blood acid-base values, and relate the condition at birth to neonatal survival and performance up to 10 weeks of life. Data were collected from 37 spontaneous unassisted parturitions, and neonatal performance was based on observations of 516 piglets. Stillbirth rate increased from 2% in the first piglets, to 17% in piglets born 13th in the litter or later. This was aggravated in sows with longer than average stage II of parturition. Umbilical cord blood values also reflected the effect of birth order, with pH decreasing and lactate increasing in the course of parturition. Interestingly, sows that had a long expulsion stage of parturition also took longer to give birth to the first four piglets (r = 0.74), suggesting that sows with complicated parturition were already experiencing problems at the start of expulsion of piglets. Piglets with signs of asphyxia, based on umbilical blood lactate higher than 4.46 mmol/L, were slower to start suckling, had a higher risk of neonatal mortality, and had a slower growth rate over the first 10 weeks of life.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasphyxia 3ablood 3afetal death 3alactic acid 3aneonatal mortality 3apH 3aparturition 3apiglets 3asows 3asuckling 3aumbilical cord1 aFleuren, Marleen1 avan Hees, Hubèrt1 avan Kempen, Theo0 tAnimals.g2018 Apr. 24, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani80500603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01219naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245008000160300001600240520025600256592002800512650002300540650002300563650002100586650001400607650001300621700002000634700001800654700002500672773012600697856007300823852000900896655001200905IND60658189720221119134252.0190816e20080122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065818972DNAL7 a10.1039/b716107g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakamiya, Atsushi10aKinetically stabilized dibenzoborole as an electron-accepting building unit  ap. 579-581.  aA synthetic route to a dibenzoborole, kinetically stabilized by the 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl group, was developed, and a series of π-extended derivatives were synthesized, which show orange-red emissions and stable electrochemical redox properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemistry 3aemissions 3amoieties1 aMishima, Kotaro1 aEkawa, Kanako1 aYamaguchi, Shigehiro0 tChemical communications.g2008 Jan. 22, , no. 5 p.579-581dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b716107g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007200150245011600222300001800338520110500356592002801461650002201489650001401511650001301525650004401538650002401582650002101606700002701627700007101654700002801725700003501753700007401788700006401862773017401926856008402100852000902184655001202193IND60679454220200406000000.0191228e20191127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067945422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b007842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmenta-Salinas, Concepción1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7786-459010aNovel Sesquiterpene Skeletons by Multiple Wagner–Meerwein Rearrangements of a Longipinane-1,9-diol Derivative  ap. 3410-3420.  aThe tricyclic sesquiterpene (1R,3R,4S,5S,7S,8S,9S,10R,11R)-7,8-diangeloyloxylongipinan-1,9-diol, or rasteviol (7), underwent multiple Wagner–Meerwein molecular rearrangements and several hydride shifts when treated with Et₂O–BF₃ to generate the six new compounds (1R,3R,4S,5R,7S,8S,9S,10R,11S)-7,8-diangeloyloxy-1,9-epoxyjiquilpane (8), (1R,3R,4S,5R,7R,8S,9S,11S)-8-angeloyloxy-1,7-epoxyzamor-10(14)-ene (11), (2S,3R,4R,5R,6R,7R,8S,9S,10S)-7,8-diangeloyloxy-6,9-epoxyjanitziane (14), (4R,5R,7S,8S,9S,10S,11S)-7,8-diangeloyloxy-9-hydroxyjiquilp-3(15)-ene (16), (2S,3S,5R,7S,8R,10S,11R)-7,8-diangeloyloxyiratzian-9-one (18), and (2S,3S,5R,10S,11R)-8-angeloyloxyiratzi-7-en-9-one (22), of which 8, 11, 14, and 18 possess new hydrocarbon skeletons.

After triple crushing three fractions were obtained: an intermediate fraction (0.4–1mm) of directly recoverable glass (17%w/w); a coarse fraction (>1mm) requiring further thermal treatment in order to separate EVA-glued layers in glass fragments; a fine fraction (<0.4mm) requiring chemical treatment to dissolve metals and obtain another recoverable glass fraction. Coarse fractions (62%w/w) were treated thermally giving another recoverable glass fraction (52%w/w). Fine fractions can be further sieved into two sub-fractions: <0.08mm (3%w/w) and 0.08–0.4mm (22%w/w). Chemical characterization showed that 0.08–0.4mm fractions mainly contained Fe, Al and Zn, while precious and dangerous metals (Ag, Ti, Te, Cu and Cd) are mainly present in fractions <0.08mm. Acid leaching of 0.08–0.4mm fractions allowed to obtain a third recoverable glass fraction (22%w/w).

The Case of Giant Panda Conservation in Sichuan, China  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reduced the threat status of the giant panda from &ldquo;endangered&rdquo; to &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; in September 2016. In this study, we analyzed current practices for giant panda conservation at regional and local environmental scales, based on recent reports of giant panda protection efforts in Sichuan Province, China, combined with the survey results from 927 households within and adjacent to the giant panda reserves in this area. The results showed that household attitudes were very positive regarding giant panda protection efforts. Over the last 10 years, farmers&rsquo; dependence on the natural resources provided by giant panda reserves significantly decreased. However, socio-economic development increased resource consumption, and led to climate change, habitat fragmentation, environmental pollution, and other issues that placed increased pressure on giant panda populations. This difference between local and regional scales must be considered when evaluating the IUCN status of giant pandas. While the status of this species has improved in the short-term due to positive local attitudes, large-scale socio-economic development pressure could have long-term negative impacts. Consequently, the IUCN assessment leading to the classification of giant panda as &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;endangered&rdquo;, should not affect its conservation intensity and effort, as such actions could negatively impact population recovery efforts, leading to the extinction of this charismatic species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate change 3aextinction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahouseholds 3anatural resources 3apollution 3asocioeconomic development 3asurveys 3aChina1 aLei, Shuo1 aQing, Qin1 aWen, Yali0 tAnimals.g2018 May 03, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani80500693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013300159300001600292500002000308520146600328592002801794596002401822650001601846650001701862650001801879650001601897650001701913650001701930650001001947650001801957651000901975700006401984700002702048700006202075700002202137700003202159773013902191856007502330852000902405655001202414IND60788414520221120183941.0220813e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078841452DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.200042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoff, Kathleen10aImpact of sample preparation methods for characterizing the geochemistry of soils and sediments by portable X‐ray fluorescence  ap. 131-143.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe examined the impact of three different sample preparation methods on bulk soil geochemistry data obtained from a hand‐held, portable X‐ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer. We generated data from a soil core recovered from the surface, downward into unaltered loess, and into a buried soil at a site in eastern Iowa. Samples were scanned (i) directly from field‐moist soil cores; (ii) after drying, grinding, and being loosely massed in plastic cups; and (iii) as pressed‐powder pellets. Data derived using these methods were compared with data obtained from a standard benchtop X‐ray fluorescence (XRF) unit. Generally, the results indicated that data from pressed powder pellets often provide the best correlation to benchtop XRF data, although the results were sometimes element or compound specific. Calcium oxide, Fe₂O₃, and K₂O generally provided the strongest correlations between pXRF‐ and XRF‐reported values; SiO₂ data were more problematic. Field‐moist pXRF scans generally underestimated element concentrations, but the correlations between pXRF and benchtop XRF measurements were greatly improved after applying pXRF‐derived calibration standards. In summary, although element/compound data provided by pXRF showed significant relationships to benchtop XRF data, the results are improved with proper sample preparation (i.e., drying, grinding, pressing) and usually by calibrating the pXRF data against known standards.  aPublisher supplied data  a#1331906cNSF‐EAR 3aX-radiation 3aburied soils 3acalcium oxide 3acalibration 3afluorescence 3ageochemistry 3aloess 3aspectrometers 3aIowa1 aSchaetzl, Randall J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6070-13651 aChakraborty, Somsubhra1 aWeindorf, David C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3814-825X1 aKasmerchak, Chase1 aBettis, E.

The total number of immobilized ligands in the porous adsorbent particles has the same value whether the spatial ligand density distribution is uniform or nonuniform. The results in this study clearly show that for a given value of the superficial velocity of the flowing fluid stream in the column (for a given value of throughput) the breakthrough time is significantly increased when the radius of the microspheres is decreased, the total number of sections of the stratified column bed is increased, and the spatial ligand density distribution employed in the microspheres is nonuniform. Furthermore, when the superficial velocity of the flowing fluid stream in the column is increased (throughput is increased) the effect that (i) the reduction in the radius of the microspheres and (ii) the increase in the number of sections of the stratified column bed have on providing robust and effective dynamic adsorptive capacity and smaller reductions on the breakthrough time is substantially larger than that realized through the use of the nonuniform ligand density distribution. Similar trends are also observed in the dynamic behavior of adsorption in the systems studied here when the value of the concentration of the adsorbate in the flowing fluid stream entering the column (inlet concentration) has such a high magnitude that the value of the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate in the adsorbed phase determined from the equilibrium Langmuir isotherm that would correspond to the inlet concentration of the adsorbate in the flowing fluid stream is, for all practical purposes, at its saturation limit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3asorption isotherms1 aLiapis, Athanasios I.0 tJournal of separation science.g2012 Dec., v. 35, no. 24 p.3439-3446dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2012006323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008600174300001400260520090000274592002801174650001601202650001801218650003001236650002401266650001601290650001701306650001701323650001501340653001001355653000801365653000801373653000901381653000701390653003801397653001501435653001901450653001801469700001801487700001701505773011001522856008201632852000901714655001201723IND60544111020221117102355.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054411102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadmoradi, Shayan10aBoom of probiotics: This time non-alcoholic fatty liver disease – A mini review  ap. 30-35.  aAs one of the major hepatic complications, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be influenced by gut microbiota. Evidence suggests that alteration of intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the health of the gut–liver axis. Furthermore, bacterial translocation and altered intestinal permeability are also among the factors leading to the pathogenesis of liver disease. Recent studies have proposed that probiotics may have beneficial effects on the treatment/prevention of NAFLD and other hepatic complications due to their ability to augment intestinal barrier function, prevent production of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and modulate the immune system. This study reviews and summarizes the available data regarding the relationship between gut microbiota and hepatic complications, focusing on the potential of probiotics as a new method of treatment/prevention for NAFLD.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty liver 3aimmune system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipopolysaccharides 3amethodology 3apathogenesis 3apermeability 3aprobiotics 0aNAFLD 0aLPS 0aGIT 0aNASH 0aBT 0aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease 0aProbiotics 0aGut microbiota 0aLiver disease1 aJavidan, Aida1 aKordi, Javad0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Nov., v. 11 p.30-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2014.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006100141245008800202300001400290500001900304520196500323592002802288650001602316650002302332650002202355650001102377650001102388650001202399650002302411650001302434650001702447650001002464651001902474653002302493653001802516653002402534653002002558653001002578653001002588653001202598700002102610700002102631700002202652700002102674700002302695773011902718856007502837852000902912655001202921IND60727393320221120163103.0210211e20200709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072739332DNAL7 a10.1017/wet.2020.732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInman, Matthew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8737-946810aEvaluation of dicamba retention in spray tanks and its impact on flue-cured tobacco  ap. 35-42.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, there has been increased use of dicamba due to the introduction of dicamba-resistant cotton and soybean in the United States. Therefore, there is a potential increase in off-target movement of dicamba and injury to sensitive crops. Flue-cured tobacco is extremely sensitive to auxin herbicides, particularly dicamba. In addition to yield loss, residue from drift or equipment contamination can have severe repercussions for the marketability of the crop. Studies were conducted in 2016, 2017, and 2018 in North Carolina to evaluate spray-tank cleanout efficiency of dicamba using various cleaning procedures. No difference in dicamba recovery was observed regardless of dicamba formulation and cleaning agent. Dicamba residue decreased with the number of rinses. There was no difference in dicamba residue recovered from the third rinse compared with residue from the tank after being refilled for subsequent tank use. Recovery ranged from 2% to 19% of the original concentration rate among the three rinses. Field studies were also conducted in 2018 to evaluate flue-cured tobacco response to reduced rates of dicamba ranging, from 1/5 to 1/10,000 of a labeled rate. Injury and yield reductions varied by environment and application timing. When exposed to 1/500 of a labeled rate at 7 and 11 wk after transplanting, tobacco injury ranged from 39% to 53% and 10% to 16% 24 days after application, respectively. The maximum yield reduction was 62%, with a 55% reduction in value when exposed to 112 g ha–¹ of dicamba. Correlations showed significant relationships between crop injury assessment and yield and value reductions, with Pearson values ranging from 0.24 to 0.63. These data can provide guidance to growers and stakeholders and emphasize the need for diligent stewardship when using dicamba technology.

These evergreen forests have been scarcely studied south of 43° S, where there is still a large area made up of old-growth forests. Silvicultural proposals for the Evergreen forest type have been based on northern Evergreen forests, so that the characterization of the structure and composition of southern Evergreen forests, e.g., their typification, would aid in the development of appropriate silvicultural proposals for these forests. Based on the tree composition of 46 sampled plots in old-growth forests in an area of >1000 ha in southern Chiloé Island (43° S), we used multivariate analyses to define forest groups and to compare these forests with other evergreen forests throughout the Archipelago of North-Patagonia. We determined that evergreen forests of southern Chiloé correspond to the North-Patagonian temperate rainforests that are characterized by few tree species of different shade tolerance growing on fragile soils. We discuss the convenience of developing continuous cover forest management for these forests, rather than selective cuts or even-aged management that is proposed in the current legislation. This study is a contribution to forest classification for both ecologically- and forestry-oriented purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeven-aged management 3aevergreen forests 3aforest types 3alaws and regulations 3amultivariate analysis 3aold-growth forests 3aphytogeography 3arain forests 3ashade tolerance 3asoil 3atrees 3aArgentina 3aChile1 aDonoso, Pablo J.0 tForests.g2013 Nov. 28, v. 4, no. 4 p.1087-1105dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f40410873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010800164300001600272520129000288592002801578650001001606650002001616650001301636650001201649650002001661650002501681650002701706650001301733650001201746650001701758650001401775650001301789650002101802650000701823650001501830650002601845650001701871650002901888650001301917650001001930650001101940651002201951651001101973653002201984653001902006653002402025653002702049653002002076700002402096700002302120700001802143773011702161856008002278852000902358655001202367IND60560840220221120124631.0180620e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056084022DNAL7 a10.1515/intag-2016-00152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBłońska, Ewa10aEffects of serpentinite fertilizer on the chemical properties and enzyme activity of young spruce soils  ap. 401-414.  aThe experimental plots used in the study were located in the middle forest zone (elevation: 900-950 m a.s.l.) on two nappes of the flysch Carpathians in southern Poland. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of serpentinite in combination with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers on selected chemical properties of the soil and activity of dehydrogenase and urease in the studied soils. All fertilizer treatments significantly enriched the tested soils in magnesium. The use of serpentinite as a fertilizer reduced the molar ratio of exchangeable calcium to magnesium, which facilitated the uptake of magnesium by tree roots due to competition between calcium and magnesium. After one year of fertilization on the Wisła experimental plot, the pH of the Ofh horizon increased, while the pH of the mineral horizons significantly decreased. Enrichment of serpentinite with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers stimulated the dehydrogenase activity in the studied organic horizon. The lack of a negative effect of the serpentinite fertilizer on enzyme activity in the spruce stand soil showed that the concentrations of the heavy metals added to the soil were not high enough to be toxic and indicated the feasibility of using this fertilizer in forestry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea 3aadverse effects 3aaltitude 3acalcium 3aenzyme activity 3aexchangeable calcium 3afertilizer application 3aforestry 3aforests 3aheavy metals 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3aorganic horizons 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium fertilizers 3aserpentinite 3asoil chemical properties 3atoxicity 3atrees 3aurease 3aCarpathian region 3aPoland 0aspruce stand soil 0afertilizer use 0achemical properties 0adehydrogenase activity 0aurease activity1 aJanuszek, Kazimierz1 aMałek, Stanisław1 aWanic, Tomasz0 tInternational agrophysics.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 30, no. 4 p.401-414dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23085x2300-87257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/intag-2016-00153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100002000163245016700183300001800350520148300368592002801851650002401879650000901903650001801912650001601930650001601946650001601962650004101978650002102019650000902040650003602049650001502085650004102100650002402141650001302165650003702178700001802215700001502233700002002248700001402268700001402282700001902296700002202315700001702337773010102354856007802455852000902533655001202542IND60080708620221118054749.0140804e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008070862DNAL7 a232257242pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2012006032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiao‐Juan10aApplication of ionic liquid‐based surfactants in the microwave‐assisted extraction for the determination of four main phloroglucinols from Dryopteris fragrans  ap. 3600-3608.  aAn ionic liquid‐based surfactant combined with microwave‐assisted extraction method, followed by RP‐HPLC‐diode array detection (DAD) with a core shell column, was successfully applied in extracting and quantifying four major phloroglucinols from Dryopteris fragrans. Eight ionic liquids with different cation and anion were investigated, and 1‐octyl‐3‐methylimidazolium bromide presented the best relative extraction efficiency for four phloroglucinols. The optimum conditions of this method were as follows: ionic liquid concentration 0.75 M, liquid/solid ratio 12:1 mL/g, extraction time 7 min, extraction temperature 50°C, and irradiation power 600 W. The quality analytical parameters of the method were obtained based on the linearity, precision, accuracy, detection, and quantification limits. The recoveries were between 96.90 and 103.5% with standard deviations not higher than 4.7%. Compared with ionic liquid‐based heat reflux extraction, ultrasonic‐assisted extraction, negative‐pressure cavitation extraction, and conventional microwave‐assisted extraction, the relative extraction efficiencies of the proposed method for four phloroglucinols increased 1.5–40.4%. The method was successfully applied for the quantification of four major phloroglucinols from D. fragrans. All these results suggest that the developed method represents an excellent alternative for the extraction and quantification of phloroglucinols in other plant materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDryopteris fragrans 3aheat 3aionic liquids 3airradiation 3asurfactants 3atemperature 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFernsxchemistry 2aIons 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMicrowaves 2aPhloroglucinolxanalysisxchemistry. 2aReference Standards 2aSolvents 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemistry1 aYu, Hui‐Min1 aGao, Chang1 aZu, Yuan‐Gang1 aWang, Wei1 aLuo, Meng1 aGu, Cheng‐Bo1 aZhao, Chun‐Jian1 aFu, Yu‐Jie0 tJournal of separation science.g2012 Dec., v. 35, no. 24 p.3600-3608dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2012006033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245015400177300001400331520110200345592002801447650003801475650001501513650001401528650001301542650000901555650001401564650002601578650001901604650001401623653000801637653001001645653000701655653000701662653000701669653000701676653001501683653002001698653001901718653002201737700002401759700003001783700002801813700003201841700002301873773011301896856008402009852000902093655001202102IND60557055620221122003446.0190318e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055705562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2016.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampestre, María Paula14aThe alkaline tolerance in Lotus japonicus is associated with mechanisms of iron acquisition and modification of the architectural pattern of the root  ap. 40-48.  aThe response of fifty-four Lotus japonicus ecotypes, and of six selected ecotypes was investigated under alkaline conditions. Sensitive, but not tolerant ecotypes, showed interveinal chlorosis under all alkalinity conditions and high mortality under extreme alkalinity. Interveinal chlorosis was associated with Fe deficiency, as a reduced Fe2+ shoot content was observed in all sensitive ecotypes. In addition, some showed a decline in photosynthesis rate and PSII performance compared to the control. In contrast, some tolerant ecotypes did not change these parameters between treatments. Alkaline tolerance could be explained by a mechanism of Fe acquisition and a root structural modification. This conclusion was based on the fact that all tolerant, but not the sensitive ecotypes, presented high ferric reductase oxidase activity under alkaline stress compared to the control, and a Herringbone root pattern modification. On this basis, the analysis of these mechanisms of alkaline tolerance could be used in screening programs for the selection of new tolerant genotypes in the Lotus genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aalkalinity 3achlorosis 3aecotypes 3airon 3amortality 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphotosystem II 3ascreening 0aFRO 0aFV/FM 0aIC 0aSI 0aPn 0aTT 0aAlkalinity 0aLotus japonicus 0aFe acquisition 0aRoot architecture1 aAntonelli, Cristian1 aCalzadilla, Pablo Ignacio1 aMaiale, Santiago Javier1 aRodríguez, Andrés Alberto1 aRuiz, Oscar Adolfo0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 206 p.40-48dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012200167300001600289520138800305592002801693650003701721650001501758650001501773650001601788650002801804650002101832650002001853650001101873650001801884650002101902650000701923650001301930650001101943650001701954650001301971650001901984650003702003650001202040653001302052653002102065653001202086653001902098653001902117700001902136700001702155700001902172700001802191773011202209856008302321852000902404655001202413IND60605429620221122052448.0200712e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060542962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.06.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Saeromi10aMagnetic force assisted electrochemical sensor for the detection of thrombin with aptamer-antibody sandwich formation  ap. 480-486.  aA magnetic force assisted electrochemical aptamer-antibody sandwich assay (MESA) was developed for the detection of thrombin as a model protein in serum samples. The MESA using the formation of sandwich complexes on the electrochemical sensor probe for reaction and the removal of unbound bioconjugates from the sensor surface without washing are controlled by a magnetic field. Thrombin was determined by the cathodic currents of a toluidine blue O (TBO) attached with thrombin antibody modified magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) at the sensor surface. To detect thrombin in a serum sample, we applied a thrombin-specific aptamer as the capture molecule bound to the functionalized conducting polymer layer (poly-(2,2´:5´,5″-terthiophene-3´-p-benzoic acid) (pTBA)), and streptavidin and starch coated-MNP was conjugated with biotinylated thrombin antibodies (Ab) and TBO as the bioconjugate (MNP@Ab-TBO). The characterization of MNP@Ab-TBO and sensor probe was performed using voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, XPS, and UV–VIS spectroscopy. The experimental conditions were optimized in terms of pH, binding time, removal time of unbound bioconjugates, and applied potential. The dynamic ranges of thrombin were from 1.0 to 500 nM with detection limit of 0.49 (± 0.06) nM. The recovery test demonstrates the reliability of the proposed sensing system for a handheld device.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3amagnetic fields 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3apH 3apolymers 3astarch 3astreptavidin 3athrombin 3atoluidine blue 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awashing 0aThrombin 0aElectrochemistry 0aAptamer 0aSandwich assay 0aMagnetic force1 aMoon, Jong-Min1 aChoi, Jaekyu1 aHwang, Hyundoo1 aShim, Yoon-Bo0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 117 p.480-486dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.06.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006000141245005200201300001400253500001900267520175300286592002802039650002302067650002302090650001102113650001202124650001002136650002602146650002002172650001502192650000902207650001002216651001002226653002402236653002002260653000902280653001802289653001802307700002102325700002502346700002102371773011902392856007502511852000902586655001202595IND60727393520221120163019.0210211e20200709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072739352DNAL7 a10.1017/wet.2020.752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, Kyle R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9576-469X10aDicamba effects on fruiting in sensitive cotton  ap. 43-48.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSince the release of dicamba-tolerant cotton in 2016, preplant and POST applications of dicamba to control glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth have increased. With the increase in area treated with dicamba, the risk of off-target movement to nontarget crops has increased. A field study was conducted at the Texas Tech University New Deal Research Farm equipped with subsurface drip irrigation in 2017 and 2018 to evaluate non-dicamba tolerant cotton response to dicamba when applied at four crop growth stages [first square (FS) + 2 wk, first bloom (FB), FB + 2 wk, and FB + 5 wk]. Dicamba at 0.56 (1×), 0.056 (1/10×), 0.0112 (1/50×), 0.0056 (1/100×), and 0.00112 (1/500×) kg ae ha–¹ was applied to ‘FM 1830GLT’ cotton. When applications were made at FS + 2 wk, a shift in boll nodal position was apparent following dicamba at the 1/50× rate in 2017 and at 1/10× in 2018 compared to the nontreated control (NTC). A shift in boll distribution from the 1/50× rate of dicamba was apparent at FB in 2017, but not in 2018. Dicamba applied at the 1× rate at FB + 2 wk resulted in reduced boll numbers. No change in boll number or boll position was apparent following any dicamba rate when applied at FB + 5 wk in both years. Dicamba applied at 1/500×, 1/100×, and 1/50× rates at all timings did not affect yield relative to the NTC. When dicamba was applied at the 1/10× rate, the greatest yield loss was observed at FS + 2 wk followed by FB and FB + 2 wk. Micronaire increased following dicamba applied at 1/10× at FS + 2 wk, FB, and FB + 2 wk in 2017. In 2018, micronaire decreased following dicamba applied at 1/10× at FB + 5 wk.

An estimated 150 bison died of the syndrome between January 1998 and December 1999. The syndrome was identified as malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), primarily the alimentary form. Clinical onset was acute, and most affected bison died within 1–3 days; none recovered. Consistent lesions were hemorrhagic cystitis, ulcerative enterotyphlocolitis, and arteritis-phlebitis. Vasculitis was milder and more localized than that in cattle with MCF, and in contrast to the situation in cattle, lymphadenomegaly was minimal. Virtually all affected bison examined were positive for ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A retrospective study of archived tissues established that MCF occurred in the yard as early as 1993. A prospective study was undertaken to establish the importance of MCF relative to other fatal diseases at the feedlot. The fate of a group of 300 healthy male bison in a consignment of 1,101 animals was followed for up to 7 months to slaughter. At entry, 23% (71/300) of bison were seropositive for MCF viruses, and 11% (8/71) of these seropositive bison were PCR positive for OvHV-2. Forty seronegative bison were selected at random from the group, and all were PCR negative for OvHV-2. There was no change in seroprevalence in the group during the investigation. The minimum infection rate for MCF virus was 36.3% (93/256). Twenty-two (7.3%) of the 300 bison in the feedlot died. Of these, 15 had MCF, 4 had acute or chronic pneumonia, and 3 were unexamined. Losses in the entire consignment were higher (98/1,101; 8.8% death loss); 76% of deaths were attributable to MCF. The study failed to reveal a relationship between subclinical infection and development of clinical disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseroprevalence 3afeedlots 3aAlcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 3amalignant catarrhal fever 3adisease course 3abison 2aAnimals 2aBisonxvirology 2aDNA, Viralxanalysis 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aDisease Progression 2aHerpesviridaexgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aMalignant Catarrhxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aMortality 2aPneumoniaxveterinaryxvirology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aProspective Studies 0aAlcelaphine herpesvirus 11 aLi, H.1 aSourk, C.1 aMontgomery, D.

Malting is a complex biotechnological process that includes steeping; germination and finally, the dehydration of cereal grains under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. In this investigation, the biophysical properties of barley malt were predicted using two models of artificial neural networks as well as response surface methodology. Stepping time and germination time were selected as the independent variables and 1 000 kernel weight, kernel density and terminal velocity were selected as the dependent variables (responses). The obtained outcomes showed that the artificial neural network model, with a logarithmic sigmoid activation function, presents more precise results than the response surface model in the prediction of the aerodynamic and biophysical properties of produced barley malt. This model presented the best result with 8 nodes in the hidden layer and significant correlation coefficient values of 0.783, 0.767 and 0.991 were obtained for responses one thousand kernel weight, kernel density, and terminal velocity, respectively. The outcomes indicated that this novel technique could be successfully applied in quantitative and qualitative monitoring within the malting process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aequipment design 3agermination 3ahandling machinery 3ahumidity 3amalting 3amalting barley 3amonitoring 3aneural networks 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascreening 3aseeds 3ashipping 3asmall cereal grains 3asoaking 3atemperature 0aANN 0aRSM 0amalting 0abarley 0acorrelation coefficient1 aFarzaneh, Vahid1 aBakhshabadi, Hamid1 aZare, Zahra1 aKarami, Zahra1 aMokhtarian, Mohsen1 aCarvalho, Isabel S.,0 tInternational agrophysics.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 30, no. 4 p.457-464dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23085x2300-87257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/intag-2016-00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011500167300001600282520120000298592002801498650001501526650001201541650001001553650002001563650000901583650001801592650001501610650001301625650001801638650001601656650002601672650002201698650001801720650003001738653002101768653002601789653001901815653003001834653002301864653004001887700002301927700002401950700002501974700002001999700006102019700002302080700002002103700002302123700002302146773011202169856008302281852000902364655001202373IND60605429720221122052525.0200712e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060542972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.06.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSriram, Manish12aA rapid readout for many single plasmonic nanoparticles using dark-field microscopy and digital color analysis  ap. 530-536.  aThe integration﻿ of plasmonic nanoparticles into biosensors has the potential to increase the sensitivity and dynamic range of detection, through the use of single nanoparticle assays. The analysis of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of plasmonic nanoparticles has allowed the limit of detection of biosensors to move towards single molecules. However, due to complex equipment or slow analysis times, these technologies have not been implemented for point-of-care detection. Herein, we demonstrate an advancement in LSPR analysis by presenting a technique, which utilizes an inexpensive CMOS-equipped digital camera and a dark-field microscope, that can analyse the λₘₐₓ of over﻿ several thousand gold nanospheres in less than a second, without the use of a spectrometer. This improves the throughput of single particle spectral analysis by enabling more nanoparticles to be probed and in a much shorter time. This technique has been demonstrated through the detection of interleukin-6 through a core-satellite binding assay. We anticipate that this technique will aid in the development of high-throughput, multiplexed and point-of-care single nanoparticle biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acameras 3acolor 3adetection limit 3agold 3ainterleukin-6 3amicroscopy 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3apoint-of-care systems 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aPlasmonic sensor 0aDark-field microscopy 0aColor analysis 0aSingle particle detection 0aGold nanoparticles 0aLocalized surface plasmon resonance1 aMarkhali, Bijan P.1 aNicovich, Philip R.1 aBennett, Danielle T.1 aReece, Peter J.1 aBrynn Hibbert, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9210-29411 aTilley, Richard D.1 aGaus, Katharina1 aVivekchand, S.R.C.1 aGooding, J.

Our previous studies based on morphological analysis and ITS sequence variation suggested that Malus toringoides (Rehd.) Hughes is derived from hybridization between M. transitoria (Batal.) Schneid. and M. kansuensis (Batal.) Schneid. To further understand the variation pattern of ITS sequences in M. toringoides, and to elucidate the evolutionary processes that affect ITS sequence variation after hybridization, we sampled 99 accessions from multiple populations of the hybrid and parental species, and then obtained totally 254 ITS sequences by cloning and sequencing. Our ITS variation data demonstrates three outcomes of ITS repeats after hybrid speciation. ∼ 27–41% of M. toringoides have only M. transitoria type ITS sequence, ∼ 40–70% have M. transitoria type ITS sequence plus one or two chimeric ITS sequences generated by recombination between parental ITS sequences, and six accessions retain both parental type ITS sequences. The plausible evolutionary processes that created the observed ITS variations were inferred to be the joint actions of recombination, concerted evolution, pseudogenization and backcrossing. Our study provides further understandings of the variation model of ITS repeats after hybridization as well as the evolution of M. toringoides after its hybrid speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus 3abackcrossing 3aconcerted evolution 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amodels 3aplant taxonomy 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis1 aTang, Jian‐Min1 aTan, Si1 aLi, Ju1 aMa, Xiang1 aZhou, Zhi‐Qin0 tNordic journal of botany.g2015 Feb., v. 33, no. 1 p.109-119dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0107-055X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.2012.00108.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245011000208500001400318520140800332592002801740650003001768650000901798650002501807650002201832650001601854650000901870650002001879650001101899650001301910650001001923650001601933650001101949650001001960653001701970653002401987653003002011653003202041653002902073700001702102700001502119773011602134856008702250852000902337655001202346IND60716097020221118154019.0210114e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071609702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1135582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shifei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9190-036X10aThermodynamic, operational, and techno-economic analysis of the cascade heating system with a double-unit  aNAL-light  aHigh back-pressure technology is an efficient way to recover waste heat and improve the energy utilization efficiency and heating capacity of cogeneration systems. In this study, a coal-fired cogeneration system with a double-unit (2 × 300 MW) was selected as the reference system and modeled in the EBSILON professional system. Then, a detailed comparative analysis of cogeneration systems with double-units was conducted from the perspective of thermodynamic, operational, and techno-economic analyses. The results show that with the high back pressure technology, the gross thermal and generation efficiencies of the novel system increased by 8.82% and 14.28%, respectively, while the standard coal consumption rate for generation was reduced by 43.47 g/kWh. Besides, the average energy quality coefficient of the novel system was reduced by 0.12. The temperatures of the exhaust steam, supplied and returned water changed the operational characteristics, including the maximum heating capacity and feasible operational region. Moreover, with the decrease in the maximum temperature rise ratio in the heating condenser, the feasible operational region of the novel system was reduced. The techno-economic analysis shows that under the given conditions, the net annual revenue of the novel system is 3.55 × 10⁶ CNY/year, and the discounted payback period of the novel system is 10.55 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acoal 3acogeneration systems 3aenergy conversion 3aexhibitions 3aheat 3aheating systems 3aincome 3apressure 3asteam 3atemperature 3awastes 3awater 0aCogeneration 0aWaste heat recovery 0aThermodynamic performance 0aFeasible operational region 0aTechno-economic analysis1 aWang, Weishu1 aGe, Zhihua0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 226 p.113558-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1135583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013600165300001800301520087800319592002801197650001301225650003401238650001301272700001701285700001601302773009601318856008101414852000901495655001201504IND60724942020221117231430.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoh, Yong-Jin10aStatistical analyses on inverted perovskite solar cells employing non-fullerene-based small molecule as a cathode interfacial layer  ap. 1643-1646.  aIn this data article, we present the influences of the solvent, concentration, and spin rates of 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2’,3’-d’]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b’]dithiophene) (ITIC) material on the performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

The essential process in this cycle is the shuttling of Na⁺ ions in and out of Mn oxides. In an effort to bring down the temperature of this cycle, we have found that the use of Mn₃O₄ nanoparticles is particularly effective. Ball milling has been applied to decrease the particle size of commercial Mn₃O₄ to less than 500 nm. Thus the solid state reaction between Na₂CO₃ and Mn₃O₄ nanoparticles occurs at a temperature 200 °C lower than with bulk samples. One of the challenges of this particular cycle lies in its slow H₂ evolution. It has been possible to operate this cycle and generate H₂ at a much faster rate at 750 °C and even at 700 °C by this means. Furthermore, the step involving hydrolysis of NaMnO₂ can be performed at 50 °C instead of 100 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3aions 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3amilling 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aRajesh, S.1 aRao, C.

Soil units of this map were combined with the mapping units on the map of soil-ecological zoning of the same scale, namely, soil districts (on the plains and in the mountains). For each soil district (total 60), average, minimum and maximum sizes of soil polygons, richness indices (total number of polygons and number of taxonomic units) were calculated, as well as species richness (Margalef, Menhinick), domination indices (Berger-Parker, MkIntosh, Simpson), complexity of the soil cover (divisibility index, complexity coefficient), diversity indices (Shannon, normalized Shannon index, Gini-Simpson), lateral differentiation, and a total score was derived by accounting the values of all calculated indices. The following quantitative characteristics of the soil cover were used to calculate the indices: the number of soil polygons, soil taxonomic groups, the length of boundaries, the area of polygons (including the average and maximum values) and their ratio. The soil diversity increases from the Arctic soil zone to the Subarctic arctic-tundra subzone and is accompanied by an increase in the areas of soil polygons. Pechorsko-Karskiy, Mezensko-Cheshskiy and Nizhneeniseyskiy plain soil districts, Koryakskiy, Anadyirskiy and Pekulneysko-Iskatenskiy mountain soil districts are characterized by maximum soil diversity, while the South-Novaya Zemlya mountain and plain soil districts – by the lowest one.  aPublisher supplied data 3afrigid soils 3amountain soils 3amountains 3apedodiversity 3aquantitative analysis 3aspecies richness 3azoning 3aArctic region 3aRussia1 aGennadiev, A.

The SSDU contains a naphthalene-diimide (NDI) chromophore, an amide group, and a hydrophobic wedge. H bonding, π stacking, and hydrophobic interaction among the SSDU lead to the formation of entropy-driven aggregates for appended hydrophilic polymers including one dendronized polymer. In water, the freshly prepared solution exhibits a spherical morphology, which gradually transforms into the cylindrical micelle for only one tested polymer having oligo-oxyethylene pendant chains. But no such transformation was noticed for the other two polymers having pendant hydroxyl groups. In the presence of 10% good solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), the rate of such morphology transformation could be significantly enhanced for all of the tested polymers producing long (>5 μm) cylindrical micelles. The rate was inversely proportional to the sample concentration, indicating that the initially formed spherical species was not an intermediate but an off-pathway aggregate. In the presence of a good solvent, the mole fraction of the off-pathway aggregate reduced marginally and increased unimer population, which facilitated the nucleation for the thermodynamic product (cylindrical micelle). Isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed the disassembly of the initially formed micelle upon dilution, but no such effect was noticed for the cylindrical micelle in the tested concentration window, suggesting enhanced stability. Noncovalent encapsulation stability, probed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies, revealed fast chain exchange by the expulsion/insertion mechanism for the off-pathway spherical aggregate. In contrast, the average lifetime increased significantly for the cylindrical micelle with predominant splitting/merging of the micelle mechanism for chain exchange, similar to amphiphilic block copolymers, although in the present system, the hydrophobic SSDU was merely 5–8 wt %.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3acomposite polymers 3aencapsulation 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3asolvents 3atetrahydrofuran 3athermodynamics 3atitration1 aRajdev, Priya1 aPramanik, Prithankar1 aHaag, Rainer1 aGhosh, Suhrit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4199-43820 tMacromolecules.g2020 Aug. 12, v. 53, no. 16 p.7044-7052dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c014933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010000167300001600267520100700283592002801290653002701318653003101345653002401376653001501400653001301415653001201428653002201440653004001462653002701502653001501529653001301544653001201557700001601569700002201585700001401607700001601621773011801637856008601755852000901841655001201850IND60602543220221119234353.0180711e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060254322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegait, U.13aAn experimental comparison of four magnetocaloric regenerators using three different materials  ap. 147-155.  aTo optimize the performance of an active magnetic regenerative system (AMR), it is important to understand the heat transfer phenomena taking place in the regenerator and the impact of the intrinsic properties of the magnetocaloric material. With this aim in mind, four regenerators involving three different materials (Pr0.65Sr0.35MnO3, La(FeCo)13-xSix, and gadolinium) have been prepared and tested using a permanent magnet based device. This set-up allows studying the performance of different types of regenerators over a wide range of fluidic and magnetic operating conditions. However, since no thermal exchanger is used, this device provides only non-load temperature spans. First, this work deals with an analysis of the performance of the regenerators as a function of their utilization ratio (i.e. working conditions such as the mass flow rate and frequency). Then, an attempt is made to correlate the performance of each regenerator with the physical properties of these different materials.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMagnetic refrigeration 0aMagnetocaloric regenerator 0aPhysical properties 0aGadolinium 0aLaFeSiCo 0aPrSrMnO 0aFroid magnétique 0aMagnétocaloriques régénérateurs 0aPropriétés physiques 0aGadolinium 0aLaFeSiCo 0aPrSrMnO1 aGuillou, F.1 aKedous-Lebouc, A.1 aHardy, V.1 aAlmanza, M.0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Jan., v. 37 p.147-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245009200206300001600298520158200314592002801896650002001924650001501944650001601959650001301975650001501988650001902003650001102022650001202033653000802045653002102053653001902074653001202093653002002105700005802125700001902183700002102202700002602223700002502249700006202274773011102336856008202447852000902529655001202538IND60615958220221119170822.0200503e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061595822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2018.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilani, Gillian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0015-154910aRobust quantification of riverine land cover dynamics by high-resolution remote sensing  ap. 491-505.  aFloodplain areas belong to the most diverse, dynamic and complex ecological habitats of the terrestrial portion of the Earth. Spatial and temporal quantification of floodplain dynamics is needed for assessing the impacts of hydromorphological controls on river ecosystems. However, estimation of land cover dynamics in a post-classification setting is hindered by a high contribution of classification errors. A possible solution relies on the selection of specific information of the change map, instead of increasing the overall classification accuracy. In this study, we analyze the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), the associated classification processes and their respective accuracies to extract a robust estimate of floodplain dynamics. We show that an estimation of dynamics should be built on specific land cover interfaces to be robust against classification errors and should include specific features depending on the season-sensor coupling. We use five different sets of features and determine the optimal combination to use information largely based on blue and infrared bands with the support of texture and point cloud metrics at leaf-off conditions. In this post-classification setting, the best observation of dynamics can be achieved by focusing on the gravel-water interface. The semi-supervised approach generated error of 10% of observed changes along highly dynamic reaches using these two land cover classes. The results show that a robust quantification of floodplain land cover dynamics can be achieved by high-resolution remote sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3atexture 0aUAS 0aMachine learning 0aClassification 0aChanges 0aHydromorphology1 aVolpi, Michele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2771-07501 aTonolla, Diego1 aDoering, Michael1 aRobinson, Christopher1 aKneubühler, Mathias1 aSchaepman, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9627-95650 tRemote sensing of environment.g2018 Nov., v. 217 p.491-505dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007100169300001400240520151000254592002801764650002401792650001501816650002401831650001801855650002001873650001501893650001001908650001301918650001101931651001101942773011801953856008102071852000902152655001202161IND60643159120221119132135.0190509e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064315912DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293190100222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerasimova, M.

To reach harmonization of abundant information and maintenance of the system’s principles and structure is now the main problem. Starting from 2004–2006, many proposals have been forwarded; they concern mostly the introduction of new diagnostic horizons and genetic features and, hence, new soil types and subtypes, respectively, for tundra and taiga regions; gaps and mistakes in the system have been revealed. A considerable portion of new data serves as a basis for discussion and introduction of new genetic features providing most complete and adequate soil names in terms of taxonomy, as well as for improving the definitions of diagnostic horizons and genetic features. Moreover, to the definitions of horizons, the relationships with other diagnostic horizons having similar properties should be added, as well as some particular landscape characteristics. As for genetic features—qualifiers for subtypes—there are doubts, whether some of them should be transferred to a lower taxonomic level—that of genus, which seems underestimated in the current system. Identifying and classifying soils encounter some problems because of traditional standards for field description of soil profiles, which are insufficiently oriented on soil properties required for recognizing diagnostic horizons and genetic features.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic horizons 3alandscapes 3asoil classification 3asoil profiles 3asoil properties 3asoil types 3ataiga 3ataxonomy 3atundra 3aRussia0 tEurasian soil science.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.25-33dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl3978911x1064-22937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10642293190100223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245008400177500001900261520162900280592002801909650002101937650002401958650001001982650001901992650001602011650001902027650001702046650001602063650001902079650001702098650001902115650002202134650002802156650001302184650001902197650001702216653002502233653002602258653002902284653001002313653002202323700002502345700002502370700001902395700001902414773012402433856008902557852000902646655001202655IND60704595520221119235058.0200824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070459552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1119632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Patricia,10aABCG2 influence on the efficiency of photodynamic therapy in glioblastoma cells  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhotodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA PDT) is a promising novel therapeutic approach in the therapy of malignant brain tumors. 5-ALA occurs as a natural precursor of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a tumor-selective photosensitizer. The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 plays a physiologically significant role in porphyrin efflux from living cells. ABCG2 is also associated with stemness properties. Here we investigate the role of ABCG2 on the susceptibility of glioblastoma cells to 5-ALA PDT.Accumulation of PpIX in doxycycline-inducible U251MG glioblastoma cells with or without induction of ABCG2 expression or ABCG2 inhibition by KO143 was analyzed using flow cytometry. In U251MG cells, ABCG2 was inducible by doxycycline after stable transfection with a tet-on expression plasmid. U251MG cells with high expression of ABCG2 were enriched and used for further experiments (sU251MG-V). PDT was performed on monolayer cell cultures by irradiation with laser light at 635 nm.Elevated levels of ABCG2 in doxycycline induced sU251MG-V cells led to a diminished accumulation of PpIX and higher light doses were needed to reduce cell viability. By inhibiting the ABCG2 transporter with the efficient and non-toxic ABCG2 inhibitor KO143, PpIX accumulation and PDT efficiency could be strongly enhanced.Glioblastoma cells with high ABCG2 expression accumulate less photosensitizer and require higher light doses to be eliminated. Inhibition of ABCG2 during photosensitizer accumulation and irradiation promises to restore full susceptibility of this crucial tumor cell population to photodynamic treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aaminolevulinic acid 3abrain 3acell viability 3adoxycycline 3aflow cytometry 3aglioblastoma 3airradiation 3aneoplasm cells 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aplasmids 3aprotoporphyrin 3atransfection 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0a5-aminolevulinic acid 0aProtoporphyrin IX (PpIX) 0aABCG2 0aCancer stem cells1 aAbdel Gaber, Sara A.1 aZimmermann, Wolfgang1 aWittig, Rainer1 aStepp, Herbert0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2020 Sept., v. 210 p.111963-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1119633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012600164300001800290520116100308592002801469650000801497650002001505650001201525650001401537650001101551650001401562650002501576651001001601653001601611653001401627653002401641700001501665700001501680773009601695856008101791852000901872655001201881IND60724942220221117231256.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Yingjuan10aMethylation data from Pseudotaxus chienii obtained using methylation-dependent restriction-site associated DNA sequencing  ap. 1556-1559.  aPseudotaxus chienii is an endangered coniferous plant that is endemic to China. Because P. chienii is sessile and has a long life cycle, its options for responding to drastic or rapid changes in climate are limited. To survive locally, P. chienii must be able to adapt, and the species shows variations in leaf size along an environmental gradient from east to west. It is important to determine whether this phenotypic variation is driven by DNA methylation. Therefore, we performed a preliminarily survey using methylation-dependent restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (MethylRAD) to investigate the methylation status of three P. chienii individuals from heterogeneous ecological niches. In total, 372,611 CCGG tags and 726,332 CCHGG tags were obtained. The rate of high quality methylation tags for a specific site in the genome varied from 42.31% (Gxdms3-4) to 50.01% (Jxbj3-4) and 50.18% (Zjdxg3-6). The level of CCHGG methylation (16.63%) was higher than that of CCGG (13.60%), which may be why P. chienii has low levels of phenotypic variation. The methylation data can be accessed using the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (SRP128155).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aclimate 3adatabases 3agenome 3aleaf area 3aphenotypic variation 3aChina 0aMethylation 0aMethylRAD 0aPseudotaxus chienii1 aWang, Zhen1 aWang, Ting0 tData in Brief.g2018 Aug., v. 19 p.1556-1559dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04241naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245015400201300001600355520246800371592002802839650001302867650001502880650002002895650001702915650002802932650002402960650002102984650001103005650001503016650001703031650001503048650001903063650002503082650001603107650001303123651001003136653001003146653001403156653003503170653002303205653002703228653002003255653001603275653002103291700001803312700001403330700001503344700001303359700001803372700001803390700001203408700001703420773011103437856008203548852000903630655001203639IND60615958320221119171155.0200503e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061595832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2018.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lianfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9382-863710aEstimation of PM2.5 concentrations at a high spatiotemporal resolution using constrained mixed-effect bagging models with MAIAC aerosol optical depth  ap. 573-586.  aExposure estimation of fine particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅) at high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial to epidemiological studies that examine acute or sub-chronic health outcomes of PM₂.₅. However, exposure assessment of PM₂.₅ has been negatively affected by sparsely distributed monitoring stations. In addition, several limitations exist among the existing methods for high spatiotemporal resolution PM₂.₅ estimation, including ignorance or limited use of spatial autocorrelation, single-model methods, and use of aerosol optical depth data with non-random missingness. These limitations probably introduce bias or high uncertainty in model estimation. In this paper, we proposed an approach of constrained mixed-effect bagging models to leverage advanced algorithm of the high-resolution AOD retrieved by Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), with other spatiotemporal predictors and spatial autocorrelation to reliably estimate PM₂.₅ at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Our base model was a daily mixed-effect spatial model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation using embedded structured and unstructured spatial random effects. Point estimates from the base models were then averaged based on the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to reduce variance in prediction. Then, constrained optimization was developed to minimize the impact of missing AOD and to capture a full time-series of PM₂.₅ concentration. Our daily-level bagging allowed AOD-PM₂.₅ association and spatial autocorrelation to vary daily, which substantially improved the model performance. As a case study of daily PM₂.₅ predictions in 2014 in Shandong Province, China, our approach achieved R² of 0.87 (RMSE: 18.6 μg/m³) in cross validation, and R² of 0.75 (RMSE: 20.6 μg/m³) in an independent test, similar to or better than most existing methods. We further extended the 2014 models to simulate 2014–2016 full time-series of biweekly average PM₂.₅ concentrations with no use of covariates in 2015–2016 but constrained optimization over 2014 daily point estimates; the results showed well-captured temporal trend with a total correlation of 0.81 between the simulated and observed values from 2015 to 2016. Our approach can be applied for other regions for exposure estimation of PM₂.₅ when measurements alone are not able to capture the desirable spatial and temporal resolutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3aautocorrelation 3acase studies 3aepidemiological studies 3aexposure assessment 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3avariance 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aMAIAC AOD 0aHigh spatiotemporal resolution 0aTemporal variation 0aAOD-PM2.5 associations 0aSpatial effects 0aMissingness 0aMachine learning1 aZhang, Jiehao1 aMeng, Xia1 aFang, Ying1 aGe, Yong1 aWang, Jinfeng1 aWang, Chengyi1 aWu, Jun1 aKan, Haidong0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2018 Nov., v. 217 p.573-586dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245017500162300001800337520082300355592002801178650001401206650002401220650001201244650002101256650001101277650001401288650001901302650001301321650001701334653001901351653001501370653001101385653001401396653001601410700002601426700001801452700001301470700002201483700002001505700001901525773015301544856007701697852000901774655001201783IND60522223720221119112412.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052222372DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-12022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozana, Vasile10aDinuclear Nickel(II) and Palladium(II) Complexes in Combination with Different Co-Catalysts as Highly Active Catalysts for the Vinyl/Addition Polymerization of Norbornene  ap. 1152-1164.  aDinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes with Schiff-base ligands (derived form salicylaldehyde condensed with 2-amino-1-alcohols or from 2-hydroxy-5-methylisophthaldialdehyde and pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde condensed with semicarbazide, thiosemicarbazide, carbonodihydrazide, or thiocarbonodihydrazide) can be activated with the co-catalysts methylalumoxane (MAO) or tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane/triethylaluminium, B(C₆F₅)₃/AlEt₃ for the vinyl/addition polymerization of norbornene to reach activities of up to 2.4 · 107 gₚₒₗyₘₑᵣ/mol(metal)·h (molar ratios metal:AlMAO = 1:100, metal:borane:AlEt₃ = 1:9:10).

From RSET to RiSET  aA few modelling approaches are available to assess the egress of people who need assistance to evacuate, since both physical and cognitive aspects should be considered. In this study, an agent-based approach has been adopted with a focus on the behavioural rules assigned to the agents depending on their characteristics and goals. In emergency, while the majority of the occupants recognise the risk and start their evacuation autonomously, the people who need assistance do not necessarily act in that way. Trained and skilled staff are required to contact and assist those needing help that could otherwise remain inside. In this study, “meta-communication” defines the different ways that “link” the rescuers and the people who need assistance during the evacuation. A unified framework is proposed to establish a standard codification of the occupant profiles, both autonomous and those who need assistance, in order to evaluate their evacuation capabilities for use in agent-based models. Based on their mobility and way-finding abilities, occupants are classified into a basic set of five categories. For each occupant category, the mobility device and the staff assistance eventually required are specified. This codification may originate a variety of design occupant profiles which are applied to specific groups of building occupants. Apart from occupant characteristics, it is necessary to define the service discipline, consisting of three components: the staffskills and consistency, the scheduling policy, and the mobility device eventually required to relocate the assisted occupant. The movement of people as groups should also be considered to establish a link between the occupants, including those who need assistance. The inclusive approach proposed in this study has been implemented using Pathfinder software and applied to the analysis of the assisted horizontal evacuation scenario of a hospital ward. The stochastics variables representing the occupant characteristics and the service discipline have been described by probability distributions, including both autonomous and assisted profiles. The Monte Carlo methods provide the means to address the parameter uncertainty in probabilistic risk analysis. The general relationship between the number of iterations executed and the accuracy of the results of interest (mean, variance, proportion of population of the output stochastic variable of interest) is discussed. Based on the Central Limit Theorem, a general a priori estimate of the number of trials required for a specified accuracy in the evacuation time modelling is obtained and a predictor-corrector scheme for conducting and terminating a single loop Monte Carlo evacuation modelling analysis is proposed and applied to the worked case. Model validation is then required to establish whether the results of the simulations are accurate and correctly predict the relevant evacuation scenario. The principles of performance-based inclusive design are thus established, introducing the occupants who need assistance, the assisting staff role, and the service discipline, in a generalization of the conventional Required Safe Escape Time (RSET): the Required Safe and inclusive Escape Time (RiSET).  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3acomputer software 3afire safety 3ahospitals 3aissues and policy 3amodel validation 3aparameter uncertainty 3apeople 3aprobabilistic risk assessment 3arisk 3avariance 0aPeople with disabilities 0aMobility impairment 0aHorizontal assisted evacuation 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aHuman behaviour 0aEvacuation modelling 0aInclusive design 0aConvergence criteria0 tFire safety journal.g2022 Jan., v. 127 p.103510-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2021.1035103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009200173300001600265520159900281592002801880650001101908650001001919650001101929650001901940650001001959650002001969653001001989653001201999653002002011653002402031700005902055773010702114856008702221852000902308655001202317IND60752534820221121020051.0220404e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075253482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.09.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalfacree, Keith10aAdvancing rural as ‘something more than a human estate’: Exploring UK sheep-shaping  ap. 375-385.  aPeriodically, the topic of defining rural is addressed within rural social science scholarship but done so in overwhelmingly human terms. This paper engages with this observation, arguing the simple but axiomatic point that the rural is not solely a human taxonomic creation but expresses a space that integrally and intimately involves the more-than-human. Consequently, the latter should be strongly, firmly and richly represented up-front within the defining rural debate. Adopting an established if, to date, still anthropocentricised three-fold model of rural space, the paper argues that each dimension – localities, representations, lives – feature the more-than-human in both passive and active ways. Overall, bringing more-than-human perspectives much further to the fore consolidates the idea of rural as inherently co-produced, a ‘baroque assemblage’ containing many more-than-human living things. Accounts of animals within such a rural must recognise their emplacing from a diversity of foci, interests and consequences. The paper begins to introduce details of this diverse co-production with respect to one ubiquitous rural animal, the sheep. It illustrates the ‘ensheeping’ of rural localities, representations and lives, with the practical significance of this brought together and drawn out through two rival accounts of sheep within the Lake District National Park. Finally, the seemingly modest call for rural studies to embrace animals more fully is argued to be enhanced today by ongoing and potentially imminent experiences impacting strongly on rural places.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3alakes 3amodels 3anational parks 3asheep 3asocial sciences 0aRural 0aAnimals 0aMore-than-human 0aProduction of space1 aWilliams, Fiona1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7381-43500 tJournal of rural studies.g2021 Oct., v. 87 p.375-385dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134024004400171040001800215100006800233245007900301300001300380506002800393506003600421506007600457506003100533520075100564592002801315596004501343506003701388650001301425650001701438650001801455650001001473650002801483650001701511650001101528650001801539650001201557653001801569653001801587653003101605653002101636653002701657773012301684856008401807903002401891852000901915655001201924IND60611899620221207060104.0180904e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061189962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2016.12.0022chorus7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2016.12.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2016.12.0022chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClements, David Julian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9016-129114aThe future of food colloids: Next-generation nanoparticle delivery systems  ap. 7-14.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe area of food colloids is rapidly evolving.

Different approaches to monitor phenology at different spatial scales, from in situ monitoring to remote sensing, are used to investigate spring and/or autumn phenological changes. In Mediterranean area, most of phenological changes occur during cloudy periods (spring and autumn), leading to a loss of information also for very high temporal resolution satellites. Instead, cloud-uninfluenced sensors, such as radar sensors, can allow to bypass this problem and produce a temporally continuous coverage.In this paper, we analyzed the spring phenology of two European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) populations, located at different latitudes in Mediterranean area. Weekly in situ monitoring of leaf-out has been correlated with data collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar. Spring phenological phases were monitored in situ following a modified BBCH-code with a 5-scores scale (from 1 - buds closed and covered by scales, to 5 - leaf completely unfolded). The score 3 (young leaves starting to emerge from the bud) was considered the bud break. Different site conditions based on aspect (northern and southern) and altitudinal gradient (high and low altitude) have been considered. The aim was to test and implement a new methodology able to decrease the frequency of the field sampling, using remote data, to extend more detailed information on geographical scale, and to reconstruct past phenology.Results showed a statistically significant different length of the vegetative spring period, spanning from dormant buds, up to leaves completely unfolded, between sites. Through Synthetic Aperture Radar estimation, this study demonstrates that leaf-out can be monitored with an extreme accuracy. The phenophase score 4 and 5 estimation showed the best performance (RMSE < of 4 days), phenophases score 2 and 3 showed promising performances (4 days < RMSE <5 days), while phenophases score 1 seems to be not easily detectable, although it can be extrapolated with an RMSE <6 days.This radar approach fixes the cloud problem typical of multispectral approach and very frequent in phenophase change periods in Mediterranean climate. This study promotes the proposed remote sensing approach as a very useful tool to monitor growing season starting in remote areas, helping to reduce in situ observations and allowing past phenology reconstruction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aMediterranean climate 3aaltitude 3aautumn 3abudbreak 3aclimate change 3aleaves 3aphenology 3aspring 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atrees 3aMediterranean region 0aLeaf phenology 0aSAR 0aSentinel-1 0aBBCH 0aFagus sylvatica1 aAntonucci, Serena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2237-20271 aMonteverdi, Maria Cristina1 aGarfì, Vittorio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6980-29201 aMarchetti, Marco1 aPlutino, Manuela1 aDi Carlo, Marco1 aGermani, Andrea1 aSantopuoli, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5373-59701 aCastaldi, Cristiano1 aChiavetta, Ugo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8404-79270 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Oct., v. 248 p.111978-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1119783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01294naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012900164300001800293520041200311592002800723650001100751650001400762650001500776700002000791700001900811773009600830856008100926852000901007655001201016IND60724942620221117231245.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKgoete, F.M.10aData on the influence of TiN on wear and corrosion behavior of Ti–6Al–4V alloy fabricated through spark plasma sintering  ap. 1989-1996.  aData about bulk properties of Ti–6Al–4V based composites specimen achieved by powder metallurgy route using spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique is presented, with focus on the effect of TiN particles on wear and corrosion behavior of the resultant composites.

Through in situ electrochemical diagnosis, we found that the accelerated decline of fuel cell could not be directly predicted by the crossover current or the electrochemically active surface area. Surface analysis of catalyst layer showed that the inverse flow of the cathode and anode may lead to dry-wet cyclic stress and corrosion of the catalyst layer in the cathode inlet area (anode outlet area). This leads to cracking in the catalyst layer and corrosion of the carbon support. What’s more, the uncorroded electrolyte will then fill in the original microporous structure, resulting in a decrease in the porosity of the catalyst layer and a corresponding accelerated decline its mass-transfer performance. According to a semi-quantitative model, a 50% corrosion of the catalyst layer leads to a decrease of up to 80% in the equivalent diffusion coefficient, the key mechanism inducing the local performance decline, which leads to accelerated decline of the overall fuel cell performance. This is particularly important for vehicle fuel cells where the local deterioration caused by the uneven distribution of hydrothermal states induces accelerated decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acorrosion 3acracking 3adecline 3adeterioration 3adiffusivity 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy conversion 3aflow 3afuel cells 3alead 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asurface area 0aFuel cell 0aUniformity 0aConsistency 0aCatalyst layer degradation 0aModeling1 aXu, Liangfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3585-28631 aLi, Jianqiu1 aWang, Qing1 aShao, Yangbin1 aChen, Xiaojing1 aDai, Wei1 aOuyang, Minggao0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 227 p.113568-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1135683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245005600173300001800229520147600247592002801723596004501751596004501796596004501841596006801886596006201954596004902016650001202065650001102077650001202088650001902100650001102119650001802130650001602148650002102164650001102185650001902196650001502215650001602230651001502246651001802261700002002279773012602299856008102425852000902506655001202515IND60614138620221120175246.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061413862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-4047-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLybarger, Nicholas D.14aThe effect of the MJO on the energetics of El Niño  ap. 2825-2839.  aThe energy budget of the Pacific Ocean is evaluated in the Super-Parameterized Community Climate Model version 4 (SP-CCSM4) on intraseasonal time scales. The budget terms are decomposed to isolate the MJO influence and the ocean current associated with Kelvin waves. Using this decomposition, one can distinguish between El Niño events with strong and weak MJO influence. Composites of El Niño events based on the wind power component associated with the MJO induced wind stress and oceanic Kelvin waves ([Formula: see text]) are compared with composites based only on the atmospheric variability and based only on the oceanic variability. It was found that the composite of events when [Formula: see text] is near maximum (+ NMJO,K) shows a greater magnitude of mean perturbation wind power, buoyancy power, and available potential energy than any other case, which is consistent with the greater amplitude Kelvin wave perturbations on the thermocline, as well as the greater amplitude of SST anomalies at the peak of the event. For + NMJO,K, latent heat flux anomalies out of the ocean along the coast of New Guinea are seen coincident with deepening of the mixed layer depth there, suggesting that this is an important region for the thermodynamic influence of the MJO on the ocean. Latent heat flux anomalies into the ocean are seen across the ITCZ in the spring, suggesting a basin wide influence by the MJO on the ocean surface radiation budget in + NMJO,K.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGS-1338427cNational Science Foundation  aAGS-1211848cNational Science Foundation  aOCI-1053575cNational Science Foundation  aNA14OAR4310160cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  aNNX14AM19GcNational Aeronautics and Space Administration  aDE-AC02-05CH11231cU.S. Department of Energy 3aEl Nino 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acoasts 3aheat transfer 3alatent heat 3apotential energy 3aspring 3awater currents 3awind power 3awind stress 3aNew Guinea 3aPacific Ocean1 aStan, Cristiana0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Oct., v. 51, no. 7-8 p.2825-2839dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-4047-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245012700159300001800286520086600304592002801170650002601198650001101224650001301235650001701248650001301265650001901278650002101297650001701318650000901335650001201344650002101356650000901377650001301386653001701399653001901416653001701435700001901452773015301471856007701624852000901701655001201710IND60522224120221119112228.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052222412DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-12062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKranz, Olaf10aElectroreduction of Organic Compounds, 34 [1].

Preparative electrolyses are run in various solventsupporting electrolytes under potentiostatic and galvanostatic conditions at lead or carbon cathodes. A partial and mostly regioselective hydrodechlorination of compounds with two or more chloro substituents is possible under suitable conditions. The replacement of one single chloro substituent, in particular in a para-position, is difficult. Highly toxic and persistent oligochloro derivatives are thus transformed into less problematic compounds with a low degree of chlorination. The chlorine content of real-life materials such as extracts of soil contaminated with chlorinated phenols and Nitrofen® can also be significantly decreased by electroreduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acarbon 3acathodes 3achlorination 3achlorine 3adechlorination 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3alead 3aphenols 3aregioselectivity 3asoil 3atoxicity 0aElectrolysis 0aDehalogenation 0aChloroarenes1 aVoss, Jürgen,0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 58, no. 12 p.1187-1200dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2003-12063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245013400205300001600339520185100355592002802206650002202234650001402256650001902270650001502289650001902304650002002323650001202343651001002355653002702365653002502392653001802417653001902435653002102454700001602475700005602491773010702547856008702654852000902741655001202750IND60752535020221122044415.0220404e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075253502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1929-668710aCurbing overstocking on rangeland through subsidies, rewards, and herders’ social capital: Lessons from Qinghai province, China  ap. 361-374.  aRestoring rangeland ecology, a goal set by the Rangeland Ecological Protection Subsidy and Reward (REPSR) scheme of China, depends on how effectively livestock overload can be curbed. Besides subsidies and rewards, herders' individual social capital also bears an important weight on their willingness to lower stocking rate. Social network offers an invisible conduit for herders to build up social capital, thus quantifying social capital through social network analysis is more straightforward than simply using proxy indicators, an approach commonly adopted so far. Based on a questionnaire survey on 288 households in Qinghai province, the effects of social capital and the REPSR compensation on stocking rate are empirically examined, replacing the traditional proxies of social capital with herders' ability to obtain information and resources as well as the restrictions imposed by social norms from social networks. Social capital is found to have a statistically significant impact on stocking rate, but tradeoffs exist among various network pathways. Herders’ acquisition of policy information and stall-feeding skills through social networks contributes to lower stocking rate, but acquisition of grazing experience, funds and machinery service exerts counteracting effects. A U-shaped relationship occurs between stocking rate and compensation amount offered by the REPSR: with the increase of compensation amount, herders lower stocking rate first and then increase it. To improve the effectiveness of the REPSR scheme, a refinement on the compensation scheme tailored to differential scales of household rangeland operation is the key, meanwhile weaving and harnessing social network to improve policy publicity and enforcement as well as knowledge sharing and production cooperation between herdsmen also deserve more attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3aquestionnaires 3arangelands 3asocial capital 3asocial networks 3asurveys 3aChina 0aRangeland conservation 0aLivestock production 0aStocking rate 0aSocial network 0aQinghai province1 aShao, Liqun1 aChen, Haibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4291-79790 tJournal of rural studies.g2021 Oct., v. 87 p.361-374dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009800167300001600265520160400281592002801885650003201913650001701945650001801962650002101980650001302001650002402014650002902038650002802067650001402095650002802109650000902137650001002146650001002156650001002166650001102176650001402187650003002201650001802231650004502249650001802294650002202312650001002334650001902344650002402363650001002387653001502397653001202412653001402424653001002438700001902448700002902467700002202496700001602518700001702534773011502551856008502666852000902751655001202760IND60527890920221119224033.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052789092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzmi, Kifaya10aMolecular detection of Theileria, Babesia, and Hepatozoon spp. in ixodid ticks from Palestine  ap. 734-741.  aIxodid ticks transmit various infectious agents that cause disease in humans and livestock worldwide. A cross-sectional survey on the presence of protozoan pathogens in ticks was carried out to assess the impact of tick-borne protozoa on domestic animals in Palestine. Ticks were collected from herds with sheep, goats and dogs in different geographic districts and their species were determined using morphological keys. The presence of piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. was determined by PCR amplification of a 460–540bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene followed by RFLP or DNA sequencing. A PCR-RFLP method based on the 18S rRNA was used in order to detect and to identify Hepatozoon, Babesia and Theileria spp. A total of 516 ticks were collected from animals in six Palestinian localities. Five tick species were found: Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Rhipicephalus bursa, Haemaphysalis parva and Haemaphysalis adleri. PCR-based analyses of the ticks revealed Theileria ovis (5.4%), Hepatozoon canis (4.3%), Babesia ovis (0.6%), and Babesia vogeli (0.4%). Theileria ovis was significantly associated with ticks from sheep and with R. turanicus ticks (p<0.01). H. canis was detected only in R. sanguineus s.l. and was significantly associated with ticks from dogs (p<0.01).To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the presence of these pathogens in ticks collected from Palestine. Communicating these findings with health and veterinary professionals will increase their awareness, and contribute to improved diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aBabesia ovis 3aHaemaphysalis 3aHepatozoon canis 3aProtozoa 3aRhipicephalus bursa 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aRhipicephalus turanicus 3aTheileria 3across-sectional studies 3adogs 3agenes 3agoats 3aherds 3ahumans 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprofessionals 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3ataxonomic keys 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 0aHepatozoon 0aBabesia 0aTheileria 0aTicks1 aEreqat, Suheir1 aNasereddin, Abedelmajeed1 aAl-Jawabreh, Amer1 aBaneth, Gad1 aAbdeen, Ziad0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2016 July, v. 7, no. 5 p.734-741dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010500176300001800281500001900299520133400318536017601652592002801828596000801856650001201864650002001876650001501896650002301911650001901934650001801953650001401971650001801985653001402003653003202017653002702049773014002076856008502216852000902301655001202310IND60701673920221122014020.0200713e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070167392DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17544972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharaf El Din, Essam12aA novel approach for surface water quality modelling based on Landsat-8 tasselled cap transformation  ap. 7186-7201.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUpdating the physicochemical properties of surface water is important to water quality researchers and decision-makers. Routine surface water quality monitoring methods are inadequate; whereas, remote sensing (RS) is a source of processing data in both spatial and temporal domains. However, RS is a good tool of monitoring freshwater ecosystems, accurate modelling of surface water quality parameters from satellite imagery is still a challenging task. High correlation between the adjacent satellite signals, which creates redundancy, is one of the main challenges that negatively affect the stability of the developed models. Therefore, this paper focuses on the development of a novel approach for modelling concentrations of both turbidity (T) and total suspended solids (TSS) using Landsat-8 tasselled cap transformation (TCT). As a result, robust models were developed between measurements from satellite-derived T and TSS and in situ measurements with coefficient of determination values of 0.854 and 0.812, respectively. These findings confirmed the possibility of using TCT to establish strong models for assessing surface water quality due to its capability of transforming a set of correlated data onto a convenient set of uncorrelated data, which maintain the major information associated with a physical phenomenon.  aThis research work is supported by the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education, represented by Public Works Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Tanta University.  aPublisher supplied data  aN/A 3aLandsat 3adecision making 3afreshwater 3aphysical phenomena 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3aturbidity 3awater quality 0aLandsat-8 0atasseled cap transformation 0atotal suspended solids0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 41, no. 18 p.7186-7201dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2020.17544973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245006100206300001800267520148000285592002801765596004501793596004501838596004501883650003001928650001401958650001901972650001501991650001102006650002302017650003002040650001202070650001102082651001702093651001802110773012602128856008102254852000902335655001202344IND60614138920221120175159.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061413892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-4058-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStan, Cristiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0076-057414aThe role of SST variability in the simulation of the MJO  ap. 2943-2964.  aThe sensitivity of the Madden-Julian Oscillation to high-frequency variability (period 1–5 days) of sea surface temperature (SST) is investigated using numerical experiments with the super-parameterized Community Climate System Model. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of air–sea interactions in the simulation of the MJO, and stress the necessity of an accurate representation of ocean variability on short time scales. Eliminating 1–5-day variability of surface boundary forcing reduces the intraseasonal variability (ISV) of the tropics during the boreal winter. The ISV spectrum becomes close to the red noise background spectrum. The variability of atmospheric circulation shifts to longer time scales. In the absence of high-frequency variability of SST the MJO power gets confined to wavenumbers 1–2 and the magnitude of westward power associated with Rossby waves increases. The MJO convective activity propagating eastward from the Indian Ocean does not cross the Maritime Continent, and convection in the western Pacific Ocean is locally generated. In the Indian Ocean convection tends to follow the meridional propagation of SST anomalies. The response of the MJO to 1–5-day variability in the SST is through the charging and discharging mechanisms contributing to the atmospheric column moist static energy before and after peak MJO convection. Horizontal advection and surface fluxes show the largest sensitivity to SST perturbations.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGS-1119999cDirectorate for Geosciences  aAGS-1211848cDirectorate for Geosciences  aATM-0425247cNational Science Foundation 3aMadden-Julian Oscillation 3aadvection 3aclimate models 3aconvection 3aenergy 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water temperature 3atropics 3awinter 3aIndian Ocean 3aPacific Ocean0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Oct., v. 51, no. 7-8 p.2943-2964dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-4058-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01399naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001200143245007800155300001800233520022300251592002800474650002400502650000900526650001400535650001700549650001000566653002400576653002200600653001700622653002400639700001400663700001600677700001600693700001900709700001700728700001700745773015300762856007700915852000900992655001201001IND60522224520221119112239.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052222452DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-12102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jun10aXyloccensin M and N, Two New B, D-seco Limonoids from Xylocarpus granatum  ap. 1216-1219.  aTwo new mexicanolide-type B, D-seco limonoids named xyloccensin M(1) and N (2) were isolated from the stem bark of Xylocarpus granatum.

For this study, we hypothesised that an organic form of selenium and/or a herbal additive (oregano, Origanum vulgare L.) may improve performance of laying hens. Aims The study was designed to determine the effects of selenium source (SS, sodium selenite; or selenium yeast, SY), oregano essential oil (OEO) and a combination of Se and OEO on performance, egg quality and blood parameters of laying hens. Methods In total, 216 Lohmann LSL-Lite laying hens, 66 weeks of age, were assigned to feed on one of six diets: control group, receiving basal diet (BD); BD + 0.3 mg SS/kg; BD + 0.3 mg SY/kg; BD + 250 mg OEO/kg; BD + 250 mg OEO + 0.3 mg SS/kg; BD + 250 mg OEO + 0.3 mg SY/kg. For each treatment, there were six replicates of six hens each for 12 weeks. Key results Feed conversion ratio was higher (P < 0.05) with the OEO diet than in the control. The SY diet decreased egg production and the OEO diet decreased egg mass (P < 0.05), although this effect was reversed with the SY + OEO diet. This would illustrate a synergistic effect of OEO with SY. Highest and lowest yolk colour values were found with the SY and SS diets, respectively (P < 0.05). Serum uric acid was lower with diets containing Se than the control diet (P < 0.05). Glutathione peroxidase activity was highest with SY and SY + OEO diets and lowest with the OEO diet (P < 0.05). Birds fed the SS + OEO diet showed the highest total antioxidant capacity and those fed SY showed the lowest total antioxidant capacity (P < 0.05). Conclusions Based on the results of the current study, it can be concluded that SY diet have increasing effect on egg weight in laying hens. In addition, novel synergistic effects between OEO and SY diets on improving egg production, egg mass and feed conversion ratio have been found. In terms of oxidative status, the detected synergistic effects between OEO and SS diets on total antioxidant capacity and between OEO and SY diets on glutathione peroxidase (GPx) have not been reported before, that appreciate more clarifying investigations in future. Although, dietary supplemental SY individually and also with OEO increased GPx, adding SS to diet together with OEO showed more improving effect on GPx compared to the separate usage. Implications Dietary supplemental SY can improve egg weight in laying hens. In addition, adding SY to diet of laying hens individually and with OEO have beneficial effects on oxidative status of bird in terms of GPs activity, which in turn can ameliorate the unfavourable impressions of probable environmentally oxidative stress on productive performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriganum vulgare 3aadditives 3aanimal products 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood composition 3ablood serum 3acolor 3adiet 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahen feeding 3alaying hens 3aoregano 3aoregano oil 3aoxidative stress 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3asynergism 3auric acid 3ayeasts 0aalbumin 0acholesterol 0aegg traits 0aglucose 0aphytogenic 0atriglycerides1 aTorki, M.1 aMohammadi, H.0 tAnimal production science.g2020, v. 60, no. 13 p.1620-1629dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN193193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007700165300001600242520167200258592002801930650001301958650002401971650001401995650002002009650001902029650001102048650001902059700002402078700002102102700003002123773009002153856007802243852000902321655001202330IND60515900520221118061435.0160321e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051590052DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2015004242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaslavska, Jitka10aValidation of CE modeling with a contactless conductivity array detector  ap. 699-710.  aDynamic computer simulation data are compared for the first time with CE data obtained with a laboratory made system comprising an array of 8 contactless conductivity detectors (C⁴Ds). The experimental setup featured a 50 μm id linear polyacrylamide (LPA) coated fused‐silica capillary of 70 cm length and a purpose built sequential injection analysis manifold for fluid handling of continuous or discontinuous buffer configurations and sample injection. The LPA coated capillary exhibits a low EOF and the manifold allows the placement of the first detector at about 2.7 cm from the sample inlet. Agreement of simulated electropherograms with experimental data was obtained for the migration and separation of cationic and anionic analyte and system zones in CZE configurations in which EOF and other column properties are constant. For configurations with discontinuous buffer systems, including ITP, experimental data obtained with the array detector revealed that the EOF is not constant. Comparison of simulation and experimental data of ITP systems provided the insight that the EOF can be estimated with an ionic strength dependent model similar to that previously used to describe EOF in fused‐silica capillaries dynamically double coated with Polybrene and poly(vinylsulfonate). For the LPA coated capillaries, the electroosmotic mobility was determined to be 17‐fold smaller compared to the case with the charged double coating. Simulation and array detection provide means for quickly investigating electrophoretic transport and separation properties. Without realistic input parameters, modeling alone is not providing data that match CE results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acomputer simulation 3adetectors 3aelectrophoresis 3aionic strength 3amodels 3apolyacrylamide1 aKoenka, Israel Joel1 aHauser, Peter C.1 aThormann, W.q(Wolfgang),0 tElectrophoresis.g2016 Mar., v. 37, no. 5-6 p.699-710dVerlag Chemiex0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2015004243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008500209300001600294520156600310592002801876596010201904596009802006650002102104650000902125650001802134650001602152650001902168650001302187650000902200650001202209650001302221650001902234650001502253650002302268650001502291650001902306650001802325650001802343650002702361650002002388650002502408700002802433773010602461856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60643160020221119133635.0190509e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064316002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-019-09573-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavoisier, Anaïs1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8987-380910aEffect of a Whey Protein Network Formed by Cold Gelation on Starch Digestibility  ap. 214-224.  aComposite gels of whey protein isolate (WPI) and potato starch (PS) were formed by calcium chloride induced cold gelation to obtain microstructures where native starch granules were encased in the WPI network. Gels were then subjected to heat treatment and PS gelatinized inside the protein network. In vitro starch digestibility was investigated using the INFOGEST protocol to explore if the protein gel was able to protect gelatinized starch granules from enzymatic attack during digestion. This study was focused on the impact of gel particle size and protein concentration on glucose release from the matrix. Mechanical and rheological properties of the composite gels were also evaluated after heat treatment. Glucose release from the matrix was reduced until the intestinal step of the simulated digestion when gels were ground to a particle size of ~1 mm. When gels were cut to a particle size of ~5 mm glucose release was decreased until the end of the test. In this case, at the end of the digestion glucose release was reduced by 15.5 and 20.5% for composite gels with 8 and 10% WPI respectively, whereas no significant reduction was observed for the gel with 6% WPI. Therefore, the effect of the WPI network on starch digestibility depended on particle size and on protein concentration. Mechanical and rheological properties of the gels were related to starch digestibility: PS hydrolysis rate decreased with increasing hardness and elasticity of the gels. This work contributes to a better understanding of starch digestion in soft food matrices.  aPublisher supplied data  adoctoral fellowship no. 21160413cNational Commission for Science and Technology, Chile (CONICYT)  aFONDECYT Project no. 1150395cNational Commission for Science and Technology, Chile (CONICYT) 3acalcium chloride 3acold 3adigestibility 3afood matrix 3agelatinization 3agelation 3agels 3aglucose 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size 3apotato starch 3arheological properties 3astarch granules 3awhey protein isolate1 aAguilera, José Miguel,0 tFood biophysics.g2019 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.214-224dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3949866x1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-019-09573-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006700147245014500214300001600359520191700375592002802292650001002320650002002330650001302350650001802363650001102381650002302392650002302415650001902438650001102457650002202468650001702490650001202507651001602519651001002535653001502545653001002560653001802570653001602588653002102604653001702625653001602642653003702658700001902695700002002714773011402734856008202848852000902930655001202939IND60615959020221119165215.0181025e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061595902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2018.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiroumand-Jadidi, Milad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9432-303210aMultiple Optimal Depth Predictors Analysis (MODPA) for river bathymetry: Findings from spectroradiometry, simulations, and satellite imagery  ap. 132-147.  aRemote mapping of bathymetry can play a key role in gaining spatial and temporal insight into fluvial processes, ranging from hydraulics and morphodynamics to habitat conditions. This research introduces Multiple Optimal Depth Predictors Analysis (MODPA), which combines previously developed depth predictors along with additional predictors derived from the intensity component of the HSI color space transformation. MODPA empirically selects a set of optimal predictors among all candidates utilizing partial least squares (PLS), stepwise, or principal component (PC) regression models. The primary focus of this study was on shallow (<1 m deep) and clearly flowing streams where substrate variability could have a pronounced effect on depth retrieval. Spectroscopic experiments were performed under controlled conditions in a hydraulic laboratory to examine the robustness of bathymetry models with respect to changes in bottom type. Further, simulations from radiative transfer modeling were used to extend the analysis by isolating the effect of inherent optical properties (IOPs) and by investigating the performance of bathymetry models in optically complex and deeper streams. The bathymetry of the Sarca River, a shallow river in the Italian Alps, was mapped using a WorldView-2 (WV-2) image, for which we evaluated the atmospheric compensation (AComp) product. Results indicated the greater robustness of multiple-predictor models particularly MODPA rather than single-predictor models, such as Optimal Band Ratio Analysis (OBRA), with respect to heterogeneity of bottom types, IOPs, and atmospheric effects. The HSI intensity component enhanced the accuracy of depth retrieval, particularly in optically-complex waters and also for low spectral resolution imagery (e.g., GeoEye). Further, the enhanced spectral resolution of WV-2 imagery improved bathymetry retrieval compared to 4-band GeoEye data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3afluid mechanics 3ahabitats 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aoptical properties 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3astreams 3aAlps region 3aItaly 0aBathymetry 0aRiver 0aLyzenga model 0aRatio model 0aDepth predictors 0aSpectroscopy 0aWorldView-2 0aAtmospheric compensation (AComp)1 aVitti, Alfonso1 aLyzenga, D.

In this study, we developed two schemes to improve the forecasting skill of the interannual variability of the EAWM index (EAWMI) using the interannual increment prediction method, also known as the DY method. First, we found that version 2 of the NCEP’s Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) showed higher skill in predicting the EAWMI in DY form than not. So, based on the advantage of the DY method, Scheme-I was obtained by adding the EAWMI DY predicted by CFSv2 to the observed EAWMI in the previous year. This scheme showed higher forecasting skill than CFSv2. Specifically, during 1983–2016, the temporal correlation coefficient between the Scheme-I-predicted and observed EAWMI was 0.47, exceeding the 99% significance level, with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreased by 12%. The autumn Arctic sea ice and North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) are two important external forcing factors for the interannual variability of the EAWM. Therefore, a second (hybrid) prediction scheme, Scheme-II, was also developed. This scheme not only involved the EAWMI DY of CFSv2, but also the sea-ice concentration (SIC) observed the previous autumn in the Laptev and East Siberian seas and the temporal coefficients of the third mode of the North Pacific SST in DY form. We found that a negative SIC anomaly in the preceding autumn over the Laptev and the East Siberian seas could lead to a significant enhancement of the Aleutian low and East Asian westerly jet in the following winter. However, the intensity of the winter Siberian high was mainly affected by the third mode of the North Pacific autumn SST. Scheme-I and Scheme-II also showed higher predictive ability for the EAWMI in negative anomaly years compared to CFSv2. More importantly, the improvement in the prediction skill of the EAWMI by the new schemes, especially for Scheme-II, could enhance the forecasting skill of the winter 2-m air temperature (T-2m) in most parts of China, as well as the intensity of the Aleutian low and Siberian high in winter. The new schemes provide a theoretical basis for improving the prediction of winter climate in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3aclimate 3aice 3amonsoon season 3aprediction 3asurface water temperature 3awinter 3aArctic region 3aChina1 aFan, Ke1 aYang, Hongqing0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Oct., v. 51, no. 7-8 p.2793-2805dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-4045-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014500174520165300319592002801972650001702000650002002017650002002037650002902057650001802086650001102104650001702115650000902132650002202141653002102163700006002184700006102244700001902305700001902324700002002343700001902363700001702382773010302399856008602502852000902588655001202597IND60752535520221122044441.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075253552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1052152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbedi, Seyed Hasan14aThe neglected role of Blastocystis sp. and Giardia lamblia in development of irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis  aThe possible role of Blastocystis sp. and Giardia lamblia infections in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has long been controversial. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether these protozoan infections are associated with IBS development. We systematically searched international databases for all studies that reported these protozoa in IBS patients published by May 10, 2021. Studies were included in the review if they were observational studies with confirmed patients with IBS (in case-control and cross-sectional studies) or parasitic infections (cohort studies) with an appropriate control group. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis model for included studies. A total of 32 papers (42 datasets), including 29 papers (31 datasets) for Blastocystis sp./IBS and 11 papers (11 datasets) for G. lamblia/IBS met the eligibility criteria. Our results indicated that the individuals with Blastocystis sp. infection were significantly at a higher risk of IBS development (OR, 1.78; 95%CI, 1.29–2.44). Moreover, cohort studies indicated a significant positive association between G. lamblia infection and IBS risk (OR, 5.47; 95%CI, 4.23–7.08); while an increasing but no statistically significant risk was observed in case-control studies (OR, 1.19; 95%CI, 0.75–1.87). Our findings suggested that Blastocystis sp. and G. lamblia infections are associated with the increased risk of developing IBS. Despite these results, further studies are needed to determine the effect of these protozoa on IBS development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlastocystis 3aGiardia lamblia 3adata collection 3airritable bowel syndrome 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3arisk 3asystematic review 0aBlastocystis sp.1 aFazlzadeh, Aylar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2538-19731 aMollalo, Abolfazl1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5092-06981 aSartip, Behnam1 aMahjour, Sanaz1 aBahadory, Saeed1 aTaghipour, Ali1 aRostami, Ali0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Jan., v. 162 p.105215-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1052153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007100166300001600237520131100253592002801564596005601592596005901648596006901707596009101776650002001867650002301887650001901910650002101929650002101950650003301971650001702004650001202021650003702033650001402070650001002084650001702094650001602111700001202127700001702139700001302156700005202169700001402221700001502235773010602250856008202356852000902438655001202447IND60643160220221119133502.0190509e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064316022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-018-09565-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Wenjuan10aEffect of Xanthan Gum on the Freeze-Thaw Stability of Wheat Gluten  ap. 142-153.  aThe effect of xanthan gum on the freeze-thaw stability of wheat gluten was evaluated during a 60-day storage period at −18 °C with thawing every 5 days for 4 h at 25 °C. The physicochemical and rheological properties of wheat gluten-xanthan gum mixtures with multiple scales were analyzed. In the control samples (wheat gluten without xanthan gum), the molecular weight by size-exclusion chromatography-multiple angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLs), content of free SH groups measured by UV/VIS spectrophotometry, and the hole sizes in the wheat gluten network structure shown by SEM increased as the freeze-thaw storage time increased, while the surface hydrophobicity index (H₀) decreased. For the wheat gluten-xanthan gum mixtures, more disulfide bonds were preserved and numerous small pores in the wheat gluten structure were observed. Meanwhile, the sample with 0.225% xanthan gum (w/w) had the lowest content of free SH groups. The wheat gluten-xanthan gum mixtures had more α-helixes than the control samples with the same freeze-thaw storage time. Rheological analysis showed that the wheat gluten-xanthan gum mixtures had higher elasticity and viscosity than the control samples. Overall, the addition of xanthan gum improved the freeze-thaw stability of the wheat gluten network.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0400203cNational Key R & D Program of China  a31671961cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017A030311021cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  ano. 2015A030310189cStart-up Fund of natural Sciences Foundation of Guangdong Province 3adisulfide bonds 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astorage time 3athawing 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aviscosity 3awheat 3awheat gluten 3axanthan gum1 aLi, Lin1 aFan, Penghui1 aZhao, Di1 aLi, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1067-36261 aRong, Hui1 aZhang, Xia0 tFood biophysics.g2019 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.142-153dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3949866x1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-018-09565-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245008600159300001800245520125600263592002801519650002001547650001901567650002701586650001601613650001801629650000901647650001301656650001301669650002501682650001401707650002601721650000901747650001601756651001401772653002001786653001401806653001101820653001101831700002001842700001901862700002001881700001801901773011701919856007102036852000902107655001202116IND60708425020221121081148.0200825s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070842502DNAL7 a10.1071/AN196212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvin, Hannah E.10aWelfare of beef cattle in Australian feedlots: a review of the risks and measures  ap. 1569-1590.  aThe rising global demand for animal protein is leading to intensification of livestock production systems. At the same time, societal concerns about sustainability and animal welfare in intensive systems is increasing. This review examines the risks to welfare for beef cattle within commercial feedlots in Australia. Several aspects of the feedlot environment have the potential to compromise the physical and psychological welfare of cattle if not properly monitored and managed. These include, but are not limited to, animal factors such as the influence of genetics, temperament and prior health, as well as management factors such as diet, pen design, resource provision, pregnancy management, and stock-person attitudes and skills. While current industry and producer initiatives exist to address some of these issues, continuous improvements in welfare requires accurate, reliable and repeatable measures to allow quantification of current and future welfare states. Existing measures of welfare are explored as well as proxy indicators that may signal the presence of improved or reduced welfare. Finally, potential future measures of welfare that are currently under development are discussed and recommendations for future research are made.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal proteins 3aanimal welfare 3aattitudes and opinions 3abeef cattle 3abeef industry 3adiet 3afeedlots 3agenetics 3alivestock production 3apregnancy 3aproduction technology 3arisk 3atemperament 3aAustralia 0aaffective state 0abehaviour 0ahealth 0astress1 aLees, Angela M.1 aCafe, Linda M.1 aColditz, Ian G.1 aLee, Caroline0 tAnimal production science.g2020, v. 60, no. 13 p.1569-1590dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN196213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01554naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007700162300001800239520055100257592002800808650001600836650001600852650001300868650001400881653001800895653001500913653001600928700002400944700002100968773015300989856007701142852000901219655001201228IND60522224920221119112246.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052222492DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-12142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeshk, Eman M.10aSynthesis of Some New Furocoumarins and their Usage in Peptide Synthesis  ap. 1237-1241.  a1,5-Benzodiazepin-2-ones (3a - d) were obtained fromω-carbethoxy visnaginone or ω-carbethoxy khellinone and substituted 1,2-phenylenediamines.

As promising candidates, one dimensional (1D) CdS nanostructures have gained growing interest due to their unique advantages, including a narrow band gap, suitable band edge positions, high aspect ratio structure with low reflectance, and excellent electronic charge transfer. This review summarizes a panorama of the latest progress related to the design and construction of 1D CdS based photocatalysts with boosted performance, involving constructing 1D solid solution, loading cocatalysts, coupling with semiconductors, hybridizing with carbon-based materials and functionalization with biocatalysts. Finally, some challenges and opportunities for future exploration of 1D CdS based photocatalysts are critically discussed. It is anticipated that this review will afford enriched information on the rational utilization of 1D CdS materials with ameliorated performances by harnessing their inherent merits, and particularly stimulate further developments of low dimensional heterostructures towards various artificial photoredox reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3aenergy 3ananomaterials 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aredox reactions 3areflectance 3asemiconductors1 aHan, Bin1 aHan, Zhuang,1 aXu, Yi-Jun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Feb. 7, v. 5, no. 6 p.2387-2410dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta06373j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245010900174300001600283520156800299592002801867650001201895650002101907650001301928650001301941650001401954650001801968650001001986650001301996650001402009650000902023650001702032650002602049700002402075700005902099700002502158700002302183773010602206856008202312852000902394655001202403IND60643160420221119133746.0190509e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064316042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-019-09568-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbebila, Emmanuel N.10aGellan Hydrogels: Preparation, Rheological Characterization and Application in Encapsulation of Curcumin  ap. 154-163.  aHydrogels can be used to protect some labile active principles, as polyphenol-rich substances, that can be added to foods to prepare functional ones. Rheological properties of gels formed through the addition of calcium chloride to gellan solutions were studied. It can be concluded that preparation variables and not only formulation ones are determinant in rheological properties of the resulting gels, as they are not in an equilibrium state but they are continuously evolving during hours to stronger gels corresponding to a denser network. It could be related to the fact that local non-gelled domains are formed surrounded by a shell of gel where Ca²⁺ ions take some time to arrive. A minimum Ca²⁺/gellan ratio (CG) is required to reach the gel point (GP), determined as the CG where the ratio loss modulus/elastic modulus (G”/G’) collapse for all frequencies. Calcium-induced external gelation of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions where a curcumin-in-oil solution is the disperse phase and a watery solution of gellan is the continuous phase was used to prepare beads were curcumin is entrapped in order to prevent its degradation. Smaller droplet-sized emulsions were obtained with higher gellan concentrations, since a higher viscosity of the continuous phase allowed to reach the critical Capillary number CaC at lower radius of droplets. An encapsulation yield around 90% was reached for gellan concentrations of 1% w/v, and the resulting encapsulated curcumin presented around 6 times slower light degradation than free curcumin-in-oil solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acurcumin 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afoods 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3aions 3aloss modulus 3amodulus of elasticity1 aSantamaría, Esther1 aMaestro, Alicia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1821-52161 aGutiérrez, José M.1 aGonzález, Carmen,0 tFood biophysics.g2019 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.154-163dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3949866x1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-019-09568-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245013300186300001600319520152000335592002801855650001401883650002501897650001001922650001201932650001001944650002201954650001801976650001801994650001402012650001402026650001002040650002402050650001202074650003302086650003002119650002302149650003602172650002802208650003602236650002802272650003802300650002802338650004302366650002802409700002302437700002002460773011302480856008202593852000902675655001202684IND4479080820221120171800.0141111e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447908082DNAL7 a222148272pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeenstra, Jan A.10aIn silico cloning of genes encoding neuropeptides, neurohormones and their putative G-protein coupled receptors in a spider mite  ap. 277-295.  aThe genome of the spider mite was prospected for the presence of genes coding neuropeptides, neurohormones and their putative G-protein coupled receptors. Fifty one candidate genes were found to encode neuropeptides or neurohormones. These include all known insect neuropeptides and neurohormones, with the exception of sulfakinin, corazonin, neuroparsin and PTTH. True orthologs of adipokinetic hormone (AKH) were neither found, but there are three genes encoding peptides similar in structure to both AKH and the AKH-corazonin-related peptide. We were also unable to identify the precursors for pigment dispersing factor (PDF) or the recently discovered trissin. However, the spider mite probably does have such genes, as we found their putative receptors. A novel arthropod neuropeptide gene was identified that shows similarity to previously described molluscan neuropeptide genes and was called EFLamide. A total of 65 putative neuropeptide GPCR genes were also identifieid, of these 58 belong to the A-family and 7 to the B-family. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 50 of them are closely related to insect GPCRs, which allowed the identification of their putative ligand in 39 cases with varying degrees of certainty. Other spider mite GPCRs however have no identifiable orthologs in the genomes of the four holometabolous insect species best analyzed. Whereas some of the latter have orthologs in hemimetabolous insect species, crustaceans or ticks, for others such arthropod homologs are currently unknown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aadipokinetic hormone 3agenes 3ainsects 3amites 3amolecular cloning 3aneurohormones 3aneuropeptides 3aphylogeny 3areceptors 3aticks 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArthropod Proteinsxgenetics 2aInsect Hormonesxgenetics 2aInsulinsxgenetics 2aInvertebrate Hormonesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgenetics 2aNeuropeptidesxgenetics 2aNeurotransmitter Agentsxgenetics 2aOligopeptidesxgenetics 2aReceptors, G-Protein-Coupledxgenetics 2aTetranychidaexgenetics1 aRombauts, Stephane1 aGrbić, Miodrag0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2012 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.277-295dElsevier Ltdx0965-17487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2011.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245010600213300001400319520150300333592002801836650001301864650001501877650001601892650001601908650002001924650001501944650002001959650001001979650001401989650001102003650000802014650001402022650002002036650001302056650002402069650002602093650001702119650001302136653001002149653001402159653002902173653001402202653000702216653000902223653000902232653000902241653000902250700003302259700001802292700002402310700002702334700002002361700001902381773011202400856008302512852000902595655001202604IND60615959320221119165305.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061595932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProctor-Brown, Lauren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6991-160910aDistal limb pathologic conditions in horses treated with sleeve-style digital cryotherapy (285 cases)  ap. 12-17.  aDigital cryotherapy (DC) is frequently used as laminitis prophylaxis for horses. While DC with ice-water slurries is reported to be safe for up to 48 h, the safety of sleeve-style digital cryotherapy (SSDC) with ice in direct contact with the distal limb has not been evaluated. Our objective was to determine the incidence of distal limb pathologic conditions (DLPC) among horses treated with SSDC. A retrospective study of cases from 2011 to 2015 identified 285 horses treated with SSDC for a minimum of 12 h. Data collected from medical records included demographic, treatment, diagnostic, and SSDC treatment parameters. Bivariate statistics and a generalized linear regression model were created to evaluate risk factors associated with increased incidence of DLPC. Among horses treated with SSDC, 7% had tissue injury of the distal limb. Increasing duration of SSDC was associated with increased incidence of DLPC. Lesions observed included dermatitis, cellulitis, alopecia, coronitis, tissue necrosis, and distal limb edema. These lesions were similar to frostbite, non-freezing cold injury, and prolonged water immersion injuries seen in other species. While the incidence of DLPC was low, the authors recommend that horses undergoing SSDC with ice in direct contact with the skin should be monitored closely for injury when prolonged cryotherapy is clinically indicated. Further studies to improve safety, efficacy, and convenience of alternative methods of DC for horses are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalopecia 3acellulitis 3acold injury 3acryosurgery 3adata collection 3adermatitis 3adisease control 3aedema 3afrostbite 3ahorses 3aice 3alaminitis 3amedical records 3anecrosis 3aregression analysis 3aretrospective studies 3arisk factors 3aslurries 0aicing 0afrostbite 0anon-freezing cold injury 0alaminitis 0aDC 0aSSDC 0aDLPC 0aNFCI 0aSIRS1 aHicks,cMrs. Dr.q(Rebecca),1 aColmer, Sarah1 aGuilfoyle, Danielle1 aDallap-Schaer, Barbara1 aJohnson, Amy L.1 aTomlinson, Joy0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2018 Dec., v. 121 p.12-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001900135245008600154300001500240500001900255520177800274592002802052650001002080650002002090650002202110650001302132650001602145650001102161650002002172650000902192650001202201650001702213700001702230700002202247700001702269700002202286700002102308700002102329773015102350856006902501856010402570990002302674852000902697655001202706IND60708425120221121081133.0200825e20200507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070842512DNAL7 a10.3791/610852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraus, Larissa10aPreparation of acute human hippocampal slices for electrophysiological recordings  ap. e61085.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEpilepsy affects about 1% of the world population and leads to a severe decrease in quality of life due to ongoing seizures as well as high risk for sudden death. Despite an abundance of available treatment options, about 30% of patients are drug-resistant. Several novel therapeutics have been developed using animal models, though the rate of drug-resistant patients remains unaltered. One of probable reasons is the lack of translation between rodent models and humans, such as a weak representation of human pharmacoresistance in animal models. Resected human brain tissue as a preclinical evaluation tool has the advantage to bridge this translational gap. Described here is a method for high quality preparation of human hippocampal brain slices and subsequent stable induction of epileptiform activity. The protocol describes the induction of burst activity during application of 8 mM KCl and 4-aminopyridin. This activity is sensitive to established AED lacosamide or novel antiepileptic candidates, such as dimethylethanolamine (DMEA). In addition, the method describes induction of seizure-like events in CA1 of human hippocampal brain slices by reduction of extracellular Mg2+ and application of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor blocker. The experimental set-up can be used to screen potential antiepileptic substances for their effects on epileptiform activity. Furthermore, mechanisms of action postulated for specific compounds can be validated using this approach in human tissue (e.g., using patch-clamp recordings). To conclude, investigation of vital human brain tissue ex vivo (here, resected hippocampus from patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy) will improve the current knowledge of physiological and pathological mechanisms in the human brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3adrug resistance 3aelectrophysiology 3aepilepsy 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3aquality of life 3arisk 3arodents 3atherapeutics1 aMonni, Laura1 aSchneider, Ulf C.1 aOnken, Julia1 aSpindler, Philipp1 aHoltkamp, Martin1 aFidzinski, Pawel0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 May 07, , no. 159 p.e61085-e61085dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/610853Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61085/preparation-acute-human-hippocampal-slices-for-electrophysiological  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04437naa a2201213 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245011100181300001600292500001900308520168100327592002802008650001302036650002402049650001502073650002402088650002302112650002002135650003102155650001302186650001702199650001602216650002602232650001402258650001302272650002402285653002302309653001502332653001902347653000802366653000802374653001302382653000602395653000602401653001002407653000802417653000902425653001302434653000902447653001002456653000902466653000902475653000702484653000902491653000802500653001202508653000902520653001502529653000802544653000802552653000802560653000702568653000802575653000702583653000902590653000902599653000902608653000902617653000802626653000802634653000902642653000902651653000602660653000902666653000702675653000802682653000802690653000602698653000602704653000602710653000802716653000802724653000802732653000802740653000702748653001002755653001002765653001002775653001102785653000902796653001102805653001102816653000802827653000802835653000802843653000802851653001102859653001102870653000702881653000702888653000802895653000802903700003102911700003002942700003302972773011403005856008303119852000903202655001203211IND60705479220221120141232.0200907e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070547922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcaraz-López, Omar Antonio10aAssessment of candidate biomarkers to detect resistance to Mycobacterium bovis in Holstein-Friesian cattle  ap. 416-425.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis has a significant economic impact worldwide each year. Control of bTB is based on skin testing and removal of reactors. However, additional strategies are required to control this disorder. Natural disease resistance has been defined as the inherent capacity of an individual to resist disease when exposed to pathogens without previous exposure or immunization. However, little is known about natural disease resistance against Mycobacterium bovis in cattle. In this study, we aimed to identify candidate biomarkers to detect host resistance to M. bovis. We used a microbicidal assay to identify the resistance phenotype. A genomic microarray analysis was carried out on RNA from 2 resistant (R) and 2 susceptible (S) cows. Our results evidenced 69 differentially expressed genes. A subset of six genes that showed differential up (IL1RN), and down-regulation (VNN, GATM, ARHGEF11, NAAA and HSPA2) were selected for further analysis. To further validate the candidate biomarkers, we identified the R phenotype in 31 cattle (9 R and 22 S). Macrophage mRNA was isolated from this group of cattle. Expression of candidate biomarkers was evaluated by qPCR 2⁻ΔCᵗ and ROC curves to determine their diagnostic potential. Candidates IL1RN and ARHGEF11 discriminates between R and S cattle. Furthermore, combination of candidates ARHGEF11: VNN: HSPA2 discriminate between R from S with AUC 0.7993 and agreement index of 0.853 (p ≤ 0.01). Our data suggest that candidate biomarkers may support the preliminary screening to identify natural resistance in herds against Mycobacterium bovis in Holstein-Friesian cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aMycobacterium bovis 3abiomarkers 3abovine tuberculosis 3adisease resistance 3aeconomic impact 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3aimmunization 3amacrophages 3amicroarray technology 3aphenotype 3aresearch 3aveterinary medicine 0aMicrobicidal assay 0aResistance 0aSusceptibility 0abTB 0aRNA 0aM. bovis 0aR 0aS 0aIL1RN 0aVNN 0aGATM 0aARHGEF11 0aNAAA 0aHSPA2 0amRNA 0aqPCR 0aHF 0aIGRA 0aDNA 0aBCG SSI 0aOADC 0aCRPMI 1640 0aFBS 0aACD 0aPBS 0apH 0aCO2 0aRT 0aFACS 0aCD14 0aFITC 0aEDTA 0aMOI 0aCFU 0ap.i. 0acDNA 0aU 0adNTP 0aRT 0aDTT 0aFDR 0aF 0aR 0as 0amin 0aNTC 0aAUC 0aROC 0aCC 0aTNFα 0aIL-12 0aIL-18 0aIL-1β 0aiNOS 0aIL-1RI 0aIL-1α 0aLPS 0aIgG 0aAPC 0aHSP 0aNF-κB 0aRhoGEF 0aM2 0aNO 0aPEA 0aOEA1 aVillarreal-Morales, Yanela1 aRangel-Escareño, Claudia1 aGutiérrez-Pabello, José A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2020 Oct., v. 132 p.416-425dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007100171300001300242520092400255592002801179650001301207650001101220650000701231650002301238653003401261653002801295653001801323653001901341700002801360700002301388700001801411773012301429856008401552852000901636655001201645IND60611900420221122220315.0181002e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061190042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2017.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBianchi, Emanuela10aInverse patchy colloids: Synthesis, modeling and self-organization  ap. 8-15.  aInverse patchy colloids are nano- to micro-scale particles with a surface divided into differently charged regions. This class of colloids combines directional, selective bonding with a relatively simple particle design: owing to the competitive interplay between the orientation-dependent attraction and repulsion — induced by the interactions between like/oppositely charged areas — experimentally accessible surface patterns are complex enough to favor the stabilization of specific structures of interest. Most important, the behavior of heterogeneously charged units can be ideally controlled by means of external parameters, such as the pH and the salt concentration. We present a concise review about this class of systems, spanning the range from the synthesis of model inverse patchy particles to their self-assembly, covering their coarse-grained modeling and the related numerical/analytical treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3amodels 3apH 3asalt concentration 0aHeterogeneously charged units 0aInverse patchy colloids 0aSelf-assembly 0aPhase diagrams1 avan Oostrum, Peter D.J.1 aLikos, Christos N.1 aKahl, Gerhard0 tCurrent opinion in colloid & interface science.g2017 July, v. 30 p.8-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:12032x1359-02947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100004200148245015200190300001300342520168600355592002802041650004802069650001802117650001102135650002102146650001402167650001302181650002002194650002502214650001802239650000902257650002702266650002102293650001402314650002102328653004802349653001402397653001202411653001702423653002002440700002802460700003002488700003702518700002202555700002802577700002802605700002702633700002602660773011102686856008302797852000902880655001202889IND60615959420221119165411.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061595942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColombatti Olivieri, María Alejandra10aProtection efficacy of Argentinian isolates of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis with different genotypes and virulence in a murine model  ap. 4-11.  aParatuberculosis is a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map). The disease causes economic losses and, therefore, it is imperative to follow proper control strategies, which should include an effective vaccine. Several strategies have assessed the virulence and immune response of Map strains that could be used as a vaccine. This study evaluates the degree of virulence, immune response, and protection of Argentinian strains of Map with different genotype in a murine model. Four local isolates (Cattle type) with different genotypes (analyzed by MIRU-VNTR and SSRs) were selected and evaluated in a virulence assay in BALB/c mice. This assay allowed us to differentiate virulent and low-virulence Map strains. The less virulent strains (1543/481 and A162) failed to induce a significant production of the proinflammatory cytokine IFNg, whereas the virulent strain 6611 established infection along with a proinflammatory immune response. On the other hand, the virulent strain 1347/498 was efficient in establishing a persistent infection, but failed to promote an important Th1 response compared with 6611 at the evaluated time. We selected the low-virulence strain 1543/498 as a live vaccine and the virulent strain 6611 as a live and inactivated vaccine in a protection assay in mice. Strain 1543/481 failed to protect the animals from challenge, whereas strain 6611, in its live and inactivated form, significantly reduced the CFUs count in the infected mice, although they had different immunological response profiles. The inactivated virulent strain 6611 is a potential vaccine candidate against paratuberculosis to be tested in cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aanimal models 3acattle 3achronic diseases 3acytokines 3agenotype 3aimmune response 3ainactivated vaccines 3alive vaccines 3amice 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparatuberculosis 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 0aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 0aVirulence 0aVaccine 0aMurine model 0aImmune response1 aMoyano, Roberto Damián1 aTraveria, Gabriel Eduardo1 aAlvarado Pinedo, María Fiorella1 aMon, María Laura1 aGravisaco, María José1 aDelgado, Fernando Oscar1 aSantangelo, María Paz1 aRomano, María Isabel0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2018 Dec., v. 121 p.4-11dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06805naa a2200949 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003900134024002500173024004100198024002300239040001800262100003000280245009700310520371600407592002804123650003904151650000804190650001304198650001904211650002604230650001104256650002004267650001504287650001704302650001404319650001504333650001204348650001004360650001904370650002004389650002504409650001204434650001004446650001604456650001704472650002604489650001404515650002504529650001204554650001704566650001704583650001304600650001404613650001404627650002204641650001004663650002004673650001104693650001404704650001504718650001504733650001204748651001104760653003004771653002704801653003004828653002804858653001104886653003504897700002804932700007704960700002905037700004705066700007805113700007205191700002705263700002905290700007605319700002905395700006605424700002805490773010305518856008605621856011405707961001305821852000905834655001205843IND60752535920221214230851.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075253592DNAL7 a3852002aris7 a10113/75253592hdl7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1052202doi7 a4317372aris_accn_no7 a2090-32000-037-000D2aris_project_no7 a3852002seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeadley, Selwyn Arlington10aOvine gammaherpesvirus-2 infection associated with chronic interstitial pneumonia in a sheep  aSheep Associated-Malignant Catarrhal Fever (SA-MCF) is severe, frequently lethal, lymphoproliferative disease predominantly of ruminants, that is caused by ovine gammaherpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2), a member of the MCF virus (MCFV) complex. However, SA-MCF in sheep is a rare entity with few demonstrations of natural diseases worldwide. This report documents the clinical, radiographical, pathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular findings of SA-MCF in a sheep. A 4-year-old, female, mixed-breed sheep with progressive emaciation for at least one month was humanely euthanized due to poor prognosis. Clinically, the animal had tachypnea, ruminal hypomotility, productive coughing with bilateral muffling sounds during pulmonary auscultation. Radiographical evaluation revealed alveolar opacity of the cranioventral pulmonary region. Grossly, there were distinct rib impressions on the pleural surface of the lungs, suggestive of interstitial pneumonia. Histopathologic evaluation of the lungs revealed several disease patterns including 1) chronic interstitial pneumonia with vasculitis and proliferating vascular lesions, and thrombosis; 2) pulmonary abscesses associated with embolic dissemination of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis from superficial lymph node due to caseous lymphadenitis, CLA; 3) granulomatous pneumonia associated with pulmonary nematodes; and 4) chronic pleuritis, probably due to caseous lymphadenitis. Additional significant histologic findings included widespread lymphocytic vasculitis and proliferating vascular lesions in multiple tissues, atrophic enteritis, segmental degeneration of myocardial fibers with lymphocytic pericarditis, lymphocytic interstitial nephritis, and non-suppurative encephalitis. An immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay, based on the monoclonal antibody 15A (MAb-15A), that is specific to all MCFV known to cause MCF, revealed positive, intracytoplasmic, intralesional immunoreactivity, predominantly within bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells of the lungs and cryptal epithelial cells of the small intestine, followed by the renal tubular epithelium, cardiomyocytes, and with patchy immunolabelling within neurons of the cerebral cortex. Molecular testing done to detect a wide range of bacterial and viral agents of ruminant diseases, only amplified OvHV-2 DNA from fresh tissue fragments of the lungs, kidney, liver, spleen, and cerebrum. Direct sequencing confirmed that the PCR amplicon derived from the pulmonary fragments had 99.2–99.7% nucleotide sequence identity with OvHV-2 reference strains and strains of OvHV-2 from Brazil. The clinical, radiographical, gross, histopathologic, IHC, and molecular findings in the lungs are consistent with chronic interstitial pneumonia associated with infection by OvHV-2. Furthermore, the non-detection of other viral agents associated with pulmonary diseases in ruminants suggest that OvHV-2 was directly associated with the development of chronic pneumonia in this sheep. Additionally, the dental alterations, CLA, and the pulmonary nematode may have contributed towards the reduced immunological statue of the animal and facilitated the occurrence of SA-MCF. These findings may indicate that OvHV-2 may be a major participant in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease of sheep under special conditions. Moreover, the proliferating vascular lesions identified in multiple tissues are additional evidence of chronic manifestations of OvHV-2 infections as described in chronic SA-MCF of cattle, while the widespread vasculitis is consistent with SA-MCF. Additionally, the IHC findings using the MAb-15A confirmed that this diagnostic approach is efficient to identify intralesional antigens of OvHV-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 3aDNA 3aNematoda 3acardiomyocytes 3acaseous lymphadenitis 3acattle 3acerebral cortex 3aemaciation 3aencephalitis 3aenteritis 3aepithelium 3afemales 3afever 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3aliver 3alymph nodes 3amixed breeds 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anephritis 3anucleotide sequences 3aopacity 3apathogenesis 3apericarditis 3apleurisy 3apneumonia 3aprognosis 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3asmall intestine 3aspleen 3atachypnea 3athrombosis 3avasculitis 3aviruses 3aBrazil 0aChronic pulmonary disease 0aLymphocytic vasculitis 0aMalignant catarrhal fever 0aMonoclonal antibody 15A 0aOvHV-2 0aProliferating vascular lesions1 aAgnol, Alais Maria Dall1 aNavolar, Felipe Martins Negreiros1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8554-11181 aFrucchi, Ana Paula Souza1 ade Matos, Andressa Maria Rorato Nascimento1 aPereira, Priscilla Fajardo Valente1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2050-86641 aXavier, Ana Aparecida Correa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8560-73351 ados Santos, Vitor Hugo1 aSilva, Luara Evangelista1 aDepes, Victoria Coronado Antunes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8983-61831 aAlfieri, Alice Fernandes1 aCunha, Cristina Wetzel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8168-54481 aAlfieri, Amauri Alcindo0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2021 Dec., v. 161 p.105220-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1052203Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/75253593Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012300171500001900294520164200313592002801955650001301983650001201996650001402008650001402022650002602036650001802062650001102080650001302091650001202104650001702116650002802133650002402161650001402185650001302199653000802212653000802220653000902228653000902237653000902246653000902255653000802264653000802272653000802280653000702288653000802295653000802303653000802311653001802319653001402337653001702351653002202368653001602390700001802406700001302424700001802437700002302455773009002478856008702568852000902655655001202664IND60716098620221118154000.0210212e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071609862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2020.1704302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrover, Tripti13aAn insight into biological activities of native cyclotides for potential applications in agriculture and pharmaceutics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCyclotides are plant-derived mini-proteins of 28 - 37 amino acids. They have a characteristic head-to-tail cyclic backbone and three disulfide cross-linkages formed by six highly conserved cysteine residues, creating a unique knotted ring structure, known as a cyclic cystine knot (CCK) motif. The CCK topology confers immense stability to cyclotides with resistance to thermal and enzymatic degradation. Native cyclotides are of interest due to their multiple biological activities with several potential applications in agricultural (e.g. biopesticides, antifungal) and pharmaceutical (e.g. anti-HIV, cytotoxic to tumor cells) sectors. The most recent application of insecticidal activity of cyclotides is the commercially available biopesticidal spray known as 'Sero X' for cotton crops. Cyclotides have a general mode of action and their potency of bioactivity is determined through their binding ability, pore formation and disruption of the target biological membranes. Keeping in view the important potential applications of biological activities of cyclotides and the lack of an extensive and analytical compilation of bioactive cyclotides, the present review systematically describes eight major biological activities of the native cyclotides from four angiosperm families viz. Fabaceae, Poaceae, Rubiaceae, Violaceae. The bioactivities of 94 cytotoxic, 57 antibacterial, 44 hemolytic, 25 antifungal, 21 anti-HIV, 20 nematocidal, 10 insecticidal and 5 molluscicidal cyclotides have been comprehensively elaborated. Further, their distribution in angiosperm families, mode of action and future prospects have also been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFabaceae 3aPoaceae 3aRubiaceae 3aViolaceae 3aantiretroviral agents 3abiopesticides 3acotton 3acysteine 3acystine 3acytotoxicity 3ainsecticidal properties 3amechanism of action 3aneoplasms 3atopology 0aCAM 0aCCK 0aEC50 0aFMCA 0aHD50 0aIC50 0aMTS 0aMTT 0aNMR 0aPE 0aSAR 0aSPR 0aSRB 0aAntimicrobial 0aHemolytic 0aInsecticidal 0aNative cyclotides 0aNematocidal1 aMishra, Reema1 aBushrá,1 aGulati, Pooja1 aMohanty, Aparajita0 tPeptides.g2021 Jan., v. 135 p.170430-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2020.1704303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04759naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245013500200506007600335520274900411592002803160506003703188650001303225650001903238650001303257650001503270650000903285650000903294650001403303650001203317650001003329650001003339650002203349650001103371650002503382650002403407650001003431650001503441650001103456650002403467650001203491650002303503700002103526700002103547700001803568700001903586700001903605700001903624700001903643700001903662700002403681700002103705700001903726700001903745700002003764700001803784700002203802700001803824700001703842773011903859856007403978852000904052655001204061IND60647197920221207084010.0190617e20180318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064719792DNAL7 a10.3390/ani80300412doi7 aPMC58675292pmcid7 a295626542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGreevy, Paul10aUsing the Five Domains Model to Assess the Adverse Impacts of Husbandry, Veterinary, and Equitation Interventions on Horse Welfare  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to conduct a series of paper-based exercises in order to assess the negative (adverse) welfare impacts, if any, of common interventions on domestic horses across a broad range of different contexts of equine care and training. An international panel (with professional expertise in psychology, equitation science, veterinary science, education, welfare, equestrian coaching, advocacy, and community engagement; n = 16) met over a four-day period to define and assess these interventions, using an adaptation of the domain-based assessment model. The interventions were considered within 14 contexts: C1 Weaning; C2 Diet; C3 Housing; C4 Foundation training; C5 Ill-health and veterinary interventions (chiefly medical); C6 Ill-health and veterinary interventions (chiefly surgical); C7 Elective procedures; C8 Care procedures; C9 Restraint for management procedures; C10 Road transport; C11 Activity—competition; C12 Activity—work; C13 Activity—breeding females; and C14 Activity—breeding males. Scores on a 1–10 scale for Domain 5 (the mental domain) gathered during the workshop were compared with overall impact scores on a 1–10 scale assigned by the same panellists individually before the workshop. The most severe (median and interquartile range, IQR) impacts within each context were identified during the workshop as: C1 abrupt, individual weaning (10 IQR 1); C2 feeding 100% low-energy concentrate (8 IQR 2.5); C3 indoor tie stalls with no social contact (9 IQR 1.5); C4 both (i) dropping horse with ropes (9 IQR 0.5) and forced flexion (9 IQR 0.5); C5 long-term curative medical treatments (8 IQR 3); C6 major deep intracavity surgery (8.5 IQR 1); C7 castration without veterinary supervision (10 IQR 1); C8 both (i) tongue ties (8 IQR 2.5) and (ii) restrictive nosebands (8 IQR 2.5); C9 ear twitch (8 IQR 1); C10 both (i) individual transport (7.00 IQR 1.5) and group transport with unfamiliar companions (7 IQR 1.5); C11 both (i) jumps racing (8 IQR 2.5) and Western performance (8 IQR 1.5); C12 carriage and haulage work (6 IQR 1.5); C13 wet nurse during transition between foals (7.5 IQR 3.75); and C14 teaser horse (7 IQR 8). Associations between pre-workshop and workshop scores were high, but some rankings changed after workshop participation, particularly relating to breeding practices. Domain 1 had the weakest association with Domain 5. The current article discusses the use of the domain-based model in equine welfare assessment, and offers a series of assumptions within each context that future users of the same approach may make when assessing animal welfare under the categories reported here. It also discusses some limitations in the framework that was used to apply the model.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadvocacy 3aanimal welfare 3abreeding 3acastration 3adiet 3aears 3aeducation 3afemales 3afoals 3amales 3amedical treatment 3amodels 3apsychosocial factors 3aroad transportation 3aropes 3atie stalls 3atongue 3aveterinary medicine 3aweaning 3awelfare assessment1 aBerger, Jeannine1 ade Brauwere, Nic1 aDoherty, Orla1 aHarrison, Anna1 aFiedler, Julie1 aJones, Claudia1 aMcDonnell, Sue1 aMcLean, Andrew1 aNakonechny, Lindsay1 aNicol, Christine1 aPreshaw, Liane1 aThomson, Peter1 aTzioumis, Vicky1 aWebster, John1 aWolfensohn, Sarah1 aYeates, James1 aJones, Bidda0 tAnimals.g2018 Mar. 18, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani80300413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245008800189300001800277500002000295520177200315592002802087650001602115650001302131650001502144650002302159650001002182650002402192650001402216650001002230773009702240856010702337852000902444655001202453IND60569937620221119071346.0170626e200105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056993762DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1283:BADROT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsh, David M.10aBehavioral and demographic responses of túngara frogs to variation in pond density  ap. 1283-1292.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPopulation responses to variable environments can result from individual behavior (i.e., dispersal and habitat selection) or demography (i.e., changes in birth and death rates). Distinguishing behavioral from demographic responses to environmental variability has important implications for interpretation of spatial patterns and projections of population persistence. I studied the behavioral and demographic responses of túngara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, to experimental variation in the density of breeding ponds over two years. At natural spatiotemporal scales of variation in pond density, behavioral responses predominated over demographic responses. In the first year of the experiment, when plots varied in pond density, túngara frogs were proportionally more abundant in plots that contained higher densities of ponds. This behavioral response appeared to be due to increased ability to find plots with high pond densities and reduced effects of pond saturation (i.e., availability of unused ponds) within these plots. In the second year of the experiment, when plots had equal pond densities, there was a detectable demographic response to breeding‐pond density early in the season, with fewer frogs in plots that had contained no ponds in the previous year. This response was short‐lived, however, and by the end of the second year there was no detectable demographic effect. These results demonstrate that behavioral responses may predominate over demographic responses even on relatively large scales. Thus, studies demonstrating changes in patterns of abundance and distribution must be cautious in interpreting these results in the context of metapopulation dynamics without a detailed understanding of species‐specific dispersal behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysalaemus 3abreeding 3ademography 3adispersal behavior 3afrogs 3ahabitat preferences 3amortality 3aponds0 tEcology.g2001 May, v. 82, no. 5 p.1283-1292dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B1283:BADROT%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245012300199300001400322520102500336592002801361650002501389650002101414650001701435650001501452650001401467650001601481650001601497650002101513650001401534650002001548650001901568650001901587650002501606650001701631650001001648650002201658650000901680653002001689653001001709653000901719653000801728653002501736700001701761700001701778700001801795700001701813700001901830700001901849773011001868856008201978852000902060655001202069IND60544107720221120152609.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054410772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6346-623310aBlueberry anthocyanins ameliorate cyclophosphamide-induced liver damage in rats by reducing inflammation and apoptosis  ap. 71-81.  aWe attempted to determine whether blueberry anthocyanins (BA) would be protective against cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced liver injury in SD rats.

Liver histopathology, serum liver enzymatic activities, cytokines and apoptotic parameters were evaluated. The rats that were injected with CTX incurred liver injury, evidenced by histological changes and elevated serum enzymes activities; CTX led to elevated proinflammatory cytokines, and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokine; also induced apoptosis, indicated by increased Bax and TLR4, and decreased Bcl-2 expression in western blot assay, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry assay with anti-Bax antibody.

In this study, we devised an accurate, rapid and easy-to-use SNP detection system based on direct loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) without DNA extraction, known as Direct-LAMP. Samples from various sources (including whole blood, dried blood spot, buccal swab and saliva), treated with NaOH, can be used directly in amplification. The turnaround time was about 30 min from sample collection to provision of results. The accuracy was evaluated by assessing the polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) Glu504Lys, which are better known for their critical role in folate and ethanol metabolism, respectively. Completely consistent genotyping results reveal that Direct-LAMP is generally concordant with sequencing. This system can serve as a very promising platform in the fields of disease predisposition, drug metabolism and personalized medicine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aaldehydes 3abiosensors 3ablood 3aethanol 3afolic acid 3agenotyping 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 3apharmacokinetics 3apoint-of-care systems 3aprecision medicine 3asaliva 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asodium hydroxide 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aIsothermal amplification 0aMultifarious sample types 0aMTHFR 0aALDH21 aZhang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0399-12011 aZhao, Mengye1 aLiu, Kewu1 aLi, Hang1 aLi, Ningning1 aGao, Linlin1 aYang, Xuemin1 aMa, Ding,1 aZhu, Juanli1 aHui, Wenli1 aHua, Kai1 aCui, Yali0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 115 p.70-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01328naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245013500159300001800294520028900312592002800601650001400629650002300643650002300666650002300689650001400712650002900726700002300755700002700778773012800805856007200933852000901005655001201014IND60658187320221119133958.0190816e20071205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065818732DNAL7 a10.1039/b715810f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantoro, Stefano10aEnantioselective organocatalytic substitution of α-cyanoacetates on imidoyl chlorides – synthesis of optically active ketimines  ap. 5155-5157.  aThe enantioselective substitution of α-cyanoacetates on imidoyl chlorides under phase-transfer catalytic conditions is presented; a simple quinidine-derived phase-transfer catalyst gives access to the products, highly substituted ketimines, in generally good yields and up to 90% ee.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3aenantioselectivity 3aketimines 3aorganochlorine compounds1 aPoulsen, Thomas B.1 aJørgensen, Karl Anker0 tChemical communications.g2007 Dec. 5, , no. 48 p.5155-5157dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b715810f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01210naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245007000129300001100199520047900210592002800689650001300717650001100730650002500741650001400766650001500780651001800795773012200813852000900935655001200944IND60300708720221123040841.0150703e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030070872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Greg10aSupreme Court Cites Science in Limiting Punishments for Juveniles  ap. 25.  aLast week, the Supreme Court ruled that mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment when applied to juvenile offenders.

Considering the number of preanal papillae of males, Babero (1973) and Giannetto and Canestri Trotti (1995) proposed the subdivision of the genus into 2 groups; those with 4 pairs of preanal papillae (25 species) and with more than 4 pairs of preanal papillae (4 species). Spirura mounporti n. sp. belongs to the second, with 5 pairs of preanal papillae, and differs from Spirura infundibuliformis (McLeod, 1933) Anderson et al., 1993, Spirura zapi (Erickson, 1938) Chabaud et al., 1965, Spirura leiperi Gupta and Trivedi, 1985, and Spirura michiganensis Sandground, 1935 in the number of pairs of pre-cloacal papillae.

This organism is also of public health concern due to an unconfirmed link to Crohn's disease. Susceptibility to paratuberculosis has been suggested to have a genetic component. In livestock, a number of candidate genes have been studied, selected on their association to susceptibility in other mycobacterial diseases, their known role in disease pathogenesis or links to susceptibility of humans to Crohn's disease. These genes include solute carrier family 11 member 1 (SLC11A1, formerly NRAMP1), toll-like receptors, caspase associated recruitment domain 15 (CARD15, formerly NOD2), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and cytokines (interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma) and their receptors. Genome wide association studies have attempted to confirm associations found and identify new genes involved in pathogenesis and susceptibility. There are a number of limitations and difficulties in these approaches, some peculiar to paratuberculosis but others generally applicable to identification of genetic associations for complex traits. The technical approaches and available information for paratuberculosis have expanded rapidly, particularly relating to sheep and cattle. Here we review the current published evidence for a genetic association with paratuberculosis susceptibility, technological advances that have progressed the field and potential avenues for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aToll-like receptors 3acaspases 3acattle 3agenome-wide association study 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3aintracellular signaling peptides and proteins 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3aparatuberculosis 3apathogenesis 3asheep 3asolutes1 aPlain, Karren M.1 aBegg, Douglas J.1 ade Silva, Kumudika1 aWhittington, Richard J.0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2011 May, v. 34, no. 3 p.197-208dElsevier Ltdx0147-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2010.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245011500166300001800281520167300299592002801972650001402000650002402014650001102038650001602049650001702065650000902082650001702091650004302108650002002151650002402171650001502195650001602210650001502226650001602241650001402257650001702271650001302288650002102301700002402322700002102346700002202367700002402389700002102413700002302434700002802457700002502485700002402510700002402534700002302558773012002581856007402701852000902775655001202784IND60129777420221120165519.0151126e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012977742DNAL7 a10.1645/13-176.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDa Silva, Aleksandro S.10aAdenosine Levels in Serum and Adenosine Deaminase Activity in Blood Cells of Dogs Infected by Rangelia vitalii  ap. 1125-1128.  aEcto-adenosinedeaminase (E-ADA) plays an important role in the production and differentiation of blood cells as well as in the control of extracellular adenosine levels. Infectious diseases can influence the synthesis of new cells or cause cell destruction, as occurs in canine rangeliosis, which results in anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and/or leukopenia. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate E-ADA activity in sera, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and adenosine levels in sera samples of dogs infected by Rangelia vitalii. Twelve animals were divided into 2 groups: noninfected (n = 5) and infected by R. vitalii (n = 7). Animals were infected with 2 ml of blood containing the parasite, and parasitemia was estimated daily for 20 days by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears. Blood collection was performed on days 0, 10, and 20 post-infection (PI) in order to evaluate the evolution of the disease. The blood collected was used to assess the activity of E-ADA. We observed an increase of E-ADA activity in sera (day 20 PI) and erythrocytes (days 10 and 20 PI) in the infected group (P < 0.05). E-ADA activity in lymphocytes was decreased on day 10, when the parasitemia was high, and increased after 20 days, when the number of circulating parasites was low. HPLC measured adenosine levels in the serum and found a reduction on days 10 and 20 PI. In conclusion, our results showed that E-ADA activity was altered in sera, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes of dogs experimentally infected by R. vitalii as well as the serum concentration of adenosine. These alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of anemia and immune response in infected dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3aadenosine deaminase 3aanemia 3ablood serum 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aerythrocytes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmune response 3ainfectious diseases 3aleukopenia 3alymphocytes 3amicroscopy 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3asampling 3athrombocytopenia1 aFrança, Raqueli T.1 aCosta, Marcio M.1 aPaim, Francine C.1 aPimentel, Victor C.1 aSchmatz, Roberta1 aJaques, Jeandre A.1 aSchetinger, Maria R.

Here, we develop and test a novel molecular technique for ecological analysis, protein fingerprinting (PF), based on isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF) in immobilized pH gradients. It is applied here to albumen from birds' eggs and permits accurate identification of eggs laid by different females. This technique greatly clarifies female alternative reproductive tactics and laying patterns in brood‐parasitic Common Goldeneye ducks Bucephala clangula. A small, nondestructive sample of albumen is taken through a hole drilled through the eggshell, which is then sealed with superglue, preserving egg hatchability. IEF yields a rich pattern of albumen bands with extensive variation among females. Observation and video recording of egg‐laying by 21 color‐marked females showed that they had unique band patterns, which were fully repeatable within and between years. Brood parasitism occurred in two‐thirds (13 of 19) of the video‐recorded nests of color‐ringed females, with up to five parasitic females per nest. Of 234 eggs, 36% were laid by females other than the incubating host. These results suggest that intraspecific brood parasitism is more common and important than suggested by earlier studies using traditional methods. Protein fingerprinting yields individual resolution similar to that of a DNA multilocus fingerprinting probe, and has several advantages. The albumen band pattern represents only the laying female, not her mate(s), making it easy to determine the maternity of eggs, and to identify a parasite that spreads her eggs among a number of nests. Albumen can be sampled as soon as the egg is laid, before predation or other losses occur, maximizing sample size and minimizing bias. Protein fingerprinting is relatively inexpensive and easy. It is also useful for several purposes other than maternity determination, such as relatedness estimation for categories of individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBucephala 3aDNA 3aamphibians 3abrood parasitism 3aducks 3aegg hatchability 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3afemales 3afish 3ainsects 3aisoelectric focusing 3anests 3apH 3aparasites 3apeptide mapping 3apredation1 aÅhlund, Matti0 tEcology.g2001 May, v. 82, no. 5 p.1433-1442dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B1433:PFANTR%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007800167300001600245520105700261592002801318650002701346650001501373650001701388650001301405650001501418650002501433650002401458650000801482650001001490650001701500650002601517650002601543650001301569650001401582650001101596700002101607700002301628700001901651700001901670700002001689700002001709700001701729700002301746700002101769700001901790773013201809856008301941852000902024655001202033IND60087170420221121062237.0141102e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008717042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2010.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoki, Takashi10aGeneration of monoclonal antibodies specific for ORF68 of koi herpesvirus  ap. 209-216.  aOutbreaks of koi herpesvirus (KHV) infection in carp are still a serious problem worldwide. KHV is closely related to other two cyprinid herpesviruses, pox herpesvirus (CHV) and haematopoietic necrosis herpesvirus (CyHV-2) in goldfish. In this study, two major KHV antigenic proteins (ORF62 and ORF68) were identified by immunoscreening using a KHV-specific polyclonal antibody, and then monoclonal antibodies were generated for immunodiagnostic studies. After screening hybridoma cells, one mAb against ORF68 (mAb-7C6) was obtained but no mAbs against ORF62. mAb-7C6 specifically reacted with a lysate of KHV-infected koi fin cells (KF-1 cells) but not with lysates of CHV- or CyHV-2-infected KF-1 cells in an immuno-blotting analysis. Similar results were shown in the following tests: (1) a indirect fluorescent antibody test using infected KF-1 cells and (2) an immunohistochemical investigation by fast red stain (infected liver) or FITC detection (infected spleen). These results suggested that mAb-7C6 specifically reacts with KHV ORF68 protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinid herpesvirus 3 3aCyprinidae 3afluorescence 3agoldfish 3ahybridomas 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainfectious diseases 3akoi 3aliver 3amicrobiology 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aproteins 3ascreening 3aspleen1 aTakano, Tomokazu1 aUnajak, Sasimnanas1 aTakagi, Madoka1 aKim, Young Rim1 aPark, Seong Bin1 aKondo, Hidehiro1 aHirono, Ikuo1 aSaito-Taki, Tatsuo1 aHikima, Jun-ichi1 aJung, Tae Sung0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2011 May, v. 34, no. 3 p.209-216dElsevier Ltdx0147-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2010.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245018300174300001800357520174400375592002802119650002202147650001702169650002202186650002102208650002602229650002602255700001902281700001502300700001502315700002102330700001602351700002202367700005602389773017402445856008402619852000902703655001202712IND60679452220221120063252.0191228e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067945222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b003282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Ha-Thanh-Tung10aDevelopment of a Building Block Strategy to Target the Classification, Identification, and Metabolite Profiling of Oleanane Triterpenoids in Gymnema sylvestre Using UHPLC-qTOF/MS  ap. 3249-3266.  aThe major class of bioactive metabolites in Gymnema sylvestre, a popular Ayurvedic medicinal plant for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, is oleanane triterpenoids. In this study, a targeted, biosynthesis-inspired approach using UHPLC-qTOF/MS was implemented to elucidate the whole chemical profile of this plant for the standardization of the Vietnamese G. sylvestre variety. The known compounds were first determined to identify the building blocks of the biosynthetic intermediates and the construction rules for synthesizing oleanane triterpenoids in the plant. These blocks were recombined to build a virtual library of all reasonable compounds consistent with the deduced construction rules. Various techniques, including relative mass defect filtering, multiple key ion analysis, mass fragmentation analysis, and comparison with standard references, were applied to determine the presence of these predicted compounds. Conventional isolation and structure elucidation of six of the new compounds were carried out to identify the new building blocks and validate the assignments. Consequently, 119 peaks were quickly assigned to oleanane triterpenoids, and among them, 77 peaks were predicted to be new compounds based on their molecular formulas and mass fragmentation patterns. All the identified metabolites were then classified into different layers to analyze their logical relationships, and a multilayered chemical profile of the oleanane triterpenoids was constructed. This new approach is expected to be practical for characterizing structures of modular secondary metabolites, such as triterpenoid saponins, and for proposing biosynthetic relationships among compounds of the same class of metabolites in medicinal plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGymnema sylvestre 3abiosynthesis 3adiabetes mellitus 3amedicinal plants 3asecondary metabolites 3atriterpenoid saponins1 aKim, Hyun Woo,1 aHan, Sohee1 aRyu, Byeol1 aDoan, Thi-Phuong1 aAn, Jin-Pyo1 aTrần, Văn Ơn,1 aOh, Won-Keun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0761-30640 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 82, no. 12 p.3249-3266dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b003283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01256naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245014300155300001600298520030500314592002800619650002200647650001900669650001400688650002100702700001700723700001800740773012600758856007300884852000900957655001200966IND60658187720221119134118.0190816e20080129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065818772DNAL7 a10.1039/b715868h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jungwon10aSynergic effect of simultaneous fluorination and platinization of TiO₂ surface on anoxic photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds  ap. 756-758.  aSimultaneously surface fluorinated and platinized TiO₂ (F–TiO₂/Pt) exhibits a novel photocatalytic activity for the anoxic degradation of organic compounds, which is attributed to the unique synergic effect of surface fluorination and platinization on the photo-induced charge transfer process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorganic compounds 3aphotocatalysis 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide1 aLee, Jaesang1 aChoi, Wonyong0 tChemical communications.g2008 Jan. 29, , no. 6 p.756-758dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b715868h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245016100159300001800320520165100338592002801989650001702017650002302034650002602057650000902083650001002092650003302102650001802135651001102153651002502164700002602189700002702215700002602242700001802268773012002286856007402406852000902480655001202489IND60129777920221120065039.0151126e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012977792DNAL7 a10.1645/13-216.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Stanley D.10aDescription of Gyrodactylus mediotorus n. sp. (Monogenea: Gyrodactylidae) Infecting Spottail Shiner (Notropis hudsonius) from the St. Lawrence River, Canada  ap. 1062-1066.  aGyrodactylus mediotorus n. sp. is described from the body, fins, and buccal cavity of the spottail shiner, Notropis hudsonius (Cyprinidae) from the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada. Gyrodactylus mediotorus n. sp. is the first species of Gyrodactylus Nordmann, 1832 described from N. hudsonius and is characterized by large hamuli, large medial process of the ventral bar, narrow linguiform ventral bar membrane, large anterolateral processes, and marginal hooks with long shafts and distinctly shaped sickle. The species that most resembles Gyrodactylus mediotorus n. sp. is Gyrodactylus protuberus Rogers and Wellborn, 1965 described from the stargazing shiner, Notropis uranoscopus Suttkus, 1959. The 2 species can be differentiated based on the larger hamuli (68.4 vs. 64) and ventral bar (38.4 vs. 24) of Gyrodactylus mediotorus n. sp. and the shape of the marginal hooks which for Gyrodactylus mediotorus n. sp. has a slightly larger toe and a point which is not as angled. The morphological description is supplemented with 436 sequenced base pairs of the 18S gene (including the V4 region) as well as 1,041 sequenced base pairs spanning the complete ITS-1, 5.8S, and ITS-2 regions. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches failed to provide any close matches for either regions of DNA, with Gyrodactylus colemanensis infecting Salvelinus fontinalis being the most genetically similar for both the 18S (∼91%, JF836090) and ITS (∼84%, JF836142) rDNA regions. Gyrodactylus mediotorus n. sp. has been found infecting spottail shiners in the St. Lawrence River in low prevalence and intensities periodically over the last 15 yr.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGyrodactylus 3aNotropis hudsonius 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3afins 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aribosomal DNA 3aQuebec 3aSaint Lawrence River1 aMarcogliese, David J.1 aForest, Jonathon J.

The accumulation carbohydrates associated with cold tolerance (CT), transcript levels for genes encoding related enzymes along with damage indices were comparatively studied in three genotypes of bread and durum wheats differing in sensitivity. Two (Norstar, bread wheat and Gerdish, durum wheat) were tolerant and the other, SRN (durum wheat), was susceptible to cold stress. During cold stress (−5°C for 24h), the contents of electrolyte leakage index (ELI) in Norstar and then Gerdish plants were lower than that of SRN plants, particularly in cold acclimated (CA) plants (4°C for 14days), confirming lethal temperature 50 (LT50) under field conditions. Increased carbohydrate abundances in the cases of sucrose, glucose, fructose, hexose phosphates, fructan, raffinose, arabinose resulted in different intensities of oxidative stress in bread (Norstar) plants compared to durum plants (SRN and Gerdish) plants as well as in CA plants compared to non-acclimated (NA) ones under cold, indicating metabolic/regulatory capacity along with a decrease in ELI content and enhanced defense activities. A significant decrease in these carbohydrates, particularly sucrose, under cold in NA plants showed an elevated level of cell damage (confirmed by ELI) compared to CA plants. On the other hand, an increase in hexose phosphates, particularly in NA plants, indicated sucrose degradation along with greater production of glucose and fructose compared to CA plants. Under such conditions, a significant increase in transcript levels of sucrose synthase and acidic invertase confirmed these results. Under cold, the high ABA-containing genotypes like Norstar and then Gerdish, which were obvious in CA plants, partly induced relative acclimation of cells for acquisition of CT compared to SRN. These results reveal an important role of carbohydrate metabolism in creating CT in durum wheats (particularly in Gerdish) as well as bread wheat with possible responsive components in metabolic and transcript levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aarabinose 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3abreads 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3adurum wheat 3aelectrolytes 3afructans 3afructose 3agenes 3agenotype 3aglucose 3ahexaploidy 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphates 3araffinose 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase 3atemperature 3atetraploidy 0aABA 0aCA 0aCT 0aELI 0aFM 0aF-6-P 0aG-1-P 0aG-6-P 0aLT50 0aNA 0aQPCR 0aROS 0aAcclimation 0aCarbohydrate 0aCold tolerance 0aDurum wheat 0aGene expression 0aProtective metabolites1 aMaali-Amiri, Reza0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 204 p.44-53dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100002200163245006500185300001800250520135900268592002801627650001101655650002201666650001701688650002001705650001401725650000901739650001201748650001901760650002601779650001901805650001701824650001701841650001801858650001801876650001601894650003101910650000901941650001001950700002201960773012901982856007802111852000902189655001202198IND60080706320221118054907.0140804e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008070632DNAL7 a249565982pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2013009502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamidi, Maryam S.10aVitamin K and musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women  ap. 1647-1657.  aAside from its important role in blood clotting, vitamin K is an important dietary factor in regulating bone and cartilage mineralization. The vitamin K requirements to maintain musculoskeletal health may be more than the current recommendations and subclinical vitamin K deficiency may be involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Observational studies suggest that diets low in vitamin K are associated with increased risk of fractures and osteoarthritis in older adults. However, so far randomized controlled trials of vitamin K supplementation in Caucasian populations have not shown clinically significant improvements in bone mineral density at major skeletal sites. Supplementation with vitamin K may reduce the risk of fractures, but this conclusion comes from clinical trials with methodological limitations. At this time, only one randomized controlled trial has examined the effect of vitamin K supplementation on radiographic hand osteoarthritis and found no overall effect. Large well‐designed randomized controlled trials are needed to compare the efficacies of vitamin K1 and K2 on fractures and osteoarthritis among older adults. In summary, currently there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of vitamin K supplements for the prevention of bone loss, fractures, or osteoarthritis in postmenopausal women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhites 3ablood coagulation 3abone density 3abone resorption 3acartilage 3adiet 3aelderly 3amineralization 3aobservational studies 3aosteoarthritis 3aosteoporosis 3apathogenesis 3aphylloquinone 3apostmenopause 3aradiography 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk 3awomen1 aCheung, Angela M.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2014 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.1647-1657dWiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Beef briskets were subjected to shockwave (11 kJ/pulse) and were sous vide-cooked at 60 °C for 12 h. Shockwave processing alone decreased the enthalpy and thermal denaturation temperature of the connective tissue proteins (second peak in the DSC thermogram, p < 0.05) compared to the control raw samples, while the protein gel electrophoresis profile remained unaffected. It led to disorganisation of the sarcomere structure and also modified the protein secondary structure. More severe muscle fibre coagulation and denaturation were observed in the shockwave-treated cooked meat compared to the cooked control. The results show that shockwave processing, with and without sous vide cooking, promotes structural changes in meat, and thus may have the potential to improve the organoleptic quality of the tough meat cuts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acoagulation 3acooked foods 3adenaturation 3aenthalpy 3afood chemistry 3agel electrophoresis 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3aprotein secondary structure 3asarcomeres 3asensory properties 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aultrastructure 0aHydrodynamic pressure processing 0aLow-temperature long-time cooking 0aFT-IR microspectrometry 0aHistology 0aTransmission electron microscopy1 aKaur, Lovedeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2789-04161 aAstruc, Thierry1 aVénien, Annie1 aStübler, Anna-Sophie1 aAganovic, Kemal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5850-87771 aLoison, Olivier1 aHodgkinson, Suzanne1 aBoland, Mike0 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 01, v. 343 p.128500-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1285003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009200171300001800263520132000281592002801601650002201629650003601651650001301687650001201700650001101712650000901723650003701732650001701769650000901786650001401795650002001809650001301829650001801842650001301860650001401873650003301887650001201920650001001932650001701942700001901959700001701978700001801995700001702013700001402030773010402044856008902148852000902237655001202246IND60534293320221118122629.0160804e20160218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053429332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b013262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Chanchan10aCharacteristics of Different Sized Slag Particles from Entrained-Flow Coal Gasification  ap. 1487-1495.  aGasification slags are byproducts of the coal gasification process, including fine slags (slags from filter) and coarse slags (slags from lock hopper). The characteristics of gasification slags with different particle sizes were investigated by the loss-on-ignition (LOI) method, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), pore structure analysis, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). The relationships between the particle size and the characteristics of slags, which include residual carbon content, surface characteristics, pore structure, crystal mineral content, and ash composition, were analyzed and obtained. For fine slags, carbon content, specific surface area, porosity, and crystal content increase with particle size. For coarse slags, medium sized (105–280 μm) particles contain the most residual carbons and crystal minerals, followed by the smaller (0–105 μm) particles. Si/Al/Ca/Mg/K tends to concentrate in larger coarse slags, while Fe/S/P tends to concentrate in smaller particles. Different characteristics of different sized slags are mainly due to their different processes experienced in the gasifier. It is considered that particle fragmentation, ash agglomeration, and slag deposition should be taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acoal 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agasification 3airon 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3aminerals 3aparticle size 3aporosity 3apotassium 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3aslags 3asurface area1 aLiang, Qinfeng1 aGuo, Xiaolei1 aDai, Zhenghua1 aLiu, Haifeng1 aGong Xin,0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Feb. 18, v. 30, no. 2 p.1487-1495dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b013263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012900156300002000285520144700305592002801752650002301780650001401803650001501817650000901832650002001841650001901861650002401880650001501904650001901919650001501938650001301953650001601966650001401982650001101996650001202007650000902019650001002028653003102038653000902069653001402078653002102092653001002113653001702123700001602140700001502156700001402171700001502185700001402200700001802214773012602232856007502358852000902433655001202442IND60527793320221122010359.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779332DNAL7 a10.1021/am50575362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Tianxi10aFacile and Label-Free Detection of Lung Cancer Biomarker in Urine by Magnetically Assisted Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering  ap. 20985-20993.  aAdenosine plays a crucial role in the regulation of physiological activity in various tissues and organs. As adenosine is a possible biomarker for cancer, the determination of its level presents a demanding task for deeply monitoring progress of diseases. Through the synthesis of Fe₃O₄/Au/Ag nanocomposites weaved and stabilized by phytic acid and its salt, we develop a magnetically assisted surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) protocol to determine trace level adenosine in urine samples from both lung cancer patients and health human. The magnetic properties of the nanocomposites enable to realize the simple separation of targeted molecules from a complex matrix and the Au/Ag nanoparticles moieties act as the SERS platform. This label-free Fe₃O₄/Au/Ag-nanocomposites-based SERS protocol shows a good stability, reproducibility, time efficiency (less than 20 min for one sample test), and huge sensitivity down to 1 × 10–¹⁰ M. The protocol also has high selectivity because SERS signal of adenosine provides the molecular fingerprint information as well as an azo coupling pretreatment is performed to remove the interference of urea. Furthermore, a SERS array is designed for on-site screening adenosine in urine samples in a massive way using a portable Raman. Such a magnetically assisted SERS method as a powerful alternative can be expected as a smart and promising tool for effective assessment of healthcare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadenosine 3abiomarkers 3agold 3ahealth services 3alung neoplasms 3amagnetic properties 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3apatients 3aphytic acid 3ascreening 3asilver 3atissues 3aurea 3aurine 0aFe3O4/Au/Ag nanocomposites 0aSERS 0aadenosine 0acancer biomarker 0aurine 0aazo coupling1 aGuo, Xiaoyu1 aWu, Yiping1 aWang, Hui1 aFu, Shuyue1 aWen, Ying1 aYang, Haifeng0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.20985-20993dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam50575363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002100147245015800168300001800326500000900344520144300353592002801796650002201824650001201846650001301858650001001871650001401881650001401895650001601909650001801925650001501943650002001958650001101978650001001989700001901999700001902018773013302037852000902170856008402179655001202263IND4460717120221121104438.0191122e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446071712DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2010.08.04472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, F.

High-yielding Argentinean wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars were grown under irrigated and high-input conditions during two seasons to study (i) yield and grain number m⁻² (GN) as a result of stover biomass at harvest (SH) and harvest index (HI); and (ii) spike dry weight at anthesis (SDWₐ; g m⁻²) and spike fertility index (SFI; grain number per gram of spike chaff or non-grain spike biomass). Duration of the stem elongation phase (SEP; first node detectable to anthesis) was analyzed as an alternative to increase SDWₐ. The HI was highly associated with yield differences between cultivars for both years, independently of stem height. In contrast, SH did not vary among cultivars in either season (P > 0.05). The GN determined yield differences between cultivars and was highly associated with SFI and SDWₐ for both years and cycles. Some cultivars with the same anthesis date showed stable variation for duration of the SEP between years (despite the year × cultivar interaction observed). As the SFI and duration of the SEP were not related, it seems promising to increase GN in a cultivar with high SFI through an increased duration of the SEP (which may yield higher SWDₐ) or vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiomass 3abreeding 3achaff 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3airrigation 3astem elongation 3astover 3awheat1 aTerrile, I.

Sources of trace minerals (TM) with higher bioavailability in breeder diets have been reported to enhance humoral and cellular immunity in broiler progeny. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of breeder feeding programs and TM dietary sources on maternal antibody transfer and humoral immune response of progeny to a live vaccine against Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Cobb 500 breeders were fed according to 2 feed allocation programs, sigmoid late fast and sigmoid late slow, from 14 to 29 wk of age. From 56 to 62 wk of age, breeders were fed with either inorganic TM or an organic source (OTM) to replace 30% of Cu, Zn, and Mn. Progeny broilers were vaccinated intraocularly with La Sota NDV vaccine at 7 d of age. Blood samples were collected at hatching, 4, and 14 d postvaccination. Serum antibody levels against NDV were assessed by ELISA and cytokine expression by real time PCR. At hatching, late slow breeder progeny fed diets with 30% OTM had higher antibody titers as compared with progeny of breeders fed 100% inorganic TM. Similar results were observed 2 wk postvaccination. Breeder feeding programs and TM sources affected the expression level of IL-4 in NDV vaccinated broiler progeny. It was concluded that breeder feeding programs influenced humoral immune response to NDV vaccine in the broiler progeny, and 30% OTM may increase these responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aantibodies 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3abroiler breeders 3acell-mediated immunity 3ahumoral immunity 3ainterleukin-4 3alive vaccines 3aprogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3arestricted feeding 0aimmunology 0abreeder 0abroiler 0afeeding program 0aorganic mineral1 aLeandro, N.M.1 aAli, R.1 aKoci, M.1 aMoraes, V.1 aBrake, J.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2013 Oct. 01, v. 22, no. 3 p.499-510dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr.2012-007083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012200165300001800287520125000305592002801555650002101583650002701604650001601631650001401647650001101661650001601672650001901688650001001707650001801717650000901735650002001744650001801764650001801782650001301800650001101813650001101824650001001835650001601845650001901861650001501880650001201895650001301907700002601920700002301946773014201969856008102111852000902192655001202201IND60596425320221118022847.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3033-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuletu, Alina10aInfluence of black tea fractions addition on dough characteristics, textural properties and shelf life of wheat bread  ap. 1133-1145.  aTheanine (T) and polyphenols (P) enriched fractions obtained from decaffeinated black tea dust by fractionation on a XAD resin, were incorporated into wheat bread formulation. The effect on dough properties and quality characteristics of supplemented breads was investigated. The development time and mixing resistance of dough was significantly increased by P fraction addition, indicating a stronger dough structure. P inhibited the Gram-positive bacteria, while E. coli was only inhibited by T fraction. Addition of P fraction provided an extension of bread shelf life up to 4 days as compared to control bread, while T fraction increased shelf life for 1 day. P fraction hindered the retrogradation of amylopectin which had no antifirming effect in bread. During storage, starch retrogradation in P bread crumbs was significantly retarded as compared with the control. P fraction produced darker, harder and coarser crumb structure and lower loaf volume. Crumb hardness was negatively correlated with bread volume (r = − 0.90, p < 0.05). The electronic nose system discriminated the bread odor based on the fraction used. Bread samples of different storage times were distinguished by e-nose with discrimination index above 90.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aamylopectin 3ablack tea 3abreads 3acorrelation 3adecaffeination 3adough 3adough quality 3adust 3aelectronic nose 3afood research 3afractionation 3ahardness 3aloaves 3amixing 3aodors 3apolyphenols 3aretrogradation 3ashelf life 3atexture 3atheanine1 aDuta, DenisaEglantina1 aAndlauer, Wilfried0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 June, v. 244, no. 6 p.1133-1145dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3033-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245012700210300001600337506007600353520156000429592002801989506003702017650001502054650001902069650002202088650003602110650001802146650001802164650001602182650001302198650003602211650003202247653001302279653001202292653001502304653002202319653001902341653001102360700002002371773014402391856008302535852000902618655001202627IND60570818720221207142555.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057081872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgeb.2017.06.0062doi7 aPMC62966322pmcid7 a306476952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdoni, Solomon A10aComparative effect of selenium and glycine on hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death and activation of macrophage U937 cells  ap. 521-526.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effects of selenium and glycine (either separately or in combination) on hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death on U937 cells and activation of U937-derived macrophages were investigated. In the first instance, U937 cells were incubated with or without selenium (Se) or glycine (GLY) or both (Se+GLY) for 24 h before exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Control cells were not incubated with Se, GLY or exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Cell viability was later assessed via trypan blue and MTT assays. For the other experiment, U937 cells were transformed to the macrophage form using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate before incubating with or without Se, GLY, Se+GLY. Contents were subsequently exposed to hydrogen peroxide and 24 h later assessed for the production of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 and the expression of iNOS and NF-κB. The results revealed that hydrogen peroxide caused significant cell death which was ameliorated by both Se and GLY. Pre-incubation of the cells with both Se and GLY did not significantly enhance cell numbers compared to GLY (p>0.05). On the other hand, Se and GLY reduced hydrogen peroxide-mediated production of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 and expression of iNOS and NF-κB. Incubating the U937-derived macrophages with Se+GLY significantly ameliorated hydrogen peroxide-mediated activation of macrophages when compared to pre-treatments with Se or GLY (p<0.05). The findings demonstrate that both Se and GLY reduced hydrogen peroxide-induced alterations in U937 cells and U937-derived macrophages. Implications of the findings are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell death 3acell viability 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3aselenium 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aSelenium 0aGlycine 0aMacrophage 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aCell viability 0aTNF-α1 aOkoko, Tebekeme0 tJournal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (Print).g2017 Dec., v. 15, no. 2 p.521-526dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23376x1687-157X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgeb.2017.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012100162300002000283520178600303592002802089650002202117650001502139650003702154650002202191650001602213650001402229650001102243650001902254650001902273650002202292650001602314650003302330650001902363650002002382650001702402650002102419650001902440653003402459653002402493653002302517653001902540653001602559700002402575773012902599856007302728852000902801655001202810IND60527793520221122010231.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779352DNAL7 a10.1021/am505767c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaresh, Gollapally10aExcellent Sun-Light-Driven Photocatalytic Activity by Aurivillius Layered Perovskites, Bi5–xLaxTi3FeO15 (x = 1, 2)  ap. 21000-21010.  aAurivillius phase layered perovskites, Bi₅–ₓLaₓTi₃FeO₁₅ (x = 1, 2) are synthesized by solid-state reaction. The compounds are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), UV–vis diffuse reflectance (UV–vis DRS), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. UV–vis DRS data revealed that the compounds are visible light absorbing semiconductors with band gaps ranging from ∼2.0–2.7 eV. Photocatalytic activity studies by Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under sun-light irradiation showed that these layered oxides are very efficient photocatalysts in mild acidic medium. Scavenger test studies demonstrated that the photogenerated holes and superoxide radicals (O₂•–) are the active species responsible for RhB degradation over the Aurivillius layered perovskites. Comparison of PL intensity, dye adsorption and ζ-potential suggested that a slow e––h⁺ recombination and effective dye adsorption are crucial for the degradation process over these photocatalysts. Moreover, relative positioning of the valence and conduction band edges of the semiconductors, O₂/O₂•–, •OH/H₂O potential and HOMO–LUMO levels of RhB appears to be responsible for making the degradation hole-specific. Photocatalytic cycle tests indicated high stability of the catalysts in the reaction medium without any observable loss of activity. This work shows great potential in developing novel photocatalysts with layered structures for sun-light-driven oxidation and degradation processes largely driven by holes and without any intervention of hydroxyl radicals, which is one of the most common reactive oxygen species (ROS) in many advanced oxidation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoluminescence 3areflectance 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiconductors 3asolar radiation 3aspectroscopy 3asuperoxide anion 3azeta potential 0aBi5−xLaxTi3FeO15 (x = 1, 2) 0alayered perovskites 0aAurivillius phases 0aphotocatalysis 0arhodamine B1 aMandal, Tapas Kumar0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.21000-21010dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am505767c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016100167300001400328520129700342592002801639650001701667650001701684650001401701650001701715650001101732650001001743650002201753650001601775650003101791650001601822650001201838650001001850653001601860653002501876653001801901653001801919653001501937653000801952653000701960653000801967653000801975653000801983653000801991653000801999653000802007653000802015653000702023700006502030700001702095700002702112700006902139700006002208700002602268773012202294856008102416852000902497655001202506IND60596979620221119210928.0180622e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059697962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIstas, Geoffrey10aPlasma urolithin metabolites correlate with improvements in endothelial function after red raspberry consumption: A double-blind randomized controlled trial  ap. 43-51.  aRaspberries are a rich source of ellagitannins and anthocyanins. The aim of this work was to investigate whether raspberry consumption can improve vascular function and to understand which phenolic metabolites may be responsible for the effects. A 3 arm double-blind randomized controlled crossover human intervention trial was conducted in 10 healthy males. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured at baseline, 2 h, and 24 h post-consumption of 200 g and 400 g of red raspberries containing 201 or 403 mg of total (poly)phenols, or a matched control drink. Raspberry (poly)phenol metabolites were analyzed in plasma and urine by UPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry using authentic standards. Significant improvements in FMD were observed at 2 h (1.6% (95%CI 1.2, 1.9) and 1.2% (95% CI 0.8, 1.5)) and 24 h (1.0% (95% CI 0.6, 1.2) and 0.7% (95%CI 0.2, 0.9)) post-consumption of the 200 and 400 g raspberry drinks as compared to control, respectively. Plasma ellagic acid, urolithin A-3-glucuronide and urolithin A-sulfate correlated with the improvements in FMD at 2 and 24 h post consumption, respectively. Consumption of dietary achievable amounts of red raspberries acutely improves endothelial function up to 24 h and ellagitannins may be responsible for the observed effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus idaeus 3aanthocyanins 3abeverages 3aellagic acid 3ahumans 3amales 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3arandomized clinical trials 3araspberries 3atannins 3aurine 0aRaspberries 0aEndothelial function 0a(Poly)phenols 0aEllagittanins 0aUrolithins 0aAUC 0aAI 0aCVD 0aCAD 0aCHD 0aFMD 0aPWA 0aPWV 0aRCT 0aTP1 aFeliciano, Rodrigo P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8116-997X1 aWeber, Timon1 aGarcia-Villalba, Rocio1 aTomas-Barberan, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0790-17391 aHeiss, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3212-89951 aRodriguez-Mateos, Ana0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 651 p.43-51dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011600171506002800287520171300315592002802028506003702056650002002093650001302113650002602126650002302152650002802175650001802203650001502221650001002236650001002246650001702256650001302273651001102286653001402297653000902311653001802320653001202338653001802350700003102368700002302399700002402422700002702446700002602473773011302499856008302612852000902695655001202704IND60764535420221215143333.0211206s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076453542DNAL7 a10.37486/2675-1305.ec030362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeltrame, Luisa B.10aTicks (Acari: Ixodidae) in wild animals treated at the Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais State, Brazil  aResource is Open Access  aTicks have a great diversity of hosts, many of which are still being discovered. These parasites may be responsible for the transmission of several pathogens to animals and humans. For this reason, knowledge on tick species and their hosts is essential for planning actions in public health and fauna conservation. From February 2018 to July 2019, ticks found in animals treated at the Wild Animal Clinic of the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA) were surveyed. Animals came from nine municipalities at the southern region of Minas Gerais State, all close to the municipality of Lavras. During veterinary procedures the animals were inspected, and tick specimens were removed from the hosts’ skins with the help of tweezers, and posteriorly identified. One hundred and three specimens of ticks were removed from the hosts and allocated in five species of Amblyomma Koch, 1844 (Ixodidae) [A. nodosum (Neumann, 1899), A. sculptum Berlese, 1888, A. aureolatum (Pallas, 1772), A. calcaratum Neumann, 1899, and A. ovale (Koch, 1844)] and one of Rhipicephalus Latreille, 1806 [R. (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini, 1888)]. Ticks were collected from: Cariama cristata (Linnaeus, 1766) (Cariamidae); Cerdocyon thous Linnaeus, 1766 and Chrysocyon brachyurus Illiger,1815 (Canidae); Leopardus pardalis Linnaeus, 1758 (Felidae); Mazama gouazoubira Fischer, 1814 (Cervidae); Myrmecophaga tridactyla Linnaeus, 1758 (Myrmecophagidae); Sphiggurus villosus (F. Cuvier, 1823) (Erethizontidae). In this study no new parasite-host relationships were found, however, wild animals can be vectors of important diseases, and monitoring the occurrence of ectoparasites in wildlife is a significant step in public health policies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCerdocyon thous 3aCervidae 3aChrysocyon brachyurus 3aLeopardus pardalis 3aMyrmecophaga tridactyla 3aRhipicephalus 3aSphiggurus 3afauna 3aticks 3awild animals 3awildlife 3aBrazil 0aAmblyomma 0abird 0aectoparasites 0amammals 0aRhipicephalus1 aLeopoldo F. de O.

Biodiversitas 21: 4726-4731. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from the intestinal tract as probiotic could be beneficial because they could trigger the growth of the host by enhancing digestibility, increasing their immune system, and inhibiting pathogenic bacteria through the enzymatic process or metabolites production. The purposes of this study were to identify and characterize lactic acid bacteria from fecal pellets, coelomic fluid, and gastrointestinal tract of Nypa worm (Namalycastis rhodochorde). Bacterial isolation was carried out by the pour plate method on de Mann Rogosa Sharp Agar (MRSA). Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) isolates were purified and then physiologically characterized by some biochemical tests. Cellulolytic activities were carried out by detecting a clear zone formation on CMC-congo Red Agar. There were 20 isolates of lactic acid bacteria from fecal pellets, coelom fluid, and gastrointestinal tract of nypa worm. Ten isolates (50%) had cellulolytic activity on CMC-phenol red agar. Eight isolates were closely related to the genus Lactobacillus, while two isolates were closely related to the genus Bacillus. These cellulolytic bacteria could be developed further as probiotic in Nypa worm feed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aLactobacillus 3aNypa 3aagar 3adigestibility 3adigestive tract 3aimmune system 3aintestines 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aprobiotics 3aIndonesia 0abacillus 0acellulolytic activity 0alactic acid bacteria 0alactobacillus 0aprobiotic1 aSetyawati, Tri Rima1 aKurniatuhadi, Rikhsan0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Sept., v. 21, no. 10dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2110363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245010700176300001600283520176500299592002802064650001102092650002902103650001102132650001902143650001302162650002302175650001102198650002502209650001102234650001702245650001502262653002702277653001802304653002202322653002002344653001302364653000702377653001302384653000802397653000902405653000902414700002002423700002302443700002202466773012002488856008802608852000902696655001202705IND60555377520221120090150.0180830e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055537752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Meyer, Annelies10aImplementation of OPTIMASS to optimise municipal wastewater sludge processing chains: Proof of concept  ap. 168-178.  aIn sludge management, sludge is increasingly perceived as a marketable product rather than as a waste material. This awareness in combination with the variety of factors influencing the optimal management strategy and disposal route, introduces the need to optimise the sludge treatment throughout the whole chain instead of only minimising its production. In this paper, OPTIMASS, a mixed integer linear programming model to optimise strategic and tactical decisions in biomass-based supply chains, is proposed in order to meet this need. The applicability of OPTIMASS is illustrated through its implementation with a view to minimise the overall global warming impact of a real municipal wastewater sludge processing chain in “region X”. A first scenario addresses the optimisation of the allocation and treatment of municipal wastewater sludge within the current network. Second, OPTIMASS is used to identify the optimal location(s) for new drying facilities in this chain. Finally, the effect on the optimal chain of changes in municipal wastewater sludge production and of changes in global warming impact of the cement industry as a disposal route is evaluated.The analysis reveals that municipal wastewater sludge processing chains can be considered to be instances of the generic biomass-based supply chain and that the OPTIMASS tool can be applied to support strategic and tactical decisions for optimising sludge management in case new technologies, new treatment facility locations, new disposal options, etc. are at stake. The validity of the OPTIMASS approach is confirmed by the close correspondence between its outcome and the results of a decision support system, specifically developed for the municipal wastewater sludge processing chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3adecision support systems 3adrying 3aglobal warming 3aindustry 3alinear programming 3amodels 3amunicipal wastewater 3asludge 3asupply chain 3atechnology 0aMathematical modelling 0aSludge supply 0aSludge management 0aSludge disposal 0aOPTIMASS 0aDM 0aGWImpact 0aLCI 0aMILP 0aWWTP1 aCattrysse, Dirk1 aOstermeyer, Pieter1 aVan Orshoven, Jos0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2016 Nov., v. 114 p.168-178dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245013200197506007600329520144800405592002801853506003701881650001601918650002101934650002301955650002101978650001201999650002002011650002002031650001102051650002302062650002102085650001402106650001902120650002402139650001402163650001402177700001602191700001602207700002002223700001602243773012502259856007402384852000902458655001202467IND60649781220221207122226.0190706e20190508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064978122DNAL7 a10.3390/md170502752doi7 aPMC65627412pmcid7 a310720082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jing 10aWidespread Existence of Quorum Sensing Inhibitors in Marine Bacteria: Potential Drugs to Combat Pathogens with Novel Strategies  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aQuorum sensing (QS) is a phenomenon of intercellular communication discovered mainly in bacteria. A QS system consisting of QS signal molecules and regulatory protein components could control physiological behaviors and virulence gene expression of bacterial pathogens. Therefore, QS inhibition could be a novel strategy to combat pathogens and related diseases. QS inhibitors (QSIs), mainly categorized into small chemical molecules and quorum quenching enzymes, could be extracted from diverse sources in marine environment and terrestrial environment. With the focus on the exploitation of marine resources in recent years, more and more QSIs from the marine environment have been investigated. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of QSIs from marine bacteria. Firstly, screening work of marine bacteria with potential QSIs was concluded and these marine bacteria were classified. Afterwards, two categories of marine bacteria-derived QSIs were summarized from the aspects of sources, structures, QS inhibition mechanisms, environmental tolerance, effects/applications, etc. Next, structural modification of natural small molecule QSIs for future drug development was discussed. Finally, potential applications of QSIs from marine bacteria in human healthcare, aquaculture, crop cultivation, etc. were elucidated, indicating promising and extensive application perspectives of QS disruption as a novel antimicrobial strategy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquaculture 3aaquatic bacteria 3acell communication 3adrug development 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3amarine environment 3amarine resources 3apathogens 3aquorum sensing 3aregulatory proteins 3ascreening 3avirulence1 aLi, Xinyun 1 aHou, Xiyan 1 aQuan, Chunshan 1 aChen, Ming 0 tMarine drugs.g2019 May 08, v. 17, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md170502753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245016100166300001400327520148400341592002801825650002501853650002201878650002301900650001101923650002601934650002201960650001101982650001901993650001402012650001202026650001602038651001002054653003402064653003002098653002002128653002202148700001302170700001702183700001602200700001802216773011802234856008802352852000902440655001202449IND60555377820221120062112.0180830e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055537782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFei, Fan10aHow to integrate the informal recycling system into municipal solid waste management in developing countries: Based on a China’s case in Suzhou urban area  ap. 74-86.  aChina and lots of other developing countries have been facing an increase in population and immense economic development that lead to an enormous growth in solid waste generation, and many developing countries aspire to achieve modern waste management systems. Domestic recyclable resources (DRR) are the recyclable part of the household waste, and are recycled mainly by informal systems in many developing countries. The recycling system in China is a typical example which exist in formal and informal recycling systems simultaneously. Based on filed research, questionnaire survey and interview, this paper carefully studies the recycling paths, material flows and cash flows in the informal recycling system in Suzhou urban area, and aims to give targeted policy suggestions in the framework of Pressure–State–Response (PSR) model. Based on the result, the recycling rate in Suzhou urban area was about 22% in 2013. It is suggested for the government to integrate the informal recycling system into municipal solid waste management by (1) giving professional training of the recycling practitioners and improving their recycling facilities, (2) giving the formal recycling channels a price advantage, (3) setting up information platforms, and (4) optimizing the layouts of recycling systems. These quantitate results and policy suggestions could be helpful to integrate the informal recycling system into municipal solid waste management of the formal recycling systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aissues and policy 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3apopulation growth 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3arecycling 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aChina 0aDomestic recyclable resources 0aInformal recycling system 0aFlow estimation 0aPolicy suggestion1 aQu, Lili1 aWen, Zongguo1 aXue, Yanyan1 aZhang, Huanan0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2016 July, v. 110 p.74-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03997naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245019200162300001400354500001900368520187200387592002802259650002102287650002902308650001802337650002502355650001502380650002302395650002702418650001602445650001602461650002302477650001802500650001602518650002402534650001202558650001202570650001902582650002002601650001602621650001202637650002302649650001002672650002102682650001002703650002102713650001202734650001002746650002002756650001002776650000702786650001302793650001002806650001102816650002102827650001402848650001102862653001202873653001602885653001402901653002802915653002102943700001302964700001702977700001502994700001503009773012703024856007903151852000903230655001203239IND60727208520221119032844.0210209e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072720852DNAL7 a10.3382/japr.2012-005772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYalçın, S.10aEffects of dietary yeast autolysate (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) on performance, carcass and gut characteristics, blood profile, and antibody production to sheep red blood cells in broilers  ap. 55-61.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was conducted to determine the effects of dietary yeast autolysate on performance, carcass and gut traits, blood parameters, and humoral immune response of broilers. A total of 175 day-old Ross 308 male broiler chicks were allocated into one control group and 4 treatment groups each containing 5 replicate groups of 7 chicks. A basal diet was supplemented with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 g/kg of yeast autolysate (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, InteWall) to generate dietary treatments. The experimental period lasted 42 d. Supplemental yeast autolysate improved live weight gain (P < 0.01) and feed conversion (P < 0.001) during the starter period (1 to 21 d). Cumulative FCR was decreased (P < 0.05) during the overall period (1 to 42 d) with 2 and 3 g/kg of yeast autolysate supplementation when compared with the control diet. There were no dietary effects on final live weight, feed intake, excreta pH, excreta moisture, carcass yield, and the relative weight of gizzard, liver, heart, spleen, bursa of Fabricius, and the intestinal weights. Yeast autolysate supplementation decreased relative weight of abdominal fat (P < 0.001) and Escherichia coli count of the digesta (P < 0.01) and increased antibody titers to SRBC (P < 0.001). The pH of jejunal and ileal digesta was decreased at the 2, 3, and 4 g/kg of yeast autolysate supplementation compared with that of birds fed the control diet (P < 0.001). Dietary treatments did not significantly affect blood serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, protein, uric acid, aspartate amino transferase, and alanine amino transferase. It was concluded that the dietary supplementation at the level of 2 and 3 g/kg of yeast autolysate was an effective feed additive in broiler feeding because of the increased growth performance, increased immunocompetence, and the reduction of E. coli colonization in the intestine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aabdominal fat 3aalanine transaminase 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3abursa of Fabricius 3acarcass yield 3acholesterol 3adietary supplements 3adigesta 3aexcreta 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agizzard 3agrowth performance 3aheart 3ahumoral immunity 3aileum 3aimmunocompetence 3ajejunum 3aliver 3aliveweight gain 3amales 3apH 3aresearch 3asheep 3aspleen 3atriacylglycerols 3auric acid 3ayeasts 0abroiler 0aperformance 0agut trait 0ahumoral immune response 0ayeast autolysate1 aEser, H.1 aYalçın, S.1 aCengiz, S.1 aEltan, Ö.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 22, no. 1 p.55-61dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr.2012-005773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245013900170300001800309506002800327520242400355592002802779506003702807650002202844650002102866650001902887650002102906650001102927650002102938650001402959650001402973650001802987651001403005653002603019653002703045653002603072653001803098700003703116700002103153773010403174856008003278852000903358655001203367IND60764536120221207135654.0211116e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076453612DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1804392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRETNANINGDYAH, CATUR10aUse of local Hydromacrophytes as phytoremediation agent in pond to improve irrigation water quality evaluated by Diatom Biotic Indices  ap. 1611-1617.  aResource is Open Access  aRetnaningdyah C, Arisoesilaningsih E, Samino S. 2017. Use of local Hydromacrophytes as phytoremediation agent in pond to improve irrigation water quality evaluated by Diatom Biotic Indices. Biodiversitas 18: 1596-1602. Irrigation water in Indonesia generally has been polluted because of agricultural, industrial and domestic activity. The aims of this research were to determine the effectiveness of phytoremediation models conducted by planting some local Hydromacrophytes in three phytoremediation ponds through a continuous culture system with water discharge about 0.3 L/seconds for improving the irrigation water quality. The quasiexperimental research was conducted in a phytoremediation pond located in Kepanjen District of Malang, East Java Indonesia. The phytoremediation pond was divided into four interconnected sections. Pond 1 and 2 were planted with some of floating leaf and emergent hydromacrophyte, pond 3 was planted by combinations of same plants added with submerged Hydromacrophytes, while pond 4 was container pond to collecting the water as a result of phytoremediation process. The success of phytoremediation process was known from some physico-chemical parameters of water and some of diatom biotic indices (trophic diatom index/TDI, percentage of pollution tolerant value (%PTV), and Shannon Wiener diversity Index) that was found from artificial substrate been installed in the early treatment. The water quality monitoring performed in each part of the ponds after the plants grew steadily. The results showed that planting of Hydromacrophytes can significantly improve the physico-chemical quality of water. This was reflected in the decline value of conductivity (from 188 Î¼S/cm to 182 Î¼S/cm), turbidity (30 NTU become 8 NTU), total suspended solid (TSS) from 31.3 mg/L to be 5.5 mg/L, nitrates (7.5 mg/L to 3.3 mg/L) and dissolved phosphates (from 0.16 mg./L become 0.04 mg/L) and increasing value of dissolved oxygen (DO) in waters from 2.6 mg/L become 2.9 mg/L. Based on biotic indices there were improvement of the water quality from heavily polluted (diversity index 0.91) become moderately polluted (diversity index 2.07), eutrophic (TDI 52) become mesoeutrophic (TDI 38), and from heavily organic pollution (PTV 93%) to be some organic pollution contribute to eutrophication (PTV 38%). Improvement of water quality was effectively occur after passing through the third pond.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillariophyceae 3adissolved oxygen 3aeutrophication 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3aphytoremediation 3apollution 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3aIndonesia 0adiatom biotic indices 0alocal hydromacrophytes 0aphytoremediation pond 0awater quality1 aARISOESILANINGSIH, ENDANG ENDANG1 aSAMINO, SETIJONO0 tBiodiversitas.g2017 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.1611-1617dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1804393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007400170300001600244520104000260592002801300650001401328650001501342650002201357650001001379650003001389650001301419650002301432650001701455700002001472700001701492773012501509856008201634852000901716655001201725IND60624168020221120041951.0181201e199812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062416802DNAL7 a10.1177/0884533698013006042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilkroski, Marcia10aTube Feeding Audit Reveals Hidden Costs and Risks of Current Practice  ap. 283-290.  aA multidisciplinary audit at 11 teaching hospitals assessed hidden costs and quality issues related to tube feeding. Data were collected on 417 tube-fed patients via interviews and review of departmental records. Hospitals averaged 38 tube-fed patients per day and 13 different formulas. Average tube feeding duration was 8.1 days. Hidden costs were identified: 18% to 62% of formulas were wasted per patient per day. The mean annual cost of wasted tube feeding formula per facility was $26,846. Open systems required 14 min/patient/d to manage, compared with 2 min/patient/d for closed systems; the open system required additional administration sets, which cost each facility an average of $47,744 per year; 33% of feedings required additional labor for manipulations. Risks identified included underfeeding of prescribed volume, exceeding hang-time policy, and practices associated with bacterial risk. The audit addressed the need for multidisciplinary evaluation of tube feeding programs to reveal hidden costs and true practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahospitals 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3anutrition risk assessment 3apatients 3arestricted feeding 3atube feeding1 aAllen, Francine1 aStorm, Heidi0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g1998 Dec., v. 13, no. 6 p.283-290dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0884533698013006043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014000170300001200310520137400322592002801696650003101724650003101755650001601786650001701802650002301819650001801842650002001860650001801880650000901898650001401907650001501921650001201936650001601948650001101964650001201975650002201987653001702009653003102026653002602057653002302083653001602106653003602122700002202158700002602180700001802206700002602224773012002250856008102370852000902451655001202460IND60596980020221119102333.0180622e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059698002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTumhom, Suthipapun10aSignificance of H461 at subsite +1 in substrate binding and transglucosylation activity of amylomaltase from Corynebacterium glutamicum  ap. 3-8.  aAmylomaltase (AM) catalyzes inter- and intra-molecular transglycosylation reactions of glucan to yield linear and cyclic oligosaccharide products. The functional roles of the conserved histidine at position 461 in the active site of AM from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgAM) was investigated. H461 A/S/D/R/W were constructed, their catalytic properties were compared to the wild-type (WT). A significant decrease in transglucosylation activities was observed, especially in H461A mutant, while hydrolysis activity was barely affected. The transglucosylation factor of the H461A-CgAM was decreased by 8.6 folds. WT preferred maltotriose (G3) as substrate for disproportionation reaction, but all H461 mutants showed higher preference for maltose (G2). Using G3 substrate, kcat/Km values of H461 mutated CgAMs were 40–64 folds lower, while the Km values were twice higher than those of WT. All mutants could not produce large-ring cyclodextrin (LR-CD) product. The heat capacity profile indicated that WT had higher thermal stability than H461A. The X-ray structure of WT showed two H-bonds between H461 and heptasaccharide analog at subsite +1, while no such bonding was observed from the model structure of H461A. The importance of H461 on substrate binding with CgAM was evidenced. We are the first to mutate an active site histidine in AM to explore its function.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-alpha-glucanotransferase 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aX-radiation 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3acyclodextrins 3aenzyme activity 3aglycosylation 3aheat 3ahistidine 3ahydrolysis 3amaltose 3amaltotriose 3amodels 3amutants 3athermal stability 0aAmylomaltase 0aCorynebacterium glutamicum 0aActive site histidine 0aTransglucosylation 0aCyclization 0aLarge-ring cyclodextrin (LR-CD)1 aKrusong, Kuakarun1 aKidokoro, Shunʼichi,1 aKatoh, Etsuko1 aPongsawasdi, Piamsook0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 652 p.3-8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008500168506002800253520096400281592002801245506003701273650002101310650001301331650002001344650002301364650001601387650001401403650002401417650001701441650003101458650002401489650001601513650002501529653002101554653002201575653003101597653002001628653001301648653001901661700002101680700002901701700002201730700001601752700001801768700001701786700001801803773009801821856008201919852000902001655001202010IND60764536220221207135710.0211210e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076453622DNAL7 a10.3389/fagro.2021.7943122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillow, Jonathan10aRNAi Targets in Agricultural Pest Insects: Advancements, Knowledge Gaps, and IPM  aResource is Open Access  aThe unprecedented target-specificity of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), due to its sequence-specific mode of action, puts dsRNA at the forefront of biosafe insecticide technology. Since 2007, sensitive target genes have been identified in numerous crop pest insects, with an end goal of applying RNA interference (RNAi) in pest management. Key RNAi targets identified include genes involved in (1) feeding and digestion, (2) production of dsRNases, (3) resistance to insecticides and plant allelochemicals, (4) reproductive fitness, and (5) transmission of plant viruses. Despite the advances, there remain critical knowledge gaps in each of these areas. Particular emphasis must be placed on ensuring RNAi's compatibility with integrated pest management (IPM), via further identification of molecular targets that reduce crop damage while sustaining pest (host) populations for highly specialized biocontrol agents, the latter representing a core pillar of IPM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3aagronomy 3aallelochemicals 3abiological control 3acrop damage 3adigestion 3adouble-stranded RNA 3ainsecticides 3aintegrated pest management 3amechanism of action 3aplant pests 3areproductive fitness 0aRNA interference 0amolecular targets 0aintegrated pest management 0acrop protection 0aagronomy 0agene silencing1 aWillow, Jonathan1 aTaning, Clauvis Nji Tizi1 aCook, Samantha M.1 aSulg, Silva1 aSilva, Ana I.1 aSmagghe, Guy1 aVeromann, Eve0 tFrontiers in agronomy.g2021 Dec., v. 3dFrontiers Media S.A.wJournal:27918x2673-32187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fagro.2021.7943123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245020700162300001800369520164600387592002802033650003402061650001702095650001902112650002402131650001602155650001602171650002102187650001302208650002102221650000902242650002402251650001802275650002002293650001102313650002902324650001702353650004402370700001302414700001802427700001202445700001502457700001102472700001402483700001702497700001702514700001502531700001702546700001502563700001602578700001302594700002602607773014802633856008102781852000902862655001202871IND60596423120221118022849.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1038-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yue10aSimultaneous determination of sulfur compounds from the sulfur pathway in rat plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry: application to the study of the effect of Shao Fu Zhu Yu decoction  ap. 3743-3755.  aA sensitive, accurate, and time-saving approach was developed for the simultaneous quantification of eight sulfur compounds in the sulfur pathway, which could reflect the status of an organism, including oxidative stress, signal transduction, enzyme reaction, and so on. In order to overcome the instability of highly reactive sulfhydryl compounds, N-ethylmaleimide derivatization was adopted to effectively protect sulfhydryl-containing samples. Using isotope-labeled glutathione (GSH-¹³C₂, ¹⁵N), the validated method was demonstrated to offer satisfactory linearity, accuracy, and precision. Separation was done by UHPLC, using a BEH amide column. Accordingly, 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile was selected as the precipitant. A tandem mass spectrometer was coupled to the chromatographic system and afforded a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL. Good linearity was maintained over a wide concentration range (r² > 0.994), and the accuracy was in the range of 86.6–114% for all the studied compounds. The precision, expressed in RSD%, ranged from 1.1% to 9.4% as intraday variability and less than 13% as interday precision for all of the analytes. The approach was applied to study the potential therapeutic mechanism of a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, Shao Fu Zhu Yu decoction. The results suggested that Shao Fu Zhu Yu decoction might protect against oxidative damage by increasing the concentrations of sulfhydryl compounds. Graphical abstract An approach to quantitatively determining sulfur compounds in the sulfur pathway simultaneously wasestablished and applied to the study of the effect of Shao Fu Zhu Yu decoction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aacetonitrile 3aderivatization 3aenzymatic reactions 3aformic acid 3aglutathione 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3asignal transduction 3aspectrometers 3astable isotopes 3asulfur 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atherapeutics 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aKang, An1 aDeng, Haishan1 aShi, Le1 aSu, Shulan1 aYu, Li1 aXie, Tong1 aShan, Jinjun1 aWen, Hongmei1 aChi, Yumei1 aHan, Shuying1 aSu, Ruilin1 aSong, Yilin1 aChen, Xi1 aShaikh, ArmaanBasheer0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2018 June, v. 410, no. 16 p.3743-3755dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-018-1038-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02057naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001700172245017000189300001600359520047900375592002800854650001700882650002200899650001300921650001300934650001200947650001500959650002800974650002701002650002601029653002501055653001701080653001601097653004601113653003601159653005201195700002201247700002601269700002001295700001901315700002401334700002301358773009701381856008801478852000901566655001201575IND60113557420221117030637.0190318e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011355742DNAL7 a232186102pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUemura, Yuka10aMicrotropins A–I: 6′-O-(2″S,3″R)-2″-Ethyl-2″,3″-dihydroxybutyrates of aliphatic alcohol β-d-glucopyranosides from the branches of Microtropis japonica  ap. 140-147.  aFrom the branches of Microtropis japonica (Celastraceae), nine aliphatic glucosides, named microtropins A–I, were isolated.

Researchers have extensively studied the energy, protein, amino acid, and mineral composition of cDDGS; however, an evaluation of the vitamin content of the cDDGS has yet to be undertaken. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the vitamin composition of cDDGS. In addition, correlations between crude fat and vitamin E (α-tocopherol) of the 6 samples of cDDGS were determined. Crude fat and 8 representative vitamins [vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E (α-tocopherol), thiamine, riboflavin, biotin, pantothenic acid, and pyridoxine] of cDDGS samples were analyzed and the determined vitamin content was compared with the standard values of the NRC. The mean value of vitamin E (α-tocopherol) in the 6 cDDGS samples was 6.8 mg/kg. In addition, the mean values of thiamine and riboflavin in the 6 cDDGS samples were 7.7 and 2.3 mg/kg, respectively. The mean values of pyridoxine and pantothenic acid in the cDDGS samples were 3.5 and 10.9 mg/kg, respectively. On the basis of regression analysis, a positive relationship existed between crude fat and vitamin E (R = 0.6677, P = 0.1473) in the 6 samples. These findings add to the information available regarding the vitamin profile of cDDGS and will assist in decisions made on the use of cDDGS in poultry diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aamino acids 3abiotin 3acoproducts 3acorn 3acrude fat 3aenergy 3aethanol 3amineral content 3apantothenic acid 3apoultry 3apyridoxine 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3ariboflavin 3athiamin 3avitamin A 3avitamin content 0acorn distillers dried grains with solubles 0avitamin1 aBatal, A.B.1 aWard, N.E.1 aDale, N.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 22, no. 1 p.71-74dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr.2012-005953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01548naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012100159300001800280520032500298592002800623650001200651650002700663650002300690650002200713650002300735650001900758650001800777650002100795650002700816700001800843700001500861700001300876700001300889700001500902700001600917773013300933856007501066852000901141655001201150IND60658857320221118235529.0190826e20110214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065885732DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04783j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shengxue10aManganese oxide nanocomposite fabricated by a simple solid-state reaction and its ultraviolet photoresponse property  ap. 2619-2621.  aWe present a facile synthesis of manganese oxide (MnO₂) nanocomposite with ultraviolet (UV) photosensitive characteristic by a solid-state reaction based on the reduction of potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) by aniline, which provides a new family and more selectivity for UV photosensitive nanomaterials in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3amanganese dioxide 3amanganese monoxide 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aphotosensitivity 3apotassium permanganate1 aYang, Hongyan1 aMa, Huiyan1 aGuo, Shu1 aCao, Fei1 aGong, Jian1 aDeng, Yulin0 tChemical communications.g2011 Feb. 14, v. 47, no. 9 p.2619-2621dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc04783j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009400175300001600269520121500285592002801500650001201528650001201540650001901552650001101571650001401582650001101596650001501607700002101622700002301643773010201666856008901768852000901857655001201866IND60534291020170629000000.0160802e20160121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053429102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b023222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJindrová, Tereza10aPhase Behavior Modeling of Bitumen and Light Normal Alkanes and CO2 by PR-EOS and CPA-EOS  ap. 515-525.  aThe Peng–Robinson (PR) and cubic-plus-association (CPA) equations of state are used to predict the phase behavior and solubility of CO₂ and normal alkanes from C₁ to nC₁₀ in several bitumens. Both of the equations of state are investigated over wide ranges of temperature and pressure. The results show that the PR-EOS describes mixure of bitumens with CO₂ and alkanes when there is no second liquid phase or when the asphaltene content in the second liquid phase is not high. The CPA-EOS describes the phase behavior of mixtures of bitumens and CO₂ and alkanes in liquid–liquid states even when the asphaltene content of one of the phases is high. High asphaltene content results in significant association and cross-association where the CPA-EOS is a natural choice. In this work the only adjustable parameter in the CPA-EOS is the cross-association energy parameter, and we show that the solubility of CO₂ and alkanes in bitumens is usually not sensitive to this parameter. However, in two-phase liquid–liquid and three-phase liquid–liquid–vapor states with one phase having a high concentration of asphaltenes, the results become sensitive to the cross-association energy parameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3abitumen 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aequations 3amodels 3asolubility1 aMikyška, Jiří1 aFiroozabadi, Abbas0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Jan. 21, v. 30, no. 1 p.515-525dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b023223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245014700165300001400312500001900326520104000345592002801385650002001413650001401433650001601447650001801463650001701481650001301498650001301511653001201524653001101536653002301547653001301570700001701583700001301600700001401613700001601627773012701643856007901770852000901849655001201858IND60727208820221119031543.0210209e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072720882DNAL7 a10.3382/japr.2012-006062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazwinski, T.A.10aObservations of benzimidazole efficacies against Ascaridia dissimilis, Ascaridia galli, and Heterakis gallinarum in naturally infected poultry  ap. 75-79.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo studies were conducted to provide current efficacy evaluation for benzimidazoles used in poultry.

Based on treatment group geometric means for all stages combined, efficacies for A. dissimilis were 0, 71.4, and 83.3% for albendazole drench, fenbendazole drench, and fenbendazole-medicated feed, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscaridia galli 3aHeterakis 3aalbendazole 3abenzimidazole 3afenbendazole 3ageometry 3aresearch 0achicken 0aturkey 0anematode infection 0aefficacy1 aTucker, C.A.1 aWray, E.1 aJones, L.1 aClark, F.D.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 22, no. 1 p.75-79dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr.2012-006063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01213naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011100161300001800272520018400290592002800474650001400502650001400516650002700530650001700557650001200574650001400586700002600600700002100626700002400647773013200671856007500803852000900878655001200887IND60658857420221118235449.0190826e20110507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065885742DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04789a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDay, Benjamin M.10aBicyclic guanidinate compounds of magnesium and their activity as pre-catalysts in the Tishchenko reaction  ap. 4995-4997.  aA synthetic route to magnesium guanidinate compounds that avoids ligand redistribution is reported; selected derivatives are active pre-catalysts in the dimerization of aldehydes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acatalysts 3achemical communication 3adimerization 3aligands 3amagnesium1 aMansfield, Natalie E.1 aColes, Martyn P.1 aHitchcock, Peter B.0 tChemical communications.g2011 May 7, v. 47, no. 17 p.4995-4997dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc04789a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005600188245022100244300001100465506007600476520133700552592002801889596003601917596006301953506003702016650002602053650002402079650002102103650002502124650003102149650002902180650002802209650001402237650003802251650002102289650003502310650001902345650002002364650001702384650001802401650001602419650002602435650004302461650005202504650001402556650002402570650002102594650001402615700001302629700001202642700001802654700001502672700001702687700001302704773012902717856008202846852000902928655001202937IND60638887620221207072753.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063888762DNAL7 a310359752pmid7 aPMC64892792pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2504-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4874-105410aEffect of Celastrus orbiculatus in inhibiting Helicobacter pylori induced inflammatory response by regulating epithelial mesenchymal transition and targeting miR-21/PDCD4 signaling pathway in gastric epithelial cells  ap. 91.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The extract of Celastrus orbiculatus (COE) have been studied for anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) activity and anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism by which COE inhibits H. pylori-induced inflammatory response has not been fully elucidated so far. METHODS: The effects of COE on viability, morphological changes, inflammatory cytokine secretion, protein and mRNA expression were analyzed by MTT assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, western blot and real-time PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. The methylation level of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) promoter was investigated by methylation-specific PCR. (MSP) . RESULTS: COE effectively inhibited the H.pylori-induced inflammatory response by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The methylation level of PDCD4 promoter was suppressed by COE, which increased the expression ofPDCD4. Moreover, COE could inhibit microRNA-21 (miR-21) expression, as shown by an enhancement of its target gene PDCD4. Furthermore, both miR-21 over-expression and PDCD4 silencing attenuated the anti-inflammatory effect. of COE. CONCLUSIONS: COE inhibits H. pylori induced inflammatory response through regulating EMT, correlating with inhibition of miR-21/PDCD4 signal pathways in gastric epithelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data  a81603439cYoung Scientists Fund  a1708085QH189cNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCelastrus orbiculatus 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantibacterial properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3acytokines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agastric mucosa 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amethylation 3aprogrammed cell death 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3atoxicity testing 3aviability1 aLiu, Lei1 aHu, Lei1 aDong, Wenqing1 aZhang, Mei1 aLiu, Yanqing1 aLi, Ping0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.91-91dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2504-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002600186245006700212506007600279520122400355592002801579506003701607650001501644650001101659650002301670650001401693650000901707650001001716650001201726650000901738650001101747650001601758650001101774650002001785650001101805650001901816700001701835700001501852700001601867700001801883700002001901773012001921856007902041852000902120655001202129IND60649707720221207073257.0190705e20190609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064970772DNAL7 a10.3390/insects100601632doi7 aPMC66277022pmcid7 a311818612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddiqui, Junaid  Ali10aFunctional Morphology and Defensive Behavior in a Social Aphid  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSocial aphids produce different morphs, which are genetically identical but morphologically different. Each morph performs a different duty in its community. Social aphids usually produce morphologically distinct soldiers to protect their colonies. The social aphid Pseudoregma bambucicola produces sterile first instar soldiers with specialized body parts and unique defensive behaviors, such as hind leg waving. By using this species as a research model, this study tested the assumption that the functional morphological basis of defensive behaviors of soldiers is related to specialized body parts. Field observations and a comprehensive morphometric analysis were carried out for natural populations. The results showed significant differences in functional morphology between soldiers, first instar nymphs, and adults. Elongated hind legs in soldiers are an important functional morphological basis for the deimatic behavior of hind leg waving, while sclerotized front legs and head horns are related to the function of directly attacking natural enemies. The size variation of different body parts among different morphs also indicates a cost&ndash;benefit trade-off in the evolution of the social aphid species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAphidoidea 3aadults 3adefensive behavior 3aevolution 3ahead 3ahorns 3ainstars 3alegs 3amodels 3amorphometry 3amorphs 3anatural enemies 3anymphs 3asclerotization1 aZou, Xuting 1 aLiu, Qian 1 aZhang, Hui 1 aLin, Xiaolan 1 aHuang, Xiaolei 0 tInsects.g2019 June 09, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects100601633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245004000202506007600242520110200318592002801420506003701448650001301485650001701498650001401515650001101529650002201540650002401562650002301586650001801609650001801627650001001645650001001655650001301665650002101678650001801699650002601717650001101743650002501754650001401779700001801793700001901811773012501830856007401955852000902029655001202038IND60649782020221207131216.0190706e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064978202DNAL7 a10.3390/md170502822doi7 aPMC65625862pmcid7 a310834462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAḥmad, Bilāl,10aOceans as a Source of Immunotherapy  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMarine flora is taxonomically diverse, biologically active, and chemically unique. It is an excellent resource, which offers great opportunities for the discovery of new biopharmaceuticals such as immunomodulators and drugs targeting cancerous, inflammatory, microbial, and fungal diseases. The ability of some marine molecules to mediate specific inhibitory activities has been demonstrated in a range of cellular processes, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell migration and adhesion. Immunomodulators have been shown to have significant therapeutic effects on immune-mediated diseases, but the search for safe and effective immunotherapies for other diseases such as sinusitis, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and allergies is ongoing. This review focuses on the marine-originated bioactive molecules with immunomodulatory potential, with a particular focus on the molecular mechanisms of specific agents with respect to their targets. It also addresses the commercial utilization of these compounds for possible drug improvement using metabolic engineering and genomics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3aasthma 3aatopic dermatitis 3abioactive compounds 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acell adhesion 3acell movement 3aflora 3afungi 3agenomics 3aimmunomodulators 3aimmunotherapy 3ametabolic engineering 3aoceans 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asinusitis1 aShah, Masaud 1 aChoi, Sangdun 0 tMarine drugs.g2019 May 10, v. 17, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md170502823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013100171300001600302520172500318592002802043650002902071650001302100650001602113650002202129650001102151650000902162650001602171650000902187650001102196650001302207650004402220650001302264650001902277653001402296653002102310653000902331653002602340653000802366653002202374700002402396700002102420700002202441700002202463700002502485773011802510856008502628852000902713655001202722IND60596980520221119102229.0191227e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059698052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDantas, Joana M.10aMolecular interactions between Geobacter sulfurreducens triheme cytochromes and the redox active analogue for humic substances  ap. 619-630.  aThe bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens can transfer electrons to quinone moieties of humic substances or to anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), a model for the humic acids. The reduced form of AQDS (AH2QDS) can also be used as energy source by G. sulfurreducens. Such bidirectional utilization of humic substances confers competitive advantages to these bacteria in Fe(III) enriched environments. Previous studies have shown that the triheme cytochrome PpcA from G. sulfurreducens has a bifunctional behavior toward the humic substance analogue. It can reduce AQDS but the protein can also be reduced by AH2QDS. Using stopped-flow kinetic measurements we were able to demonstrate that other periplasmic members of the PpcA-family in G. sulfurreducens (PpcB, PpcD and PpcE) also showed the same behavior. The extent of the electron transfer is thermodynamically controlled favoring the reduction of the cytochromes. NMR spectra recorded for 13C,15N-enriched samples in the presence increasing amounts of AQDS showed perturbations in the chemical shift signals of the cytochromes. The chemical shift perturbations on cytochromes backbone NH and 1H heme methyl signals were used to map their interaction regions with AQDS, showing that each protein forms a low-affinity binding complex through well-defined positive surface regions in the vicinity of heme IV (PpcB, PpcD and PpcE) and I (PpcE). Docking calculations performed using NMR chemical shift perturbations allowed modeling the interactions between AQDS and each cytochrome at a molecular level. Overall, the results obtained provided important structural-functional relationships to rationalize the microbial respiration of humic substances in G. sulfurreducens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacter sulfurreducens 3abacteria 3acytochromes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aheme 3ahumic acids 3airon 3amodels 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquinones 3athermodynamics 0aGeobacter 0aHumic substances 0aAQDS 0aMultiheme cytochromes 0aNMR 0aElectron transfer1 aFerreira, Marisa R.1 aCatarino, Teresa1 aKokhan, Oleksandr1 aPokkuluri, P.

CT scans were performed using a bone and soft tissue window setting, and three-dimensional surface reconstructed CT images were obtained. The MRI protocol was based on the use of Spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted and Gradient-echo (GE) STIR T2-weighted pulse sequences. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were taken in the transverse, sagittal and dorsal planes. We also performed anatomical dissections to facilitate the interpretation of the different structures of the tarsus joint and allow comparisons with CT and MRI images. RESULTS: The CT images allowed us to observe differences between the bones and soft tissues of the tarsal joint. When applying the bone window setting, the obtained footage showed the anatomy between the medulla and cortex. Additionally, the trabecular bone was delineated. By contrast, the soft tissue window allowed the main soft tissue structures of the tarsal joint, including ligaments, muscles and tendons, to be differentiated. Footage of the main anatomical structures of the standard tiger tarsus was obtained through MRI. The SE T1-weighted images showed the best evaluation of the cortical, subchondral and trabecular bone of the tibia, fibula, tarsus and metatarsus bones. Nonetheless, the GE STIR T2-weighted images allowed us to better visualize the articular cartilage and synovial fluid. In both MRI pulse sequences, the ligaments and tendons appeared with low signal intensity compared with muscles that were visible with intermediate signal intensity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this CT and MRI study of the Bengal tiger tarsal joint provide some valuable anatomical information and may be useful for diagnosing disorders in this large non-domestic cat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPanthera tigris tigris 3acartilage 3acomputed tomography 3acortex 3afibula 3aligaments 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amagnetism 3ametatarsus 3amuscles 3asynovial fluid 3atendons 3atibia 3aveterinary medicine1 aMatos, Jorge1 aEncinoso, Mario1 aGil, Francisco1 aArtiles, Alejandro1 aMartínez-Gomariz, Francisco1 aVázquez, José Maria0 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.126-126dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1865-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005100140245012400191500002000315520194700335592002802282596005902310596004302369596013602412650001102548650001102559650001802570650001102588650002602599650001502625650001802640650001702658650002502675650001802700650001602718700001902734700001802753700001602771700001702787773013502804856007402939852000903013655001203022IND60625482020221121100353.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062548202DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.129152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1809-436210aEffect of fruit moving speed on online prediction of soluble solids content of apple using Vis/NIR diffuse transmission  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of fruit moving speed on online prediction of soluble solids content (SSC) of “Fuji” apples based on visible and near‐infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy was studied. Diffuse transmission spectra between 615 and 1,045 nm were collected with a commercial online system at speeds of 0.3 m/s (S1), 0.5 m/s (S2), and 0.7 m/s (S3). Compensation models for SSC of each speed alone (local models) and all speeds (global model) were established using partial least squares (PLS). For global model, spectra of each sample were divided into three parts (P1, P2, and P3), three kinds of spectra partition combinations (P12, P13, and P23) were established. Results showed that S3 performed better and the influence of speed on spectra greatly affected SSC evaluation accuracy between local models. Comparatively, global model was insensitive to fruit moving speed variation and effective wavelengths (EWs) selected by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) after Savitzky–Golay smoothing (SGS) achieved better results than local models. Importantly, 36 EWs selected by CARS after SGS of global‐P13 model achieved the best results with rₚ and RMSEP of 0.8419, 0.8895, 0.8948 and 0.6281, 0.5318, 0.5196°Brix, respectively. Generally, global‐P13 model with EWs is promisingly applied to online SSC prediction of apple by Vis/NIR diffuse transmission. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: It is of great value to study nondestructive and rapid methods for detecting apple SSC to meet the ever‐growing needs of consumers for continuous supply and high‐quality fruit. The methods and results in this study can provide basic references for Vis/NIR diffuse transmittance online detection of SSC of “Fuji” apple about fruit moving speed variation and model simplification. It is of great social value for developing a real‐time evaluation system of apple SSC in postharvest treatment or focusing on quality changing in storage shelf.  aPublisher supplied data  a31671927cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aZ171100001117035cBeijing Nova Program  aKJCX20170417cScience and Technology Innovation Ability Construction Project of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Science 3aapples 3afruits 3aleast squares 3amodels 3apostharvest treatment 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3aspectroscopy 3atotal soluble solids 3atransmittance 3awavelengths1 aHuang, Wenqian1 aFan, Shuxiang1 aLi, Jiangbo1 aChen, Liping0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2018 Dec., v. 41, no. 8 p.e12915-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.129153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001300172245006300185300001600248520097700264592002801241650001601269650001901285650001701304650001801321650001501339650001101354650001001365650001701375650005201392650004301444650002101487650003201508650003001540650004101570650001101611650003601622650002401658650002801682650002701710651001001737653002701747653001901774653002601793653001501819700001201834700001301846700001701859700001301876773009701889856008801986852000902074655001202083IND60113557820221117030536.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011355782DNAL7 a232868802pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Rui10aCardenolide glycosides from root of Streptocaulon juventas  ap. 105-111.  aSix cardenolides were isolated from the anti-tumor active fraction of the 75% ethanol extract of Streptocaulon juventas (Asclepiadaceae), mainly found in southwest of China.

Recently, their ability to grow endophytically within plants was discovered, offering the opportunity for systemic biological control. Endophytic colonization of host plants could also influence life-table parameters and behavior of herbivores. We investigated lethal and pre-mortality effects of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum on Aphis gossypii; aphids either received inoculum while feeding on recently sprayed leaves (surface inoculum and endophytically-colonized) or while feeding on unsprayed but endophytically-colonized leaves. We used choice assays to identify any preferences for endophytically-colonized or control plants. Volatile emissions from endophytically-colonized plants and control plants were also compared. Aphid mortality rates ranged between 48.2 and 56.9% on sprayed leaves, and between 37.7 and 50.0 on endophytically-colonized leaves. There was a significant effect of endophytic colonization on the rate of nymph production, but this did not result in an overall increase in the aphid population. Endophytic colonization did not influence host-plant selection even though there were qualitative and quantitative differences in the blend of volatiles released by endophytically-colonized and control plants. Although endophytic colonization did not change herbivore behavior, plants still benefit via indirect defense, resistance to plant pathogens or abiotic stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAphis gossypii 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aMetarhizium brunneum 3aabiotic stress 3abiological control 3aemissions 3aendophytes 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3agreenhouses 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3ainoculum 3ainsect control 3aleaves 3alife history 3alife tables 3amelons 3amortality 3aplant pathogens 3astress tolerance1 aSánchez-Ortiz, Araceli 1 aValverde-García, Pablo 1 aQuesada-Moraga, Enrique 0 tInsects.g2019 June 10, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects100601653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013000170300001400300520187300314592002802187650001902215650001302234650002402247650002002271650001402291650001302305650001402318650001402332650001202346650001002358700001902368700001902387700001802406700002102424700002202445773012302467856008202590852000902672655001202681IND60624168520221120033804.0181201e199902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062416852DNAL7 a10.1177/0884533699014001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeyland, Daren K.10aHow Well Do Critically Ill Patients Tolerate Early, Intragastric Enteral Feeding? Results of a Prospective, Multicenter Trial  ap. 23-28.  aObjective: To evaluate whether critically ill patients tolerate early, intragastric enteral feedings. Design: Multicenter, prospective cohort study. Setting: Eight mixed intensive care units at tertiary care hospitals. Patients: We recruited mechanically ventilated critically ill patients expected to remain ventilated >48 hours. We enrolled 120 patients; the feeding protocol was used in 95. Forty percent were women, the mean age was 55.1 ± 18.9 years, and the mean APACHE II score was 21.6 ± 70.6. Interventions: We used a standardized feeding protocol that initiated enteral nutrition (EN) within 48 hours of admission at 25 mL/h and checked gastric residuals every 4 hours. At every 4-hour interval, the feeding rate was increased by 25 mL/h to the target rate, if the residual volume was <200 mL. If the residual volume was >200 mL, the feedings were discontinued temporarily. All patients were fed in the stomach. Motility agents were allowed if the patient had high gastric residuals. Main outcomes: Time elapsed from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to initiation of EN, tolerance (amount of EN received over the amount needed to receive to meet energy requirements), gastrointestinal dysfunction (eg, high gastric residuals), and ICU-acquired pneumonia. Results: Patients were started on EN 35.2 ± 15.6 hours after admission. Fifty-nine of 95 (62%) received >90% of their energy requirements for >2 consecutive days. Over the entire study period the average tolerance was 65.9%. Reasons why EN was interrupted or delayed included high gastric residuals, procedures, feeding tube problem, and diarrhea. The incidence of pneumonia in this cohort was 10 of 95 or 10.5%. Conclusions: Early intragastric EN is safe and feasible and is tolerated in a majority of critically ill patients. High gastric residuals represents a major obstacle to success.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3adiarrhea 3aenergy requirements 3aenteral feeding 3ahospitals 3apatients 3apneumonia 3aprotocols 3astomach 3awomen1 aKonopad, Elsie1 aAlberda, Cathy1 aKeefe, Laurie1 aCooper, Carmelle1 aCantwell, Barbara0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g1999 Feb., v. 14, no. 1 p.23-28dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0884533699014001053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01513naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009800165300001600263520048100279592002800760650001400788650001900802650001400821650001100835650001400846650000900860653003000869653002900899653003800928773012800966856008401094852000901178655001201187IND60570816520221118052746.0190415e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057081652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtusci.2016.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdo, N.F.10aEffect of non Maxwellian distribution on the dressed electrostatic wave and energy properties  ap. 617-622.  aThe investigation of dressed electrostatic and energy ion acoustic solitary waves in a warm plasma composed fluid of ions, Maxwillian positrons and fast nonthermal electrons are elaborated.

This is also the case of Potato virus Y (PVY), which comprises a high diversity of different recombinant and non-recombinant strains. Consequently, it is hard to develop reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with the same amplification efficiencies for all PVY strains which would enable their equilibrate quantification; this is specially needed in mixed infections and other studies of pathogenesis. To achieve this, we initially transferred the PVY universal RT-qPCR assay to a reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) format. RT-ddPCR is an absolute quantification method, where a calibration curve is not needed, and it is less prone to inhibitors. The RT-ddPCR developed and validated in this study achieved a dynamic range of quantification over five orders of magnitude, and in terms of its sensitivity, it was comparable to, or even better than, RT-qPCR. RT-ddPCR showed lower measurement variability. We have shown that RT-ddPCR can be used as a reference tool for the evaluation of different RT-qPCR assays. In addition, it can be used for quantification of RNA based on in-house reference materials that can then be used as calibrators in diagnostic laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotato virus Y 3adroplets 3agenetic variation 3amixed infection 3amutation 3apathogenesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 3aselection pressure1 aDobnik, David1 aRavnikar, Maja1 aPompe Novak, Maruša0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2018 June, v. 410, no. 16 p.3815-3825dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-018-1053-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009200158300002000250520110700270592002801377650002101405650001301426650002101439650002201460650001301482650001301495650001701508650001601525650001401541650001301555650001501568653002301583653003401606653002201640653002901662653002301691700001901714700002001733700001801753700002401771700001901795700001601814700002101830700002401851773012901875856007302004852000902077655001202086IND60527791720221121232341.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779172DNAL7 a10.1021/am505318d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhapli, Sachin10aFabrication of Hierarchically Porous Materials and Nanowires through Coffee Ring Effect  ap. 20643-20653.  aWe report a versatile method for the fabrication of nanowires and hierarchical porous materials from a wide variety of ceramic materials such as CaCO₃, ZnO, CuO, Co₃O₄, Co-doped ZnO, and Ag₂O. The method consists of evaporation of CO₂-enriched water microdroplets (diameter ∼3 μm) deposited from an aerosol onto heated substrates (T = 120 °C). A variety of porous scaffolds with 1–3 μm sized pores can be generated by tuning the process conditions. Subsequent sintering of the scaffolds is shown to generate nanosized pores in the walls of the porous scaffold creating a dual hierarchy of pore sizes (∼50 nm and 1–3 μm). We propose a mechanism for the formation of scaffolds based on the coffee-ring effect during the evaporation of microdroplets. Ostwald-ripening of CaCO₃ scaffolds prepared without sintering yields scaffold structures consisting of two-dimensional crystals of CaCO₃ that are one unit cell thick. The favorable application of CaCO₃ scaffolds for the enhancement of bone healing around titanium implants with improved biocompatibility is also demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstwald ripening 3aaerosols 3abiocompatibility 3acalcium carbonate 3aceramics 3acrystals 3acupric oxide 3aevaporation 3ananowires 3atitanium 3azinc oxide 0abioactive ceramics 0ahierarchical porous materials 0acalcium carbonate 0atwo-dimensional crystals 0acoffee-ring effect1 aRianasari, Ina1 aBlanton, Thomas1 aWeston, James1 aGilardetti, Rachael1 aNeiva, Rodrigo1 aTovar, Nick1 aCoelho, Paulo G.1 aJagannathan, Ramesh0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.20643-20653dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am505318d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245018600161300001800347520043900365592002800804650001500832650002700847650002300874650001100897650001600908650002300924650001600947650001200963650001300975650001100988700002100999700001901020773013401039856007501173852000901248655001201257IND60658857920221118235435.0190826e20110221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065885792DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04797j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReger, Daniel L.10aCopper(ii) carboxylate tetramers formed from an enantiopure ligand containing a π-stacking supramolecular synthon: single-crystal to single-crystal enantioselective ligand exchange  ap. 2805-2807.  aAn enantiopure ligand built from connecting the π⋯π stacking 1,8-naphthalimide supramolecular synthon with l-asparagine, Lₐₛₙ⁻, forms tetrameric [Cu₄(Lₐₛₙ)₈(py)(MeOH)].

To clarify the formation mechanism, dihydromyricetin particles were first characterized. Then, the factors influencingthe gel formation, microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation was performed to clarify the microscopic behavior of dihydromyricetin in an oil-water system. The results indicated that dihydromyricetin particles occurred as regular rod-shaped crystals with amphiphilicity. They formed a 3D steric network by overlapping with each other, separating oil droplets and stabilizing O/W emulsion gels. The dihydromyricetin concentration and oil-phase weight fraction had a significant influence on the formation and mechanical properties of gels. The alkali and low ionic strength conditions benefited the gel stability. The molecular dynamics showed that dihydromyricetin could spontaneously and quickly transfer to the oil-water interface, reduce the interfacialtension and enhance the interface thickness, which agreed with the experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3aemulsions 3afood chemistry 3agels 3aionic strength 3amicrostructure 3amolecular dynamics 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3athickness 3aweight 0aDihydromyricetin 0aPickering emulsion gels 0aMicrostructure 0aMicrorheological behavior 0aMolecular dynamics1 aJiang, Zhaojing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5918-78051 aMa, Hanjun1 aPu, Pei1 aLiu, Benguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9992-93191 aLiang, Guizhao0 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 01, v. 343 p.128486-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1284863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245011500175300001800290506002800308520127100336592002801607506003701635650002501672650002801697650002401725650001401749650001501763651001101778653000801789653001301797653001401810653001401824653001101838700002601849773010401875856008001979852000902059655001202068IND60764537320221207135655.0211116e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076453732DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1904152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMCKENZIE, JOENITTA ARTHUR10aShort Communication: The diversity of intestinal parasitic helminths in children of Silvercity, Linden, Guyana  ap. 1289-1293.  aResource is Open Access  aArthur-McKenzie J, Ansari AA. 2018.

This study was conducted in the Silvercity area, Linden, Guyana and endeavored to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic helminths in children aged 5-15 and the level of awareness of these parasitic infections among community members. Questionnaires were distributed to 30 households and 26 children which accounts for 40% of the population aged 5-15 using a simple random sampling method and tested during the months of February-April 2017. The fecal samples were collected from 26 children selected randomly and were analyzed using wet mount and formalin-ether sedimentation method. The highest age was 15 and the lowest 5, the mean age was 8. The results showed that there was a 57.6% (15/26) prevalence of intestinal parasitic helminths among children aged 5-15 within the Silvercity area. Among the parasites found, Ascaris lumbricoides was the most prevalent (38%; 10/26) followed by Enterobius vermicularis (19%; 5/26), Trichuris trichiura (15%; 4/26) and hookworm (3.8%; 1/26).

Migration of plastic constituents not only has the potential to affect product quality but also constitutes a risk to consumer health. In order to check the safety of food contact materials, analytical methodologies to identify potential migrants are required. In the first part of this work, a GC/MS screening method was developed for the identification of components from plastic packaging materials including intentionally and “non-intentionally added substances” (NIAS) as potential migrants. In the second part of this study, the presence of seven compounds (bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), benzophenone (BP)) previously identified in packaging materials were investigated in food products (corn and potatoes snacks, cookies, and cakes). For this purpose, a suitable extraction method was developed and quantification was performed using GC-MS. The developed method was validated in terms of linearity, recovery, repeatability, and limits of detection and quantification. The spiked recoveries varied between 82.7 and 116.1%, and relative standard deviation (RSD) was in the range of 2.22–15.9%. The plasticizer ATBC was the most detected compound (94% samples), followed by DEP (65%), DEHP (47%), BP (44%), DBP (35%), DIBP (21%), and BHT (12%).

Cytogenotoxic potentials of green synthesized Cola pod (Cp-AgNPs), seed (Cs-AgNPs) and seed shell (Css-AgNPs) silver nanoparticles and silver nitrates salt (Ags) were evaluated using A. cepa assay. Twenty onion bulbs were exposed to 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0μg/ml of AgNPs and Ags solutions. Microscopic evaluation was observed at 24, 48 and 72h with 5000 cells per concentration scored for chromosomal aberrations while effects on the root growth were evaluated at 72h. The observed dividing cells and mitotic inhibition were dose dependent for the three AgNPs and Ags at 24, 48 and 72h. Mitotic inhibitions obtained for 1.0, 10 and 100μg/mL at all hours of evaluation were less than half the value of negative control, while cell arrest was observed only at 72h of 100μg/mL for the three AgNPs. Chromosomal aberrations observed were C-mitosis, chromosome bridge, vagrant, and sticky chromosome which indicate the potential of AgNPs for genotoxicity. Mean root length of AgNPs treated A. cepa showed dose dependent significant decrease compared to the control indicating their inhibitory potential but found lower at all concentrations compared to Ags showing attenuation of growth inhibition. The EC50 values revealed the order of growth inhibitionas Ags >Cp-AgNPs > Css-AgNPs > Cs-AgNPs. The cytogenotoxic potential of the AgNPs suggests that caution should be exercised in their usage to prevent environmental pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aCola nitida 3abulbs 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosomes 3adose response 3agenotoxicity 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3amedian effective concentration 3amitosis 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aonions 3apollution 3aroot growth 3aseed coat 0aGreen synthesis 0aNanoparticles 0aSilver 0aAberration 0aAllium cepa 0aCola nitida1 aAzeez, Musibau A.1 aAkinboro, Akeem1 aLateef, Agbaje1 aAsafa, Tesleem B.1 aOladipo, Iyabo C.1 aOladokun, Samuel O.1 aAjibola, Adewumi A.0 tJournal of Taibah University for Science.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aTaibah UniversitywJournal:23224x1658-36557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtusci.2017.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010400160500002000264520165600284592002801940650003301968650002102001650002402022650001602046650002102062650002702083650001502110650003102125650001502156650001902171650002102190650001202211650001802223650001602241650001202257650002802269650001802297650001502315650002802330650001102358651001002369700002302379700002302402700006002425700002102485700002102506700002702527773012302554856007302677852000902750655001202759IND60625482420221121100331.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062548242DNAL7 a10.1111/jfs.125302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostanzo, Nicola10aMicrobial quality evaluation of grated cheese samples collected at retail level in Calabria (Italy)  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo evaluate the microbial quality of grated cheese sold in Southern Italy, a total of 47 samples were collected at retail. Enumeration of fungi performed by culture reveled concentration ranging between 1 and 5.56 Log₁₀ CFU/g and between 1 and 4 Log₁₀ CFU/g for yeasts and molds, respectively. Selected mold colonies (n = 95) available from 31 samples (65.96%) were further identified. In total, 27 different mold species were recorded. The top five strains were in descending order as follows: Moniliella suaveolens (21.05%, n = 20), Geotrichum candidum (9.47%, n = 9), Penicillium brevicompactum (7.36%, n = 7), Cladosporium cladosporioides (6.31%, n = 6) and Gliocladium album (5.26%, n = 5). Regarding bacterial growth, Staphylococcal cells were available from 19 out of 47 (40.42%) collected samples with a range from 1.30 to 5.15 Log₁₀ CFU/g. Staphylococcus aureus‐like colonies were not detected and similarly, pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes Salmonella and Escherichia coli was not isolated while two colonies were identified as Listeria innocua. To prevent any potential contamination and growth of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in dairy products including grated cheeses high hygiene standards need to be considered. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study provides an insight into the diversity of viable molds that can be isolated from grated cheese sold at retail level. These microorganisms, that can potentially affect the quality and the safety of food products, may serve as indication for the food business operator of hygiene during processing and eventually as prediction during storing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3aEscherichia coli 3aGeotrichum candidum 3aGliocladium 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aMoniliella 3aPenicillium brevicompactum 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus 3abacterial growth 3acheeses 3afood industry 3afood safety 3ahygiene 3amicrobiological quality 3amolds (fungi) 3aprediction 3aspoilage microorganisms 3ayeasts 3aItaly1 aRodolfi, Marinella1 aMusarella, Rosanna1 aCeniti, Carlotta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8074-61811 aSantoro, Adriano1 aBritti, Domenico1 aCasalinuovo, Francesco0 tJournal of food safety.g2018 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.e12530-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10993x0149-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfs.125303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002600147245012500173300001800298500000900316520159300325592002801918650000801946650002401954650001301978650001301991650001602004650001302020650001902033650001902052650001002071650001202081650001202093650001202105650001002117650004702127650001302174650001602187700002202203700002402225700002402249700002202273773013302295852000902428856008402437655001202521IND4460715420221121233547.0191122e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446071542DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2010.10.06102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilera, Patricia M.10aInterspecific Tetraploid Hybrids between Two Forage Grass Species: Sexual Paspalum plicatulum and Apomictic P. guenoarum  ap. 1544-1550.  aepub  aThe Plicatula group of the grass genus Paspalum contains about 30 species. Most are tetraploid and reproduce by apomixis, though some of them contain sexual diploid races. We crossed a sexual colchicine-induced autotetraploid plant of brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum Michx.) with apomictic tetraploid P. guenoarum Arechav., also from the Plicatula group. Crossability was 35% and the progeny showed morphological characteristics intermediate to those of the parents but resembling more the male parent. The random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis showed that the whole progeny amplified bands that were specific of the male parent, confirming its hybrid origin. Meiotic chromosome behavior of hybrids exhibited primarily bivalent and quadrivalent associations similar to those of the two parents. This suggests that natural tetraploid P. guenoarum shares the same basic chromosome set with that of autotetraploid P. plicatulum, and both species probably originate from the same ancestral species. Fourteen out of 23 hybrids reproduced only sexually, while nine were obligate or highly apomictic. Seed set ranged from 11 to 55% among the hybrids. Our results open the possibility of exchanging genes at the tetraploid level in breeding programs of P. plicatulum and P. guenoarum. This possibility is based on their rate of crossability, the degree of fertility among the hybrids, the segregation observed for the reproductive mode in the F₁ progeny, and the very simple procedure flow cytometry seed screen (FCSS) used to determine the reproductive mode for each hybrid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPaspalum plicatulum 3aapomixis 3abreeding 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3aflow cytometry 3aforage grasses 3agenes 3ahybrids 3aparents 3aprogeny 3araces 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseed set 3atetraploidy1 aSartor, María E.1 aGaldeano, Florencia1 aEspinoza, Francisco1 aQuarin, Camilo L.0 tCrop science.g2011 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.1544-1550dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2010.10.06103Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02883naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015900166300001800325520161700343592002801960650001901988650001402007650001902021650001202040650002302052650001702075650001302092650003302105650001202138650001702150650001602167650002302183700001902206700001702225700001802242773013402260856008202394852000902476655001202485IND60638885020221119005801.0190430e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063888502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00067-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarasu, Salih10aExtraction optimization crocin pigments of saffron (Crocus sativus) using response surface methodology and determination stability of crocin microcapsules  ap. 1515-1523.  aThis study aimed to determine optimal extraction parameters by using response surface methodology, examining the effect of microencapsulation on crocin retention, and evaluating the temperature and pH stability of crocin microcapsules. The effect of process variables on the crocin yield was successfully determined by quadratic models (R² > 0.99 and adj R² > 0.98). All variables significantly affected the crocin yield (P < 0.1). The process parameters, namely extraction time (4.40 min), temperature (55 °C), amplitude level (94%), and liquid to solid ratio (L/S) (1000) were determined as optimum extraction points. Safranal was shown to be a compound with major volatility in both the saffron and microcapsule extracts. Safranal, 2,4,4-trimethyl-3-carboxaldehyde-5-hydroxy-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-one, 4-hydroxy-2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde (HTCC), and isophorone were other major volatile compounds of saffron extract. The encapsulation process affected volatile percentage distribution insignificantly (P > 0.05). The thermal and pH stability of the crocin was determined at different temperatures (60, 70, 80, and 90 °C) and pH levels (2, 4.5, and 6). The crocin degradation showed first order kinetic, and degradation rate constant (k) were significantly affected by pH and temperature (P < 0.05). A high temperature and low pH showed higher degradation (k) in crocin content. This study suggested that crocin from saffron stigmas should be preserved by spray drying encapsulation and should only be used as a natural food colorant in low or moderate acid food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocus sativus 3aequations 3afood colorants 3aliquids 3amicroencapsulation 3apH stability 3apigments 3aresponse surface methodology 3asaffron 3aspray drying 3atemperature 3avolatile compounds1 aBayram, Yuksel1 aOzkan, Kubra1 aSagdic, Osman0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.1515-1523dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00067-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006000169300001000229500001900239520168500258592002801943596004701971650001002018650002402028650001002052650003702062650003502099650000902134650001902143650002502162650001002187650001302197650001102210650001202221650001602233650002402249700001902273700002102292700001902313700002102332700001502353700002602368700002002394700002402414700002502438700005902463773010902522856008202631852000902713655001202722IND60712841420221121124239.0210101e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071284142DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-019-0731-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvesen, Øyvind10aGoats naturally devoid of PrPC are resistant to scrapie  ap. 1.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrion diseases are progressive and fatal, neurodegenerative disorders described in humans and animals. According to the “protein-only” hypothesis, the normal host-encoded prion protein (PrPC) is converted into a pathological and infectious form (PrPSᶜ) in these diseases. Transgenic knockout models have shown that PrPC is a prerequisite for the development of prion disease. In Norwegian dairy goats, a mutation (Ter) in the prion protein gene (PRNP) effectively blocks PrPC synthesis. We inoculated 12 goats (4 PRNP⁺/⁺, 4 PRNP⁺/ᵀᵉʳ, and 4 PRNPᵀᵉʳ/ᵀᵉʳ) intracerebrally with goat scrapie prions. The mean incubation time until clinical signs of prion disease was 601 days post-inoculation (dpi) in PRNP⁺/⁺ goats and 773 dpi in PRNP⁺/ᵀᵉʳ goats. PrPSᶜ and vacuolation were similarly distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) of both groups and observed in all brain regions and segments of the spinal cord. Generally, accumulation of PrPSᶜ was limited in peripheral organs, but all PRNP⁺/⁺ goats and 1 of 4 PRNP⁺/ᵀᵉʳ goats were positive in head lymph nodes. The four PRNPᵀᵉʳ/ᵀᵉʳ goats remained healthy, without clinical signs of prion disease, and were euthanized 1260 dpi. As expected, no accumulation of PrPSᶜ was observed in the CNS or peripheral tissues of this group, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, enzyme immunoassay, and real-time quaking-induced conversion. Our study shows for the first time that animals devoid of PrPC due to a natural mutation do not propagate prions and are resistant to scrapie. Clinical onset of disease is delayed in heterozygous goats expressing about 50% of PrPC levels.  aPublisher supplied data  a227386/E40cThe Research Council of Norway 3abrain 3aenzyme immunoassays 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahead 3aheterozygosity 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alymph 3amutation 3aprions 3ascrapie 3aspinal cord 3aveterinary medicine1 aEspenes, Arild1 aReiten, Malin R.1 aVuong, Tram T.1 aMalachin, Giulia1 aTran, Linh1 aAndréoletti, Olivier1 aOlsaker, Ingrid1 aBenestad, Sylvie L.1 aTranulis, Michael A.1 aErsdal, Cecilie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5838-43560 tVeterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 51, no. 1 p.1-1dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4142873x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0731-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245007600181300001600257520161500273592002801888650002301916650001201939650001301951650001101964650000901975650001401984650001901998700001702017700002102034773010202055856008902157852000902246655001202255IND60534289020221120044617.0160802e20160121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053428902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b020842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez-Majmutov, Anton10aMolecular-Level Modeling and Simulation of Vacuum Gas Oil Hydrocracking  ap. 138-148.  aAdvancing the capabilities of refinery process models requires fundamental knowledge of hydrocarbon composition and processing behavior at the molecular level. In common practice, however, the main obstacle to reaching such a level of understanding is the difficulty to characterize the molecular composition of petroleum and its derived products with current analytical methods. A different approach is through the use of hydrocarbon composition modeling techniques to derive the molecular make up of petroleum fractions, thus enabling the development of molecular reaction models. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the application of this concept to model and simulate the vacuum gas oil hydrocracking process at the molecular level. At first the analytical characterization of the feed sample is transformed into a computational mixture of hydrocarbon molecules that is consistent with the chemistry of the actual oil sample. This molecular representation is then used as input to model the chemical transformations occurring in the hydrocracking reactor. The reaction network is organized in terms of reaction families, and reactivity parameters are modeled with quantitative structure/reactivity correlations. The developed model is tuned using experimental data obtained from a bench-scale hydrocracking reactor. Simulations showed that the model reproduces the product distribution by boiling range and hydrocarbon type, relevant product properties (e.g., API gravity), and process parameters such as hydrogen consumption and hydrocarbon vaporization, over a wide range of operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aboiling 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aoils 3apetroleum 3avolatilization1 aChen, Jinwen1 aGieleciak, Rafal0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Jan. 21, v. 30, no. 1 p.138-148dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b020843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245013600203506007600339520216400415592002802579506003702607650001502644650001102659650001102670650001102681650002102692650001202713650003002725650001102755650001402766650001002780650001002790650001302800650000902813650001502822650002302837650001802860651001002878700002402888700001702912700001702929700001802946700001902964700001802983700002603001773011903027856007903146852000903225655001203234IND60649705420221207070353.0190705e20190514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064970542DNAL7 a10.3390/insects100501382doi7 aPMC65721532pmcid7 a310916772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zaiyuan 10aEffects of Water Immersion and Soil Moisture Content on Larval and Pupal Survival of <i>Bactrocera minax</i> (Diptera: Tephritidae)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBactrocera minax, one of the most devastating citrus pests in Asia, has two developmental stages (mature larva and pupa) that complete their life cycle in the soil. Currently, southern China has a climate with abundant autumn rains, and soil moisture can be a major factor affecting the survival of larvae and pupae of B. minax. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of water immersion and high soil moisture content on the development of mature larvae and pupae of B. minax. When immersed in water for 1 d, 100% of mature larvae of B. minax were knocked out. When larvae were immersed for less than 6 d, however, more than 92% of knocked-out larvae recovered within 24 h. The days of water immersion with 50% and 90% recovery ratios (indicated as RD<inf>50</inf> and RD<inf>90</inf>) were 10.3 d and 6.4 d, respectively. When larvae were immersed less than 6 d, the mortality ratios of larvae were not significantly different from those that were not immersed at all. The days of immersion causing 50% and 90% mortality of larvae (MD<inf>50</inf> and MD<inf>90</inf>, respectively) were 7.6 d and 11.1 d, respectively. The pupation ratios of larvae were also observed to be not significantly different compared to non-immersion, and the days of immersion causing 50% and 90% pupation (PD<inf>50</inf> and PD<inf>90</inf>, respectively) were 6.6 d and 0.8 d, respectively. Larval respiration rates were reduced after water immersion as a strategy for larval survival. High water content was not detrimental to pupae of B. minax. Adult emergence did not significantly decrease in soil with high water content, even though pupae were under those conditions for 161&ndash;175 d. The respiration rates of pupae were lower in soil with different moisture levels and were not significantly different, which ensured the survival of pupae in high water content. Reduced respiration rate is a strategy for survival of larvae and pupae, and remarkable tolerance to high moisture conditions could explain the high rate of spread and geographical distribution of B. minax. The results of this study provide a reference for the occurrence and control of B. minax.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBactrocera 3aCitrus 3aadults 3aautumn 3acell respiration 3aclimate 3ageographical distribution 3alarvae 3amortality 3apests 3apupae 3apupation 3arain 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awater content 3aChina1 aChambi, Consolatha 1 aDu, Tianhua 1 aHuang, Cong 1 aWang, Fulian 1 aZhang, Guifen 1 aLi, Chuanren 1 aJuma Kayeke, Mohamed 0 tInsects.g2019 May 14, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects100501383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245007700179300001600256500000900272500001500281520207100296592002802367650001902395650002502414650002202439650002602461650002402487650001102511650001502522650001702537650001102554650001502565650001202580651001402592653001002606653002102616700002002637700002302657700002102680773012002701852000902821856009802830655001202928IND2056845020221119024511.0191122e199505  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205684502DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500030021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRooney, W.

Although recurrent selection methods have been utilized successfully for the improvement of a number of traits in oat, rapid-cycle population improvement methods for moderately to highly heritable traits have not been evaluated. Our objectives were (i) to evaluate effectiveness of rapid-cycle recurrent selection for early flowering, and (ii) to determine the effect of selection for early flowering on grain yield, maturity, and plant height. Phenotypic recurrent selection for early flowering was practiced for four cycles. The scheme requires one generation per cycle and up to three cycles can be completed in 1 yr. From each of the 30 selected plants in all four cycles, a single F₂:₄ line was derived for replicated testing. All derived lines and the original parents were evaluated at Rosemount and St. Paul, MN, in 1992 and 1993. Analysis of F₂:₄ lines from the earliest 12 plants per cycle indicated that selection reduced days-to-flowering by 1.25 days per cycle. Grain yield and plant height were reduced by 25 and 8%, respectively. Although the selection was effective, this population resulted in an unacceptably high frequency of aneuploid and phenotypically off-type progeny. Cytological analysis of the original F₁ hybrids indicated the presence of chromosomal interchanges between some of the Co parents. We hypothesize that the absence of a selfing generation in a closed recurrent selection system enhanced chromosomal interchange differences, resulting in a high frequency of off-types and aneuploids in later cycles. Therefore, if interchanges are present between breeding lines, recurrent selection without selling in oat may not be a useful method for long-term selection programs.

The receptors' participation in physiological and pathophysiological processes could be demonstrated in several studies. In addition to the regulation of sperm motility, respiratory physiology, and heart contraction, ORs play a crucial role in cancer cells. In murine myoblasts, mOR23 regulates the myogenesis and branching of skeletal muscle cells. To date, the expression and physiological role of ORs in human skeletal muscle cells have not been thoroughly elucidated. We demonstrate that four different ORs are expressed at the transcript level in differentiated myoblasts, and one other OR is expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts. Moreover, we characterized the expression of OR2H2 in differentiated human myoblasts and identified a specific ligand, aldehyde 13-13. We could observe a concentration-dependent Ca²⁺ increase in differentiated human myoblasts upon aldehyde 13-13 stimulation, which is mediated by PI3K signaling. Aldehyde 13-13 has a reducing effect on myoblast fusion. We conclude that OR2H2 could have a regulatory role in myoblast differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this report presents the first verification of the expression of ORs in human myoblasts. OR2H2 might be an interesting candidate for playing a role in the complex mechanism of myogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3abranching 3acalcium 3ahumans 3aligands 3amice 3amuscle development 3amyoblasts 3amyocardial contraction 3amyocytes 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aolfactory receptors 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3areceptors 3arespiratory physiology 3askeletal muscle 3asperm motility1 aOsterloh, Markus1 aSchulz, Viola M.1 aAltmüller, Janine1 aBecker, Christian1 aOsterloh, Sabrina1 aHatt, Hanns0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 May 01, v. 645 p.72-80dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245009200160300001600252500001900268520088500287592002801172650000901200650000901209650001101218650002501229650001601254650001001270650001001280650002301290650001301313650001401326650002201340653001001362653001201372653001601384700001701400700001701417700001601434700001401450700002301464773012901487856007901616852000901695655001201704IND60727206720221119032913.0210209e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072720672DNAL7 a10.3382/japr.2013-007502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArroyo, J.10aInfluence of amount and form of sorghum in the diet on the performance of overfed geese  ap. 849-854.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFeeding has high economic and environmental costs in poultry production. The feeding of waterfowl for fatty liver production is largely based on the use of maize as an energy source. The aim of this trial was to study the effect of the form of presentation (whole grain or flour) and the amount (40.5, 56, or 100%, depending on the form) of sorghum in the overfeeding diet on the performance of geese. During overfeeding, a diet mainly composed of sorghum reduced the FCR of the geese and increased the weight of fatty liver, but reduced their commercial grading. The use of sorghum during geese overfeeding offers interesting prospects for a more sustainable fatty liver production system. Indeed, it could reduce the environmental effect of goose feeding while improving the flexibility of production systems, making it possible to use a cereal other than maize for overfeeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3adiet 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afatty liver 3aflour 3ageese 3apoultry production 3aresearch 3awaterfowl 3awhole grain foods 0agoose 0asorghum 0aoverfeeding1 aAuvergne, A.1 aDubois, J.P.1 aLavigne, F.1 aBijja, M.1 aFortun-Lamothe, L.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 22, no. 4 p.849-854dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr.2013-007503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001800172245011700190300001600307520070000323592002801023650002401051650000901075650001301084650001701097650001101114650001701125650001801142650002501160650002501185650002401210650002601234650002701260653002401287653001801311653001801329653001801347653002201365653001901387700001601406700001701422700001901439700001801458700001401476700001401490700001701504773009701521856008801618852000901706655001201715IND60113555720221117030750.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011355572DNAL7 a231535182pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Zhi-Lai10aTetracyclic triterpenoids and terpenylated coumarins from the bark of Ailanthus altissima (“Tree of Heaven”)  ap. 159-167.  aTetracyclic triterpenoids (named as altissimanins A–E, 1–5) and a terpenylated coumarin (denominated as altissimacoumarin G, 6), along with fifteen known compounds (7–21) were isolated from the bark of Ailanthus altissima.

Some constituents (either lipase inhibitory or LDL anti-oxidative activities) had moderate inhibitory activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies sibirica 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical structure 3achromatography 3alow density lipoprotein 3amedicinal plants 3amice 3asilica gel 3aspectroscopy 3atriterpenoids 2aAbiesxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aMice 2aPinaceaexchemistry 2aTriterpenesxchemistryxpharmacology. 0aAbies sibirica 0aPinaceae 0aLipase inhibitor 0aLDL anti-oxidative activity 0aTriterpene 0aγ-Lactone ring1 aMurata, Toshihiro1 aKobayashi, Kyoko1 aSelenge, Erdenechimeg1 aMiyase, Toshio1 aBatkhuu, Javzan1 aYoshizaki, Fumihiko0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 86 p.168-175dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008600156300002000242520126700262592002801529650001601557650001301573650001101586650002101597650001401618650002301632650000901655650001101664650001801675653002401693653001701717653001601734653001801750653002101768700001301789700001401802700001901816700001701835700002101852700001401873700001801887700001701905773012601922856007502048852000902123655001202132IND60527789620221122054323.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052778962DNAL7 a10.1021/am504163r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuqiang10aHighly Flexible and Lightweight Organic Solar Cells on Biocompatible Silk Fibroin  ap. 20670-20675.  aOrganic electronics have gained widespread attention due to their flexibility, lightness, and low-cost potential. It is attractive due to the possibility of large-scale roll-to-roll processing. However, organic electronics require additional development before they can be made commercially available and fully integrated into everyday life. To achieve feasibility for commercial use, these devices must be biocompatible and flexible while maintaining high performance. In this study, biocompatible silk fibroin (SF) was integrated with a mesh of silver nanowires (AgNWs) to build up flexible organic solar cells with maximum power conversion efficiency of up to 6.62%. The AgNW/SF substrate exhibits a conductivity of ∼11.0 Ω/sq and transmittance of ∼80% in the visible light range. These substrates retained their conductivity, even after being bent and unbent 200 times; this surprising ability was attributed to its embedded structure and the properties of the specific SF materials used. To contrast, indium tin oxide on synthetic plastic substrate lost its conductivity after the much less rigid bending. These lightweight and silk-based organic solar cells pave the way for future biocompatible interfaces between wearable electronics and human skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronics 3afibroins 3ahumans 3aindium tin oxide 3ananowires 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asilk 3asilver 3atransmittance 0aorganic solar cells 0asilk fibroin 0aflexibility 0abiocompatible 0asilver nanowires1 aQi, Ning1 aSong, Tao1 aJia, Mingliang1 aXia, Zhouhui1 aYuan, Zhongcheng1 aYuan, Wei1 aZhang, Ke-Qin1 aSun, Baoquan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.20670-20675dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam504163r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245008400168300001600252520134000268592002801608650001401636650001101650650001301661650001701674650001901691650001301710650001301723650002501736650001601761700001901777700002101796700001801817700001601835700002001851773010201871856008901973852000902062655001202071IND60534289620221120062056.0160802e20160121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053428962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b021522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Xing10aChanges in Pore Structure of Metallurgical Cokes under Blast Furnace Conditions  ap. 161-170.  aMetallurgical cokes were subjected to gasification by CO–CO₂–N₂ gas with blast-furnace-like composition–temperature profile to 1673 K (1400 °C) and annealing under N₂ at temperature up to 2273 K (2000 °C). Pore structure of cokes was examined using image analysis. Porosity and pore size were both enlarged under gasification and annealing conditions. The pore structure change during gasification was mainly a result of the Boudouard reaction; the pore structure development upon annealing was attributed to the reactions of mineral matters with carbon and further devolatilization. Annealing and gasification caused a decrease in average pore roundness, an increase in the fraction of low roundness pores and the increase of coalescence points in the pore area. The degradation of coke strength following reaction and annealing was characterized using tensile testing. Both gasification and annealing decreased the mechanical strength of coke. Degradation of more reactive cokes (cokes C and D) by gasification at 1673 K (1400 °C) was visibly stronger in comparison with annealing at the same temperature. Increasing the amount of coalescence points and the degradation of coke microstrength during annealing and gasification were major factors in the degradation of cokes under the simulated blast furnace conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acarbon 3afurnaces 3agasification 3aimage analysis 3anitrogen 3aporosity 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature1 aRogers, Harold1 aZhang, Guangqing1 aHockings, Kim1 aZulli, Paul1 aOstrovski, Oleg0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Jan. 21, v. 30, no. 1 p.161-170dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b021523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010300165300001400268520083300282592002801115650002201143650000901165650002001174650001701194650001401211650002001225650001301245651001901258700001801277700001801295773012501313856008001438852000901518655001201527IND60765256120220904000000.0220904e20120224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076525612DNAL7 a10.17221/5166-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStřeleček, F.10aDevelopment of livestock in numbers and structure from the&nbsp;regional and administrative aspect  ap. 47-58.  aThe contribution deals with the development of livestock since 1990. Since that year, beef and dairy cattle numbers have dropped by more than 50 percent in the Czech Republic. This decrease has been partly compensated by an increase in efficiency, yet milk production has dropped to 55% in this period and beef production to 60% compared with 1989. The declining amount of cultivated land in the Czech Republic has resulted in a decrease in the stocking rate and the corresponding production. It adversely influences the economy namely in highland areas. In this sense the high rate of permanent pastures with low stocking rate enables to efficiently exploit the EU direct payments and thus the direct payment system discriminates above all the farms in highland areas (potato and oat-growing areas and upland production areas).  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abeef 3abeef production 3adairy cattle 3ahighlands 3amilk production 3apotatoes 3aCzech Republic1 aLososová, J.1 aKvapilík, J.0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 50, no. 2 p.47-58dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/5166-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245013400160300001600294500001900310520153900329592002801868650002901896650001601925650002101941650000901962650002201971650000901993650002002002650001702022650002002039650000902059650001002068650000902078650002102087650001202108650001302120650001102133653001802144653001802162653002802180700001502208700001502223700001902238700001702257773012902274856007902403852000902482655001202491IND60727207020221119032829.0210209e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072720702DNAL7 a10.3382/japr.2013-007742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKidd, M.T.12aA study assessing hen and progeny performance through dam diet fortification with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product  ap. 872-877.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn an effort to improve broiler performance in an environment with increasing feed costs, researchers have investigated broiler breeder diet modification as a nontraditional way to improve broiler performance without affecting broiler feed costs. Broiler breeder diet modification of vitamins and minerals has received considerable attention, but feeding hens yeast fermentation products to affect progeny is an under-researched area. In this study, Cobb 500 broiler breeder hens were allocated to floor pens and fed mash diets (from 20 wk onward) with or without a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product. Hens were artificially inseminated from male broiler breeders fed diets devoid of S. cerevisiae. Progeny were evaluated from hatches at 32 and 39 wk of age. Hens fed S. cerevisiae had a reduction in egg contamination in the 32-wk hatch (1.97 to 0.00% contaminated eggs), but not the 39-wk hatch. Hatchability of fertile eggs was improved in hens fed diets containing S. cerevisiae in both the 32- and 39-wk hatch (overall 3.58% improvement in percentage hatch of fertile eggs). Other egg break-out assessments did not differ between treatments, but progeny from hens fed S. cerevisiae had improved feed conversion and breast meat yield in the 39-wk hatch (24.24 vs. 26.19% total white meat yield), but not the 32-wk hatch. Future research should be conducted to assess the nutrient content of eggs from broiler breeder hens fed this S. cerevisiae fermentation product in addition to further assessing progeny performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abreast meat 3abroiler breeders 3adiet 3aegg contamination 3aeggs 3afeed conversion 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3ahens 3amales 3amash 3anutrient content 3aprogeny 3aresearch 3ayeasts 0ahen nutrition 0achick quality 0aSaccharomyces cerevisae1 aAraujo, L.1 aAraujo, C.1 aMcDaniel, C.D.1 aMcIntyre, D.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 22, no. 4 p.872-877dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr.2013-007743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01169naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006900158300001800227520020000245592002800445650002700473650002300500650001000523650001700533700001600550700001200566700001100578700001800589700001900607773013300626856007500759852000900834655001200843IND60658855820221118235434.0190826e20110214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065885582DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04734a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Jianfeng10aContra-diffusion synthesis of ZIF-8 films on a polymer substrate  ap. 2559-2561.  aZIF-8 films were successfully prepared on a flexible nylon substrate with a contra-diffusion synthesis method, and gas permeation experiments indicated that the films were continuous and compact.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3anylon 3apermeability1 aDong, Dehua1 aLi, Dan1 aHe, Li1 aXu, Gengsheng1 aWang, Huanting0 tChemical communications.g2011 Feb. 14, v. 47, no. 9 p.2559-2561dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc04734a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01318naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245004600160300001400206520052100220592002800741650002200769650002000791650001200811700001500823773012500838856008000963852000901043655001201052IND60765256220220419000000.0220419e20120224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076525622DNAL7 a10.17221/5167-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTichá, I.10aDecision-making support for Czech farmers  ap. 59-64.  aThe article provides an overview of software applications designed and available for Czech farmers according to two criteria: business function within which the decisions are facilitated, and type of decision-making support the application is built on.

Methyl triethoxysilane (MTEOS), 3-Glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GLYMO) and fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) were used to obtain a mechanically robust icephobic coating. Different amount of hydrophobic silica nano particles was added as fillers to introduce different roughness and surface energy to the coatings. The microstructure, roughness, and surface energy, together with elemental information and surface chemical state, were investigated at room temperature. The contact angle and sliding angle were measured at different temperatures to correlate the wetting behavior at low temperature with the anti-icing performance. The ice adhesion shear strength was measured inside an ice chamber using a self-designed tester. The factors influencing the ice adhesion were discussed, and the optimum anti-icing performance found in the series of coatings. It was found that lower surface energy leads to lower ice adhesion regardless of the roughness, while the roughness plays a more complicated role. The wetting behavior of the droplet on surface changes as temperature decreases. The anti-icing performance is closely related to the antiwetting property of the surfaces at subzero temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aambient temperature 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3aglass 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3aroughness 3ashear strength 3asilica 3asurface roughness 0asol−gel coating 0aicephobicity 0aice adhesion 0asurface roughness 0asurface energy 0amechanical durability1 aWu, Xinghua1 aKumar, Divya1 aHo, Jeffrey W.

In Thailand, most animals for this purpose are currently harvested from wild populations, with unionoid culture still being in its infancy. Whilst reliable species identification is a prerequisite for developing a large‐scale industry, identification by morphological means is hampered by extensive phenotypic plasticity and poor knowledge of species delimitations. To facilitate alternative molecular identification, we developed species‐specific markers for the three Thai unionoids with considerable economic potential (CEP): that is, Chamberlainia hainesiana, Hyriopsis desowitzi and Hyriopsis myersiana. For this purpose, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints using 24 specific primer pairs were generated for eight samples of each CEP species and four samples of the closely related, non‐CEP species Contradens contradens. Cloning and sequencing of 13 CEP species‐specific AFLP bands revealed fragment collision at three occasions. In total, 16 species‐specific primer pairs were designed and tested on 92 Thai specimens spanning seven species and four genera. Thereby, specificity of (1) three primers to C. hainesiana, (2) one primer to H. desowitzi + Hyriopsis bialata, (3) one primer to H. myersiana + H. bialata and (4) four primers to all three Hyriopsis species tested was confirmed. Respective multiplex PCR protocols are provided. The developed primers enable cheap, quick and reliable identification of the Thai CEP species by one to three PCRs and offer a tool for a range of additional applications within mussel culture and ecological and evolutionary research on these important organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnionoida 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3afreshwater 3amollusc culture 3amussels 3aphenotypic plasticity 3araw materials 3ataxonomy 2aAnimals 2aDNA Primers 2aGenetic Markers 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSpecies Specificity 2aUnionidaexgenetics 3aThailand 0aThailand1 aZieritz, A.1 aKanchanaketu, T.1 aKovitvadhi, U.1 aKovitvadhi, S.1 aHongtrakul, V.0 tAnimal genetics.g2014 Apr., v. 45, no. 2 p.235-239dBlackwell Sciencex0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.121153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245009600176300001600272520155000288592002801838650001401866650001301880650001701893650001301910650001201923650001401935650001301949650001501962650002401977650002402001650001102025700002002036700001702056773009302073856005502166852000902221655001202230IND50067238620221120060140.0130618e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006723862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07922.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ale Roux, Peter C.10aGeomorphological disturbance is necessary for predicting fine‐scale species distributions  ap. 800-808.  aDisturbances related to geomorphological processes are frequent, widespread and often intense at high latitudes and altitudes, affecting the fine‐scale distribution of many plant species. While the inclusion of physical disturbances into models of species geographic ranges is widely recommended, no studies have yet tested the utility of field‐quantified geomorphological disturbances for terrestrial species distribution modelling. Here we apply generalized additive models and boosted regression trees to examine if the explicit inclusion of terrestrial and fluvial geomorphological variables alters species distribution models for 154 vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species in north European mountain tundra. The inclusion of these disturbances significantly improved both the explanatory and predictive power of distribution models, with consistent results for all three species groups. Spatial distribution predictions changed considerably for some species after the inclusion of disturbance variables, with fluvial disturbances generating strongly linear features for species influenced by erosion or sediment deposition. As a consequence, models incorporating geomorphological variables produced markedly more refined distribution maps than simpler models. Predictions of species distributions will thus benefit strongly from the inclusion of fine‐scale geomorphological variables, particularly in areas of active earth surface processes, enabling more accurate forecasting of future species ranges under changing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryopsida 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3alatitude 3alichens 3amountains 3aplanting 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asediment deposition 3atundra1 aVirtanen, Risto1 aLuoto, Miska0 tEcography.g2013 July, v. 36, no. 7 p.800-808dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07922.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001600161245009300177300001800270500000900288500001500297520191500312592002802227650002202255650001302277650001802290650001202308650001602320650002602336650002402362650002702386650002002413650001702433650001102450650002702461650003602488650001702524650001602541653001202557700001902569700001902588700001902607773012402626852000902750856009802759655001202857IND2056845420221119024512.0191122e199609  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205684542DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1996.0011183X003600050016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZehr, B.

Because of the cumbersome nature of traditional laboratory wet-milling procedures, relatively little information is available regarding inheritance of wet-milling product fractions. In this study, the inheritance of maize wet-milling product fractions was evaluated in grain of 40 full-sib families from a Design I mating (20 males; two females per male) and a newly developed, rapid, laboratory milling procedure. The narrow-sense heritability estimate of male-family means for the starch fraction was 0.73. Predicted gain from selection with a conservative heritability estimate was 7.4 g kg⁻¹ per cycle for the starch fraction. Phenotypic and genetic correlation coefficients between the wet-milling starch fraction and initial starch concentration, measured by near-infrared reflectance, were significant (0.79 and 0.89, respectively). Significant phenotypic and genetic correlation coefficients were observed between a wet-milling index and an index based on near-infrared reflectance. Relative rankings of check hybrids were significantly different between these two indices. Results from this study indicated product fractions from maize wet milling are heritable, and thus modifiable through selection. Genetic correlation coefficients suggested that selection for increased starch extractability from wet milling could be accomplished by using near-infrared reflectance to measure starch concentration. Changes in hybrid rank among wet-milling and near-infrared reflectance indices suggested that final selections of candidate hybrids for specific milling applications should be based on actual wet-milling evaluation.

Genetic diversity and structure of Ganoderma boninense isolates from oil palm and other plantation crops. Biodiversitas 21: 451-456. Oil palm is an economically important plant, which one of the most important sources of vegetable oil in the world. However, oil palm plantation and other crops face the treat basal stem rot (BSR) disease by Ganoderma boninense. A study on genetic diversity and structure of G. boninense is therefore needed in order to formulate improved control strategies for this disease. This work aimed to analyze the genetic diversity and structure of the G. boninense isolates derived from different hosts, 131 oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), six rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), three coconuts (Cocos nucifera), and three lontar palm (Borassus flabellifer). Genetic diversity and population structure of G. boninense isolates were investigated using six SSR markers with GenAlex 6.502 software. Results showed that several microsatellite loci indicated specific primary success rates, such as KT124402, KT124399, and KT124394, depicting high polymorphism content (>75%). This result suggested that these markers were equally effective in determining the polymorphisms of G. boninense isolates. A hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that genetic diversity mostly found among individuals within a population (88%), then among populations (8%), and within individuals (4%).. Phylogeny analysis showed two clusters of Ganoderma isolates. which was considered variation as dissimilar across with origin. The present study indicated that G. boninense from oil palm was predominantly comprised of a genetically distinct individual.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorassus flabellifer 3aElaeis guineensis 3aGanoderma boninense 3aHevea brasiliensis 3acomputer software 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3arubber 3astem rot 3avariance 3avegetable oil 0aamova 0aganoderma disease 0amicrosatellite 0apolymorphism1 aHAYATI, RAHMAH1 aPUTRI, LOLLIE A.P.1 aCHALIL, DIANA1 aSYAHPUTRA, INDRA1 aBasyuni, Mohammad0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Jan., v. 21, no. 2dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2102043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008100159300002000240520165600260592002801916650001201944650001101956650002101967650001501988650001702003650001502020653002902035653003602064653001402100653001702114653002702131700002002158700001602178700001802194700002002212773012602232856007502358852000902433655001202442IND60527790020221122025905.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779002DNAL7 a10.1021/am504498x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tae Hyung,10aElectrically Controlled Delivery of Cargo into Single Human Neural Stem Cell  ap. 20709-20716.  aNanoprobe-based techniques have emerged as an efficient tool for the manipulation and analysis of single cells. Here, we report a powerful whole-electrical single-cell manipulation tool that enables rapid and controllable delivery of cargo into single neural stem cells with precision monitoring of the cell penetration process using a conductive nanoprobe. The highly electrically sensitive nanoprobes that were fabricated and the indium tin oxide electrode-integrated cell chip were found to be very effective for monitoring the cell penetration process via current changes that appear as spike-like negative currents. Moreover, the assembly of cargoes onto the nanoprobes was controllable and could reach its maximum load in a very short period of time (<10 min) based on the same electrical system that was used for monitoring cell penetration and without the need for any complex chemical linkers or mediators. Even more remarkably, the cargo assembled on the surface of the nanoprobe was successfully released in a very short period of time (<10 s), regardless of the surrounding intracellular or extracellular environments. The monitoring of cell penetration, assembly of quantum dots (QDs), and release of QDs into the intracellular environment were all accomplished using our whole-electrical system that combined a conductive nanoprobe with cell chip technology. This is a novel technology, which can eliminate complex and time-consuming steps owing to chemical modifications, as well as reduce the time needed for the delivery of cargo into the cell cytosol/nucleus during cell penetration, which is very important for reducing cell damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytosol 3ahumans 3aindium tin oxide 3amonitoring 3aquantum dots 3astem cells 0asingle-cell manipulation 0aelectrical assembly and release 0ananoprobe 0aquantum dots 0ahuman neural stem cell1 aCho, Hyeon-Yeol1 aLee, Ki-Bum1 aKim, Seung U.1 aChoi, Jeong-Woo0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.20709-20716dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam504498x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012100173300001600294520190400310592002802214650001902242650002502261650002402286650001602310650001602326650001802342650001502360650001502375650002202390650001302412650002502425650001702450650001402467650001702481650001202498650001002510651001102520653001502531653002202546653002402568653001902592700002402611700002902635773012602664856008802790852000902878655001202887IND60555377120221120090207.0180830e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055537712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriefer, Carmen10aFood waste prevention in Europe – A cause-driven approach to identify the most relevant leverage points for action  ap. 155-165.  aThe reduction of food waste is seen as an important lever for ensuring food security and diminishing environmental burdens. In context of the forthcoming revision of the European Waste Directive the EC is planning to commit its Member States to reduce their food waste by 30% until 2025. To reach this ambitious objective effective prevention measures have to be implemented. This requires detailed knowledge on drivers and reasons for food waste generation along the food supply chain and the ‘hotspots of wastage’. The paper provides information on these two topics. Main drivers for food waste generation are process- and market-based standards, non-compliance with food safety requirements, exceeding of expiry dates, marketing standards or logistic constraints, but also consumer preferences and societal trends like growing prosperity, declining food prices, rising number of single households and increasing employment of women. As surveys and calculations indicate, the highest waste rates in Europe occur at the first stage (primary production) and the last stage (household sector) of the supply chain. The paper further presents a set of policy options on European and national level which are considered most promising to prevent food waste. The selection is based on a thorough literature review, reflecting also the results of a stakeholder workshop held in November 2014. The analysis reveals that most of the prevention measures implemented in the EU Member States up to now are soft instruments like awareness campaigns, round tables, networks and information platforms. In addition to this soft instruments, the paper advocates for the introduction of more rigorous approaches like the abolishment of subsidies on food, amendments to EU regulations and economic incentives. Further research is required to assess the impacts and efficacy of economic and regulatory instruments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aconsumer preferences 3aeconomic incentives 3afood prices 3afood safety 3afood security 3afood waste 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3aprimary productivity 3astakeholders 3asubsidies 3asupply chain 3asurveys 3awomen 3aEurope 0aFood waste 0aFood supply chain 0aPrevention measures 0aPolicy options1 aJörissen, Juliane,1 aBräutigam, Klaus-Rainer0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2016 May,  June, v. 109 p.155-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245019100173300001600364520184000380592002802220650002502248650001202273650001102285650001802296650002102314650002002335650001502355650001002370650002202380650001402402650001902416650001402435650001102449650000702460650001402467650001502481650001302496650001602509650002102525700002402546700001802570700002002588700001802608700002902626700003102655700002502686700002802711773010202739856008902841852000902930655001202939IND60534290220170629000000.0160802e20160121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053429022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b022152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Renzo C.10aCharacterization of Acid-Soluble Oxidized Asphaltenes by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry: Insights on Oxycracking Processes and Asphaltene Structural Features  ap. 171-179.  aThe dissolution of organic matter into water via oxidative processes, named oxycracking, has been practiced for a long time for the removal of organic pollutants, in which oxygen induces breakage and functionalization of organic molecules. Recently, oxycracking has been explored as an alternative approach to handling the increased amount of solid residues produced in oil sands upgrading activities that involve carbon rejection in solvent deasphalting units. This study uses an asphaltene-rich feedstock, operationally known as petroleum pitch, isolated from an Athabasca bitumen vacuum residue, which was submitted to oxycracking reactions at 200 and 220 °C. The feed and water-soluble fractions isolated at pH 1, termed acid-soluble oxidized asphaltenes (ASOA), were analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry [Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS)] using electrospray and atmospheric pressure photoionization ion sources. FTICR-MS analysis revealed extensive oxidation of all compound classes originally present in the asphaltene-rich feed. Double bond equivalent (DBE) distribution plots show that sequential carboxylation (formation of a carboxyl group) occurs progressively with an increasing reaction temperature, leading to the incorporation of up to 15 oxygen atoms per molecule, whereas simultaneous decarboxylation reactions produce a CO₂-rich gas phase. ASOA samples also show lower overall carbon number distributions than the asphaltene feed, which is direct evidence of C–C bond cleavage during the oxycracking process. In addition, molecular fragments detected in ASOA after carbon–carbon bond cleavages showed not only lower carbon numbers but also lower DBEs per molecule, consistent with a more dominant archipelago architecture for the parent asphaltene molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3abitumen 3acarbon 3acarboxylation 3achemical bonding 3adecarboxylation 3afeedstocks 3agases 3amass spectrometry 3aoil sands 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3asolvents 3atemperature 3awater solubility1 aRadović, Jagoš

The synthesized composite was characterized and applied to magnetic-μ-dispersive solid-phase extraction of oxcarbazepine (OXC), phenytoin (PHT), and carbamazepine (CBZ) from human plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid samples prior to analysis by a high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector. The extraction parameters were investigated and the optimum condition was obtained when the variables were set to the following: sorbent type, Fe₃O₄@polyDA–MWCNTs (length < 2 μm); sample pH, 6; amount of sorbent, 15 mg; sorption time, 1.5 min at room temperature; type and volume of the eluent, 2.5 mL methanol; and salt content, none added. Under the optimized conditions, the calibration curves are linear in the concentration range 2–2000 ng/mL, the limits of detection are in the range 0.4–3.1 ng/mL, and the relative standard deviations and relative recoveries of plasma (spiked at 200 ng/mL) and CSF (spiked at 50 ng/mL) are in the ranges 1.4–8.2% and 92.8–96.5%, respectively. The applicability of the method was successfully confirmed by extraction and determination of OXC, PHT, and CBZ in biological matrices.

The models exploit the theory of the mechanical behavior of sunflower seeds and its kernel with moisture content, variety, size and loading orientation. The proposed models have been tested on three common Iranian varieties of sunflower seeds and their kernels namely Azargol, Shahroodi and Fandoghi. The results showed that rupture forces for both sunflower seed and kernel decreased with increasing moisture content, while in both loading orientations and for all varieties and size categories, the absorbed energy and deformation at rupture point increased as moisture content increased. The required compressive forces in both orientations, to initiate sunflower seed hulls rupture were higher (30.06  117.46 N) than those required to rupture the kernels (11.64  39.98 N). The seeds required lower dehulling compressive force when loaded under horizontal orientation than vertical orientation. However, an opposite trend was observed for the kernels. The deformation of kernels was substantially higher (1.92  2.90 mm) than the seeds (0.47  1.66 mm) for all variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3adeformation 3aenergy 3ahulling 3ahulls 3amathematical models 3aseeds 3asunflower seed 3awater content 0amodeling 0afracture resistance 0akernel 0amoisture content 0asize 0asunflower seed 0avariety1 aEmadi, Bagher1 aAbbaspour Fard, Mohammad Hossein1 aSaiedirad, Mohammad Hossein0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2011 May 18, v. 7, no. 3dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.21183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002200172245005100194300001300245520167200258592002801930650001901958650002701977650001302004650002202017650001702039650001402056650001602070650001502086650001502101650001502116650001702131650001102148650001002159650002502169650002802194650003102222650002202253650002602275653002202301653004002323653002102363653003002384653002802414653001502442653003702457700004002494773009402534856008802628852000902716655001202725IND60113556620221117031054.0190318e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011355662DNAL7 a232868792pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatilla, Angel J.10aNon-symbiotic hemoglobins in the life of seeds  ap. 7-15.  aNon-symbiotic hemoglobins (nsHbs), ancestors of symbiotic-Hbs, are hexacoordinated dimeric proteins, for which the crystal structure is well described. According to the extent of hexacoordination, nsHbs are classified as belonging to class-1 (nsHbs1) or class-2 (nsHbs2). The nsHbs1 show weak hexacoordination, moderate rates of O2-binding, very small rates of O2 dissociation, and a remarkably high affinity for O2, all suggesting a function involving O2 scavenging. In contrast, the nsHbs2 exhibit strong hexacoordination, low rates of O2-binding and moderately low O2 dissociation and affinity, suggesting a sensing role for sustained low (μM) levels of O2. The existence of spatial and specific expression of nsHbs1 suggests that nsHbs play tissue-specific rather than housekeeping functions. The permeation of O2 into seeds is usually prevented during the desiccation phase and early imbibition, generating an internal hypoxic environment that leads to ATP limitation. During evolution, the seed has acquired mechanisms to prevent or reduce this hypoxic stress. The nsHbs1/NO cycle appear to be involved in modulating the redox state in the seed and in maintaining an active metabolism. Under O2 deficit, NADH and NO are synthesized in the seed and nsHbs1 scavenges O2, which is used to transform NO into NO3− with concomitant formation of Fe3+-nsHbs1. Expression of nsHbs1 is not detectable in dry viable seeds. However, in the seeds cross-talk occurs between nsHbs1 and NO during germination. This review considers the current status of our knowledge of seed nsHbs and considers key issues of further work to better understand their role in seed physiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aancestry 3acrystal structure 3adissociation 3aevolution 3agermination 3ahemoglobin 3aimbibition 3ametabolism 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen 3aseeds 2aHypoxiaxmetabolism. 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSeedsxmetabolism 2aSymbiosisxphysiology 0aCrystal structure 0aHexacoordinate and dimeric proteins 0aHypoxia in seeds 0aNon-symbiotic hemoglobins 0ansHbs/NO cycle in seeds 0aRice nsHbs 0aSpatial expression of seed nsHbs1 aRodríguez-Gacio, María del Carmen0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 Mar., v. 87 p.7-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03881naa a2201009 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245004600173300001400219520124600233592002801479650002101507650001001528650002501538650001801563650001301581650002001594650001401614650000901628650001001637650001101647650001701658650001101675650001101686650001401697650002801711650001501739650001501754653002201769653001601791653002301807653001501830653001901845653000801864653003701872653001001909653003401919653000901953653005601962653001002018653004402028653000702072653002402079653000702103653002502110653000702135653002002142653000702162653001702169653000802186653002902194653000802223653002802231653001202259653003702271653000602308653001102314653000902325653003602334653000702370653001502377653000802392653002902400653000702429653001202436653000702448653001602455653000802471653002502479653000702504653001802511653000702529653002302536653000902559653004102568653000602609653001502615700001702630773012202647856008102769852000902850655001202859IND60596979520221119211123.0180622e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059697952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEggersdorfer, Manfred10aCarotenoids in human nutrition and health  ap. 18-26.  aCarotenoids are naturally occurring pigments found in most fruits and vegetables, plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria. Humans cannot synthesize carotenoids and must ingest them in food or via supplementation. Carotenoids have a range of functions in human health. They primarily exert antioxidant effects, but individual carotenoids may also act through other mechanisms; for example, β-carotene has a pro-vitamin A function, while lutein/zeaxanthin constitute macular pigment in the eye. The benefit of lutein in reducing progression of age-related macular eye disease and cataracts is strengthening; an intake recommendation would help to generate awareness in the general population to have an adequate intake of lutein rich foods. There is evidence that carotenoids, in addition to beneficial effects on eye health, also produce improvements in cognitive function and cardiovascular health, and may help to prevent some types of cancer. Despite the evidence for the health benefits of carotenoids, large population-based supplementation studies have produced mixed results for some of the carotenoids. To establish and confirm the health benefits of the different carotenoids more research, including clinical studies, is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aalgae 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-carotene 3acataract 3aclinical trials 3acognition 3aeyes 3afoods 3afruits 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alutein 3aneoplasms 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3avegetables 3azeaxanthin 0aCancer prevention 0aCarotenoids 0aCognitive function 0aEye health 0aHealthy ageing 0aAMD 0aage-related macular degeneration 0aAREDS 0aAge-Related Eye Disease Study 0aATBC 0aα-Tocopherol, β -Carotene Cancer Prevention Study 0aCARET 0aβ -Carotene And Retinol Efficacy Trial 0aCI 0aconfidence interval 0aCS 0acontrast sensitivity 0aGT 0aglare tolerance 0aHR 0ahazard ratio 0aHDL 0ahigh-density lipoprotein 0aLDL 0alow-density lipoprotein 0aLinxian 0aLinxian General Population Trial 0aL 0alutein 0aMPOD 0aMacular Pigment Optical Density 0aOR 0aodds ratio 0aPHS 0aPhysicians' Health Study 0aPL 0aplacebo 0aPP 0aphotophobia 0aPRT 0aphotostress recovery 0aRR 0arelative risk 0aSD 0astandard deviation 0aTICS 0aTelephone Interview Cognitive Status 0aZ 0azeaxanthin1 aWyss, Adrian0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 652 p.18-26dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009000174300001800264520153500282592002801817650001501845650002201860650001801882650004301900650001101943650001201954650002201966650001301988650001502001650001302016650001302029650001502042650001802057700001802075700002202093700001902115700002002134700002602154700002402180773014802204856008102352852000902433655001202442IND60596422520221118022845.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1054-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolovyeva, ElizavetaM.10aFractionOptimizer: a method for optimal peptide fractionation in bottom-up proteomics  ap. 3827-3833.  aRecent advances in mass spectrometry and separation technologies created the opportunities for deep proteome characterization using shotgun proteomics approaches. The “real world” sample complexity and high concentration range limit the sensitivity of this characterization. The common strategy for increasing the sensitivity is sample fractionation prior to analysis either at the protein or the peptide level. Typically, fractionation at the peptide level is performed using linear gradient high-performance liquid chromatography followed by uniform fraction collection. However, this way of peptide fractionation results in significantly suboptimal operation of the mass spectrometer due to the non-uniform distribution of peptides between the fractions. In this work, we propose an approach based on peptide retention time prediction allowing optimization of chromatographic conditions and fraction collection procedures. An open-source software implementing the approach called FractionOptimizer was developed and is available at http://hg.theorchromo.ru/FractionOptimizer . The performance of the developed tool was demonstrated for human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line lysate. In these experiments, we improved the uniformity of the peptides distribution between fractions. Moreover, in addition to 13,492 peptides, we found 6787 new peptides not identified in the experiments without fractionation and up to 800 new proteins (or 25%).

M.10aFormation of Methane Clathrate Hydrates in Coal Moisture: Implications for Coalbed Methane Resources and Reservoir Pressures  ap. 88-97.  aAdsorption, X-ray diffraction, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of subbituminous to high-volatile bituminous coal at in situ moisture content, low temperatures, and moderate pressures demonstrate that a significant proportion of the inherent moisture (nonmobile water) is available to form methane clathrate hydrates. These results have implications for coal gas resources and reservoir pressures in current areas of permafrost and the much larger regions that were glaciated during the Pleistocene. Methane adsorption tests indicate the clathrates form comparatively rapidly in coal micro- and mesopores from an immobile water phase, at lower pressures than those formed in macroporous materials. At successively higher experimental pressures, hydrates nucleate and grow rapidly on the scale of minutes to hours, until an “apparent” equilibrium pressure is reached. The onset of hydrate formation at 0 °C is at about 3.25 MPa for a Tarn coal with 33% moisture and at slightly higher pressures for the other coals with lower inherent moisture. The amount of gas consumed in hydrate formation, in excess of that attributed to sorption, is 11.6 cm³/g coal for the Tarn coal (Alaska) with 33% moisture, 8.15 cm³/g coal for a Dietz coal (Wyoming) with 22% moisture, and 1.85 cm³/g coal for a Texas coal with about 8% moisture. On a volume of gas (STP) per volume of water basis at 8 MPa, the Tarn and Dietz coal have similar values (35 and 37 cm³/cm³), whereas the Texas coal is measureably less (24 cm³/cm³). At 8 MPa and 0 °C, about 20% of the inherent moisture has participated in hydrate formation for the Tarn and Deitz coals and 13% for the Texas coal. If hydrate formation strips methane from the sorbed state, the proportion of water contributing to hydrate calculates was over 100% for the Texas coal, which suggests that methane is mainly forming from free gas. The methane hydrates analyzed by X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are cubic (Pm3n̅ space group) and have small and large cage sI structures. NMR and PXRD spectra indicates that the small cages are about 90% occupied, while the large cages are completely full, yielding a stoichiometry of ca. CH₄·6H₂O, which is consistent with other natural hydrates. There is some evidence that some methane gas remains trapped in the smallest pores, whereas the hydrates occupy large pores, which may be due to the suppression of hydrate formation by high capillary pressures. The formation of methane hydrates, particularly in low-rank coals, markedly increases the capacity of the coal to store gas. Depending on the coal moisture content and coal rank, methane storage capacity in gas hydrates is up to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the gas storage capacity of the coal by sorption alone. Since low-rank coals invariably have high moisture content, if the strata lie with the hydrate stability zone, significant gas storage in hydrates is anticipated, if gas is available. At the low temperature required for hydrate formation, however, self-sourced methane from methanogenesis or thermal alteration is not anticipated. Successive formation and dissociation of methane hydrates during glacial and interglacial times in the Pleistocene can be anticipated to have impacted shallow gas reservoirs, including coals, to depth up to about 800 m, depending on the surface temperature and geothermal gradient. It is speculated that during the Pleistocene free and sorbed coal gas was scavenged during the formation of hydrates, and this process may explain the low gas content of some high-latitude coals. Similarly, lower than anticipated pore pressure and lack of free water in the Horseshoe Canyon coals in western Canada may be the result of dissociation of hydrates forming overpressures, which potentially could hydraulically fracture the coal and flush the coal of free water. Subsequent dissipation of the gas pressure would lead to the current low reservoir pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acoal 3acoalbed methane 3adissociation 3agas hydrate 3alatitude 3amethane 3amethane production 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apermafrost 3aporous media 3astoichiometry 3asurface temperature 3awater content 3aAlaska 3aTexas 3aWyoming1 aBustin, R.

Therefore, land evaluation involves many aspects of natural conditions, economic, and social issues. This research was conducted in a hilly region of Central Vietnam to assess the land suitability of potential agricultural land use types that are based on scientific and local knowledge. In the frame of this research, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA); Analytical Hierarchy Analysis (AHP); Geographic Information System (GIS); and, scoring based scientific literature and local knowledge were applied for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for land use evaluation. The results of the PRA survey reveal that five plants offer great agricultural potential in the research area, namely rice, cassava, acacia, banana, and rubber. The land suitability of each plant type varies, depending on physical conditions as well as economic and social aspects. Acacia and cassava represent the most suitable plant types in the research area. Recommendations regarding agricultural land use planning in the A Luoi district are brought forward based on the land evaluation results. The combination of scientific and local knowledge in land assessment based on GIS technology, AHP, and PRA methods is a promising approach for land evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aagricultural land 3abananas 3acassava 3adeveloping countries 3ageographic information systems 3aland evaluation 3aland suitability 3aland use planning 3amulti-criteria decision making 3arice 3arubber 3arural areas 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aVietnam1 aPham, Tung  Gia1 aKappas, M.q(Martin),1 aWyss, Daniel 1 aTran, Chau  Thi Minh0 tLand.g2019 June 03, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land80600903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008100160300002000241520155600261592002801817650001601845650001401861650002701875650001301902650002801915650001901943650001801962650003301980650001602013650002102029650003702050650000902087653002402096653002502120653001802145653002402163653002602187653002302213653001002236653002402246700002602270700001902296700002302315700002202338773012602360856007502486852000902561655001202570IND60527788020170710000000.0160715e20141126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052778802DNAL7 a10.1021/am506134k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalland, Sylvain10aStrong and Moldable Cellulose Magnets with High Ferrite Nanoparticle Content  ap. 20524-20534.  aA major limitation in the development of highly functional hybrid nanocomposites is brittleness and low tensile strength at high inorganic nanoparticle content. Herein, cellulose nanofibers were extracted from wood and individually decorated with cobalt-ferrite nanoparticles and then for the first time molded at low temperature (<120 °C) into magnetic nanocomposites with up to 93 wt % inorganic content. The material structure was characterized by TEM and FE-SEM and mechanically tested as compression molded samples. The obtained porous magnetic sheets were further impregnated with a thermosetting epoxy resin, which improved the load-bearing functions of ferrite and cellulose material. A nanocomposite with 70 wt % ferrite, 20 wt % cellulose nanofibers, and 10 wt % epoxy showed a modulus of 12.6 GPa, a tensile strength of 97 MPa, and a strain at failure of ca. 4%. Magnetic characterization was performed in a vibrating sample magnetometer, which showed that the coercivity was unaffected and that the saturation magnetization was in proportion with the ferrite content. The used ferrite, CoFe₂O₄, is a magnetically hard material, demonstrated by that the composite material behaved as a traditional permanent magnet. The presented processing route is easily adaptable to prepare millimeter-thick and moldable magnetic objects. This suggests that the processing method has the potential to be scaled-up for industrial use for the preparation of a new subcategory of magnetic, low-cost, and moldable objects based on cellulose nanofibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3aepoxides 3aferrimagnetic materials 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awood 0acellulose nanofiber 0aferrite nanoparticle 0ananocomposite 0acompression-molding 0amechanical properties 0amagnetic composite 0aepoxy 0amaterial processing1 aAndersson, Richard L.1 aStröm, Valter1 aOlsson, Richard T.1 aBerglund, Lars A.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Nov. 26, v. 6, no. 22 p.20524-20534dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam506134k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129024002200167024001900189040001800208100002200226245013300248300001800381506007600399520192900475592002802404506003702432650002202469650001302491650002302504650001602527650000902543650002302552650003402575650002902609650001402638650001802652650001802670650003402688650002102722650001402743650001402757650001602771650001002787700001802797700001902815700002002834700002202854700002502876700002102901700001902922700005902941773013803000856008103138852000903219655001203228IND60596420020221207142839.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-018-3086-62doi7 a10.1007/s00122-018-3086-62chorus7 aPMC60042772pmcid7 a295890412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuliana, Philomin10aGenome-wide association mapping for resistance to leaf rust, stripe rust and tan spot in wheat reveals potential candidate genes  ap. 1405-1422.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKEY MESSAGE: Genome-wide association mapping in conjunction with population sequencing map and Ensembl plants was used to identify markers/candidate genes linked to leaf rust, stripe rust and tan spot resistance in wheat. Leaf rust (LR), stripe rust (YR) and tan spot (TS) are some of the important foliar diseases in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To identify candidate resistance genes for these diseases in CIMMYT’s (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) International bread wheat screening nurseries, we used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in conjunction with information from the population sequencing map and Ensembl plants. Wheat entries were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotyped in replicated trials. Using a mixed linear model, we observed that seedling resistance to LR was associated with 12 markers on chromosomes 1DS, 2AS, 2BL, 3B, 4AL, 6AS and 6AL, and seedling resistance to TS was associated with 14 markers on chromosomes 1AS, 2AL, 2BL, 3AS, 3AL, 3B, 6AS and 6AL. Seedling and adult plant resistance (APR) to YR were associated with several markers at the distal end of chromosome 2AS. In addition, YR APR was also associated with markers on chromosomes 2DL, 3B and 7DS. The potential candidate genes for these diseases included several resistance genes, receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinases and defense-related enzymes. However, extensive LD in wheat that decays at about 5 × 10⁷ bps, poses a huge challenge for delineating candidate gene intervals and candidates should be further mapped, functionally characterized and validated. We also explored a segment on chromosome 2AS associated with multiple disease resistance and identified seventeen disease resistance linked genes. We conclude that identifying candidate genes linked to significant markers in GWAS is feasible in wheat, thus creating opportunities for accelerating molecular breeding.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriticum aestivum 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acorn 3adisease resistance 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping by sequencing 3aleaf rust 3alinear models 3amature plants 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aresistance genes 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3astripe rust 3awheat1 aSingh, RaviP.1 aSingh, PawanK.1 aPoland, JesseA.1 aBergstrom, GaryC.1 aHuerta-Espino, Julio1 aBhavani, Sridhar1 aCrossa, José,1 aSorrells, MarkE.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7367-26630 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2018 July, v. 131, no. 7 p.1405-1422dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-018-3086-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002400147245011000171300001800281500000900299520134100308592002801649650000801677650001301685650001701698650001901715650000901734650001801743650001701761700002101778700002301799700001501822773012201837852000901959856008401968655001202052IND4460708620221116142910.0191228e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446070862DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2010.10.05922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreuser, William C.10aRemoving Sand from Putting Green Clipping Samples Substantially Reduces Clipping Weight Measurement Error  ap. 1268-1273.  aepub  aAccurate determination of turfgrass yield via clipping harvest can be problematic on closely mowed research putting greens because sand often contaminates samples. Scientists reporting putting green clipping yields rarely mention if or how sand was removed from clippings. The two objectives were: (i) evaluate the efficacy of three clipping cleaning methods (water decantation, forced air, and a vibrating pan method) and (ii) evaluate the effect of sand contamination on field data variability. All three clipping cleaning methods effectively removed coarse sand from the sample while only the vibrating pan method effectively removed the fine sand fraction. Turf clippings were collected from four different research putting greens, dried, weighed, cleaned, and reweighed to calculate percent sand and treatment variability. Debris mass ranged from 0.01 to 0.92 kg kg⁻¹ (0.001–0.535 cm³ cm⁻³) and averaged 0.26 kg kg⁻¹ sand with a standard deviation of 0.18 kg kg⁻¹ Cleaning clippings reduced the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of all treatments (n = 104) by 0.92 g m⁻² and 15%, respectively. Sand debris varied spatially across each green regardless of sand topdressing. Sand debris in golf putting green clipping samples constitutes a large enough percentage of total mass to justify its removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acleaning 3agolf courses 3alawns and turf 3asand 3asand fraction 3aturf grasses1 aFish, Matthew P.1 aSoldat, Douglas J.1 aBauer, Sam0 tCrop science.g2011 May, v. 51, no. 3 p.1268-1273dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2010.10.05923Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01880naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009600171300001100267500001400278520052300292592002800815650002000843650002500863650001600888650001100904650001000915650001600925650001400941651001100955700003200966700002900998700002801027700002901055700003301084700002701117700002701144700007101171773012401242856008301366852000901449655001201458IND60712840120221121124148.0201217e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071284012DNAL7 a10.1007/s13314-020-00401-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz-Lagunas, Blas10aColletotrichum gloeosporioides causes anthracnose on grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) in Mexico  ap. 31.  aNAL-light  aThe grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) is an important crop for citrus farming in Mexico.

However, little is known about the growth mechanisms involved in the formation of this kind of nanostructures, yet. Here, CuInS₂ nanorods and networks were synthesized through a facile low-cost and phosphine-free method. Copper and indium sources were added together in the presence of oleylamine and oleic acid. Changing the amount of oleic acid present in the reaction solution influenced the reactivity of the monomers, and consequently, the size of copper sulfide seeds formed in situ after the injection of tert-dodecanethiol, serving as the source of sulfur. Two different growth mechanisms of CuInS₂ nanorods were observed, depending on the size of the copper sulfide seeds. Larger seeds (8 nm), which were generated with relatively small amounts of oleic acid, resulted in the formation of hybrid copper sulfide-copper indium disulfide nanocrystals as intermediates in the growth process of the nanorods, while smaller seeds (4 nm) obtained with relatively large amounts of oleic acid were gradually converted to copper indium sulfide nanorods. At longer reaction times, these nanorods formed network structures. The reaction between oleylamine and oleic acid at high temperature turned out to be the crucial factor to induce the attachment of nanorods to multipods and networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy conversion 3aindium 3ananocrystals 3ananorods 3aoleic acid 3aseeds 3asolar energy 3asulfides 3asulfur 3atemperature 0acopper indium disulfide 0acopper sulfide 0ahybrid nanostructure 0ashape control 0acolloidal synthesis 0ananorods1 aBloemen, Mathieu1 aParisi, Jürgen1 aKolny-Olesiak, Joanna0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Nov. 26, v. 6, no. 22 p.20535-20543dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam50614543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245015600171300001800327506002800345520153300373592002801906506003701934650002101971650001201992650002602004650001102030650002202041650001202063650001102075650000902086651001402095700002502109700001602134700002502150773010402175856008002279852000902359655001202368IND60764531920221207144455.0211121e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076453192DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2004122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANTOH, ALFRED ALFONSO10aShort Communication: Agricultural biodiversity and economic productivity of the yards in Arguni Bawah, Kaimana District, West Papua Province, Indonesia  ap. 1020-1026.  aResource is Open Access  aAntoh AA, Arifin NHS, Chozin MA, Arifin HS. 2019. Agricultural biodiversity and economic productivity of the yards in Arguni Bawah, Kaimana District, West Papua Province, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 1020-1026. Papua Island, Indonesia has abundance of agricultural biological resources. This is reflected in a variety of agricultural products in different parts of the area and in the use of yards, which is not fully utilized. This study was aimed at mapping the agricultural biodiversity of the yards, as well as measuring their economic productivity. The study area was Arguni Bawah Sub-district, Kaimana District, West Papua Province, Indonesia, and the study was conducted from November 2017 to March 2018. The average number of plant species recorded from yards were 13, number of individuals being 72 in an average yard size of 696 m2. The smallest yard was 231 m2 with only three species and 4 individuals. The maximum number of species found were 26 with 267 individuals. The maximum size of yards studied was 3,000 m2. There are five functional types of plants with high density and SDR, there are the species producing starch (taro and banana), vegetables (gedi and spinach), fruits (banana) and ornamentals, among others. The Shanon-Wiener diversity index (H´) ranged from 1.8 to 2.5, indicating that the biodiversity of plant species in the yards may be interpreted as abundant or moderate. The evaluation of economic productivity showed that average cash income received by households from yards was Rp.7,693,000.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagrobiodiversity 3abananas 3aeconomic productivity 3aincome 3aornamental plants 3aspinach 3astarch 3ataro 3aIndonesia1 aARIFIN, NURHAYATI HS1 aCHOZIN, M A1 aArifin, Hadi Susilo,0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Mar., v. 20, no. 4 p.1020-1026dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2004123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245012700213506007600340520158200416592002801998506003702026650001302063650002402076650002502100650002302125650002102148650001602169651001002185700002302195700001802218700001402236700002402250700001602274700002302290773011902313856007902432852000902511655001202520IND60649704320221207065345.0190705e20190503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064970432DNAL7 a10.3390/insects100501282doi7 aPMC65723902pmcid7 a310588672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontanilla, Alyssa  M.10aTaxonomic and Functional Ant Diversity Along tropical, Subtropical, and Subalpine Elevational Transects in Southwest China  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough elevational gradients of biodiversity have long been the topic of scientific research, information on patterns of, and processes that shape insect community structure across elevation is still lacking. Addressing this gap requires the use of both taxonomic and functional approaches when studying diversity across elevational gradients. In this study, we examined taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversity of ant assemblages sampled along tropical, subtropical, and subalpine elevational transects in Yunnan Province, southwest China. Species richness was used to quantify taxonomic alpha diversity, and two indices (FD and FRic) were calculated using morphological measurements to quantify functional alpha diversity. Taxonomic and functional beta diversity were partitioned into their turnover- and nestedness-resultant components. Though temperature and functional alpha diversity decreased linearly with increasing elevation, taxonomic alpha diversity showed a significant logarithmic decrease, with few species present at elevations greater than 3000 m a.s.l. The turnover-resultant component of taxonomic beta diversity increased with increasing elevational distance, while the nestedness-resultant component of functional beta diversity increased with increasing elevational distance in the subtropical transect. The observed patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity reflected ants&rsquo; thermophilic nature, implying functional adaptations (i.e., nested functional diversity) at higher elevations where environmental conditions were unfavorable.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaltitude 3acommunity structure 3afunctional diversity 3ainsect communities 3aspecies richness 3atemperature 3aChina1 aNakamura, Akihiro 1 aXu, Zhenghui 1 aCao, Min 1 aKitching, Roger  L.1 aTang, Yong 1 aBurwell, Chris  J.0 tInsects.g2019 May 03, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects100501283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002500192245014300217300001600360506007600376520055800452592002801010506003701038650002601075650001701101650002401118650004301142650001101185650002201196650001601218650001501234650001001249653004401259653002201303653002101325653002401346653003101370700002201401700002301423773011101446856008601557852000901643655001201652IND60570812720221207142553.0180905e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057081272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.06.0282doi7 aPMC55850562pmcid7 a286548692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathias, Patricia I.12aA review of high performance liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric urinary methods for anticancer drug exposure of health care workers  ap. 316-324.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis review describes published high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) methods for the determination of anticancer drugs in human urine as non-invasive tool for monitoring of health care worker exposure to antineoplastic and cytotoxic drugs.

Carrying capacity to preserve biodiversity on ecotourism in Mount Rinjani National Park, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 978-989. Mount Rinjani National Park (MRNP) in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia has applied ecotourism which becomes more popular at international and national level. Yet, the MRNP ecotourism faces various problems such as ecotourism resources damage, erosion, or garbage left by ecotourism activities, etc. This study aims to analyze (i) the land suitability for ecotourism based on criteria of tourism object range, land use and land cover, zone type, biodiversity range, and slope, and (ii) carrying capacity of the ecotourism area, the total number of visitors who can enjoy ecotourism attraction based on activities type, total area, capacity days, and turnover factor. The results of the land suitability for ecotourism analysis show that the MRNP ecotourism has been applied on the suitable land for ecotourism, except in Pelawangan Senaru and at the Peak of Mount Rinjani due to its sensitive and fragile area. The carrying capacity assessment using Douglass formula (1982) has counted the visitors for up to 42.527 visitors per year for camping activity. Generally, this value is under the average actual visitors at present, i.e. 44.112 visitors per year. It means the MRNP ecotourism is already exceeded its carrying capacity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3aecotourism 3aland suitability 3aland use and land cover maps 3amunicipal solid waste 3anational parks 3aIndonesia 0acarrying capacity 0aecotourism 0anational park1 aArifin, Hadi Susilo,1 aPRAMUDYA, BAMBANG1 aSri Mulatsih,0 tBiodiversitas.g2017 July, v. 18, no. 3 p.978-989dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1803163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010500162506002800267520149300295592002801788506003701816650001801853650001801871650002401889650002601913650000901939650001401948653001801962653001601980653000901996653000902005700002902014773009202043856008002135852000902215655001202224IND60764532120221207144454.0211122e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076453212DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2108582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Viet The13aAn in silico approach for evaluation of rbcL and matK loci for DNA barcoding of Cucurbitaceae family  aResource is Open Access  aHo VT, Nguyen MP. 2020. An in silico approach for evaluation of rbcL and matK loci for DNA barcoding of Cucurbitaceae family. Biodiversitas 21: 3879-3885. DNA barcodes have been used intensively to discriminate different species in Cucurbitaceae family. The main of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of rbcL and matK loci for 16 species of Cucurbitaceae family by using in silico approach. For analysis, sequences were firstly retrieved from NCBI and then calculated for sequence parameters. Sequences were then aligned and constructed phylogenetic try and examined for species resolution ability. The obtained data show the variability of resolving capacity among species. rbcL region is suitable for distinguishing five species namely S. edule, M. cochinchinensis, L. aegyptiaca, C. melo, and C. pepo, whereas matK locus is more proper for different five species consisting of M. balsamina, M. cochinchinensis, M. charantia, S. edule, and C. sativus. The resolving power is improved sharply by analyzing the rbcL + matK combination with up to nine species consisting of C. lanatus, B. hispida, C. melo, C. sativus, C. pepo, C. agryrosperma, L. aegyptiaca, S. edule, and M. cochinchinensis. Therefore, the integration of rbcL and matK loci may improve the competence of assessing genetic relatedness at species level of members in Cucurbitaceae family. The obtained information could be important for choosing proper DNA barcode loci for phylogenetic study of this crop family.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucurbitaceae 3aDNA barcoding 3acomputer simulation 3agenetic relationships 3aloci 3aphylogeny 0acucurbitaceae 0adna barcode 0amatk 0arbcl1 aNguyễn, Minh Phương,0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Aug., v. 21, no. 8dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2108583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013300172300001400305520125900319592002801578650001001606650001501616650001101631650002101642650001301663650001501676650002101691650002901712650004401741650001001785653001601795653001501811653001501826653002001841653003201861700002201893700002001915773011501935856008602050852000902136655001202145IND60570812820221118052635.0180905e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057081282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Najjar, Nahed12aA rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the quantification of Fosfomycin in plasma, urine, and aqueous fluids  ap. 57-64.  aA simple and fast ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) method for the analysis of Fosfomycin in different matrices (human plasma/urine, and aqueous fluid) has been established and validated. Sample cleanup consists, depending on the matrix used, on protein precipitation or dilution with methanol containing isotopically labeled Fosfomycin as internal standard. Compounds, separated on a Luna Omega PS C18 column, were detected in multiple reactions monitoring in negative ion mode using API4000 system. With a total run time of 2min and using low volume of samples (plasma: 10μl, urine: 2μl, and aqueous fluid: 5μl), the covered ranges were: plasma (12.5–800μg/mL), urine (62.5–4000μg/mL), and aqueous fluid (1–160μg/mL). The method proved to be precise and accurate. The inaccuracy and imprecision in each matrix at the four tested quality controls including the lower limit of quantification were:: plasma (≤ 6.5%, ≤ 8%), urine (≤ 5.8%, ≤ 6.3%), and aqueous fluid (≤ 10.6%, ≤12%). The method is fast and robust which makes it relevant for pharmacokinetic studies and therapeutic drug monitoring. The appropriateness of the developed method in clinical application is also confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3afosfomycin 3ahumans 3aisotope labeling 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 0aAntibiotics 0aFosfomycin 0aLC–MS/MS 0aPharmacokinetic 0aTherapeutic drug monitoring1 aJantsch, Jonathan1 aGessner, André0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 1061-1062 p.57-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04069naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010900166500002000275520238900295592002802684650002002712650002202732650001702754650001802771650001602789650001402805650001802819650001702837650001602854650001602870650002502886650002302911650001102934650001202945650001102957650001502968650000702983650001802990650001303008650002303021650002303044650001703067650001203084650002203096700002003118700002803138700002303166700002003189700007603209773013503285856007403420852000903494655001203503IND60625479020221119063849.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062547902DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.129182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCenci, Daniel Frigeri10aEffect of meat and water temperature and emulsion speed on the industrial process for chicken mortadella  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA 2³ factorial design was performed to evaluate the meat and water temperature and the emulsification speed effects in relation to the physical state of animal proteins added to the emulsion process for chicken mortadella production. The dependent variables studied were instrumental texture, pH, protein, lipid, lipid oxidation, and sensory analysis. Under study conditions, the parameter for emulsion speed and water temperature had no significant difference to chemical analyses on the process. Yet, shear force showed a significant difference between treatments in the proportion of raw meat (chilled/frozen). The pH and TBAR values presented no significant difference between treatments, but it had differences during storage period, however inside of acceptable limits. The shear force was influenced by proportions of chilled/frozen raw meat, because the increase in the amount of cooled raw material is beneficial for sensory characteristics. The treatment T9 had a higher acceptability (82.07%), with conditions of process emulsification at 700 rpm, proportion of chilled/frozen raw meat material (1,280/1,280) and added water at 32 °C, resulting in a final 1.5 °C emulsified mass temperature. The proteins, lipid values, and microbiological analysis indicated that the mortadella is found within legislation parameters and the optimized process was successful. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The increasing demand for food quality product by consumers has made the food industry more competitive, thus making the supply of standardized, quality, and accessible products to the market extremely important. This study provides valuable information for the food industry, especially for emulsified meat products. In the industry, frozen and chilled meat raw materials and water are used to help in mixing with other ingredient. However, attention should be taken on the proportions and temperature that raw materials are used, as these have direct influence on the stability and quality emulsion and, consequently on the final product as well. To maintain the product standard quality, the standardization of operational parameters such as emulsification speed, chilled/frozen meat proportion, and water temperature were performed. The results showed that mortadella texture could be improved by the proportions of chilled/frozen raw material, being well accepted by consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal proteins 3achemical analysis 3achicken meat 3achilled meats 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3afood industry 3afood quality 3afrozen meat 3aingredients 3alaws and regulations 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amarkets 3amixing 3amortadella 3apH 3araw materials 3araw meat 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3astorage time 3atexture 3awater temperature1 aKilian, Josiane1 aJaneczko, Marcelo Urban1 aManzoli, Alexandra1 aRigo, Elisandra1 aSoares, Mónica Beatriz Alvarado1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5920-732X0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2018 Dec., v. 41, no. 8 p.e12918-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.129183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245018200176300001600358520132700374592002801701650001701729650000901746650001301755650002001768650000901788650002601797650001201823650001601835650001501851650000901866650000901875650001001884650002701894650002901921653001501950653001601965653002501981653003202006653001502038700002102053700001802074700002102092700002302113700002102136700001702157700002802174700001802202773011102220856008602331852000902417655001202426IND60570812920221118052637.0180905e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057081292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Md.

Due to the rapid degradation of methiocarb and its metabolites, a quick sample preparation method was developed using acetonitrile and salts followed by purification via dispersive- solid phase extraction (d-SPE). Seven-point calibration curves were constructed separately in each matrix, and good linearity was observed in each matrix-matched calibration curve with a coefficient of determination (R²) ≥ 0.991. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.0016 and 0.005mg/kg, respectively, for all tested analytes in various matrices. The method was validated in triplicate at three fortification levels (equivalent to 1, 2, and 10 times the limit of quantification) with a recovery rate ranging between 76.4–118.0% and a relative standard deviation≤10.0%. The developed method was successfully applied to market samples, and no residues of methiocarb and/or its metabolites were observed in the tested samples. In sum, this method can be applied for the routine analysis of methiocarb and its metabolites in foods of animal origins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abeef 3achickens 3adetection limit 3aeggs 3aliquid chromatography 3amarkets 3ametabolites 3amethiocarb 3amilk 3apork 3asalts 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aMethiocarb 0aMetabolites 0aAnimal food products 0aSimultaneous quantification 0aLC–MS/MS1 aAbd El-Aty, A.M.1 aNa, Tae-Woong1 aPark, Joon-Seong1 aKabir, Md.

In this context, feasibility of struvite (MgNH4PO4·6H2O) recovery, an alternative P fertilizer is already demonstrated at laboratory scale from range of waste streams of farm, municipal and industrial origin, with reasonably high orthophosphate recovery efficiency (∼90%). However, apart from a few commercial extraction units using municipal sludge and urine, large scale struvite recovery is not widely adopted for many of these sources. Moreover, need of some research interventions that are restricting its profitable recovery are also highlighted by earlier studies. To increase recovery efficiency from identified potential sources in terms of cost and energy input, research focuses on some new aspects of the process such as prospects of alternative recyclable magnesium sources, different seed materials and their related issues, which are analyzed in this review. Prospects of nitrogen conservation through struvite recovery and fertilizer value of struvite considering its properties, comparative performance with conventional fertilizer and interaction with soil and plant growth are also critically reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarms 3amagnesium 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3anitrogen 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant growth 3asludge 3asoil 3aurine 0aStruvite 0aPhosphorus 0aRecovery 0aMagnesium 0aSeed 0aNitrogen 0aFertilizer1 aWest, Helen1 aClarke, Michèle,1 aBaruah, D.C.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2016 Feb., v. 107 p.142-156dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245014000179300001600319500001500335520224700350592002802597650001602625650002002641650001902661650002502680650002202705650001102727650001202738650001802750650001102768650001502779650001202794650002402806650001802830650001102848650001502859650001302874650001202887650001202899650001502911651001002926653001402936700001602950700002402966700001302990700003103003700003203034700001803066773011603084856005503200852000903255655001203264IND4472462020221120071519.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447246202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2011.01404.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbelenda, M.

We investigated soils that differed in the abundance of organoâAl complexes to determine the effect of such binding on SOM chemistry. For this, the surface horizons of three types of acid soils in the Basque Country (northern Spain) under forest stands were studied: (i) Aluâandic Andosols (AND soils) on basalts and trachytes, (ii) Umbrisols or soâcalled âaluminicâ(ALU) soils also on basalts and trachytes and (iii) soils with a podzolizing trend (POD), on quartzites. Values of Al extractable with sodium pyrophosphate (Alp) in the surface horizons of these soils ranged between 8.5 and 13.1, 1.9 and 9.3, and 0.8 and 3.7 g kgâ1 dry weight, for the AND, ALU and POD soils respectively. For POD and ALU soils, surface horizons were sampled at two depths, 0â5 and 5â20 cm, whereas the AND soils were sampled at different depths down to the B horizon. NaOHâextractable SOM from three AND soils, 12 ALU soils and 12 POD soils was studied by pyrolysisâgas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The POD soils had the largest loads of plantâderived markers (lignin, longâchain alkanes and alkenes, methyl ketones, fatty acids); SOM of the AND soils had the smallest amounts of plantâderived SOM and the largest amounts of microbial products (microbial sugars and Nâcompounds) of the soils studied. ALU soils had an intermediate pattern, as expected. The results indicate that the SOM of Aluâandic Andosols, developed from basalt and trachyte rocks, is essentially dissimilar to that of soils derived from quartzârich parent material, under the same climate conditions and similar forest stands. The dominance of secondary (microbialâderived) SOM in Aluâandic Andosols, also observed in previous research on Silâandic Andosols (these are dominated by shortârange ordered Si compounds in contrast to the dominance of organoâAl complexes in Aluâandic Andosols), reveals the small contribution of primary (plantâderived) material to SOM in soils with andic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acids 3asoil properties 3achromatography 3asodium pyrophosphate 3amass spectrometry 3asugars 3aparents 3aforest stands 3abasalt 3aperoxidase 3aclimate 3asoil organic matter 3asoil sampling 3alignin 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3aalkanes 3aketones 3aB horizons 3aSpain 0achemistry1 aBuurman, P.1 aCamps Arbestain, M.1 aKaal, J.1 aMartinezâCortizas, A.1 aGartziaâBengoetxea, N.1 aMacÃ­as, F.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2011 Dec., v. 62, no. 6 p.834-848dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2011.01404.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001400161245007600175300001800251500000900269500001500278520197200293592002802265650002002293650001402313650001302327650001202340650002302352650002602375650002102401650002402422650001302446650002102459650001502480650002602495653001902521700001602540700001902556773012402575852000902699856009802708655001202806IND2056844320221119024430.0191122e199609  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205684432DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1996.0011183X003600050010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaray, G.10aResponses to S1 Selection in Flint and Dent Synthetic Maize Populations  ap. 1129-1134.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aFlint × dent is a common heterotic pattern exploited in maize (Zea mays L.) breeding programs across Europe. Two maize synthetics, EZS1, a mixture of Spanish open-pollinated flint varieties, and EZS2, crosses among North American dent-improved populations, were produced in Zaragoza, Spain. The synthetics showed heterotic behavior and were subjected to two cycles of S₁-progeny intrapopulation selection for grain yield and lodging resistance before starting reciprocal recurrent selection. Our objectives were to partition the response to selection into additive and dominance effects after two cycles of intrapopulation selection, with generation mean analysis and diversity analysis. The entries resulting from a diallel mating design, without reciprocals, among the original and first two cycles for each population, were tested in five environments. The results showed that both populations were responsive to selection for improved grain yield, but only EZS2 was improved by selection against lodging. Diversity analysis was less conservative than the generation means model in detecting significant genetic effects. Genetic effects associated with selection for grain yield and lodging were mostly additive, but a significant dominance effect was detected in EZS2 for lodging. The improvement of the population cross did not match that of the populations per se, especially for EZS2. A loss of heterosis for the cross was detected, which might become unrecoverable if S₁ selection is continued. It was concluded that S₁ selection should be discontinued and that reciprocal recurrent selection should be initiated.

This paper evaluates the suitability of vegetation indices derived from satellite Landsat 5 TM data in comparison with yield, curvature and topography wetness index over a relatively small field (11.5 ha). Imageries were chosen from the years 2006 and 2010, when oat was grown and from 2005 and 2011, when winter wheat was grown. These images were taken in June in the same growth stage for every crop. It was confirmed that derived indices from Landsat images can be used for comparison with yield and selected topographic attributes and it can explain yield variability, which can be influenced by water distribution during growth stages. Correlation coefficient between moisture stress index and winter wheat yield was &ndash;0.816 in the image acquisition date of 4. 6. 2011.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adevelopmental stages 3aenvironment 3aoats 3asoil 3atopography 3avegetation 3awater distribution 3awinter wheat1 aZemek, F.1 aNovák, P.1 aBrovkina, O.1 aMayerová, M.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 60, no. 11 p.501-506dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/515/2014-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04468naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016200170300001600332520269500348592002803043650001603071650001703087650002103104650001603125650001503141650002003156650001103176650001603187650001103203650000903214650002603223650002203249650001503271650001603286650002303302650001603325650001403341650001303355650001303368650002503381650001603406650001503422650001603437651001003453653009003463653001003553653001403563653002203577700001203599700001803611700001803629700001303647773011103660856008603771852000903857655001203866IND60570813020221118052704.0180905e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057081302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiu-ping, Zhan14aThe optimization and establishment of QuEChERS-UPLC–MS/MS method for simultaneously detecting various kinds of pesticides residues in fruits and vegetables  ap. 281-290.  aThe quality safety supervision and test of agricultural products urgently need a very excellent analytical method with simultaneously detecting many components in order to assess, prevent and control pesticide residues.In this research, three fruits and three vegetables produced in Shanghai were selected as the materials, 54 pesticide residues were detected with the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC–MS/MS) method on the basis of optimized QuEChERS method according to different materials properties.The results showed that: all samples were directly extracted by acetonitrile containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid; complex matrix samples were purified by a mixed sorbent of 300mg MgSO4+100mg PSA+100mg C18+0.01g Carb, general matrix samples didn’t add Carb, simple matrix samples such as watermelon directly filmed; Chromatographic column was ZORBAX Eclipse Plus-C18 column (3.0mm×150mm, 3.5μm) at 40°C, the methanol-water of mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.45mL/min by a gradient elution contained 0.1% formic acid and 5mmol/L ammonium acetate and the injection volume was 1μL.

With the optimized method, the calibration curves of 54 pesticides were better linear in 15–500μg/kg (r ≥0.988), the average adding standard recovery rates of 54 pesticides were 73.2%–134.3% except pymetrozine and cyromazine with the relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1.0%–13.8%; the limit of detection (LOD) under three times signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and limit of quantitative (LOQ) under 10 times S/N were respectively confirmed 0.003–2.000μg/kg and 0.01–6.67μg/kg.The results demonstrated that the optimized “QuEChERS-UPLC–MS/MS method” was a simple, rapid, sensitive, accurate, efficient, economical and safe method that simultaneously detected multiple pesticide residues through one time sample treatment; It had some advantages such as more pesticides per detection, simple and convenient pretreatment and less solvent dosage to be suitable for the quick high-throughput quantitative screening and confirmation of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium acetate 3aavermectins 3acyromazine 3adetection limit 3adrying 3aformic acid 3afruits 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3amultipliers 3apesticide residues 3apymetrozine 3ascreening 3asolvents 3asorbents 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3avegetables 3awatermelons 3aChina 0aUltra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC–MS/MS) 0aFruit 0aVegetable 0aPesticide residue1 aLin, Ma1 aLan-qi, Huang1 aJian-Bo, Chen1 aLi, Zhao0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 1060 p.281-290dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013000155300002000285520089900305592002801204650002201232650001401254650000801268650001401276650002101290650001401311650001301325650001901338650001001357650003301367700001401400700001901414700001701433700001501450700002001465700001801485700001801503773014301521856007401664852000901738655001201747IND60670484520221117221146.0191002e20131008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067048452DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta11792h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yong10aMulti-walled carbon nanotube papers as binder-free cathodes for large capacity and reversible non-aqueous Li–O₂ batteries  ap. 13076-13081.  aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were interpenetrated together to form a 3-dimensional porous structure, multi-walled carbon nanotube paper (WCNTP), by a floating catalyst method. The as-synthesized MWCNTP was employed as an air cathode for non-aqueous Li–O₂ batteries without the addition of any binder or conductive additives. A huge specific capacity of 34 600 mA h g⁻¹ could be obtained at a current density of 500 mA g⁻¹. 50 cycles of continuous discharge and charge have been achieved with no capacity loss at 250 mA g⁻¹, with a cut-off capacity of 1000 mA h g⁻¹. The reversible formation and decomposition of the discharge product Li₂O₂ was clearly revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These results suggest the great potential of the binder-free MWCNTPs as air cathodes for Li–O₂ batteries with high energy density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3aair 3abatteries 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3aenergy density 3apaper 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aLi, Fujun1 aTang, Dai-Ming1 aJian, Zelang1 aLiu, Chang1 aGolberg, Dmitri1 aYamada, Atsuo1 aZhou, Haoshen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Oct. 8, v. 1, no. 42 p.13076-13081dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta11792h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011500159300001600274500001900290520142500309592002801734650002401762650001401786650001401800650001801814650002001832650001201852650001601864650001101880650001701891653005501908653003201963653001601995700001502011700001702026700002202043700001602065700001602081773012202097856007902219852000902298655001202307IND60696457720221121025527.0200604e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645772DNAL7 a10.1089/cell.2019.00972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun10aHypoxia Enhances Mesenchymal Characteristics Maintenance of Buffalo Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells  ap. 167-177.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) from livestock are valuable resources for veterinary therapeutics and animal reproduction. Previous studies have shown that hypoxic conditions were beneficial in maintaining the mesenchymal feature of BMSCs. However, the effects of hypoxia on buffalo BMSCs (bBMSCs) remain unclear. In this study, the effects of hypoxic conditions on cell morphology, migration, polarity, and karyotype of bBMSCs were examined. The results showed that hypoxia (5% oxygen) enhanced colony formation and stress fiber synthesis of bBMSCs. Under the hypoxic culture conditions, the migration capacity and normal karyotype rate of bBMSCs were significantly improved (p < 0.05), which resulted in weakened cell polarity and enhanced karyotype stability in bBMSCs. In addition, it was significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated in the expression levels of HIF-TWIST signaling pathway axis-related genes (Hif-1, Hif-2, Twist, Snail, Slug, Fn1, N-cadherin, Collal). The HIF-TWIST axis of bBMSCs was also activated in hypoxia. Finally, it was more effective and easier to maintain the mesenchymal feature of bBMSCs in hypoxic conditions. These findings not only provide theoretical guidance to elucidate the detailed regulation mechanism of hypoxia on mesenchymal nature maintenance of bBMSCs, but also provide positive support to further establish the stable in vitro culture system of bBMSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal reproduction 3abuffaloes 3acadherins 3acell polarity 3acell structures 3ahypoxia 3akaryotyping 3aoxygen 3atherapeutics 0abuffalo bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 0amesenchymal characteristics 0amaintenance1 aLei, Chuan1 aDeng, Yanfei1 aAhmed, Jam zaheer1 aShi, Deshun1 aLu, Fenghua0 tCellular reprogramming.g2020 June 01, v. 22, no. 3 p.167-177dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:21670x2152-49987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cell.2019.00973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014600164520123800310592002801548650001901576650001301595650001701608650002601625650001001651650002001661650001401681650000901695650001301704650001301717650001701730650001501747650002401762653003401786653001301820653002901833653002601862653001501888700001901903700001701922700001701939700001501956700001701971700001801988700001502006700005402021773010802075856008602183852000902269655001202278IND60674150020221120021339.0191227e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067415002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1154982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Ding10aAnisamide-functionalized pH-responsive amphiphilic chitosan-based paclitaxel micelles for sigma-1 receptor targeted prostate cancer treatment  aControlled release and tumor-selective distribution are highly desirable for anticancer nanomedicines. Here, we design and synthesize an anisamide-conjugated N-octyl-N,O-maleoyl-O-phosphoryl chitosan (a-OMPC) which can form amphiphilic micelles featuring pH-responsive release and high affinity to sigma-1 receptor-overexpressed tumors for paclitaxel (PTX) delivery. Thereinto, maleoyl and phosphoryl groups cooperatively contribute to pH-responsive drug release due to a conversion from hydrophile to hydrophobe in the acidic microenvironment of endo/lysosomes. We demonstrated that PTX-loaded a-OMPC micelles (PTX-aM) enhanced the cellular internalization via the affinity between anisamide and sigma-1 receptor, rapidly released drug in endo/lysosomes and elevated the cytotoxicity against PC-3 cells. The in vivo studies further verified that PTX-aM could largely accumulate at the tumor site even after 24 h of administration, resulting in obvious inhibition effect and prolonged survival period in PC-3 tumor xenograft-bearing mice. Moreover, OMPC showed no obvious hemolytic and acute toxicity. Collectively, this chitosan derivate holds a promising potential in application of prostate cancer-targeted drug delivery system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3ain vivo studies 3alysosomes 3amice 3amicelles 3amoieties 3ananomedicine 3apaclitaxel 3aprostatic neoplasms 0aAmphiphilic chitosan derivate 0aMicelles 0aProstate tumor targeting 0apH-responsive release 0aPaclitaxel1 aJiao, Mengying1 aLin, Haijiao1 aTian, Chunli1 aQu, Guowei1 aXue, Jingwei1 aXue, Lingjing1 aJu, Caoyun1 aZhang, Can1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-54380 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 229 p.115498-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1154983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245012700203300001800330520152600348592002801874650002701902650001401929650002001943650001701963650000801980650002101988650001502009650001202024650002602036650002602062650001702088650000902105650001702114650001302131650001902144650001202163653001502175653000902190653003702199653002102236653001802257700001702275700001602292700002302308700002102331700001902352700005802371773014702429856008002576852000902656655001202665IND60684910720221118051906.0200226e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b064522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSall, Erik D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1603-592110aQuantifying Dicamba Volatility under Field Conditions: Part II, Comparative Analysis of 23 Dicamba Volatility Field Trials  ap. 2286-2296.  aThis study summarizes 23 field trials (over six geographic locations, with each trial composed of a separate field site and an application event) for quantifying the postapplication volatilization of dicamba from fields treated with an array of dicamba-containing formulations and tank adjuvants at an application rate of 0.56 or 1.12 kg dicamba acid equivalents (a.e.) per hectare (0.5 or 1.0 lb dicamba a.e. per acre). The data span 3 years of testing over a range of locations, field types, and environmental conditions. The aerodynamic and the integrated horizontal flux methodologies were employed (and then averaged) for estimating the vertical flux from the field for periods extending to approximately 72 h post application. In all cases, the vertical flux peaked within 24 h of application and then decayed to much lower levels by day 3. Total volatile losses among all formulations and conditions ranged from 0.023 ± 0.003 to 0.302 ± 0.045% of the applied dicamba (median = 0.08%). Analysis of the recorded meteorological and soil conditions for each field trial failed to identify any single soil or weather parameter as a dominant driver of total volatile losses. Air concentrations of dicamba observed in the course of these trials were all below the no observed adverse effect concentration for conventional soybean plant height or yield, indicating that air concentrations directly above or outside of the dicamba-treated area would not cause a reduction in plant height or yield of conventional soybean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeographical Locations 3aadjuvants 3aadverse effects 3aaerodynamics 3aair 3aapplication rate 3acrop yield 3adicamba 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3aplant height 3asoil 3asoil quality 3asoybeans 3avolatilization 3aweather 0avolatility 0aflux 0aintegrated horizontal flux (IHF) 0aaerodynamic (AD) 0avertical flux1 aHuang, Keguo1 aPai, Naresh1 aSchapaugh, Adam W.1 aHonegger, Joy L.1 aOrr, Thomas B.1 aRiter, Leah S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5702-161X0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 68, no. 8 p.2286-2296dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b064523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245016000217520102000377592002801397650002201425650001901447650001601466650001601482650002301498650002101521650002301542650002601565650001901591651001101610653002201621653003101643653002101674653003001695653003201725700002101757700002501778700006401803700001701867700001801884700001601902700002601918700002201944700001801966700002001984773010002004856008702104852000902191655001202200IND60755852120221119195349.0220426e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075585212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1315312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlu'datt, Muhammad H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8976-500410aDevelopment of a nutrition management software based on selected Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dishes to support personalized diet and weight management  aThe nutrient composition of 50 commonly consumed Jordanian food dishes was determined to support the development of a novel nutrition management system designed to assist with dietary intake assessment and diet management.

Year‐round observations are relatively sparse in this region partially covered by sea ice. We took advantage of one‐year‐long records of ocean currents and hydrography from seven moorings north of Svalbard. The moorings are organized in two arrays separated by 94 km along the path of the Atlantic Water inflow to investigate the properties, transport and heat loss of the Atlantic Water in 2018/2019. The Atlantic Water volume transport varies from 0.5 Sv (1 Sv = 10⁶ m³s⁻¹) in spring to 2 Sv in fall. The first mode of variation of the Atlantic Water inflow temperature is a warm/cold mode with a seasonal cycle. The second mode corresponds to a shorter time scale (6–7 days) variability in the onshore/offshore displacement of the temperature core linked to the mesoscale variability. Heat loss from the Atlantic Water in this region is estimated, for the first time using two mooring arrays and conserving the volume transport. The heat loss varies between 302 W m⁻² in winter to 60 W m⁻² in spring. The onshore moorings show a westward countercurrent driven by Ekman setup in spring, carrying transformed‐Atlantic Water. The offshore moorings show a bottom‐intensified current that covaries with the wind stress curl. These two mooring arrays allowed for a better comprehension of the structure and transformation of the slope currents north of Svalbard.  aPublisher supplied data  a276730cResearch council of norway  aNE/P006302/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3acold 3ageophysics 3aheat 3ahydrology 3aresearch 3asea ice 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3atemperature 3awind stress 3awinter 3aArctic Ocean 3aNorway1 aKalhagen, Kjersti1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3547-10591 aKolås, Eivind1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2914-72041 aFer, Ilker1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2427-25321 aNilsen, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5636-20921 aCottier, Finlo0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2022JC018568-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC0185683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245014100169520137900310592002801689650001901717650001901736650003201755650001601787650001801803650001401821650001601835650001101851650002201862650001101884650001801895650001601913650001401929650002201943650001201965651001001977651001001987700002101997700002102018700001902039700001702058700002002075700002002095700002902115773012002144856007902264852000902343655001202352IND60763567220221119202147.0220120e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076356722DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110202242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrajapati, Malyaj R.10aIdentification and Characterization of a Garlic Virus E Genome in Garlic (Allium sativum L.) Using High-Throughput Sequencing from India  aGarlic (Allium sativum L.) plants exhibiting mosaics, deformation, and yellow stripes symptoms were identified in Meerut City, Uttar Pradesh, India. To investigate the viruses in the garlic samples, the method of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was used. Complete genome of the garlic virus E (GarV-E) isolate (NCBI accession No. MW925710) was retrieved. The virus complete genome comprises 8450 nucleotides (nts), excluding the poly (A) tail at the 3′ terminus, with 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of 99 and 384 nts, respectively, and ORFs encoding replicase with a conserved motif for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), TGB1, TGB2, TGB3, serine-rich protein, coat protein, and nucleic acid binding protein (NABP). The sequence homology shared 83.49–90.40% and 87.48–92.87% with those of GarV-E isolates available in NCBI at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship of this isolate from India (MW925710) with GarV-E isolate YH (AJ292230) from Zhejiang, China. The presence of GarV-E was also confirmed by RT-PCR. The present study is the first report of GarV-E in garlic cultivar Yamuna Safed-3 grown in northern India. However, further studies are needed to confirm its role in symptom development, nationwide distribution, genetic diversity, and potential yield loss to the garlic in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aGarlic virus E 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aamino acids 3acoat proteins 3acultivars 3adeformation 3agarlic 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3anucleic acids 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3asequence homology 3aviruses 3aChina 3aIndia1 aManav, Aakansha 1 aSingh, Jitender 1 aKumar, Pankaj 1 aKumar, Amit 1 aRavindra Kumar,1 aPrakash, Satya 1 aBaranwal, Virendra Kumar0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110202243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245009000178520142600268592002801694650001201722650001101734650001901745650001101764650001701775650001501792650001301807700001701820700002401837700002301861700003001884773012801914856008702042852000902129655001202138IND60768434120221120124759.0220225e20220120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076843412DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100202202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Vivien Jessica10aUnravelling Formaldehyde Metabolism in Bacteria: Road towards Synthetic Methylotrophy  aFormaldehyde metabolism is prevalent in all organisms, where the accumulation of formaldehyde can be prevented through the activity of dissimilation pathways. Furthermore, formaldehyde assimilatory pathways play a fundamental role in many methylotrophs, which are microorganisms able to build biomass and obtain energy from single- and multicarbon compounds with no carbon–carbon bonds. Here, we describe how formaldehyde is formed in the environment, the mechanisms of its toxicity to the cells, and the cell’s strategies to circumvent it. While their importance is unquestionable for cell survival in formaldehyde rich environments, we present examples of how the modification of native formaldehyde dissimilation pathways in nonmethylotrophic bacteria can be applied to redirect carbon flux toward heterologous, synthetic formaldehyde assimilation pathways introduced into their metabolism. Attempts to engineer methylotrophy into nonmethylotrophic hosts have gained interest in the past decade, with only limited successes leading to the creation of autonomous synthetic methylotrophy. Here, we discuss how native formaldehyde assimilation pathways can additionally be employed as a premise to achieving synthetic methylotrophy. Lastly, we discuss how emerging knowledge on regulation of formaldehyde metabolism can contribute to creating synthetic regulatory circuits applied in metabolic engineering strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acell viability 3aenergy 3aformaldehyde 3ametabolism 3atoxicity1 aIrla, Marta 1 aGil López, Marina 1 aBrautaset, Trygve 1 aFernandes Brito, Luciana 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100202203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245022300166300001600389520189700405592002802302650002302330650002702353650000802380650002402388650002402412650002002436650001502456650001002471650002402481650002302505650000902528650001702537650001002554650001402564650003002578650002202608650001302630650002702643651001102670651001802681653001502699653002502714653000802739700002102747700004002768700001902808700003102827700002802858700002602886773013902912856007803051852000903129655001203138IND60663645820221120205637.0191004e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066364582DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2018.23482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaiz, Laís Moraes10aAntibodies and Molecular Detection of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum in Samples of Free-Ranging Marmosets (Primates: Callitrichidae: Callithrix spp.) in an Area of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis in Southeastern Brazil  ap. 249-254.  aLeishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic protozoan infection that affects mammals and involves a complex epidemiology. Although dogs are considered the main reservoir in zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the possible presence of other mammalian species acting as reservoirs has been associated as a possible cause of lack of success in the control of human VL in many endemic areas. The knowledge about natural infections of some species is still scarce, such as nonhuman primates (NHP), especially from the genus Callithrix (marmosets). We investigated the infection by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum, the agent of VL in the Americas, in 26 marmosets captured monthly, from April 2014 to March 2015, in an environmentally protected area (EPA) in Southeastern Brazil. The EPA has undergone significant environmental changes and has a transmission focus of canine VL since 2009. Serology was performed through the direct agglutination test, which detected low antibody titers in seven marmosets (7/26; 26.9%, 95% confidence interval 9.9–44.0), being five Callithrix penicillata (black-tufted-ear marmoset) and two Callithrix jacchus (white-tufted-ear marmoset). The presence of the DNA of Leishmania was investigated in blood and skin samples by PCR and genetic sequencing. This is the first report of the detection of L. (L.) infantum in the skin of a marmoset, which was verified in a sample from one C. penicillata. The results demonstrate the natural infection of marmosets by L. (L.) infantum and may suggest the participation of these animals as hosts in the parasite's transmission cycle in the EPA. However, more comprehensive studies are needed to elucidate their role on the VL epidemiology in this area and also in different endemic areas, especially because these NHP are increasingly in contact with humans and domestic animals, particularly due to environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallithrix jacchus 3aCallithrix penicillata 3aDNA 3aLeishmania infantum 3aagglutination tests 3aanimal diseases 3aantibodies 3ablood 3aconfidence interval 3aconservation areas 3adogs 3aepidemiology 3ahosts 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aserology 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aBrazil 3aNorth America 0aLeishmania 0ahabitat modification 0aPCR1 aMotoie, Gabriela1 aRichini-Pereira, Virgínia Bodelão1 aLangoni, Helio1 aMenozzi, Benedito Donizete1 aTolezano, José Eduardo1 aDonalisio, Maria Rita0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 19, no. 4 p.249-254dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2018.23483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04319naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245016900195300001600364500002000380520253100400592002802931596005902959596005903018650001003077650001003087650002203097650001903119650001703138650002403155650001203179650001003191650001103201650003003212650001903242650001403261650001303275650001403288651001003302700002103312700001903333700001803352700007103370700002003441700001903461700006903480700002003549773013803569856007303707852000903780655001203789IND60744887720221123005139.0210721e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074488772DNAL7 a10.1111/jse.127952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yi‐Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6095-382110aRevisiting of Carex sect. Confertiflorae s.l. (Cyperaceae): New data from molecular and morphological evidence and first insights on Carex biogeography in East Asia  ap. 668-686.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCarex sect. Confertiflorae s.l. is a medium‐sized species group (ca. 40 species) with its center of diversity in E Asia (China and Japan). According to morphological traits, the section has been proposed to split into two sections (sects. Confertiflorae sensu Ohwi and Molliculae Ohwi) up to five different ones (sects. Confertiflorae s.s., Molliculae, Dispalatae Ohwi, Ischnostachyae Ohwi, and Alliiformes Akiyama). Recent phylogenetic reconstructions showed Confertiflorae s.l. not to be monophyletic, as species traditionally considered part of it were found to belong to other clades, whereas species traditionally ascribed to other sections were nested within it. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic structure, morphological affinities, and biogeographic history of sect. Confertiflorae s.l. We employed a taxon‐based approach to explore the morphological affinities of the species considered in sect. Confertiflorae and compared the micromorphology of the nutlets of almost all the taxa using SEM. We included 40 samples representing 31 species/subspecies of sect. Confertiflorae s.l. and used two nuclear (ETS and ITS) and three plastid (trnL‐F, matK, and rpl32‐trnL ᵁᴬᴳ) molecular markers to reconstruct the phylogeny of the group. The phylogenetic analyses confirmed the polyphyly of sect. Confertiflorae s.l., whose representatives were found within five distinct clades. From these, two clades, sect. Confertiflorae and sect. Molliculae, were found to be closely related and contained the majority of the species. The composition of the two clades agreed with the morphological structure of the group, and we confirmed an exclusive combination of features (namely color of basal sheaths, presence of bract sheath, peduncle of lowest spike, inflorescence sex distribution, shape of pistillate glume apex, and color and veins of utricle, among others) characterizing each of the two clades. The origin of the two clades was found to be in the early Pliocene; however, the majority of the diversification events within each clade took place during the Pleistocene. This illustrates that although Asia has been regarded as having little potential ecological space for Carex to diversify due to its climate stability, groups of sedges sub‐endemic from that area may have a fairly recent origin related to glaciations. We proposed the rearrangement of sect. Confertiflorae as previously conceived as three independent sections: the monotypic Alliiformes, sect. Molliculae, and sect. Paludosae.  aPublisher supplied data  a31770212cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31470304cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCarex 3aJapan 3aPleistocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3abiogeography 3acenter of diversity 3aclimate 3acolor 3afruits 3ageographical distribution 3amicrostructure 3amonophyly 3apeduncle 3apolyphyly 3aChina1 aJin, Xiao‐Feng1 aIkeda, Hiroshi1 aYano, Okihito1 aBenítez‐Benítez, Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4956-03431 aChen, Wei‐Jie1 aLiu, Yong‐Di1 aJiménez‐Mejías, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2815-44771 aYu, Ming‐Jian0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2021 July, v. 59, no. 4 p.668-686dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000114x1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.127953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010600171520112100277592002801398653002701426653002601453653002801479653002401507653002601531653001401557700002401571700002201595700002101617700002701638700005701665773010801722856008601830852000901916655001201925IND60674150220221120222523.0191227e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067415022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1155052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolpe, Veronica10aShort chain chito-oligosaccharides promote arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in Medicago truncatula  aDuring the establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, the fungus and the host plant exchange chemical signals that are crucial to reciprocal recognition. Short-chain chitin oligomers (CO) released by AM fungi are known to trigger symbiotic signaling in all host plant species tested. Here we applied exogenous CO, derived from crustacean exoskeleton, to pot-grown Medicago truncatula inoculated with the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae and investigated root colonization, plant gene regulation and biomass production. CO treatment strongly promoted AM colonization with significant increases in arbuscule development, biomass production and photosynthetic surface compared to untreated mycorrhizal plants. Gene expression analyses indicated that CO treatment anticipated the expression of MtBCP and MtPT4 plant symbiotic markers, during the first two weeks post inoculation. Altogether, our results provide evidence that plant treatment with symbiotic fungal elicitors, anticipated and enhanced AM development, encouraging the use of CO to promote AM establishment in sustainable agricultural practices.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChito-oligosaccharides 0aArbuscular mycorrhiza 0aSustainable agriculture 0aMedicago truncatula 0aFunneliformis mosseae 0aSymbiosis1 aCarotenuto, Gennaro1 aBerzero, Carlotta1 aCagnina, Lavinia1 aPuech-Pagès, Virginie1 aGenre, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5029-61940 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 229 p.115505-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1155053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245017700155300001800332500002000350520150600370592002801876596005901904596007401963596004702037596005402084650002602138650002702164650001802191650001202209650002902221650003502250650001302285650001802298650001302316650000902329650001202338700001402350700001502364700001802379700001602397700001802413700001702431700001902448700005202467773011602519856007302635852000902708655001202717IND60750119120221122234832.0210910e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075011912DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.153772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Weijun10aFerredoxin 1 is downregulated by the accumulation of abscisic acid in an ABI5‐dependent manner to facilitate rice stripe virus infection in Nicotiana benthamiana and rice  ap. 1183-1197.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFerredoxin 1 (FD1) accepts and distributes electrons in the electron transfer chain of plants. Its expression is universally downregulated by viruses and its roles in plant immunity have been brought into focus over the past decade. However, the mechanism by which viruses regulate FD1 remains to be defined. In a previous report, we found that the expression of Nicotiana benthamiana FD1 (NbFD1) was downregulated following infection with potato virus X (PVX) and that NbFD1 regulates callose deposition at plasmodesmata to play a role in defense against PVX infection. We now report that NbFD1 is downregulated by rice stripe virus (RSV) infection and that silencing of NbFD1 also facilitates RSV infection, while viral infection was inhibited in a transgenic line overexpressing NbFD1, indicating that NbFD1 also functions in defense against RSV infection. Next, a RSV‐derived small interfering RNA was identified that contributes to the downregulation of FD1 transcripts. Further analysis showed that the abscisic acid (ABA) which accumulates in RSV‐infected plants also represses NbFD1 transcription. It does this by stimulating expression of ABA insensitive 5 (ABI5), which binds the ABA response element motifs in the NbFD1 promoter, resulting in negative regulation. Regulation of FD1 by ABA was also confirmed in RSV‐infected plants of the natural host rice.

The electrochemical behaviors and electronic properties of the passive films developed on the MoSi₂-based nanocomposite coatings in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution were characterized using various electrochemical analytical techniques, including potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potential of zero charge and Mott–Schottky analysis. The results revealed that both plasma nitriding and alloying with Al have a positive effect on the corrosion resistance of the resultant coatings by altering the microstructure of the coatings as well as the chemical composition and semiconducting properties of the passive films. Both plasma nitriding and Al alloying can suppress transpassive dissolution of molybdenum by increasing the ratio of Mo(iv) to Mo(vi), and, thus, reduce the donor density of the passive films. In addition, it is observed that both treatments increase the differences between corrosion potential and potential of zero charge and thereby enhance the capability to repulse chloride ions. These findings are expected to provide valuable guidance for the design of corrosion-resistant coating materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3achemical composition 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aions 3amicrostructure 3amolybdenum 3ananocomposites 3asemiconductors 3asodium chloride1 aLiu, Linlin1 aMunroe, Paul1 aXie, Zong-Han1 aJiang, Zhong-Tao0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 1, no. 35 p.10281-10291dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta11813d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002700143245014400170300001600314520116000330592002801490650002501518650001401543650001001557650002601567650001201593650001501605650003101620650001501651650001301666650002501679651001501704653001301719653001501732653001301747653001501760700002101775700002201796700001801818773010201836856008101938852000902019655001202028IND4461646320221121221346.0151127e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446164632DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-10-00136.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCullough, Patrick E.10aNitrogen Influences Bispyribac-Sodium Efficacy and Metabolism in Annual Bluegrass (Poa annua) and Creeping Bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera)  ap. 385-390.  aField and laboratory experiments were conducted in New Jersey to investigate the influence of nitrogen on annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass metabolism and responses to bispyribac-sodium. In field experiments, withholding nitrogen during the test period increased sensitivity of both grasses to bispyribac-sodium, and grasses fertilized biweekly had darker color on most rating dates. Nitrogen generally increased annual bluegrass tolerance to bispyribac-sodium at 74 g ha⁻¹ but not at 148 g ha⁻¹. Creeping bentgrass was influenced by nitrogen at both herbicide rates. In laboratory experiments, weekly nitrogen treatments increased ¹⁴C-bispyribac-sodium metabolism in both grasses compared to unfertilized plants. Annual bluegrass metabolized approximately 50%% less herbicide regardless of nitrogen regime compared to creeping bentgrass. Overall, routine nitrogen fertilization appears to improve annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass tolerance to bispyribac-sodium, which may be attributed to higher metabolism.Nomenclature: Bispyribac-sodium; annual bluegrass, Poa annua L.; creeping bentgrass, Agrostis stolonifera L., ‘L-93’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3aPoa annua 3acolor 3afield experimentation 3agrasses 3aherbicides 3alaboratory experimentation 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aNew Jersey 0aEfficacy 0ametabolism 0anitrogen 0aturf grass1 aHart, Stephen E.1 aGianfagna, Thomas1 aChaves, Fabio0 tWeed technology.g2011 , v. 25, no. 3 p.385-390dWeed Science Society of Americax0890-037X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWT-D-10-00136.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013500163520139100298592002801689650002801717650001901745650002801764650001901792650001601811650001601827650001601843650001001859650002301869650001501892650001701907650001301924650001601937650000901953650001801962700002601980700002102006700001902027700002802046700002802074773012002102856007902222852000902301655001202310IND60763567520221119202028.0220120e20220116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076356752DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110202272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemati, Arash 10aEffect of Different Enriched Vermicomposts, Humic Acid Extract and Indole-3-Acetic Acid Amendments on the Growth of Brassica napus  aHumic acid (HA) is a specific and stable component of humus materials that behaves similarly to growth stimulants, esp. auxin hormones, contributing to improving growth indices and performance of plants. As a rich source of HA, vermicompost (VC) is also a plant growth stimulating bio-fertilizer that can enhance growth indices and performance in plants. The purpose of the present study is to compare the influence of VC enriched with bacterial and/or fertilizer, commercial humic acid (CHA) extract, and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on improving growth characteristics and performance of rapeseed under greenhouse conditions. The results showed the complete superiority of VC over the CHA and IAA (approximately 8% increase in the dry weights of root and aerial organ and nearly three times increase in seed weight). The highest values of these indices were obtained with VC enriched with Nitrogen, Sulfur, and Phosphorus, Azotobacter chroococcum and Pseudomonas fluorescens; the lowest value was obtained with VC enriched with urea. Additionally, the application of 3% VC and the control involved the highest and lowest values in all traits, respectively. The SPAD (chlorophyll index) value and stem diameter were not significantly affected by different application levels of VC. Overall, the applications of IAA and the CHA were not found to be suitable and therefore not recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzotobacter chroococcum 3aBrassica napus 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abiofertilizers 3achlorophyll 3agreenhouses 3ahumic acids 3ahumus 3aindole acetic acid 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3arapeseed 3aseed weight 3aurea 3avermicomposts1 aAlikhani, Hossein Ali1 aAjdanian, Ladan 1 aBabaei, Mehdi 1 aAsgari Lajayer, Behnam 1 avan Hullebusch, Eric D.0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 16, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110202273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014000169500001900309520100100328592002801329650001401357650001401371650002301385650001501408650001601423650001901439653002701458653003701485653001601522700002401538700002501562700002001587700001801607700002101625700001701646773010501663856008701768852000901855655001201864IND60727685720221120022832.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1248312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaeem, Abdul10aKinetic and optimization study of sustainable biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using novel heterogeneous solid base catalyst  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe novel Na-SiO₂@TiO₂ heterogeneous base catalyst was designed and successfully applied to the trans-esterification reaction of waste cooking oil for sustainable biodiesel production. The designed catalyst was characterized by SEM, XPS, FT-IR and BET before treatment, illustrated its suitability for the catalytic trans-esterification reaction. Moreover, the influence of reaction temperature, time, catalyst concentration and WCO:MeOH molar ratio on the catalytic activity were also investigated, resultant 98% biodiesel yield was achieved. The reusability test demonstrated that the Na-SiO₂@TiO₂ catalyst has noticeable catalytic potency up to 5 successive runs. Besides, the kinetics study explains that the reaction is kinetically controlled by pseudo 1st order. The Ea was found to be 21.65 kJ/mol.

Connecticut River as the primary freshwater source enters near the sound's mouth. The summertime pathways of river water under low discharge and mild wind conditions are studied through both numerical simulations with a passive dye pulse and field surface drifter observations. Within the 19‐day modeling analysis period a third of the river dye pulse remains in the eastern sound; another third of the pulse moves up‐estuary with the near‐bottom dense inflow into the central and western sound with a spring‐neap tidal modulation; and another third leaves the sound with the near‐surface outflow toward the continental shelf through Block Island Sound. The latter pathway is confirmed by field surface drifter tracks. Three scenarios of wind forcing are tested: a WRF‐ROMS Coupled case, a NARR data forcing case, and a No‐Wind case. The results show though that the sound is tidal mixing dominated, mild winds still alter the position and strength of the estuarine exchange flow, and either enhances by the cross‐estuary winds or lateral straining. On the shelf, winds play a more important role on the fresher estuarine water distribution. The sensitivities of circulation, salinity, and numerical drifter tracks to different atmospheric forcings also are studied. The results suggest that the coupled model has better performance to simulate surface drifter tracks.  aPublisher supplied data  cUCONN Marine Sciences predoctoral summer funding 2013  aNNX13AE25GcNASA  a0955967cNSF 3abrackish water 3acontinental shelf 3adyes 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3ariver water 3arivers 3asalinity 3asummer 3awater distribution 3awind 3aConnecticut River1 aWhitney, Michael M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2048-77550 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Mar., v. 124, no. 3 p.1897-1914dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0144863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024001900113024003100132040001800163100001600181245009000197300001600287520085900303592002801162650002201190650002601212650001801238650002601256650003201282650004501314650001601359650002001375650001901395650002301414650004701437650001701484650002301501650002101524650002501545650001701570650002001587650002001607650002701627650004601654650004701700650003201747650002401779700001801803700001801821700002001839700001801859700001901877773013601896852000902032856011202041856007802153961001302231655001202244IND2325014520221119093058.0200823e200106  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232501452DNAL7 a10113/300822hdl7 a114591902pmid7 a10.1007/s0043801004652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaess, S.K.10aAnalysis of the introgression of Solanum bulbocastanum DNA into potato breeding lines  ap. 694-704.  aSomatic hybrids have been obtained between potato and Solanum bulbocastanum PI 245310, a Mexican diploid (2n=2x=24) species.

Recent works demonstrate a temporal coupling of climate cooling and widespread colonization of Carex in North America, implicating ecological diversification. In addition, research has consistently found asymmetric patterns of lineage‐level diversification in the genus. Why does variation in clade sizes exist in the genus? Is ecological diversification involved? In this study, we tested whether rates of morphological and ecological trait evolution are correlated with clade‐level species richness in Carex of North America north of Mexico. We constructed a phylogeny of 477 species—an almost complete regional sample. We estimated rates of evolution of morphological traits, habitat, and climatic niche and assessed whether differences in rates of evolution correlate with species richness differences in replicate non‐nested sister clades. Our work demonstrates significant positive correlations between climatic niche rates, habitat and reproductive morphological evolution, and species richness. This coupling of trait and niche evolution and species richness in a diverse, continental clade sample strongly suggests that the ability of clades to explore niche and functional space has shaped disparities in richness and functional diversity across the North American flora region. Our findings highlight the importance of the evolutionary history of trait and niche evolution in shaping continental and regional floras.  aPublisher supplied data  a1255901cNational Science Foundation  a558809,RGPIN‐2018‐04115,RGPIN‐342278‐2013cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  aRGPIN‐342278‐2013cNational Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grants to JRS  aRGPIN‐2018‐04115cNational Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grants to JRS  a558809cNSERC Graduate Scholarships‐Master's Scholarship  a1255901cJEP, and a US National Science Foundation Award 3aCarex 3aflora 3afunctional diversity 3aglobal cooling 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aspecies richness 3aMexico1 aHipp, Andrew,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1241-99041 aHahn, Marlene1 aStarr, Julian R.0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2021 July, v. 59, no. 4 p.763-775dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000114x1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.127393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008900166300001600255500001900271500001100290520175400301592002802055596009102083596010502174596009502279650002102374650003302395650001202428650001202440650002402452650002302476650001202499650000902511650001402520650000902534650001702543650002602560650002102586650001702607650002402624650002502648650001302673651001602686700001802702700001602720700001902736700001702755700001902772700001902791773015202810856008202962852000903044655001203053IND60696458420221120200702.0200526e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11157-020-09530-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Mabruk14aThe effect of carrier addition on Anammox start-up and microbial community: a review  ap. 355-368.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe Anaerobic Ammonia Oxidation (Anammox) wastewater treatment process has attracted significant attention ever since its discovery in the Netherlands in the 1990′s. This has mostly been due to the potential cost-effectiveness associated with the process in large scale application. However, the application of the Anammox process on an industrial-scale has been curtailed mainly due to the long start-up time of the Anammox bacteria. In order to ensure the feasibility of industrial-scale Anammox application, researchers have employed various means; experimenting with different reactor types, membrane types, as well as the usage of chemicals such as hydrazine, acyl-homoserinelactones (AHL), etc. Most recently however, more attention has been directed towards the addition of biomass carriers such as biochar, zeolites, sponges, non-woven membrane etc. for the optimization of the Anammox process. This article provides an up-to-date overview of the various carriers (Non-woven fabric, Biochar, Down-flow hanging sponge, Zeolite, Zero-violent iron, Polyethylene glycol gel, Activated-carbon, Polyethylene sponge, etc.) that have so far been used to better the performance of the Anammox process. It also focuses on the effect of these biomass carrier additions on the microbial growth and community structure. Understanding the metabolomics of microorganisms in carrier-amended media promises to enhance our knowledge of carriers’ influence on the microbial community structure. Generally, the metabolic effects of carrier-amendment on microbial growth and community are largely uninvestigated. Future researches focusing on this area could tremendously improve our comprehension of the inner-workings of the carrier amended Anammox set-up.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. Zd1804cJiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Science and Engineering  aKFLAB201701cOpening Fund of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Anaerobic Biotechnology (Jiangnan University)  aXTCXSZ2019-3cCollaborative Innovation Center for Water Treatment Technology and Materials 3aactivated carbon 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3acost effectiveness 3afabrics 3agels 3ahydrazine 3airon 3ametabolomics 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial growth 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene glycol 3awastewater treatment 3azeolites 3aNetherlands1 aXie, Junxiang1 aXie, Jiawei1 aChang, Yaofeng1 aGuo, Menglei1 aChen, Chongjun1 aZhang, Tian C.0 tRe/views in environmental science and bio/technology.g2020 June, v. 19, no. 2 p.355-368dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000487x1569-17057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11157-020-09530-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245011800153300001500271520186300286592002802149650001102177650001002188650001702198650002502215650001402240650001902254650002202273650002202295650001302317650001102330650001602341650001502357700001302372700001402385773015302399856006902552856010602621990002302727852000902750655001202759IND60663646020221120205752.0190910e20190907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066364602DNAL7 a10.3791/589452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Qing-Ran10aIdentifying cell surface markers of primary neural stem and progenitor cells by metabolic labeling of sialoglycan  ap. e58945.  aNeural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) are the cellular basis for the complex structures and functions of the brain. They are located in specialized niches in vivo and can be isolated and expanded in vitro, serving as an important resource for cell transplantation to repair brain damage. However, NSPCs are heterogeneous and not clearly defined at the molecular level or purified due to a lack of specific cell surface markers. The protocol presented, which has been previously reported, combines a neural-endothelial co-culture system with a metabolic glycan labeling method to identify the surface sialoglycoproteome of primary NSPCs. The NSPC-endothelial co-culture system allows self-renewal and expansion of primary NSPCs in vitro, generating a sufficient number of NSPCs. Sialoglycans in cultured NSPCs are labeled using an unnatural sialic acid metabolic reporter with bioorthogonal functional groups. By comparing the sialoglycoproteome from self-renewing NSPCs expanded in an endothelial co-culture with differentiating neural culture, we identify a list of membrane proteins that are enriched in NSPCs. In detail, the protocol involves: 1) set-up of an NSPC-endothelial co-culture and NSPC differentiating culture; 2) labeling with azidosugar per-O-acetylated N-azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac4ManNAz); and 3) biotin conjugation to modified sialoglycan for imaging after fixation of neural culture or protein extraction from neural culture for mass spectrometry analysis. Then, the NSPC-enriched surface marker candidates are selected by comparative analysis of mass spectrometry data from both the expanded NSPC and differentiated neural cultures. This protocol is highly sensitive for identifying membrane proteins of low abundance in the starting materials, and it can be applied to marker discovery in other systems with appropriate modifications  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotin 3abrain 3abrain damage 3acell transplantation 3acoculture 3aimage analysis 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane proteins 3amoieties 3aniches 3asialic acid 3astem cells1 aDong, Lu1 aShen, Qin0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Sept. 07, , no. 151 p.e58945-e58945dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/589453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58945/identifying-cell-surface-markers-primary-neural-stem-progenitor-cells  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245010100158300001800259500002000277520121300297592002801510596004801538596006201586596006601648596010301714596007301817596004401890596008501934650001102019650001502030650001302045650001402058650002202072651001702094651001402111700006002125700005902185700002402244700006002268700002702328700002302355700005302378700001602431700001202447700002102459700002502480700001902505773013102524856007702655852000902732655001202741IND60789722320221120155005.0220822e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078972232DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JC0143562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xiaoyue10aInterannual Variability of the Sulawesi Sea Circulation Forced by Indo‐Pacific Planetary Waves  ap. 1616-1633.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe regional INDESO model configured in the Indonesian seas from 2008 to 2016 is used to study the mechanisms responsible for the variability of the currents in the Sulawesi Sea of the Indonesian seas. The model simulation compares reasonably with the seasonal to interannual variability of the moored current meter observations in the upper 350 m or so of the Maluku Channel during 2015 and 2016. The interannual variability of the currents in the eastern Sulawesi Sea in the model is found to be associated with both the Pacific and Indian Ocean remote forcing. Lag correlation analysis and a theoretical linear wave model simulation suggest that both the equatorial Kelvin waves from the Indian Ocean and the coastally trapped Kelvin waves from the western Pacific along the Philippine coast can propagate through the Indonesian seas and arrive at the Maluku Channel. In particular, from mid‐2015 to 2016 the Indian Ocean Kelvin waves are found to significantly impact the sea level anomaly variability in the Maluku Channel. The results indicate the importance of Indo‐Pacific planetary waves to the interannual variability of the currents in the Sulawesi Sea at the entrance of the Indonesian seas.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA11010205cCAS Strategic Priority Project  aNA17OAR4310257cDOC | NOAA | Climate Program Office (CPO)  a41876025cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  aU1606402cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Natural Science Foundation of Shandong)  a41720104008cNSFC | International Cooperation and Exchange Programme  a41421005cNSFC Innovative Group Project  a2016ASKJ04cQingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM) 3acoasts 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asea level 3asimulation models 3aIndian Ocean 3aIndonesia1 aSprintall, Janet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7428-75801 aYuan, Dongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1588-73321 aTranchant, Benoît,1 aGaspar, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1477-12151 aKoch‐Larrouy, Ariane1 aReffray, Guillaume1 aLi, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9447-28581 aWang, Zheng1 aLi, Yao1 aNugroho, Dwiyoga1 aCorvianawatie, Corry1 aSurinati, Dewi0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Mar., v. 124, no. 3 p.1616-1633dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0143563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245016400175520115000339592002801489650002801517650003101545650001601576650002601592650001501618650002001633650002001653650001201673650003701685650001201722650001301734650001901747650001601766700002401782700003101806773012801837856008701965852000902052655001202061IND60768434620221120124713.0220225e20220211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076843462DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100204202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, Camilla 10aInduction of Broad β-lactam Resistance in Achromobacter ruhlandii by Exposure to Ticarcillin Is Primarily Linked to Substitutions in Murein Peptide Ligase Mpl  aAchromobacter species are emerging pathogens in cystic fibrosis with inherent resistance to several classes of antimicrobial agents. We exposed strains with wild-type antimicrobial susceptibility to ticarcillin and generated mutants with broad β-lactam resistance. Within the detection limit of the assay, the capability to develop mutational resistance was strain-specific and reproducible. Mutational resistance was observed for all three tested strains of Achromobacter ruhlandii, for one of seven strains of Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and for none of five strains of Achromobacter insuavis. All mutants were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, while minimal inhibitory concentration of several other β-lactams increased 4–32-fold. Whole genome sequencing identified 1–4 non-synonymous mutations in known genes per mutant. All mutants encoded amino acid substitutions in cell wall recycling proteins, primarily Mpl, and the observed resistance is probably caused by hyperproduction of OXA-114-like β-lactamases. Related, but not identical substitutions were detected in clinical strains expressing acquired antimicrobial resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter ruhlandii 3aAchromobacter xylosoxidans 3aamino acids 3aantibiotic resistance 3acell walls 3acystic fibrosis 3adetection limit 3aligases 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amutants 3apeptides 3apeptidoglycans 3aticarcillin1 aGabrielaite, Migle 1 aNørskov-Lauritsen, Niels 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Feb. 11, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100204203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010000166300001600266520151300282592002801795650002001823650002301843650000901866650002101875650001701896650001101913650001501924650003401939650002301973650002301996650002102019650002902040650001202069651001102081653003102092653002702123653002202150653002502172653002102197700001602218700001702234700001702251700001602268700001602284700001902300773008902319856008402408852000902492655001202501IND60097632520221118222941.0160901e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009763252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrépet, A.10aIdentification of the main pesticide residue mixtures to which the French population is exposed  ap. 125-133.  aOwing to the intensive use of pesticides and their potential persistence in the environment, various pesticide residues can be found in the diet. Consumers are therefore exposed to complex pesticide mixtures which may have combined adverse effects on human health. By modelling food exposure to multiple pesticides, this paper aims to determine the main mixtures to which the general population is exposed in France. Dietary exposure of 3337 individuals from the INCA2 French national consumption survey was assessed for 79 pesticide residues, based on results of the 2006 French food monitoring programmes. Individuals were divided into groups with similar patterns of co-exposure using the clustering ability of a Bayesian nonparametric model. In the 5 groups of individuals with the highest exposure, mixtures are formed by pairs of pesticides with correlations above 0.7. Seven mixtures of 2–6 pesticides each were characterised. We identified the commodities that contributed the most to exposure. Pesticide mixtures can either be components of a single plant protection product applied together on the same crop or be from separate products that are consumed together during a meal. Of the 25 pesticides forming the mixtures, two—DDT and Dieldrin—are known persistent organic pollutants. The approach developed is generic and can be applied to all types of substances found in the diet in order to characterise the mixtures that should be studied first because of their adverse effects on health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aat-risk population 3adiet 3adietary exposure 3ahuman health 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apesticide mixtures 3apesticide residues 3aplant protection 3aproducts and commodities 3asurveys 3aFrance 0aPesticide residue mixtures 0aCo-exposure clustering 0aMultiple exposure 0aFood risk assessment 0aCombined effects1 aTressou, J.1 aGraillot, V.1 aBéchaux, C.1 aPierlot, S.1 aHéraud, F.1 aLeblanc, J.

Euthyceras) has long been thought to comprise at most five species of Mexican sedges. Our morphological studies in the field and herbarium, however, supported by more recent DNA sequencing work, demonstrate that the section is, in fact, three times as species‐rich, making it one of the largest sections in Mexico. Its 15 species range from Chihuahua to Tamaulipas south to Veracruz and Oaxaca; a single species, Carex muriculata, extends into the United States. The section has unusual inflorescences with simple (except in Carex complexa), uniformly androgynous, sessile spikes, utriculiform cladoprophylls, and perigynia with a unique combination of pubescence types composed of papillae; unicellular, simple hairs; and (in many species) multicellular tubercles. We recognize five previously described species (C. muriculata, Carex perstricta, Carex schiedeana, Carex stellata, and Carex vizarronensis) and describe 10 additional species (Carex angustilepis, Carex cabralii, Carex complexa, Carex dentata, Carex gypsophila, Carex mesophila, Carex paneroi, Carex planilamina, Carex revoluta, and Carex tehuacana). We have expanded the morphological features used in the section to include particularly anther, staminate scale, and style features, and more detailed micromorphology of the perigynia, especially indumentum. In total, 13 of the 15 species recognized herein, with a total of 32 individuals, were examined for ETS and ITS for phylogenetic reconstruction. Phylogenetically, the xeric species (plus C. paneroi) form a grade leading to a clade of the more mesophytic species adapted to forest understories, plus the unique cliff dwelling C. complexa.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSF Award #1255901cUnited States National Science Foundation 3aCarex 3aDNA 3aherbaria 3amicrostructure 3aphylogeny 3aMexico1 aGonzález‐Elizondo, María del Socorro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4047-154X1 aHahn, Marlene1 aGarner, Mira1 aHipp, Andrew,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1241-99040 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2021 July, v. 59, no. 4 p.698-725dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000114x1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.127413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04493naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245011100172500001900283520271000302592002803012650002203040650001203062650002603074650001503100650001403115650001303129650001503142650001503157650001603172650001503188650001403203650001403217650001203231650001603243650001303259650001503272650002303287650001503310650001403325650002403339650001103363650003103374650001503405650001303420650001203433650002103445650001303466651001803479651001203497651001803509651002903527700003303556700001703589700002103606700001903627773012103646856007903767852000903846655001203855IND60732032220221119234944.0210326e20210313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073203222DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100302222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Alessio, Stefania 10aPost-Translational Protein Deimination Signatures in Plasma and Plasma EVs of Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe reindeer (caribou) Rangifer tarandus is a Cervidae in the order Artiodactyla. Reindeer are sedentary and migratory populations with circumpolar distribution in the Arctic, Northern Europe, Siberia and North America. Reindeer are an important wild and domesticated species, and have developed various adaptive strategies to extreme environments. Importantly, deer have also been identified to be putative zoonotic carriers, including for parasites, prions and coronavirus. Therefore, novel insights into immune-related markers are of considerable interest. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a phylogenetically conserved enzyme family which causes post-translational protein deimination by converting arginine into citrulline in target proteins. This affects protein function in health and disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in cellular communication, in physiological and pathological processes, via transfer of cargo material, and their release is partly regulated by PADs. This study assessed deiminated protein and EV profile signatures in plasma from sixteen healthy wild female reindeer, collected in Iceland during screening for parasites and chronic wasting disease. Reindeer plasma EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed distribution from 30 to 400 nm and were positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers. Deiminated proteins were isolated from whole plasma and plasma EVs, identified by proteomic analysis and protein interaction networks assessed by KEGG and GO analysis. This revealed a large number of deimination-enriched pathways for immunity and metabolism, with some differences between whole plasma and EVs. While shared KEGG pathways for whole plasma and plasma EVs included complement and coagulation pathways, KEGG pathways specific for EVs were for protein digestion and absorption, platelet activation, amoebiasis, the AGE–RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, ECM receptor interaction, the relaxin signaling pathway and the estrogen signaling pathway. KEGG pathways specific for whole plasma were pertussis, ferroptosis, SLE, thyroid hormone synthesis, phagosome, Staphylococcus aureus infection, vitamin digestion and absorption, and prion disease. Further differences were also found between molecular function and biological processes GO pathways when comparing functional STRING networks for deiminated proteins in EVs, compared with deiminated proteins in whole plasma. This study highlights deiminated proteins and EVs as candidate biomarkers for reindeer health and may provide information on regulation of immune pathways in physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative (prion) disease and zoonosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRangifer tarandus 3aSiberia 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aabsorption 3aamebiasis 3aarginine 3abiomarkers 3acitrulline 3acoagulation 3acomplement 3adigestion 3aestrogens 3afemales 3aferroptosis 3aimmunity 3ametabolism 3amigratory behavior 3aphagosomes 3aphylogeny 3aplatelet activation 3aprions 3aprotein-arginine deiminase 3aproteomics 3areindeer 3arelaxin 3athyroid hormones 3azoonoses 3aArctic region 3aIceland 3aNorth America 3aNorthern European region1 aThorgeirsdóttir, Stefanía 1 aKraev, Igor 1 aKarl Skirnisson,1 aLange, Sigrun 0 tBiology.g2021 Mar. 13, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100302223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245007800203300001800281520124700299592002801546650003401574650002001608650002601628650002601654650000801680650002901688650002501717650000901742650004601751650001401797650004301811650001301854650002301867650001301890650000901903650002701912650001901939650001301958653001601971653001901987653002602006700001702032700001902049700005702068700001602125700005702141700005502198773014702253856008002400852000902480655001202489IND60684911320221118051945.0200226e20200122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b070772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun-Joo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4393-815X10aPlasma-Polymerized Phlorotannins and Their Enhanced Biological Activities  ap. 2357-2365.  aHere, we investigated the effect of cold plasma (CP) on the biological activities of phloroglucinol. Phloroglucinol (7.92 and 15.84 mM in methanol) was treated with air dielectric barrier discharge plasma at 250 W. In vitro, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity and ferrous-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values of phloroglucinol increased in plasma treatment in a time-dependent manner. CP treatment of phloroglucinol decreased the lipid oxidation of oil emulsion during storage and increased the antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Staphylococcus aureus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of phloroglucinol increased and total phenolic content decreased based on CP treatment. The CP-induced polymerization of phloroglocinol to phlorotannin derivatives was identified using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detector and electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (HPLC–UV–ESI/MS) method. Consequently, the polymer structure of phloroglucinol was found in the CP-treated phloroglucinol. In addition, CP enhances the biological activity of phloroglucinol and could be applied to bioactive materials in food and related industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aair 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3acold 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aemulsions 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3alipid peroxidation 3amethanol 3aoils 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3apolymerization 3apolymers 0acold plasma 0aphloroglucinol 0abiological activities1 aYong, Hae In1 aLee, Byong Won1 aPark, Sanghoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4180-74551 aBaek, Ki Ho1 aKim, Tae Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0428-28291 aJo, Cheorun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2109-37980 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Jan. 22, v. 68, no. 8 p.2357-2365dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b070773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007000139245014000209300001600349500002000365520169500385592002802080596006602108596006602174596007302240650001002313650002202323650001602345650001202361650001102373650001402384650001502398650002702413700006902440700006902509700005702578700005902635700006302694700006002757700006102817700006102878773013802939856007303077852000903150655001203159IND60744888320221120153011.0210721e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074488832DNAL7 a10.1111/jse.127302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMárquez‐Corro, José I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4277-293310aMacroevolutionary insights into sedges (Carex: Cyperaceae): The effects of rapid chromosome number evolution on lineage diversification  ap. 776-790.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChanges in holocentric chromosome number due to fission and fusion have direct and immediate effects on genome structure and recombination rates. These, in turn, may influence ecology and evolutionary trajectories profoundly. Sedges of the genus Carex (Cyperaceae) comprise ca. 2000 species with holocentric chromosomes. The genus exhibits a phenomenal range in the chromosome number (2n = 10 − 132) with almost not polyploidy. In this study, we integrated the most comprehensive cytogenetic and phylogenetic data for sedges with associated climatic and morphological data to investigate the hypothesis that high recombination rates are selected when evolutionary innovation is required, using chromosome number evolution as a proxy for recombination rate. We evaluated Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models to infer shifts in chromosome number equilibrium and selective regime. We also tested the relationship between chromosome number and diversification rates. Our analyses demonstrate significant correlations between morphology and climatic niche and chromosome number in Carex. Nevertheless, the amount of chromosomal variation that we are able to explain is very small. We recognized a large number of shifts in mean chromosome number, but a significantly lower number in climatic niche and morphology. We also detected a peak in diversification rates near intermediate recombination rates. In combination, these analyses point toward the importance of chromosome evolution to the evolutionary history of Carex. Our work suggests that the effect of chromosome evolution on recombination rates, not just on reproductive isolation, may be central to the evolutionary history of sedges.  aPublisher supplied data  aBES‐2017‐079621cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aCGL2016‐77401‐PcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aPGC2018‐099608‐B‐I00cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad 3aCarex 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3aecology 3agenome 3aphylogeny 3apolyploidy 3areproductive isolation1 aMartín‐Bravo, Santiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0626-07701 aJiménez‐Mejías, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2815-44771 aHipp, Andrew,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1241-99041 aSpalink, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3250-568X1 aNaczi, Robert F.

We loaded apigenin (Ap), a dietary flavonoid having anti-cancer property, with poly (lactic-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NAp) to explore if nano-encapsulation could enhance anti-carcinogenic effect against ultra-violet B (UVB) and Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced skin tumor and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice. Particle size, morphology and zeta potential of NAp were determined using dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Tumor incidence and multiplicity in UVB–BaP induced mice with/without NAp treatment were ascertained and their histolopathological sections and chromosomal aberrations were studied. ROS accumulation and mitochondrial functioning through relevant markers like mitochondrial transmembrane potential were analyzed. Mitochondrial volume changes/swelling, cytochrome c (cyt c) release, mRNA and protein expressions of Apaf-1, bax, bcl-2, cyt c, cleaved caspase-9 and 3 were studied. Results showed that NAp produced better effects than Ap, due to their smaller size, and faster mobility. NAp reduced tissue damage and frequency of chromosomal aberrations, increased ROS accumulation to mediate mitochondrial-apoptosis through modulation of several apoptotic markers and mitochondrial matrix swelling. NAp showed ameliorative potentials in combating skin cancer and therefore has greater prospect of use in therapeutic management of skin cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapigenin 3aapoptosis 3aatomic force microscopy 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acaspase-9 3achromosome aberrations 3acytochrome c 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3alight scattering 3amembrane potential 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitochondria 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3askin neoplasms 3aultraviolet radiation 3azeta potential 0aPLGA-nano-encapsulation 0aApigenin 0aUltra-violet-B 0aBenzo[a]pyrene 0aApoptosis1 aDas, Jayeeta1 aSamadder, Asmita1 aPaul, Avijit1 aKhuda-Bukhsh, Anisur Rahman0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Dec., v. 62 p.670-680dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.09.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245006400200300001800264500002000282520146600302592002801768596004701796650001501843650001901858650001301877650001401890650001201904650001901916650000901935700005601944773013102000856007702131852000902208655001202217IND60789722620221120164751.0220822e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078972262DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JC0144052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Madison1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2259-042X10aOcean Surface Turbulence in Newly Formed Marginal Ice Zones  ap. 1382-1398.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNear‐surface turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates are altered by the presence of sea ice in the marginal ice zone, with significant implications for exchanges at the air‐ice‐ocean interface. Observations spanning a range of conditions are used to parameterize dissipation rates in marginal ice zones with relatively thin, newly formed ice, and two regimes are identified. In both regimes, the turbulent dissipation rates are matched to the turbulent input rate, which is formulated as the surface stress acting on roughness elements moving at an effective transfer velocity. In marginal ice zones with waves, the short waves are the roughness elements, and the phase speed of these waves is the effective transfer velocity. The wave amplitudes are attenuated by the ice, and thus, the size of the roughness elements is reduced; this is parameterized as a reduction in the effective transfer velocity. When waves are sufficiently small, the ice floes are the roughness elements, and the relative velocity between the sea ice and the ocean is the effective transfer velocity. A scaling is introduced to determine the appropriate transfer velocity in a marginal ice zone based on wave height, ice thickness and concentration, and ice‐ocean shear. The results suggest that turbulence underneath new sea ice is mostly related to the wind forcing and that marginal ice zones generally have less turbulence than the open ocean under similar wind forcing.  aPublisher supplied data  aN00014-13-1-0284cOffice of Naval Research 3ageophysics 3akinetic energy 3aresearch 3aroughness 3asea ice 3aturbulent flow 3awind1 aThomson, Jim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8929-00880 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Mar., v. 124, no. 3 p.1382-1398dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0144053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006500166520134600231592002801577650002701605650001301632650002501645650002701670650001401697650002801711650001001739650002101749650001401770650002001784650002001804650001201824650001901836650001301855650002201868700001801890700002401908700001701932773012101949856008202070852000902152655001202161IND60674150920221120212511.0191118e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067415092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2019.1034712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShelomi, Matan14aThe unique antimicrobial peptide repertoire of stick insects  aThe comparative analysis of innate immunity across different insect taxa has revealed unanticipated evolutionary plasticity, providing intriguing examples of immunity-related effector gene expansion and loss. Phasmatodea, the stick and leaf insects, is an order of hemimetabolous insects that can provide insight into ancestral innate immunity genes lost by later insect clades. We injected the stick insect Peruphasma schultei with a mixture of microbial elicitors to activate a strong immune response, followed by RNA-Seq analysis to screen for induced immunity-related effector genes. This revealed a highly diverse spectrum of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) belonging to the attacin, coleoptericin, defensin, thaumatin, and tachystatin families. In addition, we identified a large group of short, cysteine-rich putative AMPs, some of which were strongly elicited. The immunity-related effector gene repertoire also included c-type and i-type lysozymes and several pattern-recognition proteins, such as proteins that recognize Gram-negative bacteria and peptidoglycans. Finally, we identified 45 hemolymph lipopolysaccharide-binding protein sequences, an unusually large number for insects. Taken together, our results indicate that at least some phasmids synthesize a broad spectrum of diverse AMPs that deserve further in-depth analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPhasmida 3aamino acid sequences 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aelicitors 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenes 3agenome expansion 3ahemolymph 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3ainsects 3apeptidoglycans 3aproteins 3asequence analysis1 aJacobs, Chris1 aVilcinskas, Andreas1 aVogel, Heiko0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2020 Feb., v. 103 p.103471-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2019.1034713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245010700202300001800309520108100327592002801408650002701436650001001463650001101473650001401484650001101498650001101509650001901520650001001539650001301549653001901562653001601581653001701597653001401614653002001628700006501648700002101713700002101734700005701755773014701812856008001959852000902039655001202048IND60684911720221118051938.0200226e20200124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b073962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lumin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8255-422310aAnalysis of Fruit Lignin Content, Composition, and Linkage Types in Pear Cultivars and Related Species  ap. 2493-2505.  aLignin content, composition, and linkage types were investigated in pear fruit cultivars and related species. Lignin content increased during early stages and then decreased toward ripening in the core and flesh of “Gold Nijisseiki” and “Alexandrine Douillard”. The lignin content was highest at harvest in Chinese quince. Only trace amounts of lignin were detected in apple flesh. The lignin content was low in Japanese pears “Ohshu”, “Hosui”, and “Kosui”, and the noncondensed lignin index was high in flesh. The lignin type was guaiacyl–syringyl (GS) in these pears and related species. The S/G ratio at harvest varied widely (0.75–2.64) and increased during early stages and remained constant toward harvest in “Gold Nijisseiki” and “Alexandrine Douillard”. “Gold Nijisseiki” and “Alexandrine Douillard” were determined to be G- and S-lignin-rich types, respectively. β-Aryl ether, phenylcoumaran, and resinol interunit linkage types were detected among monolignol bonds, and β-Aryl ether units were the main linkages in the pear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudocydonia sinensis 3aPyrus 3aapples 3acultivars 3afruits 3alignin 3alignin content 3apears 3aripening 0apear cultivars 0astone cells 0afruit lignin 0aS/G ratio 0aRosaceae family1 aKamitakahara, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0130-19191 aMurayama, Hideki1 aOhsako, Takanori1 aItai, Akihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6837-89290 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Jan. 24, v. 68, no. 8 p.2493-2505dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b073963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245010300167300001600270520146000286592002801746596004701774596007801821650001001899650000901909650002201918650002201940650001001962650001201972651001001984653003301994653002102027653002002048653002102068653003002089700003302119700002002152700002702172700002202199773013302221856007802354852000902432655001202441IND60786602120221120174938.0220804e20220427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660212DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2021-01862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Meis, Annagiulia10aFeeding ecology of the endangered Apennine Yellow-bellied Toad (Bombina pachypus) in central Italy  ap. 452-463.  aAnurans are generalist opportunistic consumers, but many species show some degree of diet specialization. Within populations, individuals may specialize in specific dietary resources (individual specialization). Indeed, generalist populations may be composed of individuals using the whole range of available resources or of diverse individuals exploiting specific food items. Based on the niche variation hypothesis (NHV), an increase in population niche width may be related to a higher incidence of individual specialization. We analyzed the feeding ecology of the endangered Apennine Yellow-bellied Toad (Bombina pachypus (Bonaparte, 1838)) in central Italy. This species showed a generalist feeding strategy, wide trophic niche, high individual generalization, and a predominant use of terrestrial resources. The study species inhabits seasonal habitats determining variation in food availability and diversity, and this may have driven toads to be unselective and consume almost any encountered palatable item. The absence of sexual size dimorphism may explain the absence of trophic differentiation between sexes. The analysis of individual feeding traits revealed a week's degree of individual specialization positively correlated to niche width, partly supporting the NHV. The obtained information can be used for the implementation of effective conservation strategies of locally imperilled species, especially those breeding in temporary ponds.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Science, Roma Tre University  cMinistry of Education and Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003510 3aAnura 3adiet 3afood availability 3asexual dimorphism 3atoads 3azoology 3aItaly 0aApennine Yellow-bellied Toad 0aBombina pachypus 0atemporary ponds 0afeeding strategy 0aindividual specialization1 aBissattini, Alessandra Maria1 aVenchi, Alberto1 aBologna, Marco Alberto1 aVignoli, Leonardo0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2022 Apr. 27, v. 100, no. 7 p.452-463dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2021-01863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011200159300001800271500002000289520173300309592002802042650002502070650002502095650001702120650001702137650001002154650001902164650002202183650001602205650001602221650002302237650001402260650001502274650002502289650003002314650002202344650001502366700002402381700005802405700005802463773011602521856007302637852000902710655001202719IND60750119920221122235026.0210910e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075011992DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.153672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTannert, Martin10aAt4g29530 is a phosphoethanolamine phosphatase homologous to PECP1 with a role in flowering time regulation  ap. 1072-1083.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the most abundant phospholipids in membranes. The biosynthesis of phospholipids occurs mainly via the Kennedy pathway. Recent studies have shown that through this pathway, choline (Cho) moieties are synthesized through the methylation of phosphoethanolamine (PEtn) to phosphocholine (PCho) by phospho‐base N‐methyltransferase. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase1 (PECP1) is described as an enzyme that regulates the synthesis of PCho by decreasing the PEtn level during phosphate starvation to avoid the energy‐consuming methylation step. By homology search, we identified a gene (At4g29530) encoding a putative PECP1 homolog from Arabidopsis with a currently unknown biological function in planta. We found that At4g29530 is not induced by phosphate starvation, and is mainly expressed in leaves and flowers. The analysis of null mutants and overexpression lines revealed that PEtn, rather than PCho, is the substrate in vivo, as in PECP1. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography‐coupled mass spectrometry analysis of head group metabolites shows an increased PEtn level and decreased ethanolamine level in null mutants. At4g29530 null mutants have an early flowering phenotype, which is corroborated by a higher PC/PE ratio. Furthermore, we found an increased PCho level. The choline level was not changed, so the results corroborate that the PEtn‐dependent pathway is the main route for the generation of Cho moieties. We assume that the PEtn‐hydrolyzing enzyme participates in fine‐tuning the metabolic pathway, and helps prevent the energy‐consuming biosynthesis of PCho through the methylation pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3aethanolamine 3agenes 3ahydrophilicity 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3aphenotype 3aphosphates 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphosphorylcholine 3astarvation1 aBalcke, Gerd Ulrich1 aTissier, Alain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9406-42451 aKöck, Margret1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8178-84040 tplant journal.g2021 Aug., v. 107, no. 4 p.1072-1083dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.153673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245012400178520115400302592002801456650002701484650003001511650001501541650002701556650001801583650000901601650002601610650002001636650001401656650002001670650001801690650001801708650001701726650001901743650001101762650002901773650001301802650001501815650001201830650001101842650001601853653001701869653001801886653002701904653001001931653001601941700002101957700002001978700001801998700002502016700002002041700002002061700002902081700002102110700002202131773012102153856008202274852000902356655001202365IND60674151120221120222509.0200503e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067415112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2019.1035252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Robles, Inmaculada10aProteomic insights into the immune response of the Colorado potato beetle larvae challenged with Bacillus thuringiensis  aBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins constitute effective, environmentally safe biopesticides. Nevertheless, insects' tolerance to Bt is influenced by environmental factors affecting immunity. To understand larval immune response in the devastating coleopteran insect pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), we undertook a proteomic analysis of hemolymph of non-treated control larvae and larvae consuming non-lethal doses of spore-crystal mixtures containing the coleopteran-active Cry3Aa toxin. Results revealed lower amount of proteins involved in insect growth and higher amount of immune response-related proteins in challenged insects, sustaining the larval weight loss observed. Additionally, we found a potential regulatory role of the evolutionary conserved miR-8 in the insect's immune response relying on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Upon toxin challenge, different patterns of hemolymph AMPs expression and phenoloxidase activity were observed in CPB larvae reared on different Solanaceae plants. This suggests that diet and diet-associated insect midgut microbiota might modulate this insects' tolerance to non-lethal doses of Bt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3aSolanaceae 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abiopesticides 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3ahemolymph 3aimmune response 3ainsect growth 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect pests 3amicroorganisms 3amidgut 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arearing 3atoxins 3aweight loss 0aCry3Aa toxin 0aPhenoloxidase 0aAntimicrobial peptides 0amiR-8 0aInsect diet1 aDe Loma, Jessica1 aCapilla, Miguel1 aRoger, Isabel1 aBoix-Montesinos, Paz1 aCarrión, Pablo1 aVicente, Marcos1 aLópez-Galiano, M.

We present a field experiment that integrates an economic auction and a biophysical water flux model to develop a local market process consisting of both the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, we operate an auction with small-scale livestock owners who bid for contracts to implement site-specific manure management practices that reduce phosphorus loadings to a major reservoir. On the demand side, we implement a real money, multi-unit public good auction for these contracts with residents who potentially benefit from reduced water quality risks. The experiments allow us to construct supply and demand curves to find an equilibrium price for water quality improvement. The field experiments provide a proof-of-concept for practical implementation of a local market for environmental improvements, even for the challenging context of nonpoint pollution.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUniversity of Connecticutdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007710  cUniversity of Rhode Islanddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000096140 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal manure management 3aauctions 3adecision making 3aecological value 3aecosystem services 3afield experimentation 3alivestock 3amarkets 3amodels 3anonpoint source pollution 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3aprices 3arisk 3asupply balance 3awater quality 3awatershed hydrology 0aHydrologic ecosystem services 0aWater quality 0aMarket-based approach 0aAuctions1 aSwallow, Stephen K.1 aGold, Arthur J.1 aOpaluch, James1 aKafle, Achyut1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8464-09661 aMerrill, Nathaniel H.1 aMichaud, Clayton1 aGill, Carrie Anne0 tEcological economics.g2018 Apr., v. 146 p.17-25dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04016naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009900165300001600264520241000280592002802690650002102718650002502739650002002764650001402784650002802798650003702826650002202863650001502885650003302900650002102933650000902954650001102963650001302974650001802987650002003005651001203025651001103037651001603048651001803064653002703082653002503109653001403134653002203148653001603170700002003186700002303206700002603229773012703255856008303382852000903465655001203474IND60479334820221122175147.0160120e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047933482DNAL7 a10.1614/IPSM-D-15-00024.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJogesh, Tania10aPatterns of Genetic Diversity in the Globally Invasive Species Wild Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa)  ap. 415-429.  aWild parsnip is an invasive species with a global distribution in temperate climates. Parsnips are native to Eurasia and have been cultivated for more than five centuries. It is unclear whether the global invasion of this species is a consequence of escape from cultivation or the accidental introduction of a Eurasian wild subspecies. In this study, we used nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers to evaluate the genetic structure of wild parsnip in its native range (Europe) and in three distinct geographic regions where it is considered invasive: eastern North America, western North America, and New Zealand. We also compared wild and cultivated parsnips to determine whether they are genetically distinct. From 112 individuals, we recovered 14 ITS and 27 cpDNA haplotypes. One ITS haplotype was widespread; few haplotypes were rare singletons. In contrast, at least two lineages of cpDNA haplotypes were recovered, with several novel haplotypes restricted to Europe. Cultivated parsnips were not genetically distinct from wild parsnips, and numerous wild parsnip populations shared haplotypes with cultivars. High genetic diversity was recovered in all three regions, suggesting multiple introductions.Nomenclature: Wild parsnip, Pastinaca sativa L. PASA2.Management Implications: The availability of molecular data and advances in population genetic analysis have made it possible to estimate the patterns of species migrations with considerable precision. Findings from historical colonization and dispersal studies can shed light on human-mediated transport of biological materials and provide a broad understanding of how humans may have contributed to the introduction and spread of an invasive species. Evidence obtained in this study indicates that escape from cultivation led to the globalization of wild parsnips and introduced populations have high genetic diversity. Increased levels of diversity in invasive populations can act as a primer for rapid adaptive evolution of this noxious invasive species. Future studies with increased sampling and additional loci have the potential to elucidate specific patterns of colonization and admixture in this agriculturally entwined invasive plant and may serve as a model for investigating the natural and agricultural history of plant species that exist in wild, cultivated, and feral forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPastinaca sativa 3aagricultural history 3achloroplast DNA 3acultivars 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ainvasive species 3aloci 3amodels 3aparsnips 3aribosomal DNA 3atemperate zones 3aEurasia 3aEurope 3aNew Zealand 3aNorth America 0aChloroplast haplotypes 0acolonization history 0acultivars 0ainvasion genetics 0aNew Zealand1 aPeery, Rhiannon1 aDownie, Stephen R.1 aBerenbaum, M.q(May),0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 4 p.415-429dWeed Science Society of Americax1939-747X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FIPSM-D-15-00024.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03945naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520203900296592002802335650001802363650001602381650002602397650002402423650002102447650002602468650001002494650001002504650001302514650002302527650002602550650002102576650003402597650001502631650001402646650002202660650001802682650001702700650001102717650001302728650001402741650003002755651001002785653002202795653001302817653003002830653002102860653001502881700002502896700005902921700001302980700001602993700001903009700002003028700005803048773010703106856008503213852000903298655001203307IND60623604220221123044346.0190326e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062360422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lianguo10aContamination by perfluoroalkyl substances and microbial community structure in Pearl River Delta sediments  ap. 218-225.  aEnvironmental microbiota play essential roles in the maintenance of many biogeochemical processes, including nutrient cycling and pollutant degradation. They are also highly susceptible to changes in environmental stressors, with environmental pollutants being key disruptors of microbial dynamics. In the present study, a scientific cruise was launched on July 2017 around Pearl River Delta, a suitable studying site for perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the wake of the severe PFAS pollution. Surface sediment samples were collected from 18 representative stations to assess PFAS accumulation and profile microbial community. PFAS concentrations ranged from 24.2 to 181.4 pg/g dry weight in sediment, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the dominant homologue. The concentrations of PFAS homologues in the current study were much lower than those reported in previous studies, implying effective management and control of pollution from PFAS-related industries. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum, while nitrogen-metabolizing Nitrosopumilus and sulfate-reducing Desulfococcus genera were the most abundant. Variations in microbial communities among sampling stations were mainly due to the differences in abundances of Escherichia, Nitrosopumilus, and Desulfococcus. The outbreak of Escherichia bacteria at specific coastal stations potentially indicated the discharge of fecal matter into the marine environment. Dissolved oxygen (DO) in bottom seawater significantly influenced the structure of microbial communities in the sediment, while current study failed to observe significant effects from PFAS pollutants. Positive correlations were found between DO and sulfate-reducing bacteria in Desulfococcus and GOUTA19 genera. Overall, this study explored relationships between environmental variables (e.g., PFAS pollutants) and sediment bacteria. Biogeochemical parameters significantly influenced the structure and composition of microbial communities in sediment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfococcus 3aEscherichia 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3agenes 3aindustry 3amarine environment 3amicrobial communities 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3apollutants 3apollution 3apollution control 3aribosomal RNA 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3aseawater 3asediments 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3aChina 0aPearl River Delta 0aSediment 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aDissolved oxygen 0aMicrobiota1 aTsui, Mirabelle M.P.1 aLam, James C.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5557-62131 aWang, Qi1 aHu, Chenyan1 aWai, Onyx W.H.1 aZhou, Bingsheng1 aLam, Paul K.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2134-37100 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Feb., v. 245 p.218-225dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014600160300002000306520162800326592002801954650001301982650001601995650002302011650002002034650001302054650001002067650001802077650001202095650001102107650001502118650001802133650001802151650001402169650001102183653002402194653002802218653004602246653002502292653002602317653001702343653002102360700002702381700002002408700002002428700001802448773012602466856008002592852000902672655001202681IND60586032420221120193837.0171115e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058603242DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b139172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Xuemei10aMicrochemical Plant in a Liquid Droplet: Plasmonic Liquid Marble for Sequential Reactions and Attomole Detection of Toxin at Microliter Scale  ap. 39635-39640.  aMiniaturizing the continuous multistep operations of a factory into a microchemical plant offers a safe and cost-effective approach to promote high-throughput screening in drug development and enforcement of industrial/environmental safety. While particle-assembled microdroplets in the form of liquid marble are ideal as microchemical plant, these platforms are mainly restricted to single-step reactions and limited to ex situ reaction monitoring. Herein, we utilize plasmonic liquid marble (PLM), formed by encapsulating liquid droplet with Ag nanocubes, to address these issues and demonstrate it as an ideal microchemical plant to conduct reaction-and-detection sequences on-demand in a nondisruptive manner. Utilizing a two-step azo-dye formation as our model reaction, our microchemical plant allows rapid and efficient diazotization of nitroaniline to form diazonium nitrobenzene, followed by the azo coupling of this intermediate with target aromatic compound to yield azo-dye. These molecular events are tracked in situ via SERS measurement through the plasmonic shell and further verified with in silico investigation. Furthermore, we apply our microchemical plant for ultrasensitive SERS detection and quantification of bisphenol A (BPA) with detection limit down to 10 amol, which is 50 000-fold lower than the BPA safety limit. Together with the protections offered by plasmonic shell against external environments, these collective advantages empower PLM as a multifunctional microchemical plant to facilitate small-volume testing and optimization of processes relevant in industrial and research contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3abisphenol A 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3adroplets 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aliquids 3amodels 3amonitoring 3ananomaterials 3anitroanilines 3ascreening 3asilver 0amicrochemical plant 0aplasmonic liquid marble 0ain situ surface-enhanced Raman scattering 0asequential reactions 0aenclosed microreactor 0amicrosensing 0aAg nanoparticles1 aKoh, Charlynn Sher Lin1 aLee, Hiang Kwee1 aChew, Wee Shern1 aLing, Xing Yi0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 9, no. 45 p.39635-39640dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b139173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245010000211300001800311500001900329520097000348592002801318650002301346650002201369650001301391650002101404650001401425650001701439650001201456650001501468650002101483650001901504650001601523650001401539650001101553700006101564773017001625856008001795852000901875655001201884IND60727316120221122123844.0210210e20210127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072731612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c057422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Manishkumar D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6665-764110aKinetics of Carbon Nanotube Aerogel Synthesis using Floating Catalyst Chemical Vapor Deposition  ap. 2187-2196.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKinetics of formation of carbon nanotube aerogel (CNT-a) by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FC–CVD) has been studied for the first time by thermocatalytic decomposition of ethanol using ferrocene and thiophene as the catalyst and promoter, respectively. Effects of temperature (1423–1573 K), catalyst concentration (1.2–6.5 Pa), and partial pressure of ethanol (120–300 kPa) on the rate of formation of CNT-a have been investigated. The activation energy for the formation of CNT-a was calculated to be 38.5 kJ mol–¹. Various kinetic models were used to determine the rate limiting step(s). Irreversible dissociation of adsorbed ethanol followed by decomposition of the adsorbed ethyl group was found to be rate controlling step for the formation of CNT-a. The atomic ratios of Fe/S and Fe/C were found to have profound effects on the type of CNTs present in CNT-a as characterized by the scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aaerogels 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3adissociation 3aethanol 3aferrocenes 3apartial pressure 3aprocess design 3atemperature 3athiophene 3avapors1 aDasgupta, Kinshuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5742-77990 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Jan. 27, v. 60, no. 5 p.2187-2196dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c057423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245011600179300001600295520129400311536031001605592002801915596012801943596009502071650001502166650001302181650001702194650002202211650003102233650001902264650001802283650000902301650001802310653001002328653002002338653002902358653002202387700003002409700002502439700003202464700002902496700002502525700003302550773013602583856008502719852000902804655001202813IND60750790120221120210828.0210918e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075079012DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2020.17681432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Luana Maria10aEstimating wood moisture by near infrared spectroscopy: Testing acquisition methods and wood surfaces qualities  ap. 336-343.  aMoisture is one of the most important wood properties because its variation directly influences the material strength and density. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic models in order to estimate the moisture content in wood specimens. Moreover, predictive models built from NIR signatures recorded by different acquisition methods and on wood surfaces were compared and discussed. Mass and NIR spectra were measured on forty (40) Eucalyptus wood specimens in 10 steps during drying from the fiber saturated point to anhydrous condition. NIR spectra were recorded by means of an integrating sphere and optical fiber probe on four surface. Thus, wood moisture values were correlated with the corresponding NIR spectra by Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression. The best models for estimating wood moisture were developed from NIR spectra recorded on the transverse surface produced with the band saw by integrating sphere method (R²p = 0.96 and RMSEP = 8.56%) and fiber optic probe (R²p = 0.83 and RMSEP = 20.09%).

The contribution of a number of different transgene enzyme activities was systematically determined, as was the contribution of endogenous fatty acid metabolism. Successive iterations were informed by lipidomic analysis of neutral, polar and acyl-CoA pools. This approach allowed for a four-fold improvement on levels previously reported for the accumulation of eicosapentaenoic acid in Arabidopsis seeds and also facilitated the successful engineering of the high value polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid to 10-fold higher levels. Our studies identify the minimal gene set required to direct the efficient synthesis of these fatty acids in transgenic seed oil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aacyl coenzyme A 3abiosynthesis 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acid metabolism 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3ametabolic engineering 3aseed oils 3aseeds 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 0aALA 0aARA 0aDAG 0aDHA 0aDPA 0aEPA 0aGLA 0aLA 0aLC-PUFA 0aPC 0aPE 0aPI 0aPS 0aSDA 0aTAG 0aDesaturase 0aElongase 0aNutritional enhancement 0aOmega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 0aTransgenic plants1 aHaslam, Richard P.1 aUsher, Sarah L.1 aNapier, Johnathan A.1 aSayanova, Olga0 tMetabolic engineering.g2013 May, v. 17 p.30-41dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2013.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010100166300001800267500001900285520130100304592002801605650002201633650001401655650001201669650001801681650001901699650001801718650001401736650001001750650001901760650001401779700001201793700001401805700001601819700001601835700005701851773017001908856008002078852000902158655001202167IND60727316220221122123837.0210210e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072731622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c057512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Shengjuan10aCu–MnOX/γ-Al₂O₃ Catalyzed Ozonation of Nitrobenzene in a High-Gravity Rotating Packed Bed  ap. 2123-2135.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, Cu–MnOX/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst was first used for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of nitrobenzene (NB) in a high-gravity rotating packed bed (RPB), as RPB could significantly improve the mass transfer of ozone and thus contribute to the utilization efficiency of ozone and the degradation of NB. To illuminate the synergistic effect of RPB and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation, the degradation (ηNB) and mineralization (ηTOC) efficiency of NB as well as the utilization efficiency of ozone (Ru) in the RPB/O₃, BR/O₃ (bubbling reactor), and RPB/O₃/Cat. processes were compared. The results showed that the ηNB and Ru of the RPB/O₃ system were more than twice compared to that of the BR/O₃ system due to the high mass transfer of ozone in the RPB. The use of Cu–MnOX/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst as a packing in the RPB/O₃/Cat. system resulted in an increase in the mineralization of NB from 60.3 to 81.7%. Radical quenching tests confirmed that O₂•– and •OH were dominant reactive oxygen species, and O₂•– played an important role in •OH generation. In conclusion, Cu–MnOX/γ-Al₂O₃-catalyzed ozonation and high gravity had a synergistic effect on •OH initiation and thus improved the degradation and mineralization of NB in an aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3agravity 3amass transfer 3amineralization 3anitrobenzenes 3aozonation 3aozone 3aprocess design 3asynergism1 aLei, Du1 aSong, Yao1 aLiang, Lina1 aLiu, Youzhi1 aJiao, Weizhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3378-67430 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 60, no. 5 p.2123-2135dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c057513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009900164300001400263520099200277592002801269650002101297650002001318650002701338650002301365650001801388650001601406650001001422650002401432650001301456650001501469650001401484653001601498653001501514653001301529653001001542653002101552700001601573700001301589700001501602700001601617700001701633700001701650700001401667773008401681856008301765852000901848655001201857IND60083303920221123023128.0161023e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008330392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2013.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jing10aEngineering central metabolic modules of Escherichia coli for improving β-carotene production  ap. 42-50.  aATP and NADPH are two important cofactors for production of terpenoids compounds.

The whole β-carotene synthetic pathway was divided into five modules. Engineering MEP module resulted in 3.5-fold increase of β-carotene yield, while engineering β-carotene synthesis module resulted in another 3.4-fold increase. The best β-carotene yield increased 21%, 17% and 39% after modulating single gene of ATP synthesis, pentose phosphate and TCA modules, respectively. Combined engineering of TCA and PPP modules had a synergistic effect on improving β-carotene yield, leading to 64% increase of β-carotene yield over a high producing parental strain. Fed-batch fermentation of the best strain CAR005 was performed, which produced 2.1g/L β-carotene with a yield of 60mg/g DCW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abatch fermentation 3abeta-carotene 3aengineering 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3apentoses 3aphosphates 3asynergism 0aβ-Carotene 0aTerpenoids 0aCofactor 0aNADPH 0aEscherichia coli1 aLi, Qingyan1 aSun, Tao1 aZhu, Xinna1 aXu, Hongtao1 aTang, Jinlei1 aZhang, Xueli1 aMa, Yanhe0 tMetabolic engineering.g2013 May, v. 17 p.42-50dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2013.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011200169300001400281520165800295592002801953650003101981650001202012650001302024650001202037650001102049650002602060650001902086650001602105650001202121650001402133650001402147653001202161653001202173653001602185653002602201700002602227773008402253856008302337852000902420655001202429IND60083304020221123005931.0161023e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008330402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2013.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheel, Michael10aNew options to engineer biofuel microbes: Development and application of a high-throughput screening system  ap. 51-58.  aThe number of recent efforts on rational metabolic engineering approaches to increase butanol production in Clostridium acetobutylicum are quite limited, demonstrating the physiological complexity of solventogenic clostridia. Since multiple largely unknown parameters determine a particular phenotype, an inverse strategy to select a phenotype of interest can be useful. However, the major constraint for explorative or combinatorial metabolic engineering approaches is the availability of a feasible screening method to select the desired phenotype from a large population in a high-throughput manner. Therefore, a semi-quantitative assay was developed to monitor alcohol production in microtiter cultures of C. acetobutylicum. The applicability of the screening system was evaluated by two examples. First, C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was chemically mutagenized and subjected to high butanol concentrations as a pre-selection step. Screening of the butanol-tolerant population resulted in the identification of mutants with >20% increased butanol production as compared to the wildtype. The second application example was based on a pre-engineered C. acetobutylicum strain with low acetone biosynthetic activity, but concomitantly reduced butanol titer. After chemical mutagenesis, a total of 4390 clones was analyzed and mutants with significantly increased butanol concentrations and similarly low acetone levels as the parental strain were selected. Thus, the suitability of the semi-quantitative screening system was validated, opening up new perspectives for combinatorial strategies to improve solventogenic clostridia and other biofuel microbes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aacetone 3abiofuels 3abutanol 3aclones 3ametabolic engineering 3amicroorganisms 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3ascreening 0aButanol 0aEthanol 0aClostridium 0aNitroblue tetrazolium1 aLütke-Eversloh, Tina0 tMetabolic engineering.g2013 May, v. 17 p.51-58dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2013.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245019400153300001800347520169500365592002802060650001002088650001402098650001302112650001102125650001802136650004102154650001102195650001502206650001202221650001102233650001302244650002302257650001102280650001202291650001402303650001302317650001102330650002302341700001402364700001602378700001502394700001902409700001602428700001702444773010402461856007502565852000902640655001202649IND60534011120221116194225.0160802e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053401112DNAL7 a10.1021/ef300501t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aCharacterization of Red Pine Pyrolysis Bio-oil by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry and Negative-Ion Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry  ap. 4532-4539.  aA red pine fast pyrolysis bio-oil was subjected to sequential solvent fractionation into n-hexane soluble (HS), ether soluble (ES), ether insoluble (EIS), dichloromethane soluble (DS), and methanol soluble (MeS) fractions. The volatile components of bio-oil were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), indicating the presence of acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, phenols, and anhydromonosaccharides, which consisted of methoxy, hydroxy, and carbonyl functional groups. These results imply that the bio-oil was similar to the most reported fast pyrolysis bio-oil samples in molecular composition. The bio-oil and its five subfractions were analyzed by negative-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The predominant compounds in bio-oil were O₂–O₁₇ class species with 1–22 double-bond equivalent (DBE) values and 4–39 carbon numbers. The most abundant class species in biocrude oil, HS, ES, EIS, DS, and MeS subfractions were O₇, O₆, O₈, O₁₀, O₇, and O₈ class species, respectively. The predominant EIS subfraction presented an obvious relative low DBE value, sustaining the tentative identification as “sugar fraction”. The predominant compounds in DS subfraction were likely lignin dimers, whereas those in MeS subfraction should be lignin dimers and trimers. The number of oxygen atoms of the bio-oil compounds was negatively correlated with the average DBE value, indicating that oxygen atoms were present in various functional groups of the bio-oil compounds. The N₁Oₓ class species were also identified, which contained 1–16 DBE and 6–30 carbon numbers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aaldehydes 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3afractionation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexane 3aionization 3aketones 3alignin 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3aoxygen 3aphenols 3apyrolysis 3asolvents 3asugars 3avolatile compounds1 aShi, Quan1 aZhang, Yahe1 aHe, Yuling1 aChung, Keng H.1 aZhao, Suoqi1 aXu, Chunming0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4532-4539dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef300501t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245018300163300001600346520116900362592002801531650001101559650002201570650001201592650001201604650001301616650001401629650003101643650001701674650001101691650000901702650001101711650001901722650001401741650002001755650001401775650002001789650002101809650001901830650001501849653001701864653002401881653002101905653002001926700001501946700001701961700001401978700001701992700002302009700001702032773010702049856008502156852000902241655001202250IND60623604520221120112935.0190326e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062360452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lu12aA comprehensive mitigation strategy for heavy metal contamination of farmland around mining areas – Screening of low accumulated cultivars, soil remediation and risk assessment  ap. 820-828.  aA three-year field test was conducted in an area surrounding past mining activity (mining area) to investigate the value of a novel comprehensive remediation strategy for Cd and Pb contamination, which included screening of low accumulated vegetable cultivars that take up Cd and Pb less than normal cultivars, in situ soil remediation using different soil amendments, and health risk assessment that evaluates the possibility of safe consumption for the vegetables.

Following treatments, hazard quotients for adults and children were below 1, indicating that the vegetables grown were safe for human consumption. The total cost of remediation was $3885 ha−1, so the cost of the remediation of the combination of Cd and Pb was economic in this mining area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aagricultural land 3abiochar 3acadmium 3achildren 3acultivars 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3alead 3amining 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3arisk assessment 3ascreening 3asoil amendments 3asoil remediation 3asuperphosphate 3avegetables 0aHeavy metals 0aVegetable screening 0aSoil remediation 0aRisk assessment1 aYang, Dong1 aLi, Zhangtao1 aFu, Yuhui1 aLiu, Xingmei1 aBrookes, Philip C.1 aXu, Jianming0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Feb., v. 245 p.820-828dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007700169300001400246520126800260592002801528650003001556650002101586650002801607650001001635650001601645650001801661650001701679650001101696650001201707650001901719650001501738650001101753650003101764650001001795650002701805650001101832650002601843650000901869650001301878650002201891653001601913653002501929653002801954653001101982700001901993700001302012700002202025700001502047773008402062856008302146852000902229655001202238IND60083304120221123005858.0161023e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008330412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2013.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jun-Chao10aMetabolic engineering of tomato for high-yield production of astaxanthin  ap. 59-67.  aDietary carotenoids have been shown to be beneficial to health by decreasing the risk of many diseases. Attempts to enhance carotenoids in food crops have been successful although higher plants appear to resist big changes of carotenoid biosynthesis by metabolic engineering. Here we report the generation of a more nutritious tomato by modifying the intrinsic carotenes to astaxanthin, a high-value ketocarotenoid rarely found in plants. This was achieved by co-expression of the algal β-carotene ketolase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and β-carotene hydroxylase from Haematococcus pluvialis, a unique pair of enzymes identified to co-operate perfectly in converting β-carotene to astaxanthin by functional complementation in Escherichia coli. Expression of the two enzymes in tomato up-regulated most intrinsic carotenogenic genes, and efficiently directed carbon flux into carotenoids, leading to massive accumulations of mostly free astaxanthin in leaves (3.12mg/g) but esterified astaxanthin in fruits (16.1mg/g) and a 16-fold increase of total carotenoid capacity therein without affecting the plant normal growth and development. This study opened up the possibility of employing crop plants as green factories for economical production of astaxanthin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aEscherichia coli 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aalgae 3aastaxanthin 3abeta-carotene 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aenzymes 3aesterification 3afood crops 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3aleaves 3ametabolic engineering 3arisk 3atomatoes 3atransgenic plants 0aAstaxanthin 0aβ-carotene ketolase 0aβ-carotene hydroxylase 0aTomato1 aZhong, Yu-Juan1 aLiu, Jin1 aSandmann, Gerhard1 aChen, Feng0 tMetabolic engineering.g2013 May, v. 17 p.59-67dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2013.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008400157300001800241520201100259592002802270650001902298650001402317650001902331650001102350650000902361650001402370650001402384700002002398700002302418773010402441856007502545852000902620655001202629IND60534011220221116193854.0160802e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053401122DNAL7 a10.1021/ef300502f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Tausif10aComplex Flow and Composition Path in CO2 Injection Schemes from Density Effects  ap. 4590-4598.  aCO₂ injection has been used to improve oil recovery for the last 4 decades. In recent years, CO₂ injection has become more attractive because of the dual effect: injection in the subsurface (1) allows for reduction of the CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere to reduce global warming and (2) improves the oil recovery. One of the screening criteria for CO₂ injection as an enhanced oil recovery method is based on the measurement of CO₂ minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) in a slim tube. The slim tube data are used for the purpose of field evaluation and for the tuning of the equations of state. The slim tube represents one-dimensional (1D) horizontal flow. When CO₂ dissolves in the oil, the density may increase. The effect of the density increase in high-permeability reservoirs when CO₂ is injected from the top has not been modeled in the past. The increase in density changes the flow path from 1D to two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) (downward flow). As a result of this density effect, the compositional path in a reservoir can be radically different from the flow path in a slim tube. In this work, we study the density effect from CO₂ dissolution in modeling of CO₂ injection. We account for the increase in oil density with CO₂ dissolution using the Peng–Robinson equation of state. The viscosity is modeled based on the Pedersen–Fredenslund viscosity correlation. We perform compositional simulation of CO₂ injection in a 2D vertical cross-section with the density effect. Our results show that the density increase from CO₂ dissolution may have a drastic effect on the CO₂ flow path and recovery performance. One conclusion from this work is that there is a need to have accurate density data for CO₂/oil mixtures at different CO₂ concentrations to model properly CO₂ injection studies. Our main conclusion is that the downward flow of the CO₂ and oil mixture may not be gravity-stable, despite the widespread assumption in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aequations 3aglobal warming 3amodels 3aoils 3ascreening 3aviscosity1 aNasrabadi, Hadi1 aFiroozabadi, Abbas0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4590-4598dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef300502f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245016200179300001800341520110300359536036101462592002801823596003201851596001101883596002801894650001101922650001801933650001501951650001501966650000901981650001601990650002202006651001102028651001802039651001102057651001202068700002002080700001902100700002402119700002402143773011902167856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60750790520221120210831.0211005e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075079052DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2021.19634972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzalevskiy, Konstantin10aClassification of the frozen/thawed surface state of Northern land areas based on SMAP and GCOM-W1 brightness temperature observations at 1.4 GHz and 6.9 GHz  ap. 1073-1081.  aIn this letter, the method created earlier by the authors and the information product SPL3FTP_E of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite for determining frozen/thawed state of soil surface on the example of test sites placed on North Slope of Alaska, U.S.A., Canada, Finland and Russian Federation were compared. As an indicator of the frozen/thawed state of soil surface, the polarization index calculated on the basis of the reflectivity of soils was proposed. The soil reflectivity was determined in the L-band based on the SMAP radiometric observations at a frequency of 1.4 GHz using the values of brightness temperatures measured by the Global Change Observation Mission – Water 1/Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (GCOM-W1/AMSR2) at a vertical polarization and a frequency of 6.9 GHz, as an estimate of the soil effective temperature. As a result, it was shown that the developed method makes it possible to increase accuracy of the frozen/thawed states determination of soil surface from 3% to 9% in relation to the SMAP data (SPL3FTP_E) for twelve Arctic test sites.  aThis work was supported by the SB RAS project No. 0287-2021-0034.

F<sub>1</sub> hybrids resulting from single crosses between the moderately responsive line DH 105 and recalcitrant genotypes with high breeding value showed a considerable heterosis effect in their androgenic responses. Most of the hybrids had favourable morphological and agronomic characters on the basis of “per se” evaluation. The data of the experiments showed that these F<sub>1</sub> hybrid plants could be successfully used as anther donors, since numerous fertile DH plants were developed from their anther cultures.

The research was conducted with the use of a qualitative approach and involved two steps. First, in order to select retailers with organic private labels (OPLs) and producers delivering products under OPLs, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with the representatives of management boards of 17 enterprises. Second, in order to analyze the assortment-based competitive advantage of the OPLs in depth, 8 enterprises were analyzed. In order to explore the price-related competitive advantage, three products offered under PLs, organic PLs, producer brands, and imported brands were selected for subsequent analysis. For retail chains, it was found that the introduction of OPLs is the source of CA via six contributors, namely, price, range of assortment, type of PLs, image of the retailer, sustainability and specific process, and product-related attributes of organic food. Extension of offers with organic private labels makes it easier for consumers to buy organic food at more affordable prices and follow the principles of proper nutrition and a sustainable diet with low environmental impact. At the same time, the international retailers can position themselves as chains contributing to more sustainable consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adiet 3aenvironmental impact 3ainterviews 3amarkets 3aorganic foods 3aprices 3aproduct labeling 3aqualitative analysis1 aŻakowska-Biemans, Sylwia1 aCzeczotko, Maksymilian1 aŚwiątkowska, Monika1 aStangierska, Dagmara1 aŚwistak, Ewa1 aBobola, Agnieszka1 aSzlachciuk, Julita1 aKrajewski, Karol0 tSustainability.g2018 July 05, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100723383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245010400161300001600265500001500281520123500296592002801531650002401559650001701583650001101600650001501611650001601626650001501642650002501657650001001682653003201692653002501724653002001749653001401769700001701783700001401800773012701814856008201941852000902023655001202032IND60478476320221120202416.0160121e20050801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047847632DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.53.2005.2.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajkai, K.10aElectrical capacitance of roots in relation to plant electrodes, measuring frequency and root media  ap. 197-210.  a2019-12-06  aThe electrical capacitance method was applied for the examination of living root systems in a pot experiment. The measured root capacitances gave an unambiguous indication of the development of root mass and length. The root capacitances measured using needle and clamp plant electrodes were closely similar when the roots of whole plants were placed in water, while increasing differences were observed with a decrease in soil water saturation. The difference in capacitance between the plant electrodes is outlined by interpreting the action mechanism of the clamp electrode. The capacitance and electrical impedance spectra (30 Hz-1 MHz) were determined for roots in soil, for pieces of roots washed free of soil, and for the soil itself. The root capacitance was smaller than that of the soil and higher than that of root pieces at 1 kHz, while the capacitance of the soil became equal to that of roots in soil at about 2 kHz. This calls attention to the importance of the measuring frequency when determining root capacitance. A capacitor model with two dielectric media is proposed besides Dalton's model in order to interpret the behaviour of root and soil capacitances.

The mechanisms of dilution, thermal-diffusion, and chemical effects of diluents on the laminar burning velocity were analyzed quantitatively at different dilution ratios for different diluents. Results show that the laminar burning velocity is decreased in the order from helium, argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. In the case of N₂, the thermal-diffusion and chemical effects can be negligible and the decrease of the laminar burning velocity is largely caused by the dilution effect. The dilution, thermal-diffusion, and chemical effects of CO₂ suppress the laminar burning velocity, where the dilution effect plays a dominant effect among them. For helium and argon diluents, the chemical effect can be negligible and the thermal-diffusion effect enhances the laminar burning velocity. Therefore, the dilution effect has a much larger suppression effect on decreasing the laminar burning velocity to counteract the thermal-diffusion effect of helium and argon. An empirical formula of the laminar burning velocity that takes into account the adiabatic flame temperature and thermal diffusivity is obtained. Good correlations between the laminar burning velocity and mole fraction of H + OH at the position of the maximum mole fraction of the H radical in the flame are also demonstrated. The laminar burning velocity has the same tendency with the product of thermal-diffusion and chemical reaction terms as a function of the dilution ratio for different diluents. The adiabatic flame temperature plays a dominant influence on the laminar burning velocity, and thermal diffusivity has a secondary influence on methane–air–diluent flames.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical reactions 3ahelium 3anitrogen 3atemperature 3athermal diffusivity1 aJiang, Xue1 aHuang, Zuohua1 aIida, Norimasa0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4242-4252dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef300535s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245005000176300001500226520108600241592002801327650001901355650002601374650000901400650001301409650001401422650000901436650001901445650001601464651002201480651001301502651001001515700002301525773009001548856008801638990002301726852000901749655001201758IND60091568320221123032541.0141103e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009156832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamatzky, Andrew10aRebuilding Iberian motorways with slime mould  ap. 89-100.  aPlasmodium of a cellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a unique living substrate proved to be efficient in solving many computational problems with natural spatial parallelism.

Whether the system is comprised entirely of ions, like ionic liquids, or is a mixture of a polar solvent with a salt, e.g., liquid electrolytes for battery applications, the presence of ions in these materials results in strong local electric fields polarizing solvent molecules and large ions. To predict properties of such systems from molecular simulations often requires either explicit or mean-field inclusion of the influence of polarization on electrostatic interactions. In this manuscript, we review the pros and cons of different treatments of polarization ranging from the mean-field approaches to the most popular explicit polarization models in molecular dynamics simulations of ionic materials. For each method, we discuss their advantages and disadvantages and emphasize key assumptions as well as their adjustable parameters. Strategies for the development of polarizable models are presented with a specific focus on extracting atomic polarizabilities. Finally, we compare simulations using polarizable and nonpolarizable models for several classes of ionic systems, discussing the underlying physics that each approach includes or ignores, implications for implementation and computational efficiency, and the accuracy of properties predicted by these methods compared to experiments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abatteries 3aelectric field 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3aionic liquids 3aions 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models1 aPiquemal, Jean-Philip1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6615-94261 aBorodin, Oleg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9428-52911 aMacKerell, Alexander D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8287-68041 aRoux, Benoît,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5254-27121 aSchröder, Christian,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2167-50960 tChemical reviews.g2019 May 29, v. 119, no. 13 p.7940-7995dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b007633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007700158300001800235520143800253592002801691650001501719650001801734650002601752650002601778650001101804650000901815650001201824650001301836650000901849650001401858650001401872650001001886650001901896650001401915700002101929773010401950856007502054852000902129655001202138IND60534011520221116185509.0160802e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053401152DNAL7 a10.1021/ef300537e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunia, Ricardo10aStudy of Heavy Crude Oil Flows in Pipelines with Electromagnetic Heaters  ap. 4426-4437.  aThe electromagnetic heating of heavy crude oil in cylindrical pipes represents a novel technique to reduce fluid viscosity and diminish the cost required for its transportation. In this study, the oil viscous fluid momentum and energy balances, which include the effects of electromagnetic heating, variable viscosity, and fluid dielectric properties, are solved in cylindrical coordinates. The electromagnetic energy absorbed by oil is converted into sensible heat, which could significantly reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil fluids. This drop in fluid viscosity diminishes flow pressure losses in pipelines, which reduces the number and size of pumping stations between oil producers and consumers. Different pipe materials are considered here to determine the effect of their dielectric properties in the fluid flow. Simulation results show that pipe materials with large electromagnetic absorption tend to attenuate the pipe interior electromagnetic field, which reduces the direct warming of the fluid. This significant reduction in the direct fluid heating suggests that pipes made by transparent electromagnetic materials are preferred for this type of application. A fixed cost analysis of using electromagnetic heaters was made to maximize the distance between pump stations in a long pipeline stretch. The simulation results demonstrate that electromagnetic heaters increase the distance between pump stations by 30%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acost analysis 3adielectric properties 3aelectromagnetic field 3aenergy 3aheat 3aheaters 3amomentum 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apipelines 3apipes 3atransportation 3aviscosity1 aEdgar, Thomas F.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4426-4437dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef300537e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011500175300001300290520166000303592002801963650001901991650001102010650001102021650001602032650001302048650002102061650001602082650001302098650001502111650001902126650002302145650001002168650001102178653000902189653001902198653001902217653002002236653001302256653001402269700002202283700001902305700002102324700001902345773009502364856008602459852000902545655001202554IND60525795420221120220626.0190319e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052579542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelefosse, Matthieu10aVariation in size and chemical composition of seeds from the seagrass Zostera marina—Ecological implications  ap. 7-14.  aSeed size correlates with several plant traits spanning from seedling emergence depth or survival to seed dispersal potential. The ecological importance of seed size has been widely recognised for terrestrial plants, but few studies address this for marine angiosperms. With focus on the seagrass Zostera marina, we (1) relate seed size (length, diameter, fresh and dry weights) to its main reserves: starch, proteins and minerals, (2) quantify inter- and intra-specific population differences in seed size and composition, and (3) determine the effect of size on seed dispersal. We found that the seed size variation originated mostly from differences within rather than between populations. Seed dry weight (DW) was the most variable morphological characteristic across populations (0.64–6.03mg DW). DW was positively correlated with the amount of reserves (p<0.001). An eelgrass seed contained on average 52% DW starch, 13% DW proteins and 4% DW minerals. Interestingly, the relative contents of minerals and proteins were higher in smaller seeds, whereas starch content of seeds >2mg DW remained constant. Seed settling velocity, a proxy for seed dispersal, increased with DW from 1.4 to 8.6cms−1. Seeds of different quality may disperse differently: heavy seeds stay close to the parent plant and contain relatively more carbon to compensate for low light regime in the adults’ shadow, whereas smaller seeds spread further and contain relatively high nutrient content to establish rapidly in more open areas. Intraspecific seed size variations in the seagrass Z. marina may therefore assure both patch maintenance and colonisation of new areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZostera marina 3aadults 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3aminerals 3anutrient content 3aphotoperiod 3aproteins 3aseagrasses 3aseed dispersal 3aseedling emergence 3aseeds 3astarch 0aSeed 0aZostera marina 0aStarch content 0aProtein content 0aMinerals 0aDispersal1 aPovidisa, Katrina1 aPoncet, Dorine1 aKristensen, Erik1 aOlesen, Birgit0 tAquatic botany.g2016 May, v. 131 p.7-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001900162245010800181300001600289520184800305592002802153650001102181650001702192650001602209650001102225650001102236650001302247650001702260650001302277650002302290650002102313650001002334650001902344650002302363650002502386650001002411650002102421650001602442651001102458700002302469700002502492700001902517773009602536856007702632852000902709655001202718IND50073466720221121103456.0170718e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007346672DNAL7 a245776522pmid7 a10.1007/s0044200005942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSparks, Jed P.10aLeaf uptake of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a tropical wet forest: implications for tropospheric chemistry  ap. 214-221.  aTropical forest soils are known to emit large amounts of reactive nitrogen oxide compounds, often referred to collectively as NOy (NOy = NO + NO₂ + HNO₃ + organic nitrates). Plants are known to assimilate and emit NOy and it is therefore likely that plant canopies affect the atmospheric concentration of reactive nitrogen compounds by assimilating or emitting some fraction of the soil-emitted NOy. It is crucial to understand the magnitude of the canopy effects and the primary environmental and physiological controls over NOy exchange in order to accurately quantify regional NOy inventories and parameterize models of tropospheric photochemistry. In this study we focused on nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), which is the component of NOy that most directly catalyzes the chemistry of O₃ dynamics, one of the most abundant oxidative species in the troposphere, and which has been reported as the NOy species that is most readily exchanged between plants and the atmosphere. Leaf chamber measurements of NO₂ flux were measured in 25 tree species growing in a wet tropical forest in the Republic of Panama. NO₂ was emitted to the atmosphere at ambient NO₂ concentrations below 0.53–1.60 ppbv (the NO₂ compensation point) depending on species, with the highest rate of emission being 50 pmol m–² s–¹ at <0.1 ppbv. NO₂ was assimilated by leaves at ambient NO₂ concentrations above the compensation point, with the maximum observed uptake rate being 1,550 pmol m–² s–¹ at 5 ppbv. No seasonal variation in leaf NO₂ flux was observed in this study and leaf emission and uptake appeared to be primarily controlled by leaf nitrogen and stomatal conductance, respectively. When scaled to the entire canopy, soil NO emission rates to the atmosphere were estimated to be maximally altered ±19% by the overlying canopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aforest soils 3ainventories 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrogen compounds 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aphotochemistry 3aseasonal variation 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 3atropical forests 3atroposphere 3aPanama1 aMonson, Russell K.1 aSparks, Kimberlee L.1 aLerdau, Manuel0 tOecologia.g2001 Apr., v. 127, no. 2 p.214-221dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0044200005943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01862naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005200170300001400222520071400236592002800950650002000978650001900998650001901017650002201036650001101058650001601069650001301085651001101098653001501109653001301124653001601137653001601153700002601169700001701195700002201212700002701234773009601261856008601357852000901443655001201452IND60525795620221120220721.0190319e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052579562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aden Hartog, C.12aA new Ruppia from Mexico: Ruppia mexicana n.sp.  ap. 38-44.  aA study on the features of Ruppia from different sheltered bays and lagoons with marine or brackish water along the Mexican Yucatan peninsula indicates that these plants are morphologically distinct from the European Ruppia maritima.

R.10aTools for Improving the Effectiveness of Academic Partnerships in Informing Conservation Practices  ap. 93-101.  aTo identify effective strategies for managing and enhancing partnerships between conservation organizations (CO) and academic researchers, we interviewed 11 Canadian environmental nongovernmental and governmental organizations that manage conservation lands. Conservation organizations were asked to describe their strategies for setting research priorities, finding research partners, providing incentives, specifying and obtaining deliverables, applying results, and measuring the success of partnerships with academic researchers. Several effective strategies were identified for enhancing the success of academic partnerships. Many COs develop lists of internal research priorities to communicate to the research community beyond their existing networks. Funding is widely viewed as the most effective incentive; however, most COs are limited in the amount of direct research funding they can provide. Instead, they rely on alternative incentives, including providing access to land and data, accommodations at research stations, equipment, and expertise. Peer-reviewed articles are often the most desirable deliverables; however, alternate deliverables are usually welcomed by COs. These include reports, data sets, literature reviews, and workshops or seminars where researchers share knowledge directly with practitioners. Establishing written contracts for deliverables and following up by phone or email helps to ensure that deliverables are received. Participation in research by CO practitioners serving on student committees or as coauthors helps to keep research relevant to COs' needs. COs can develop systems to track and apply research conducted in partnership with academics, including developing records for completed projects, and disseminating research results beyond the project team.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacademic achievement 3acommittees 3aconservation practices 3adata collection 3ae-mail 3aequipment 3aresearch support 3aresearchers 0aeffectiveness 0aevidence 0afunding 0apriorities 0aresearch1 aTremblay, Marie A.1 aBarna, Heather0 tNatural areas journal.g2016 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.93-101dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.036.01163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006600153245007900219500001900298520101200317592002801329650002501357650001301382650002101395650001301416650002001429650001101449651001701460653001901477653001801496653001401514653004201528700002301570773010601593856008801699852000901787655001201796IND60715957820221120024225.0210201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071595782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1117852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams-Wynn, Mark D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9751-541912aA review of the treatment options for marine plastic waste in South Africa  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMarine plastic is a major worldwide challenge, for which many solutions are being proposed. However, most of the solutions focus on the prevention and collection of the plastic, with little emphasis on the development of waste treatment options.This review seeks to propose areas where further studies could assist to close gaps in knowledge. Some identified gaps include a poor understanding of the quantities and composition of marine plastics, a lack of information about existing marine plastic treatment technologies, and the environmental impact of the available options. To better understand the capabilities of the current South African plastics recycling industry, data from the South African Waste Information Centre (SAWIC) are reported and discussed.While there is a lack of technology development for the treatment of marine plastic globally, the intention of this review is to drive research in this area by creating awareness and encouraging implementation of possible treatment technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3aindustry 3amarine pollution 3aplastics 3awaste treatment 3awastes 3aSouth Africa 0aMarine plastic 0aMarine debris 0aTreatment 0aMarine plastic treatment technologies1 aNaidoo, Paramespri0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2020 Dec., v. 161 p.111785-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1117853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008900163300001800252520159100270592002801861596014001889650002702029650001602056650002402072650002902096650002102125650002602146650000902172650000902181650002102190650001602211650001402227650001902241650001002260650001802270650001902288650001102307650002002318650002302338651001102361651002502372700002202397700002202419700002002441773010102461856008202562852000902644655001202653IND60676913620221122063158.0191122e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067691362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-019-00374-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarly, Luc10aSeasonality of a Floodplain Subsidy to the Fish Community of a Large Temperate River  ap. 1823-1837.  aThis study examines the temporal and spatial variability of the floodplain trophic contribution to the fish community of Lake Saint-Pierre, a large (≈ 300 km²), shallow (≈ 3 m) widening of the St. Lawrence River (Québec, Canada). We hypothesized that floodplain contribution to fish diet would be maximal during the early growing period following the seasonal flood and at sites located closest to the floodplain. Carbon stable isotope ratios (δ¹³C) of invertebrates and 35 fish species were analyzed at the beginning and at the end of two growing seasons, at increasing distances from the floodplain. Floodplain contribution, in the form of exported aquatic invertebrates, was estimated at the fish community (littoral versus main river), species and individual fish level, using a stable isotopic mixing model and a linear mixed model selection. As hypothesized, fish captured in the early part of the growing season near the floodplain benefitted from the largest floodplain contribution, which decreased during the late growing season. In addition, floodplain contribution differed among fish species, being higher in small or immature littoral species (northern pike, yellow perch, blackchin and golden shiners) than for larger taxa inhabiting the main river channel (shorthead redhorse, white sucker and channel catfish). Our study revealed that floodplain production during the early growing season represents a key food resource to a large portion of the riverine food web, thus highlighting the essential role of the floodplain in human-altered temperate rivers.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCTROI 186430cProgram Strategic Initiatives for Innovation (ISI) from Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies (FRQNT) 3aCatostomus commersonii 3aEsox lucius 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aMoxostoma macrolepidotum 3aPerca flavescens 3aaquatic invertebrates 3adiet 3afish 3afish communities 3afloodplains 3afood webs 3agrowing season 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3aQuebec 3aSaint Lawrence River1 aHudon, Christiane1 aCattaneo, Antonia1 aCabana, Gilbert0 tEcosystems.g2019 Dec., v. 22, no. 8 p.1823-1837dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00374-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245003800165300001600203520067600219592002800895650002100923650001300944650002200957650001100979650001100990650001901001650000901020651001301029651001701042653002801059653001101087653002001098653001901118773010601137856007801243852000901321655001201330IND60479336520221122114642.0160121e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047933652DNAL7 a10.3375/043.036.01172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardner, Harold W.10aSeed Dispersal by Roadside Mowing  ap. 102-104.  aBased on many years of stewardship experience in natural areas in Illinois and Pennsylvania, I discuss the potential for roadside mowing to facilitate the spread of aggressive alien plants.

While multibranched gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as a promising modality in the photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancers, some of the key challenges limiting their clinical translation lie in the need to develop reproducible and cost-effective synthetic methods as well as the selective accumulation of sufficient AuNPs at tumor sites. In this study, we report a simple and direct seed-mediated synthesis of monodispersed multibranched AuNPs using the catechol-containing LAT-1 ligands, L- and D-dopa, to confer active cancer targeting. This route obviates the need for additional conjugation with targeting moieties such as peptides or antibodies. Nanoflower-like AuNPs (AuNF) with diameters of approximately 46, 70, and 90 nm were obtained and were found to possess excellent colloidal stability and biocompatibility. A significantly higher intracellular accumulation of the L- and D-dopa functionalized AuNFs was observed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-453) when compared to the nontargeting control AuNFs synthesized with dopamine and 4-ethylcatechol. Importantly, no significant difference in uptake between the targeting and nontargeting AuNFs was observed in a non-tumorigenic MCF-10A breast epithelial cell line, hence demonstrating tumor selectivity. For PTT of breast cancer, Ag⁺ was introduced during synthesis to obtain L-dopa functionalized nanourchin-like AuNPs (AuNUs) with strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance. The L-dopa functionalized AuNUs mediated selective photothermal ablation of the triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and sensitized the cells to the anticancer drugs cisplatin and docetaxel. This work brings forward an effective strategy for the facile preparation of cancer targeting multibranched AuNPs with potential for the in vivo PTT of breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-dopa 3aabsorbance 3aantibodies 3abiocompatibility 3abiomarkers 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acisplatin 3adopamine 3aepithelial cells 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3amoieties 3ananogold 3apeptides 3asilver 3atherapeutics 3atransporters 0acatechol 0agold nanoparticle 0alarge neutral amino acid transporter-1 0acancer targeting 0aphotothermal1 aChen, Shu1 aNabavi, Elham1 aRegoutz, Anna1 aPayne, David J.1 aElson, Daniel S.1 aDexter, David T.1 aDunlop, Iain E.1 aPorter, Alexandra E.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 9, no. 45 p.39259-39270dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b148513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008300160300001600243520140200259592002801661650001901689650001801708650001201726650001801738650001801756650001201774650001201786650001301798650001101811650001201822650001501834650001701849650000901866650001301875650001301888650001101901653001801912653001801930653001801948653001701966653002501983653002402008773012702032856008302159852000902242655001202251IND60478476820221120202311.0160121e20051001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047847682DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.53.2005.3.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTasi, J.10aHeavy metal, macro- and microelement content of grass species and dicotyledons  ap. 349-352.  aData on the composition of fodder from pastures (grass, meadow-hay) can be frequently found in the literature, but data on the element contents of the grass or non-grass species composing natural grasslands are scarce. In order to analyse the element contents of plants, samples were collected over 3 years (1998-2000) from different types of natural grasslands. On non-fertilised grasslands, the dominant species was <i>Festuca pseudovina</i>. The dominant species on fertilised grasslands was <i>Poa pratensis</i>, with <i>Bromus inermis</i> or <i>Elymus repens</i> being dominant at some sites. The results showed that leguminous plants had the highest contents of four of the five macroelements, while the highest level of K was found in dicotyledonous plants. The Na and Ca contents of the plants were higher on non-fertilised grasslands, while the level of all the other macroelements was higher in plants from fertilised grasslands. Since the Se contents showed a high dispersion, only a trend was observed, indicating that the Se content of grass species is not significantly lower than that of other grassland plants. On non-fertilised grasslands, grass species contained the most Cr and Pb, while leguminous plants contained the most Cd. In fodder from fertilised grasslands, the highest quantity of Cd and Cr was found in grass species, and the most lead in non-leguminous dicotyledons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus inermis 3aElymus repens 3aFestuca 3aMagnoliopsida 3aPoa pratensis 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3aforage 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aheavy metals 3alead 3apastures 3aselenium 3asodium 0agrass species 0agrass species 0agrass species 0adicotyledons 0amacroelement content 0aheavy metal content0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2005 Oct. 1, v. 53, no. 3 p.349-352dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.53.2005.3.123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009700172300001600269520134700285592002801632650002001660650002101680650002301701650001301724650001701737650002001754650002901774650001001803650001601813650001901829650001201848650001201860650001001872650002301882650001501905650001201920650002201932650000901954650001301963650001001976653002901986653001702015653001902032653002502051653002702076700002702103700001902130700002002149700001502169773011702184856005102301852000902352655001202361IND50087182220221119161626.0140412e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008718222DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2013.7940252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatara, Antariksh10aVolatile Constituents and Antimicrobial Activity of Aerial parts of Ocimum gratissimum Linn.  ap. 283-288.  aAromatic compounds in the steam distilled volatile oil obtained from aerial parts of Shrubby basil (Hindi - Ramtulasi), Ocimum gratissimum Linn.

It is thus critical to understand how large-scale disturbances are affecting the overall forest C stocks. C dynamics in North American boreal forest ecosystems are strongly affected by the defoliation and mortality that occurs during a spruce budworm (SBW) outbreak. We used forest inventory geospatial databases, monthly climate data, spatially explicit defoliation sequence data, and the TRIPLEX-Insect model to simulate C dynamics with and without SBW disturbances in stands with different vulnerability to the SBW in the boreal forest of Quebec. Our results showed that SBW defoliation and related mortality decreased the average aboveground biomass and belowground biomass by 5.96% and 6.94% by 2017, respectively. At the same time, 21,046 km² of forest were converted from a C sink to a source. This study provides the first quantitative analysis of the effect of a SBW outbreak on carbon dynamics for three different boreal stand types (that is, fir, spruce, and mixed fir-spruce) at a regional scale. Our results suggested that younger fir forests lost less C than either fir-spruce or spruce forests during SBW attacks between 2007 and 2017 in Quebec. This highlights the importance of considering species composition when assessing vulnerability or resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aPicea 3aaboveground biomass 3abelowground biomass 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3adefoliation 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest inventory 3ameteorological data 3amortality 3aquantitative analysis 3asimulation models 3aspatial data 3aspecies diversity 3aQuebec1 aPeng, Changhui1 aDe Grandpré, Louis1 aCandau, Jean-Noël1 aWork, Timothy1 aHuang, Chunbo1 aKneeshaw, Daniel0 tEcosystems.g2019 Dec., v. 22, no. 8 p.1838-1851dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00377-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245006500166300001400231520145900245592002801704650001601732650002801748650002301776650002801799650001301827650001201840650001101852650002501863650001501888650001901903650001701922650002001939650002101959650002601980650001502006650001102021650002402032650001202056650002102068650002902089653001502118653000802133653000802141653000802149653000802157653000802165653000902173653000802182653000802190653000902198653000802207653000602215653000802221653000802229653000802237653001102245653001102256653000802267653001002275653003602285653002002321653002202341653002602363653002002389700001902409700002302428773008502451856008302536852000902619655001202628IND60083305020221120093456.0161023e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008330502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2013.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xuewen10aDynamic metabolic flux analysis of plant cell wall synthesis  ap. 78-85.  aThe regulation of plant cell wall synthesis pathways remains poorly understood. This has become a bottleneck in designing bioenergy crops. The goal of this study was to analyze the regulation of plant cell wall precursor metabolism using metabolic flux analysis based on dynamic labeling experiments. Arabidopsis T87 cells were cultured heterotrophically with 13C labeled sucrose. The time course of 13C labeling patterns in cell wall precursors and related sugar phosphates was monitored using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry until steady state labeling was reached. A kinetic model based on mass action reaction mechanisms was developed to simulate the carbon flow in the cell wall synthesis network. The kinetic parameters of the model were determined by fitting the model to the labeling time course data, cell wall composition, and synthesis rates. A metabolic control analysis was performed to predict metabolic regulations that may improve plant biomass composition for biofuel production. Our results describe the routes and rates of carbon flow from sucrose to cell wall precursors. We found that sucrose invertase is responsible for the entry of sucrose into metabolism and UDP-glucose-4-epimerase plays a dominant role in UDP-Gal synthesis in heterotrophic Aradidopsis cells under aerobic conditions. We also predicted reactions that exert strong regulatory influence over carbon flow to cell wall synthesis and its composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aUDP-glucose 4-epimerase 3aaerobic conditions 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3acultured cells 3aenergy crops 3afuel production 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3amodels 3areaction mechanisms 3asucrose 3asugar phosphates 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aNDP-sugars 0aApi 0aAra 0aFuc 0aFru 0aGal 0aGalA 0aGDP 0aGlc 0aGlcA 0aMan 0aP 0aRha 0aXyl 0aSuc 0aG(M)1P 0aG(M)6P 0aF6P 0aGal1P 0aDynamic metabolic flux analysis 0aPlant cell wall 0aSucrose invertase 0aMetabolic engineering 0aBioenergy crops1 aAlonso, Ana P.1 aShachar-Hill, Yair0 tMetabolic engineering.g2013 July, v. 18 p.78-85dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245014700164300001200311500001500323520098700338592002801325650001801353650002101371650001301392650003801405650002601443650002801469650001501497653002401512653003301536653002501569653002501594653002201619653002101641700001401662700001601676700001801692700001801710773009301728856008601821852000901907655001201916IND60567125520221118022913.0170710e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056712552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Lu10aDetection of subtle differences in analogous viral capsid proteins by allowing unrestricted specific interaction in solution competition ELISA  ap. 1-4.  a2019-12-06  aAssay artifacts were reported in plate-based immuoassays during the assessment of specific molecular interactions owing to the surface induced aggregation/conformational changes. To circumvent surface adsorption and associated artifacts, we used a solution competition ELISA by allowing unrestricted interaction between binding partners to occur in solution for better discrimination between epitopes with subtle differences. A difference of two orders of magnitude in binding to neutralizing antibodies for two truncated versions of the hepatitis E virus capsid protein was observed, while other assays showed comparable antigenicity with the same monoclonal antibodies. Discrimination of epitopes with high degree resemblance in analogous viral capsid proteins was demonstrated quantitatively based on their specific interactions. Therefore, the solution competition ELISA is a method of choice when the detection of subtle differences of two highly analogous proteins is desired.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoat proteins 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aepitopes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aadsorption 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aAntigen-antibody interaction 0aViral capsid protein 0aSolution interaction 0aHepatitis E virus 0aBinding analysis1 aWang, Xin1 aFang, Mujin1 aXia, Ningshao1 aZhao, Qinjian0 tJournal of virological methods.g2016 Oct., v. 236 p.1-4dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01677naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009500170300001800265520049300283592002800776650001100804650002300815650001400838650002200852650001700874650002900891653001900920653000900939653002500948653002200973653002900995700002201024700001901046700002101065773011201086856008401198852000901282655001201291IND60599485320221120081919.0180702e20140702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059948532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.04.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeildé, Kévin10aFirst single electron transfer reaction on propargylic chloride in 5-nitroimidazole series  ap. 3652-3657.  aWe report here the first example of an SRN1 reaction on propargylic chloride in heterocyclic series.

The production of several secondary metabolites in R55 mutant was significantly improved using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Two antibiotics with antifungal activity, 2, 4-diacetylphloroglucinol (Phl) and pyoluteorin (Plt), which may contribute to the improved antifungal activity of the R55 mutant, were identified by mass spectrometer (MS) analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aPseudomonas protegens 3aantibiotics 3aantifungal properties 3aengineering 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amutants 3amutation 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribosomes 3asecondary metabolites 3aspectrometers 0aPseudomonas protegens 0aRibosome engineering 0aRifampicin resistance 0aSecondary metabolite 0aAntifungal activity1 aLiu, Zhengqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7737-923X1 aZhang, Guoyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5982-494X1 aMo, Xiangtao1 aDing, Xuezhi1 aXia, Liqiu1 aHu, Shengbiao0 tResearch in microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 167, no. 8 p.625-629dElsevier Masson SASaInstitut PasteurwJournal:11932x0923-25087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2016.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008200175300001400257520159800271592002801869650002301897650001501920650001401935650002301949650001201972650001201984650001301996650002102009650002202030650002902052650001702081650001602098650001002114650001702124650001502141650001302156650001202169653001602181653002202197653003402219653001502253700002302268700002202291700001902313773009602332856008602428852000902514655001202523IND60525796020221120220538.0190319e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052579602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcias-Bonet, Neus10aNitrogen-fixing bacteria in Mediterranean seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) roots  ap. 57-60.  aBiological nitrogen fixation by diazotrophic bacteria in seagrass rhizosphere and leaf epiphytic community is an important source of nitrogen required for plant growth. However, the presence of endophytic diazotrophs remains unclear in seagrass tissues. Here, we assess the presence, diversity and taxonomy of nitrogen-fixing bacteria within surface-sterilized roots of Posidonia oceanica. Moreover, we analyze the nitrogen isotopic signature of seagrass tissues in order to notice atmospheric nitrogen fixation. We detected nitrogen-fixing bacteria by nifH gene amplification in 13 out of the 78 roots sampled, corresponding to 9 locations out of 26 meadows. We detected two different types of bacterial nifH sequences associated with P. oceanica roots, which were closely related to sequences previously isolated from the rhizosphere of a salt marsh cord grass and a putative anaerobe. Nitrogen content of seagrass tissues showed low isotopic signatures in all the sampled meadows, pointing out the atmospheric origin of the assimilated nitrogen by seagrasses. However, this was not related with the presence of endophytic nitrogen fixers, suggesting the nitrogen fixation occurring in rhizosphere and in the epiphytic community could be an important source of nitrogen for P. oceanica. The low diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria reported here suggests species-specific relationships between diazotrophs and P. oceanica, revealing possible symbiotic interactions that could play a major role in nitrogen acquisition by seagrasses in oligotrophic environments where they form lush meadows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aendophytes 3aepiphytes 3agene amplification 3agrasses 3ameadows 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asalt marshes 3aseagrasses 3ataxonomy 3atissues 0aDiazotrophy 0aNitrogen fixation 0aSeagrass-bacteria interaction 0aEndophytes1 aArrieta, Jesús M.1 aDuarte, Carlos M.1 aMarbà, Núria0 tAquatic botany.g2016 May, v. 131 p.57-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03747naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245012400175300001600299520179500315592002802110650002202138650002002160650002402180650002002204650001902224650001802243650001902261650001902280650001102299650001102310650002002321650001002341650001602351650001002367650000902377650001002386650006502396650001502461650001402476650002802490650006402518650003902582650005002621650006602671650001202737650006402749650004202813650002002855651001102875651001102886700001902897700002002916700002102936773011302957856004203070852000903112655001203121IND4470013320221121152025.0120502e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447001332DNAL7 a225233482pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.11002352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Lihong10aVariation in intra-annual wood formation, and foliage and shoot development of three major Canadian boreal tree species  ap. 827-837.  a• Premise of the study: In a warming climate, boreal trees may have adjusted their growth strategy (e.g., onset and coordination of growth among different organs such as stem, shoot, and foliage, within and among species) to cope with the extended growing seasons. A detailed investigation into growth of different organs during a growing season may help us assess the potential effects of climate change on tree growth in the boreal forest. • METHODS: The intra-annual growth of stem xylem, shoot tips, and foliage area of Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides, and Betula papyrifera was monitored in a boreal forest in Quebec, Canada during the growing season of 2007. Xylem formation was measured at weekly intervals, and shoot elongation and foliage expansion were measured three times per week from May to September. Growth indices for stem, shoot, and foliage were calculated and used to identify any climate–growth dependence. • Key results: The time periods required for stem growth, branch extension, and foliage expansion differed among species. Of the three species, P. banksiana had the earliest budburst (20 May) yet the latest completion date of the foliage growth (2 August); P. tremuloides had the latest budburst (27 May) yet the earliest completion date of the foliage growth (10 July). Air temperature positively affected shoot extension growth of all three species. Precipitation positively influenced stem growth of the two broadleaf species, whereas growing season temperature positively impacted stem growth of P. banksiana. • CONCLUSION: The results show that both the timing of growth processes and environmental dependences differ among co-occurring species, thereby leading to different adaptive capability of these boreal tree species to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula papyrifera 3aPinus banksiana 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aair temperature 3aboreal forests 3aforest growth 3aglobal warming 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3ashoots 3astem elongation 3astems 3atree growth 3atrees 3awood 3axylem 2aBetulaxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aCell Count 2aEcosystem 2aMeteorological Concepts 2aPinusxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aPlant Shootsxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aPopulusxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aSeasons 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aWoodxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aXylemxcytology 3aQuebec 0aCanada1 aBergeron, Yves1 aHuang, Jian-Guo1 aBerninger, Frank0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2012 May, v. 99, no. 5 p.827-837dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1100235  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012800176300001400304520162800318592002801946650002601974650002502000650001702025650002802042650002102070650002502091650001302116650001602129650001802145650002702163650001802190650002002208650001702228650003002245650002302275650002202298650001002320650001002330650002302340650001502363650004302378650001202421650000902433650001902442650002802461650001702489653002102506653001202527653002302539653002702562653001102589653003702600653001902637653000802656653000802664653000602672653000702678653000602685653000702691653000902698700001902707700002202726773010002748856008502848852000902933655001202942IND60623605420221120143539.0190326e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062360542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2018.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhandarkar, Nikhil S.10aChlorogenic acid attenuates high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet–induced cardiovascular, liver, and metabolic changes in rats  ap. 78-88.  aChlorogenic acid as a constituent of coffee is consumed regularly in the human diet. Chlorogenic acid intake has been associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that chlorogenic acid would improve cardiovascular, liver, and metabolic responses in a rat model of metabolic syndrome induced by a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Male Wistar rats (8-9 weeks old, 335 ± 2 g, n = 48) were divided into 4 groups and fed with corn starch diet (16 weeks); corn starch diet with chlorogenic acid in food for the last 8 weeks; high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (16 weeks); or high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet with chlorogenic acid (~100 mg/kg/d) in food for the last 8 weeks. In high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet–fed rats, chlorogenic acid reduced energy intake and food efficiency to reduce visceral fat, especially retroperitoneal fat, and abdominal circumference; reversed the elevated systolic blood pressure; and attenuated left ventricular diastolic stiffness with reduced collagen deposition and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the left ventricle. Chlorogenic acid decreased inflammation and fat deposition in the liver along with reduced plasma liver enzyme activities of obese rats but did not change the plasma lipid profile. Chlorogenic acid increased diversity of gut microbiota, which may improve overall metabolism in the body. Thus, chronic dietary chlorogenic acid attenuated diet-induced inflammation as well as cardiovascular, liver, and metabolic changes, suggesting that chlorogenic acid has potential for further clinical evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood lipids 3acardiovascular diseases 3achlorogenic acid 3aclinical examination 3acollagen 3acorn starch 3aenergy intake 3ahigh carbohydrate diet 3ahigh fat diet 3ahuman nutrition 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alaboratory animals 3alipid composition 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3arats 3arisk reduction 3asystolic blood pressure 3avisceral fat 0aChlorogenic acid 0aObesity 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aCardiovascular disease 0aCoffee 0aHigh-carbohydrate, high-fat diet 0aGut microbiota 0aALT 0aAST 0aC 0aCC 0aH 0aHC 0aNEFA1 aBrown, Lindsay1 aPanchal, Sunil K.0 tNutrition research.g2019 Feb., v. 62 p.78-88dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2018.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014400168300001600312520114100328592002801469650001301497650001101510650002001521650002201541650001901563650001301582650001701595650002001612650002301632650002201655650001801677650002001695650002201715650001101737650001601748650001101764651001001775700002301785700002001808700002301828773017001851856008402021852000902105655001202114IND60479337020221122052440.0160429e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047933702DNAL7 a10.1894/SWNAT-D-14-00022.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeaver, Sara P.10aBaseline population estimates and microclimate data for newly established overwintering Brazilian free-tailed bat colonies in central Texas  ap. 151-157.  aBehavioral changes of migratory species have been globally documented in recent decades. However, there is a paucity of research on changes in migratory bat species. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) roost in central Texas from March to November. These bats have historically migrated south in late fall, leaving summer roosts unoccupied during winter. Recently, overwintering populations have been discovered in central Texas. The objectives of our study were to determine presence or absence of overwintering free-tailed bats at six known summer roosts, obtain baseline population estimates, and evaluate microclimates of roosts during winters of 2010–2011 and 2011–2012. We used data loggers to monitor temperature and humidity hourly. We estimated population sizes with digital images using ImageJ software, previously established roosting densities, or both. Our results indicated that occupied roosts were colder, had less stable temperatures, and had a stronger correlation between internal and external temperatures vs. unoccupied roosts. Population sizes increased at all occupied roosts from 2010 to 2011.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTadarida 3aautumn 3abehavior change 3acomputer software 3adigital images 3ahumidity 3amicroclimate 3amicroprocessors 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3aoverwintering 3apopulation size 3aroosting behavior 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aTexas1 aSimpson, Thomas R.1 aBaccus, John T.1 aWeckerly, Floyd W.0 tSouthwestern naturalist.g2015 June, v. 60, no. 2-3 p.151-157dThe Southwestern Association of Naturalists Southern Illinois University Edwardsvillex1943-62627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1894%2FSWNAT-D-14-00022.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009100208300001800299520171300317592002802030596004402058650002602102650002102128650002002149650001202169650000902181650001702190650001302207650001402220650001102234650000902245650002402254650001402278700002802292700002202320700002002342700002102362773010102383856008202484852000902566655001202575IND60676913920221122063144.0191122e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067691392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-019-00382-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaillie, Paul J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7172-358910aDecadal-Scale Vegetation Change Driven by Salinity at Leading Edge of Rising Sea Level  ap. 1918-1930.  aAs sea levels rise, low-lying coastal forests increasingly are subject to stressors such as inundation and saltwater exposure. At long timescales (for example, centuries), the extent of inundation and saltwater exposure will increase; however, on a decadal timescale, the role of these drivers may differ in both magnitude and direction. To investigate the drivers of decadal-scale vegetation change, we measured the changes in five metrics of vegetation composition and structure between 2003/2004 and 2016/2017 at 98 plots distributed across a vegetation gradient from coastal forest to brackish marshes (< 0.5–18 ppt). We used elevation as a proxy of inundation vulnerability and soil sodium concentration as a proxy of saltwater exposure, and we investigated relationships between these two variables and the change in vegetation conditions between the two sampling periods. Soil sodium concentration was a significant predictor of vegetation change for all five vegetation metrics, whereas the effect of elevation was not significant for any of the metrics. The one site that was affected by wildfire twice during the duration of the study shifted almost completely from forest to marsh with limited regeneration of woody vegetation observed in 2016/2017. Our results show that salinization in our system is a more important driver of vegetation change than inundation potential. Furthermore, the effects of drought-induced salinization could be amplified by the elevated risk of wildfire during droughts. Forecasting the response of coastal wetlands to rising sea levels will require a better understanding of the individual and combined effects of salinity, droughts, and wildfires on vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data  a769393cNorth Carolina State University 3abotanical composition 3abrackish marshes 3acoastal forests 3adrought 3arisk 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asea level 3asodium 3asoil 3avegetation gradient 3awildfires1 aMoorman, Christopher E.1 aPoulter, Benjamin1 aArdón, Marcelo1 aEmanuel, Ryan E.0 tEcosystems.g2019 Dec., v. 22, no. 8 p.1918-1930dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00382-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245018200163300002000345520106800365592002801433650001501461650001401476650001201490650002601502650002201528650001301550650001901563650001401582650002001596650003401616650001201650650001101662650002101673650001301694650001101707700001701718700005401735700001101789700001301800700005401813700005701867773017301924856008002097852000902177655001202186IND60650860120221120222732.0190710e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065086012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b064812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Cuilan10aGas-Phase Epoxidation of Propylene with Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor: Effect of Modification with NaOH on TS-1 Titanosilicate Catalyst in the Presence of Tetra-propylammonium Bromide  ap. 11739-11749.  aThis study was related to a solvent-free gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with H₂O₂ vapor to synthesize propylene oxide (G-HPPO). Focus was given to the hydrothermal modification of TS-1 with NaOH–TPABr. Results showed that properly modified TS-1 exhibited 1.70 kgPO kgTS₋₁–¹ h–¹ propylene oxide productivity, 93.6% PO selectivity, and 12.9% propene conversion. More than 60 wt % H₂O₂ utility were achieved with a 4.7 propylene/H₂O₂ molar ratio. Catalyst characterizations indicated that considerable amount sodium ions were introduced into the modified TS-1. The infrared absorption feature of framework Ti was shifted to higher wavenumbers. The blueshift and the NH₄⁺-exchange experiment suggested that the modification changed the local environment of framework Ti by transforming them into “open” sites which had titanium hydroxyl groups and sodium ions on their neighboring silicon hydroxyls as counter cations. Unlike liquid-phase epoxidation, G-HPPO can be significantly benefit by the presence of the sodium ions in TS-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acatalysts 3acations 3aepoxidation reactions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amoieties 3aprocess design 3apropylene 3apropylene oxide 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asilicon 3asodium 3asodium hydroxide 3atitanium 3avapors1 aZhu, Quanren1 aYi, Yanhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5869-93821 aSu, Ji1 aHe, Ning1 aLiu, Jiaxu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0815-39791 aGuo, Hongchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8843-61990 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 June 18, v. 58, no. 27 p.11739-11749dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b064813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008800157300001800245520170300263592002801966650001201994650001402006650001302020650001202033650001802045650002602063650001402089650001302103650001102116700001202127700001602139773010402155856007502259852000902334655001202343IND60534012220221116185721.0160802e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053401222DNAL7 a10.1021/ef300606v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Junhua10aEfficient Production of Furan Derivatives from a Sugar Mixture by Catalytic Process  ap. 4560-4567.  aWe present here the results of an investigation aimed at identifying catalysts for the dehydration of glucose and xylose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural in a diphasic reaction system, and the subsequent conversion of HMF and furfural to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and 2-methyl furan (MF) was also investigated. For the dehydration of glucose and xylose mixture, a series of SO₄²–/ZrO₂–TiO₂ solid acid catalysts were prepared by precipitation and impregnation method. Effects of various reaction parameters and catalyst reuse cycle toward the reaction performance were studied. Experimental results indicated that the product yield could reach 30.9 mol % (for HMF) and 54.3 mol % (for furfural) under the optimal experimental conditions. The SO₄²–/ZrO₂–TiO₂ catalyst is recoverable from the resulting product mixture and reused multiple times after calcination without any substantial change on the HMF and furfural yield. Furthermore, effects of various hydrogenation parameters of HMF and furfural in n-butanol promoted by carbon-supported ruthenium (Ru/C) were discussed, and the highest yield could reach 60.3 mol % (for DMF) and 61.9 mol % (for MF) under the optimal experimental conditions by starting with HMF and furfural in pure n-butanol, but the target products of DMF and MF could not be detected when directly used by the separated organic phase as solvent and substrate. However, the DMF and MF yield could reach 32.7 and 17.5 mol %, respectively, when the separated organic phase undergoes a further purification, which indicated that the purification of the organic phase is a key step for the further hydrogenation of HMF and furfural to DMF and MF.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanol 3acatalysts 3afurfural 3aglucose 3ahydrogenation 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aruthenium 3asolvents 3axylose1 aLin, Lu1 aLiu, Shijie0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4560-4567dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef300606v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013400164300001800298520112100316592002801437650001201465650001201477650001101489650002001500650001701520650001801537650000901555650001501564650000901579650001801588700001301606700001601619773010101635856004801736852000901784655001201793IND4483833420221118061442.0120508e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448383342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5115-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPing, JianFeng10aDetermination of trace heavy metals in milk using an ionic liquid and bismuth oxide nanoparticles modified carbon paste electrode  ap. 1781-1787.  aA novel carbon composite electrode modified with bismuth oxide nanoparticles and the ionic liquid n-octylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate was fabricated and used to simultaneously determine cadmium and lead levels using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry.

Compared with the traditional binder based composite electrode, our electrode exhibited well-defined and separate stripping voltammetric peaks for cadmium and lead. Furthermore, the antifouling capacity of the bismuth film electrode was significantly improved by the ionic liquid. Under optimized conditions, the linear range of the composite electrode was from 3.0 to 30.0 Î¼g Lâ1 for both metal ions with a detection limit of 0.15 Î¼g Lâ1 for cadmium and 0.21 Î¼g Lâ1 for lead.

The characters examined were individual plant production (total mass of the ears on a single plant), thousand-kernel mass, number of kernel rows, ear length, number of kernels per row, shelling % and the assimilating leaf area above the main ear. Among these yield components, the individual plant production, the ear length, the number of kernels per row and the grain-cob ratio (shelling %) were influenced to the greatest extent by the year, followed by the variety and the location. The greatest average yield was achieved by the tested hybrids at all five locations in 1997 (263 g/plant). The average yields in 1998 and 1999 were significantly lower (221 and 203 g/plant, respectively). The outstanding yields achieved in 1997 could be attributed to the favourable ecological conditions, which led to the development of secondary ears in Keszthely and Sopronhorpács. At the other three locations there was only one ear per plant, but these ears were longer than in the following years. The greatest year effect was recorded in Sopronhorpács, where the individual plant production amounted to 305 g/plant in 1997 and 238 g/plant in the worst year, 1999. In Gyöngyös conditions were very dry in all three years, so the year effect was least pronounced at this location (grand mean of 195 g/plant in 1997 and 201 g/plant in 1999). Stability analysis was carried out using the coefficient of variance for individual plant production. Hybrids Mv 3, Mv 5, Mv 9 and Mv 12 were found to have the best adaptability. The shelling % was not significantly influenced by the location; the grain-cob ratio is relatively stable for maize hybrids. A correlation was found between the individual plant production and the leaf area above the main ear (R<sup>2</sup>=0.658). Hybrids with the largest leaf area above the main ear also had the greatest ear mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3ahybrids 3aleaf area 3aseeds 3ashelling 3avariance 3ayield components 3aHungary 0amaize hybrid 0amaize hybrid 0amaize hybrid 0ayield 0ayield components 0ayear effect 0alocation effect 0aassimilating leaf area1 aSpitkó, T.1 aPintér, J.,0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2005 Oct. 1, v. 53, no. 3 p.251-259dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.53.2005.3.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007000156300001800226520104200244592002801286650002101314650002201335650001801357650001901375650001601394650001401410650001101424700001801435700001901453773010401472856007501576852000901651655001201660IND60534012320221116185551.0160802e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053401232DNAL7 a10.1021/ef300607z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenshan10aRate Equation Theory for the Carbonation Reaction of CaO with CO2  ap. 4607-4616.  aRate equation theory for CaO carbonation reaction was developed to replace the assumption of critical product layer thickness with a complete calculation of the rates of CaCO₃ nucleation and growth. The model includes rate expressions for the island size distribution function with time evolution, and the surface reaction, surface diffusion, grain boundary and lattice diffusion, and Ostwald ripening were considered in this theory to describe CaCO₃ product islands growing on the CaO surface. The macroscopic behavior of a gas–solid reaction can be calculated with the island size distribution. The carbonation reaction of CaO with CO₂ including both early islands growth stage and later product layer diffusion stage was calculated with the developed theory and was validated with experimental data, and the relative importance of some elementary steps was discussed.

The flaw in this logic is that the uptake of greenhouse gases by an ecosystem has the effect of reducing the pool of bulk atmospheric greenhouse gases and, consequently, lowering the decay rate of those gases. This violates our implicit assumption that the pool of bulk atmospheric greenhouse gases is in steady state and not affected by the ecosystem. To account for this, the e⁽⁻ ᵈᵗ/τ⁾ term needs to remain in the model, with the result that the exact same equation is used when an ecosystem exhibits sustained greenhouse gas emissions or uptake.

Salvianic acid A was traditionally isolated from plant root or synthesized by chemical methods, both of which had low efficiency. Herein, we developed an unprecedented artificial biosynthetic pathway of salvianic acid A in E. coli, enabling its production from glucose directly. In this pathway, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate was converted to salvianic acid A via D-lactate dehydrogenase (encoding by d-ldh from Lactobacillus pentosus) and hydroxylase complex (encoding by hpaBC from E. coli). Furthermore, we optimized the pathway by a modular engineering approach and deleting genes involved in the regulatory and competing pathways. The metabolically engineered E. coli strain achieved high productivity of salvianic acid A (7.1g/L) with a yield of 0.47mol/mol glucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus pentosus 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3aantioxidant activity 3abiochemical pathways 3acardiovascular diseases 3agenes 3aglucose 3ametabolic engineering 3atyrosine 0aSalvianic acid A 0aMetabolic engineering 0aD-lactate dehydrogenase 0ahpaBC 0aEscherichia coli1 aWang, Chang-Song1 aQiao, Jianjun1 aZhao, Guang-Rong0 tMetabolic engineering.g2013 Sept., v. 19 p.79-87dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2013.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01118naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010900157300001400266500002000280520020800300592002800508650001100536650002900547650002000576700001800596773014300614856007400757852000900831655001200840IND60786597720221120103319.0220804e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078659772DNAL7 a10.1002/awwa.10012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Juneseok10aSustainability Strategies at the Water–Energy Nexus: Renewable Energy and Decentralized Infrastructure  ap. 32-39.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWith a global focus on incorporating renewable energies into existing water infrastructure, the water industry has established important strategies to conserve water and energy for future sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3arenewable energy sources 3awater utilities1 aYounos, Tamim0 tJournal of the American Water Works Association.g2018 Feb., v. 110, no. 2 p.32-39dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27674x0003-150X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/awwa.10013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008800164300001800252520099000270592002801260650002101288650001701309650001401326650001001340650001601350650001701366650001501383650001801398650001901416650001401435650001301449650002301462650001801485653002401503653001401527653002001541653001801561653002101579700005501600700002001655700001301675700001501688700001901703700005601722700005701778773014401835856008501979852000902064655001202073IND60696455720221121071216.0200526e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645572DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c001252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei10aBacterial Cellulose-Based Composite Scaffolds for Biomedical Applications: A Review  ap. 7536-7562.  aBacterial cellulose (BC), with non-toxicity, high purity, and biocompatibility, has been considered as a versatile candidate for various biomedical applications. Recently, the fabrication of BC-based composite scaffolds compounded with other ingredients such as nanoparticles and polymers has received extensive investigation, which enabled the development of numerous promising biomedical products. Additionally, BC-derived nanocrystals (BCNCs) and nanofibrils (BCNFs) have proven to be promising reinforcing agents in a variety of polymeric scaffolds for biomedical applications. In this review, we summarize recent preparation strategies for BC-based and BCNCs- and BCNFs-containing composite scaffolds and their advances in biomedical applications, including wound healing, tissue engineering, and drug delivery, as well as tumor cell culture and cancer treatment. Finally, we present challenges and future perspectives for BC-based composite scaffolds for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acell culture 3acellulose 3adrugs 3aingredients 3ananocrystals 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolymers 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 0aBacterial cellulose 0aScaffolds 0aWound dressings 0aDrug delivery 0aCancer treatment1 aDu, Haishun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8046-03191 aZhang, Miaomiao1 aLiu, Kun1 aLiu, Huayu1 aXie, Hongxiang1 aZhang, Xinyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3830-40961 aSi, Chuanling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1630-78000 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Apr. 30, v. 8, no. 20 p.7536-7562dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c001253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009900173520096000272592002801232650001401260650002601274650000801300650001001308650001101318650001501329650001801344650001801362700002101380700002101401700002201422700002401444700002201468700002601490700002001516773012801536856008701664852000901751655001201760IND60768431620221120184538.0220225e20220208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076843162DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100203962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMornico, Damien 10aRNA Sequencing Reveals Widespread Transcription of Natural Antisense RNAs in Entamoeba Species  aEntamoeba is a genus of Amoebozoa that includes the intestine-colonizing pathogenic species Entamoeba histolytica. To understand the basis of gene regulation in E. histolytica from an evolutionary perspective, we have profiled the transcriptomes of its closely related species E. dispar, E. moshkovskii and E. invadens. Genome-wide identification of transcription start sites (TSS) and polyadenylation sites (PAS) revealed the similarities and differences of their gene regulatory sequences. In particular, we found the widespread initiation of antisense transcription from within the gene coding sequences is a common feature among all Entamoeba species. Interestingly, we observed the enrichment of antisense transcription in genes involved in several processes that are common to species infecting the human intestine, e.g., the metabolism of phospholipids. These results suggest a potentially conserved and compact gene regulatory system in Entamoeba.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmoebozoa 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aRNA 3agenes 3ahumans 3aintestines 3aphospholipids 3atranscriptome1 aHon, Chung-Chau 1 aKoutero, Mikael 1 aWeber, Christian 1 aCoppée, Jean-Yves 1 aClark, C.

Twenty‐four weaned piglets with an average body weight (BW) of 6.89 ± 0.15 kg were divided into four diets for 28 days. The treatments were basal diet (control), basal diet supplemented with antibiotic (20 mg/kg colistin sulphate and 40 mg/kg bacitracin zinc, AT), probiotics (400 mg/kg Bacillus coagulans ≥5 × 109 CFU/g, BC) or yeast hydrolysate (5000 mg/kg yeast hydrolysate, YH). Average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were improved by AT and YH diets (p < 0.05), while BC diet only increased ADG (p < 0.05). The complement 3 (C3), lysozyme (LZM) and tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) concentrations in serum were increased in BC diet (p < 0.05). Feeding AT and YH caused the increase of jejunal villus height (p < 0.05), and a higher ratio of villus height/crypt depth was observed in AT, BC and YH groups (p < 0.05). The mRNA expression of zonula occludens‐1 (ZO‐1) in jejunal mucosa was up‐regulated by AT, BC and YH diets (p < 0.05). Dietary AT, BC or YH inclusion decreased the interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) concentration and TNF‐α mRNA expression (p < 0.05), and YH supplementation even down‐regulated toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14 expressions (p < 0.05). In summary, the dietary administration of BC or YH both improves growth performance through promoting the intestinal barrier function, indicating both of them can serve as potential alternatives to antibiotics growth promoters for the piglet production.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0500605cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aBacillus coagulans 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aanimal physiology 3aaverage daily gain 3abacitracin 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acolistin 3acomplement 3adiet 3afeed intake 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3ahydrolysates 3aimmune response 3ajejunum 3alysozyme 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3apiglets 3aprobiotics 3avilli 3ayeasts 3azinc1 aLiang, Chan1 aChen, Daiwen1 aYan, Hui1 aTian, Gang1 aZheng, Ping1 aHe, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1963-97661 aYu, Jie1 aMao, Xiangbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6292-77471 aHuang, Zhiqing1 aLuo, Yuheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4241-80531 aLuo, Junqiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1024-18661 aYu, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6605-67420 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2021 Sept., v. 105, no. 5 p.898-907dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.135293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013000174520128900304592002801593650002901621650001501650650001401665650003401679650001701713650001501730650001301745650001101758653001501769653003101784653002201815653002401837700001701861700003001878700001601908773009801924856008702022852000902109655001202118IND60755850120221119194948.0211206e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075585012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerahtia, Seydali10aOptimal techno-economic energy management strategy for building’s microgrids based bald eagle search optimization algorithm  aThis research proposes an effective energy management strategy (EMS) for the economic operation under standalone and grid-connected operating modes of integrated solar renewables microgrid. The proposed microgrid is composed of a photovoltaic generator (PV), a fuel cell system (FC), and a battery storage system. The random nature of the renewable and the load power imposed some stability problems and economic problems, including operating costs. The suggested technique was based on the bald eagle search optimization algorithm (BES), which was designed for a one-day scheduling horizon. The key objectives of this paper were to satisfy the load power with the lowest operating costs under a stable direct current (DC) bus voltage, enhance the overall system efficiency and protect the battery from deep discharge and overcharge. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, the obtained results were compared with other optimizers, including particle swarm optimization (PSO), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), artificial eco-system optimizer (AEO), COOT optimizer, and political optimizer (PO). The comparison confirmed the superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of minimum operating energy cost (0.1577c€/kW), high efficiency (87.395%) and final SoC (33.268%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliaeetus leucocephalus 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3aelectric potential difference 3aenergy costs 3afuel cells 3apolitics 3aswarms 0aMicrogrids 0aEnergy management strategy 0aEnergy efficiency 0aModern optimization1 aRezk, Hegazy1 aAbdelkareem, Mohammad Ali1 aOlabi, A.G.0 tApplied energy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 306 p.118069-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04369naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100003100197245013600228506007600364520226100440592002802701506003702729650001802766650002602784650002102810650002402831650001702855650001602872650002002888650001802908650002602926650001202952650001502964650000902979650003002988650002003018650002603038650001403064650001403078650001803092650001903110650001603129650001603145650002403161650001203185650001403197650003603211653001003247653001803257653001703275653002703292653002203319653001203341700001303353700003003366700001903396700001803415700002203433700002303455773009303478856009103571852000903662655001203671IND60674148020221207095543.0200128e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067414802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1195582doi7 aPMC68708772pmcid7 a316548722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijayaraghavalu, Sivakumar10aSynergistic combination treatment to break cross talk between cancer cells and bone cells to inhibit progression of bone metastasis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdvanced-stage cancers often metastasize to bone, and is the major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Due to poor biodistribution of intravenously administered anticancer drugs within the bone, chemotherapy is not optimally effective in treating bone metastasis. Additionally, overexpression of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in the bone microenvironment drives the vicious, destructive cycle of progression of bone metastasis and bone resorption. We hypothesized that the combination treatment — with docetaxel (TXT), an anticancer drug encapsulated in sustained release biodegradable nanoparticles (TXT-NPs) that are designed to localize in bone marrow, and denosumab monoclonal antibody (DNmb), which binds to RANKL — could be more effective than either treatment alone. We tested our hypothesis in intraosseous prostate cancer (PC-3) cell-induced osteolytic mouse model of bone metastasis with treatments given intravenously. The results demonstrated better efficacy with TXT-NPs than with TXT-CrEL or saline control in inhibiting progression of metastasis and improving survival. TXT-NPs showed ~3-fold higher drug levels in metastasized bone tissue at 1 wk post-administration than TXT-CrEL, thus explaining their efficacy. However, the combination treatment (TXT-NPs + DNmb) given simultaneously was significantly more effective in inhibiting metastatic progression; it caused early tumor regression and improved survival, and caused no body weight loss or tumor relapse, even when the treatment was discontinued, whereas TXT-NPs or DNmb alone treatments showed tumor relapse after an initial regression. Micro-CT analysis of the bone from the combination treatment showed no bone loss and normal bone mineral content, bone density, and bone volume fraction, whereas TXT-NPs or DNmb alone treatments showed bone loss. Confirming the above results, histochemical analysis of the bone from the combination treatment demonstrated normal bone morphology, and osteoblast and osteoclast cell activities. In conclusion, TXT-NPs and DNmb in combination, because of their complementary roles in breaking the cross talk between cancer cells and bone cells, was significantly effective in treating bone metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiodegradability 3abody weight changes 3abone density 3abone marrow 3abone resorption 3aencapsulation 3aintravenous injection 3aligands 3ametastasis 3amice 3amicro-computed tomography 3amineral content 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amorbidity 3amortality 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arelapse 3aremission 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aTumor 0aDrug delivery 0aNanocarriers 0aBiodegradable polymers 0aSustained release 0aImaging1 aGao, Yue1 aRahman, Mohammed Tanjimur1 aRozic, Richard1 aSharifi, Nima1 aMidura, Ronald J.1 aLabhasetwar, Vinod0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Jan., v. 227 p.119558-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1195583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013700154300001800291520118400309592002801493650004401521650002301565650001201588650002201600650004401622650001801666650001501684650001901699650001101718650003401729700002201763773014101785856007401926852000902000655001202009IND60670482520221117220839.0191002e20130806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067048252DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta11728f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Jian10aDesign and synthesis of a fluoro-silane amine monomer for novel thin film composite membranes to dehydrate ethanol via pervaporation  ap. 9814-9826.  aA novel hybrid organic–inorganic amine monomer has been designed and synthesized to prepare thin film composite (TFC) membranes for ethanol dehydration via pervaporation. Different from the conventional amine monomer, m-phenylenediamine (MPD), used for interfacial polymerization, the new monomer was molecularly designed to sandwich an inorganic component nonafluorohexylmethyldichloro silane (ClSi) between two MPD molecules. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry were used to characterize and verify the chemical structures of the new monomer and the polyamide film. As a result, the advantages of polymeric and inorganic materials are effectively integrated in the newly developed TFC membranes, and these membranes exhibit a superior pervaporation separation performance as compared to most reported membranes in the literature for ethanol dehydration. Their best pervaporation performance shows a flux of 1.9 kg m⁻² h⁻¹ and a separation factor of 108 for the dehydration of the 85/15 wt% ethanol–water mixture at 50 °C. These novel TFC membranes show great potential to compete with commercially available membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical structure 3aethanol 3afilms (materials) 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apervaporation 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3asilane 3athin film composite membranes1 aChung, Tai-shung,0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Aug. 6, v. 1, no. 34 p.9814-9826dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta11728f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008300177300001800260520157300278592002801851650002201879650002101901650002401922650002901946650001301975650001201988650002202000650000902022650001202031650001702043650001502060650001102075650001302086650002702099650002502126650002302151653003102174653001902205653002702224700006702251700006802318700007102386700002702457700006002484700006602544700003402610700006002644700006202704700002202766700006202788700005902850773014302909856008503052852000903137655001203146IND60696455820221121071239.0200526e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645582DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c002012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeyedpour, S.

In this study, we investigate the effect of organic ligands on the antibacterial and structural properties of silver-based metal–azolate frameworks (Ag-MAFs). Three new Ag-MAFs were synthesized with silver, as the metal center, and imidazole-based linkers having different chemistries via a facile and environmentally friendly method conducted at room temperature. The coordination of silver ions with the linkers resulted in the formation of Ag-imidazole, Ag-2 methylimidazole, and Ag-benzimidazole complexes with octahedral, hexagonal nanosheet, and nanoribbon morphologies, respectively. The Ag-MAFs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity (up to 95% die-off of bacteria at a short exposure time of 3 h) in colloidal forms against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) because of synergetic effects of silver and the imidazole-based linkers. Ag-2 methylimidazole showed the highest antibacterial activity, owing to its high silver concentration and special nanocrystal structure that provides better contact with bacteria. This work indicates that the antibacterial activity of Ag-MAF nanostructures can be tailored by changing the organic linker, allowing for creating nanostructures with desired biocidal properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aambient temperature 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3adie-off 3aexposure duration 3aions 3aligands 3ananocrystals 3ananosheets 3asilver 3asolvents 3asustainable technology 3awastewater treatment 3awater purification 0ametal−azolate frameworks 0ananostructures 0aantibacterial activity1 aArabi Shamsabadi, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9726-24661 aKhoshhal Salestan, Saeed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6426-83891 aDadashi Firouzjaei, Mostafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0215-82101 aSharifian Gh, Mohammad1 aRahimpour, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1511-27611 aAkbari Afkhami, Farhad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5977-84801 aShirzad Kebria, Mohammad Reza1 aElliott, Mark A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7835-06121 aTiraferri, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9859-13281 aSangermano, Marco1 aEsfahani, Milad R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6530-43101 aSoroush, Masoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4879-50980 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 May 01, v. 8, no. 20 p.7588-7599dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c002013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245009000168300001600258520136200274592002801636650002101664650002701685650002801712650002401740650001101764650002001775650001401795650001701809650001601826650001701842653003101859700002201890700002101912773010201933856008102035852000902116655001202125IND4461646120221121180943.0151127e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446164612DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-10-00142.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlessner, Michael L.10aQuantification of Warm-Season Turfgrass Injury from Triclopyr and Aminocyclopyrachlor  ap. 367-373.  aSynthetic auxin herbicides are widely used because of their effective control of broadleaf weeds and safety in many turfgrass species. However, two synthetic auxin herbicides, triclopyr and aminocyclopyrachlor (AMCP; DPX-KJM44), are known to injure warm-season turfgrasses. Our objective was to quantify this injury through evaluations of turfgrass quality and turfgrass green cover in response to herbicide treatment. The results of this study indicate that relative to the labeled use rates of triclopyr (0.56 to 1.12 kg ae ha⁻¹) and AMCP (0.053 kg ai ha⁻¹), zoysiagrass is the only turfgrass tested with sufficient tolerance to the respective compounds for their use as weed-control agents. Bermudagrass and centipedegrass may be injured by triclopyr and AMCP at labeled rates, characterized by a reduction in turfgrass quality and green cover. St. Augustinegrass is not tolerant of either triclopyr or AMCP at labeled rates.Nomenclature: Aminocyclopyrachlor-methyl, DPX-KJM44; triclopyr; centipedegrass, Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack.; hybrid bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon (L.)

Subsequently, the photovoltaic thermal heat pump system engineering was designed and constructed, and then the performance study of system heating in continuous operation and stage operation in winter was carried out in January 2021. During the system operation, the average coefficient of heating performance of the system was 2.95 in daytime stage operating, 2.55 in nighttime stage operating and 2.07 in continuous operating. To conduct the application simulation of photovoltaic thermal heat pump system, first the prediction model of system heating performance based on back propagation neural network was established and verified according to the operational parameters, then 12 cities of typical climate zone in China were selected to conduct operation simulation and performance prediction to analyze the regional applicability of the system, finally the performance prediction of system heating under variable working conditions was carried out to guide the design calculation of engineering application of photovoltaic thermal heat pump system engineering. It can be concluded that the system was more suitable for engineering application in cities of cold zone and hot summer and cold winter zone than that in severe cold zone. Besides that, the integration and operation optimization of system should be carried out to reduce the average temperature of the circulating hot water tank so that the energy efficiency of hot water system can be improved by 42%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acold zones 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat pumps 3amodels 3aprediction 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aChina 0aPhotovoltaic thermal heat pump 0aSystem engineering 0aHeating in winter 0aOperation study 0aApplication simulation1 aZhang, Jili1 aHan, Youhua1 aGuo, Xiaochao0 tApplied energy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 306 p.118071-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008000156300001800236520127600254592002801530650002301558650002201581650001301603650002101616650002201637650002101659650001401680650001801694650001301712650001501725650002601740650001501766650002601781650001401807650001301821650003301834650001201867650002201879650002101901650003701922700001801959700001701977773014101994856007402135852000902209655001202218IND60670482720221117220645.0191002e20130806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067048272DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta11734k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Haisong10aElectrically conductive aerogels composed of cellulose and carbon nanotubes  ap. 9714-9720.  aAerogels composed of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and cellulose were fabricated by the flash freezing/lyophilization process using wet-gel precursors, which were regenerated from a homogeneous dispersion of CNTs and cellulose in alkaline–urea aqueous solution. The morphology and textural properties of the resultant composite aerogels were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption tests. All the prepared materials exhibited both a nanostructured solid network (specific surface areas between 140 and 160 m² g⁻¹) and a nanoporous network (including macropores, mesopores and micropores). The results from thermogravimetric analysis and tensile tests revealed that the composite aerogels have good thermal stability and excellent mechanical properties, respectively. The Young's modulus of the composite aerogels could be tuned to reach about 90 MPa. And composite aerogels with 3–10 wt% CNTs have a conductivity of about 2.3 × 10⁻⁴ to 2.2 × 10⁻² S cm⁻¹, with the conductivity threshold at MWCNT volume fractions being as low as 3 × 10⁻³.

In this study we prepared and characterized various lignin samples from black liquor (BL), a major byproduct from the pulp and paper manufacturing processes, and studied the pyrolysis behaviors of these isolated lignin samples at 600 °C under a N₂ atmosphere. Three lignin samples were isolated from the Kraft pulping BL of Loblolly pine linerboard grade process (KL, obtained by direct evaporation; L10, obtained by precipitation at pH 10; L3, obtained by precipitation at pH 3), while another three were from the Kraft pulping BL of Loblolly pine bleach grade process (KB, B10, B3). The inorganic elements present in lignin samples were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analyzer. The KL and KB samples contained a larger amount of inorganic elements, especially Na and S, than did the other lignin samples. Owing to large quantities of inorganic elements, the ash contents in KL and KB were higher than in the precipitated lignin samples (L10, B10, L3, and B3). These inorganic elements have a significant effect on the subsequent pyrolysis process, as a result, more extensive depolymerization of lignin occurred in KL and KB samples, leading to the formation of fewer pyrolysis oils, with lower molecular weights. NMR analyses of pyrolysis oils show that more methoxyl groups and ether bonds were cleaved, resulting in fewer methoxyl groups and aromatic C–O bonds for the KL and KB heavy oil than for the precipitated lignin heavy oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3aash content 3abiorefining 3ableaching agents 3abyproducts 3achemical bonding 3adepolymerization 3aevaporation 3akraft pulping 3alignin 3amanufacturing 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apH 3apulp and paper industry 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis oils 3asodium 3awaste liquors1 aQin, Chengrong1 aRagauskas, Arthur J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3536-554X1 aNi, Yonghao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6107-66721 aHuang, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3290-77880 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Feb. 03, v. 59, no. 8 p.3310-3320dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b066903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245012000165300001400285500001500299520200000314592002802314650001302342650002102355650002402376650001902400650002402419650002602443650001502469650001102484650000902495650002202504650002402526650001002550650002202560650002302582653001902605653001602624700001902640700002302659700001602682773008302698856008402781852000902865655001202874IND4468330620221122035038.0141110e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446833062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2012.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadwan, M.A.10aBiological control of the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita on tomato using bioproducts of microbial origin  ap. 58-62.  a2019-12-06  aThe nematicidal potential of four commercial bioproducts containing the bio-agents Bacillus megaterium (Bioarc®), Trichoderma album (Biozeid®), Trichoderma harzianum (Plant Gard®) and Ascophyllum nodosum (Algaefol®) against the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, infecting tomato, was assessed in a glasshouse. Their activity was compared with that of oxamyl or carbofuran. The effect of the treatments on the growth parameters of tomato plants was also examined. All treatments were significantly superior over the untreated check in reducing the root galls and J₂ of the nematode in the soil, except T. harzianum at 10 and 25ml/kg soil against J₂, which was equal to control treatment. Among the bioproducts, B. megaterium at 10g/kg soil achieved the highest significant reduction in the number of root galling (89.20%) followed by T. album (87.77%), A. nodosum (86.96%) and T. harzianum (69.79%). The highest rate of the tested bioproducts gave the greatest reduction in galls and significantly higher than that of oxamyl or carbofuran. In addition, all the products found to be high efficient in reducing J₂ and caused more than 97% reduction in the soil. The efficacy of the tested bioproducts in reducing the root galls and J₂ in the soil increased in a dose dependent manner. Significant increases in shoot length occurred in A. nodosum (25ml/kg) and T. album (20g/kg) while T. harzianum (50ml/kg) significantly decreased the shoot length and weight compared to the untreated inoculated plants. B. megaterium (10 and 20g/kg) and T. album (5 and 10g/kg) significantly increased shoot weight. All treatments did not significantly differ from those of untreated inoculated plants except A. nodosum (25ml/kg) in the case of root length and B. megaterium and A. nodosum at all tested rates in the case of root weight. Generally, the results indicate that the tested microbial products could prove to be one component in integrated root-knot nematode management on tomatoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3anematode control 3aAscophyllum nodosum 3asoil nematodes 3aBacillus megaterium 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aroot galls 3ashoots 3asoil 3aTrichoderma lixii 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 3abiobased products 3abiological control 0aHypocrea lixii 0aTrichoderma1 aFarrag, S.A.A.1 aAbu-Elamayem, M.M.1 aAhmed, N.S.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2012 May, v. 56 p.58-62dElsevier B.V.x0929-13937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2012.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245006200166520080200228592002801030650001201058650000901070650002201079650000901101650001701110700001801127700002201145700002901167773011801196856007701314852000901391655001201400IND60771334320221116140003.0220325e20220314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077133432DNAL7 a10.3390/land110304202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHackenberg, Britta 10aNamibian Experiences Establishing Community Fish Reserves  aInland fisheries play a critical role in the ecology of the Okavango Delta, but their conservation is particularly complex. For nearly a decade, communities, conservancies, policy makers, and partner organisations have worked to establish fish reserves across the Kavango and Zambezi. Guidelines on the establishment of fish reserves have been developed to delineate the process through which these protected areas are established, and a structured learning process has unpacked knowledge held by different stakeholders to better understand the opportunities and limitations of fish reserves and to subsequently revise these guidelines.

From D-5 (5 d before inflorescence-opening, designated as D-day) to D-2 about 8 microwatts mg-1 fresh wt. was observed, and during D-1 an increase in heat evolution to 14 microwatts mg-1 fresh wt. was monitored. The heat was produced through oxidative metabolism, since replacing the air in the microcalorimeter with nitrogen blocked heat-production. Addition of salicylic acid to tissue slices of thermogenic organs (appendix, lowest part of the spadix and male flowers) and of non-thermogenic organs (female flowers, club-shaped organs and lower part of the spadix) of Sauromatum inflorescences revealed that the acid boosted heat-production only in the thermogenic organs. The effect of the acid manifested itself with no appreciable lag time, and it generated non-linearity in the rate of heat-production by tissue slices of the appendix. In the appendices of the highly thermogenic Arum italicum and of the weakly thermogenic Amorphophallus rivieri, salicylic acid selectively boosted the rate of heat-production in the appendix of A. italicum. A Q(10) of 2.4 was found between 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C for 1 mm-thick slices of D-4 appendices of S. guttatum. Addition of digitonin or deoxycholate to pre-D-day tissue slices of the appendix increased the rate of heat-production. 3ametabolism 3amale flowers 3aAmorphophallus konjac 3asalicylic acid 3aArum italicum 3aheat production 0ainflorescences 0aoxidative metabolism 0aflowers 0aAraceae1 aMeeuse, B.J.D.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1993 Feb., v. 44, no. 259 p.493-499x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01547naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245010500133300001600238520080200254650001601056650001201072700001801084700001601102700001501118773007501133852000901208939003301217945000801250946001101258655001201269991570679570742620221119224414.0930507e199304  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930015272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotermans, S.12aA user's guide to microbial challenge testing for ensuring the safety and stability of food products  ap. 145-157.  aThis article describes the development of a user's guide to microbiological challenge testing (MCT), which seeks to ensure the safety of different food products. Before undertaking such a test, each situation must be carefully reviewed and both relevant micro-organisms and the risks involved must be established. Only in the absence of the necessary information will a MCT be required. The test involves: (1) an appropriate experimental design; (2) an inoculation procedure; (3) a test procedure; and (4) interpretation of results. The results are evaluated in relation to set safety criteria and, if satisfactory, should be confirmed under field conditions (verification). Based on this approach, a practical example is given to predict the safety and stability of vacuum-packed cooked potatoes. 3afood safety 3atesting1 ain't Veld, P.1 aWijtzes, T.1 aMead, G.C.0 tFood microbiology.g1993 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.145-157x0740-00207nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01901naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010800125300001600233500001500249520087400264650001701138650002601155650001801181650002201199650001901221650003001240650001301270653001301283653002401296700001601320700001501336700002001351773009001371852000901461930003301470945001301503946001101516655001201527IND2033761520221119224706.0931004e199302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203376152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatt, D.A.10aAppearance of nitrate concentration-dependent polypeptides in N-limited Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells  ap. 447-455.  a2019-12-04  aN-limited Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells were supplied with 0.6 mM or 1.6 mM NO3(-1) for 90 min, conditions which elicit NO3(-1) uptake via the 'constitutive' and 'inducible' mechanisms, respectively. Protein extracts from whole cell, soluble- and membrane-associated fractions, before and after NO3(-1) supply, were subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis. Comparison of protein profiles ultimately led to the identification of a single cell membrane-associated polypeptide (21 kD, pI c. 5.5) and ten soluble fraction polypeptides (17 to 73 kD, pI c. 5.0 to 7.1) unique to the high NO3(-1) treatment. A putative role in the 'inducible' NO3(-1) uptake mechanism is proposed for these 11 polypeptides as: (1) they were present in NO3(-1)-grown cells, and (2) their appearance in N-limited cells coincided with full induction of the high concentration NO3(-1) uptake system. 3apolypeptides 3anutrient availability 3aion transport 3amembrane proteins 3acell membranes 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3anitrates 0aproteins 0anitrate transporter1 aAmory, A.M.1 aWatt, M.P.1 aCresswell, C.F.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1993 Feb., v. 44, no. 259 p.447-455x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04450naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166072001700184072001700201100001800218245010000236300001800336500001500354506007600369520178700445506003702232650001102269650002002280650001802300650002802318650001002346650002302356650002902379650001702408650001502425650002402440650001402464650001702478650000902495650002202504650007202526650002802598650002802626650006802654650002402722650002402746650001102770650004002781650002202821650002402843650001102867650004002878650001802918650001702936650003002953650004202983650004103025650004703066653001503113653002203128653001603150653006003166700001603226700001803242700002103260700002503281700002403306773013903330852000903469856008303478930003303561945002503594946001303619655001203632IND4413672120221207082853.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441367212DNAL7 a190645212pmid7 aPMC34704812pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.264042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKang, Jae Hee12aA trial of B vitamins and cognitive function among women at high risk of cardiovascular disease  ap. 1602-1610.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: High homocysteine concentrations may be neurotoxic and contribute to cognitive decline in older persons. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effect of supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B-12, and vitamin B-6 on cognitive change in women with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CVD risk factors. DESIGN: The Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to test the effect of a combination of B vitamins (2.5 mg folic acid/d, 50 mg vitamin B-6/d, and 1 mg vitamin B-12/d) on secondary prevention of CVD. Female health professionals aged greater-than-or-equal40 y (n = 5442) with CVD or greater-than-or-equal3 coronary risk factors in 1998 (after folic acid fortification began in the United States) were randomly assigned to treatment. Shortly after randomization (mean: 1.2 y), a substudy of cognitive function was initiated among 2009 participants aged greater-than-or-equal65 y. Telephone cognitive function testing was administered up to 4 times over 5.4 y with 5 tests of general cognition, verbal memory, and category fluency. Repeated-measures analyses were conducted, and the primary outcome was a global composite score averaging all test results. RESULTS: Mean cognitive change from baseline did not differ between the B vitamin and placebo groups (difference in change in global score: 0.03; 95% CI: -0.03, 0.08; P = 0.30). However, supplementation appeared to preserve cognition among women with a low baseline dietary intake of B vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Combined B vitamin supplementation did not delay cognitive decline among women with CVD or CVD risk factors. The possible cognitive benefits of supplementation among women with a low dietary intake of B vitamins warrant further study.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amemory 3anutrient intake 3aneurotoxicity 3acardiovascular diseases 3awomen 3aat-risk population 3anutritional intervention 3arisk factors 3afolic acid 3avitamin supplements 3acognition 3ahomocysteine 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aCognitionxdrug effects 2aCognition Disordersxbloodxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aHyperhomocysteinemiaxcomplications 2aPsychometrics 2aRisk Factors 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aVitamin B 12xadministration & dosage 2aVitamin B 6xadministration & dosage 2aVitamin B Complexxadministration & dosage 0asenescence 0avitamin B complex 0arisk groups 0aWomen's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study1 aCook, Nancy1 aManson, JoAnn1 aBuring, Julie E.1 aAlbert, Christine M.1 aGrodstein, Francine0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Dec., v. 88, no. 6 p.1602-1610dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.264043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/01/20  aOther US 7aarticle02376naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010200125300001600227500001500243520140100258650001301659650001801672650001301690650001901703650002201722650001501744653001401759653001501773653001101788653001001799700001901809700001801828773009001846852000901936930003301945945001301978946001101991655001202002IND2033760920221119224451.0931004e199302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203376092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, P.R.10aAluminium toxicity in roots: an investigation of spatial sensitivity and the role of the root cap  ap. 437-446.  a2019-12-04  aThe primary symptom of aluminium (Al) toxicity in higher plants is inhibition of root growth. in this study, we investigated the spatial sensitivity of maize (Zea mays L.) roots to Al. A divided-chamber technique indicated that only exposure of the terminal 10 to 15 mm of the root to Al resulted in inhibition of growth. Application of Al to all but this apical region of the root had little or no effect on growth for 24 h and caused minimal damage to the root tissue. Small agar blocks infused with Al were then applied to discrete areas of the apex of maize roots to determine which section (root cap, meristem or elongation zone) was more important to Al-induced inhibition of growth. The terminal 2.0 to 3.0 mm of root (root cap and meristem) must be exposed to Al for inhibition. Application of Al to the 3.0 mm of root proximal to this terminal zone (elongation zone) resulted in damage to the root tissue but no significant inhibition of growth. Therefore, the visible injuries incurred by roots during Al-stress are not associated directly with the inhibition of root growth. Furthermore, removal of the root cap had no effect on the Al-induced inhibition of root growth in solution experiments and argues against the root cap providing protection from Al stress or serving an essential role in the mechanism of toxicity. We suggest that the meristem is the primary site of Al-toxicity. 3aZea mays 3aphytotoxicity 3aaluminum 3aroot meristems 3aspatial variation 3ametal ions 0aroot caps 0ainhibition 0agrowth 0aroots1 aDiTomaso, J.M.1 aKochian, L.V.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1993 Feb., v. 44, no. 259 p.437-446x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04317naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166072001700184072001700201100001800218245011000236300001800346506007600364520188100440506003702321650001402358650001302372650001402385650001702399650002202416650002502438650003202463650002302495650002502518650001302543650002002556650001802576650006702594650002102661650001102682650002302693650004902716650001102765650001102776650006802787650005302855650002002908650000902928650001702937650002102954650005802975651001003033651002503043653002403068700002003092700001903112700002303131700001703154700001903171700002303190700002203213700002203235773013903257852000903396856008303405930003303488945002503521946001303546655001203559IND4413672420221207081208.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441367242DNAL7 a190645242pmid7 aPMC26351112pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.265102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBejon, Philip10aFraction of all hospital admissions and deaths attributable to malnutrition among children in rural Kenya  ap. 1626-1631.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Malnutrition is common in the developing world and associated with disease and mortality. Because malnutrition frequently occurs among children in the community as well as those with acute illness, and because anthropometric indicators of nutritional status are continuous variables that preclude a single definition of malnutrition, malnutrition-attributable fractions of admissions and deaths cannot be calculated by simply enumerating individual children. OBJECTIVE: We determined the malnutrition-attributable fractions among children admitted to a rural district hospital in Kenya, among inpatient deaths and among children with the major causes of severe disease. DESIGN: We analyzed data from children between 6 and 60 mo of age, comprising 13 307 admissions, 674 deaths, 3068 admissions with severe disease, and 562 community controls by logistic regression, using anthropometric z scores as the independent variable and admission or death as the outcome, to calculate the probability of admission as a result of "true malnutrition" for individual cases. Probabilities were averaged to calculate attributable fractions. RESULTS: Z scores < -3 were insensitive for malnutrition-attributable deaths and admissions, and no single threshold was both specific and sensitive. The overall malnutrition-attributable fraction for in-hospital deaths was 51% (95% CI: 42%, 61%) with midupper arm circumference. Similar malnutrition-attributable fractions were seen for the major causes of severe disease (severe malaria, gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infection, HIV, and invasive bacterial disease). CONCLUSIONS: Despite global improvements, malnutrition still underlies half of the inpatient morbidity and mortality rates among children in rural Kenya. This contribution is underestimated by using conventional clinical definitions of severe malnutrition.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahospitals 3apatients 3amortality 3amalnutrition 3arural health care 3adeveloping countries 3aanthropometric measurements 3anutritional status 3anutrition assessment 3achildren 3achild nutrition 2aAnthropometry 2aChild Nutrition Disordersxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aHospital Mortality 2aHospitalizationxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Nutrition Disordersxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aKwashiorkorxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aRural Health 2aRural Population 2aWasting Syndromexdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality. 3aKenya 0aKenyaxepidemiology. 0ahospital admissions1 aMohammed, Shebe1 aMwangi, Isaiah1 aAtkinson, Sarah H.1 aOsier, Faith1 aPeshu, Norbert1 aNewton, Charles R.1 aMaitland, Kathryn1 aBerkley, James A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Dec., v. 88, no. 6 p.1626-1631dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.265103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/01/21  aOther US 7aarticle03830naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245014700167300001600314520217800330650001902508650002902527650002002556650002102576650001202597650001502609650001402624650002202638650002102660650002602681650001002707650001602717650002302733650001302756650001902769650001402788650001802802650001302820650001002833650001402843650001102857650001002868653001402878653001502892653002402907700001702931700001802948700002102966773013202987852000903119856009203128930003303220946001103253655001203264IND4412766220221119224511.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441276622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01429.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunker, S.10aImpact of Verticillium longisporum on Yield and Morphology of Winter Oilseed Rape (Brassica napus) in Relation to Systemic Spread in the Plant  ap. 698-707.  aThe impact of Verticillium longisporum on single plant and whole plot yield of oilseed rape (OSR) was studied in field experiments with natural infection or artificial soil infestation. Disease incidence (DI) and disease severity (DS) correlated with the amount of inoculum provided at four different levels by addition of infested rapeseed straw to the soil. DI and DS were higher in 2003, a year with higher average soil and air temperatures, than in 2004, at similar levels of added inoculum. Maximum DI and DS levels achieved with artificial soil infestation were 54.3% and 0.57 (rating scale from 0 to 2), respectively, which was insufficient to induce significant yield reduction in whole plots. In contrast, a significant decrease in yield was recorded on single naturally infected plants removed from the field at growth stage (GS) 83 to 85. Yield losses of single plants accounted for 20 to more than 80% at DS levels above 5 (scale 0 to 9). The systemic spread of V. longisporum was significantly delayed in plants in the field with substantial colonization of the shoots not occurring before maturity stages. However, fungal systemic spread into the shoots was faster in 2003, consistent with the visual disease assessment in the field. Conversely, the pathogen systemically spread after 28 days in plants (susceptible cultivar 'Falcon') in the greenhouse. Root dip inoculation with conidia suspension induced earlier and more severe disease symptoms than microsclerotia added to the soil. In contrast to the field, intense stunting was recorded on inoculated plants in the greenhouse. The susceptible cultivar, 'Falcon', showed higher DS, stronger reduction in root and shoot lengths and a faster fungal spread in the plant tissue than the moderate susceptible cultivar, 'Talent'. Climatic conditions appear to be responsible for the strong delay in fungal invasion of plants in the field. This may prevent the plants from stunting and mitigate the overall yield effects of the disease. This study indicates a significant yield damage potential of V. longisporum in areas with DI above 60% and conditions accelerating the systemic pathogen spread in the plants. 3aBrassica napus 3aVerticillium longisporum 3aair temperature 3aclimatic factors 3aconidia 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3adisease incidence 3adisease severity 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3ainoculum 3amaturity stage 3apathogens 3aplant tissues 3arapeseed 3aroots 3asclerotia 3ashoots 3astraw 0acrop loss 0ayield loss 0adisease development1 aKeunecke, H.1 aSteinbach, P.1 avonTiedemann, A.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2008 Dec., v. 156, no. 11-12 p.698-707dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01429.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03609naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245017400127300001600301500013800317500002400455520200200479650001802481650002202499650000902521650001502530650001302545650001402558650001302572650001402585650002702599650001502626650001702641650001202658650001102670650001802681650001302699650001102712650001802723650001702741650001402758650001102772650000902783650001202792650001502804650001102819700001602830700001602846773012202862852000902984856008602993655001203079IND4468374920221119224801.0130603s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446837492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAggarwal, V.10aIn vitro mass production of stevia rebaudiana bertoni (an antidiabetic endangered herb) and assessment of phytotoxicity of different heavy metals on stevioside synthesis  ap. 121-133.  aPaper presented at the II International Symposium on Medicinal and Nutraceutical Plants, held November 25-27, 2009, New Delhi, India.  aIncludes references  aDiabetes is a major global epidemic currently affecting 50 million people across the world and is expected to rise to 300 million by 2025. However, the present pharmacological approach for the management of this serious disease is far from ideal, which behooves the exploration of newer and safer agents. Currently, there is an enormous increase in the use of herbal and other alternative medicines for the treatment of diabetes. Stevia rebaudiana, a member of Asteraceae has emerged as a natural sweetener against synthetic sugars and an alternative herbal cure for diabetes. This property of Stevia is attributed mainly due to the presence of major steviol glycosides e.g., steviosides, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside C and dulcoside A, besides, several other bioactive compounds. These compounds are known to stimulate the pancreatic cells to produce insulin in diabetic patients. It has, therefore, become imperative to undertake different biotechnological approaches such as its ex situ conservation and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated genetic transformation for improved production of stevioside and related bioactive compounds. In light of the above, an in vitro technology has been developed for mass production of Stevia rebaudiana and optimization of stevioside production using various elicitors e.g., heavy metals, osmolytes, etc. Multiple shoots have been induced in the seedling derived node and leaf explants on MS medium augmented with different cytokinins. Of the various combinations tried, MS+1 µM BA proved optimum for differentiating an average of 12.05+/-0.31 and 10.40+/-1.02 shoots from nodal and leaf explants respectively, in 100% cultures after 30 days. Half-strength MS basal proved helpful in inducing rhizogenesis in 100% cultures. The plants were gradually hardened and subsequently transferred to garden soil where 97% plants survived and induced floral buds after 60 days. The impact of heavy metal stress on morphogenesis of nodal explants has also been studied. 3aAgrobacterium 3aStevia rebaudiana 3abuds 3acytokinins 3adiabetes 3aelicitors 3aexplants 3agardening 3agenetic transformation 3aglycosides 3aheavy metals 3ainsulin 3aleaves 3amorphogenesis 3apatients 3apeople 3aphytotoxicity 3arhizogenesis 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil 3asteviol 3astevioside 3asugars1 aShankar, V.1 aAgrawal, V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Jan., , no. 972 p.121-133dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/972/972_16.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03247naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175100001200184245010800196300001600304500002400320500001500344520126900359650002501628650002201653650002101675650002701696650002501723650002401748650002501772650002201797650001901819650002201838650002401860650002301884650002301907650002501930650003801955650002701993650002802020650003202048650002602080650001402106650005302120650002702173650002702200653001902227653002802246653003102274700001502305700001902320773010502339852000902444856008702453930003302540945002502573946001102598655001202609IND4432876920221119224701.0100219e20100301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443287692DNAL7 a198796652pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2009.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aHe, Jie12aA Pelargonium ARGONAUTE4 Gene shows organ-specific expression and differences in RNA and protein levels  ap. 319-325.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRNAi-induced gene silencing plays a role in plant DNA methylation and defense. While most gene silencing studies have been performed on annuals, little is known about the expression of key components of this process (like ARGONAUTE proteins) in ornamentals. Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction techniques, an ARGONAUTE4 gene, PhAGO4, was isolated from Pelargonium. PhAGO4 encodes a predicted product of 934 amino acids that contains the PAZ and PIWI domains typical of ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PhAGO4 clusters with other plant AGO4 proteins. Organ expression patterns of the AGO4 genes in Pelargonium and Arabidopsis show intriguing differences. AGO4 RNA levels decline with leaf age in both Arabidopsis and Pelargonium. In contrast AGO4 RNA levels in roots relative to leaves are higher in Pelargonium than in Arabidopsis. Both Arabidopsis and Pelargonium AGO4 showed higher RNA levels in flowers than leaves or roots. Even though flowers show higher levels of PhAGO4 RNA when compared to leaves and roots, protein gel blot analysis shows that at the protein level, the reverse is true. This suggests that PhAGO4 expression may be regulated at the translational or post-translational level in Pelargonium flowers. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3asequence analysis 3aRNA interference 3atranslation (genetics) 3aPelargonium hortorum 3atissue distribution 3aamino acid sequences 3amolecular cloning 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificityxgenetics 2aPelargoniumxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0agene silencing 0amolecular sequence data 0agene expression regulation1 aGray, John1 aLeisner, Scott0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2010 Mar. 1, v. 167, no. 4 p.319-325dUrban & Fischerx0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2009.10.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100304b20100403c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03393naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100002300218245006200241300001800303500001500321506007600336520178600412506003702198650000802235650002802243650001302271650001702284650001402301650002102315650002902336650001902365650000902384650002402393650002402417650002402441650001402465653001402479700002502493700002502518700001802543773013902561852000902700856008302709930003302792945002502825946001302850655001202863IND4413672320221207082219.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441367232DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2007.258162doi7 aPMC26131992pmcid7 a190645232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVirtanen, Jyrki K.10aFish consumption and risk of major chronic disease in men  ap. 1618-1625.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Although fish consumption may reduce specific disease endpoints, such as sudden cardiac death and prostate cancer, the effects of major chronic disease on total burden, reflecting sums of effects on a variety of endpoints and risk pathways, are not well established. Higher n-6 fatty acid consumption has also been hypothesized to reduce the health benefits of n-3 fatty acids in fish. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the associations of fish and n-3 fatty acid consumption with risk of total major chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, cancer, and death) and to determine whether a high n-6 intake modifies the associations. DESIGN: Lifestyle and other risk factors were assessed every 2 y and diet every 4 y in 40,230 US male health professionals aged 40-75 y and free of major chronic disease at baseline in 1986. During 18 y of follow-up, 9715 major chronic disease events occurred, including 3639 cardiovascular disease events, 4690 cancers, and 1386 deaths from other causes. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, neither fish nor dietary n-3 fatty acid consumption was significantly associated with risk of total major chronic disease. Compared with fish consumption of <1 serving/mo, consumption of 1 serving/wk and of 2-4 servings/wk was associated with a lower risk of total cardiovascular disease of [almost equal to]15%. No significant associations were seen with cancer risk. Higher or lower n-6 fatty acid intake did not significantly modify the results (P for interaction > 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Modest fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of total cardiovascular disease, consistent with cardiac mortality benefits but not with total cancer or overall major chronic disease; n-6 fatty acid consumption did not influence these relations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amen 3acardiovascular diseases 3aseafoods 3arisk factors 3alifestyle 3achronic diseases 3adietary nutrient sources 3aprotein intake 3afish 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3amortality 0aneoplasms1 aMozaffarian, Dariush1 aChiuve, Stephanie E.1 aRimm, Eric B.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Dec., v. 88, no. 6 p.1618-1625dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2007.258163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/01/21  aOther US 7aarticle02234naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006500126300001600191500013800207500002400345520112600369650002801495650002301523650001001546650001201556650001301568650001001581650001801591651001001609700001401619700001701633700001701650773012201667852000901789856008601798655001201884IND4468374820221119224755.0130603s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446837482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaina, A.P.10aEvaluation studies on Kalmegh (andrographis paniculata nees)  ap. 117-120.  aPaper presented at the II International Symposium on Medicinal and Nutraceutical Plants, held November 25-27, 2009, New Delhi, India.  aIncludes references  aAndrographis paniculata nees (Acanthaceae), the kalmegh of Ayurveda in India is an annual herb, widely used in the Indian system of medicine as a stomachic, tonic, antipyretic, anti-fertility, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, immuno-stimulatory and anti-oxidant agent. Androgropholide is the major active principle present in the plant attributing therapeutic activity. Kalmegh is a component of over 50% of the multi-ingredient herbal formulations available in India for the treatment of liver ailments. The herb is widely distributed in plains and forests throughout India. A study on evaluation of wild growing populations collected from diverse locations was initiated to identify a suitable genotype with high andrographolide content. Andrographolide content ranged from 1.30 to 2.51% among 22 collections with mean andrographolide of 1.82%. Promising collections identified were IC342139 (2.51%), IC471916 (2.16%), IC111291 (2.20%) and IC210635 (2.13%). Considering its value as a drug raw material, emphasis should be given for its commercial cultivation to get authentic raw material of known quality. 3aAndrographis paniculata 3aAyurvedic medicine 3adrugs 3aforests 3agenotype 3aliver 3araw materials 3aIndia1 aKumar, A.1 aPareek, S.K.1 aSharma, S.K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Jan., , no. 972 p.117-120dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/972/972_15.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01700naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005000127300001400177500013800191500002400329520073600353650001301089650001701102650001001119650001301129650002101142650001101163651001001174773012001184852000901304856008501313655001201398IND4468272020221119224728.0130531s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446827202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKochar, K.P.10aIndian dietary spices: tradition to modernity  ap. 67-78.  aPaper presented at the II International Symposium on Medicinal and Nutraceutical Plants, held November 25-27, 2009, New Delhi, India.  aIncludes references  aWhenever the curiosity of the present day investigator probes into the past and brings to light even fragmentary information on the ingenious methods of our ancestors, it makes a fascinating study.

We determined soil-erosion rates based on ¹³⁷Cs in situ measurements. The method integrates soil erosion over the last 22 y (time after the Chernobyl accident). Measured erosion rates were compared with erosion rates modeled with the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The comparison was done in order to find out if the USLE is a useful tool for erosion prediction in steep mountainous grassland systems. Three different land-use types were investigated: hayfields, pasture with dwarf shrubs, and pasture without dwarf shrubs. Our test plots are situated in the Urseren Valley (Central Switzerland) with a mean slope steepness of 37°. Mean annual soil-erosion rates determined with ¹³⁷Cs of the investigated sites ranged between the minimum of 4.7 t ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ for pastures with dwarf shrubs to >30 t ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ at hayfields and pastures without dwarf shrubs. The determined erosion rates are 10 to 20 times higher compared to previous measurements in alpine regions. Our measurements integrated over the last 22 y, including extreme rainfall events as well as winter processes, whereas previous studies mostly reported erosion rates based on summer time and short-term rainfall simulation experiments. These results lead to the assumption that heavy-rainfall events as well as erosion processes during winter time and early spring do have a considerable influence on the high erosion amounts that were measured. The latter can be confirmed by photographs of damaged plots after snowmelt. Erosion rates based on the USLE are in the same order of magnitude compared to ¹³⁷Cs-based results for the land-use type "pasture with dwarf shrubs". However, erosion amounts on hayfields and pasture without dwarf shrubs are underestimated by the USLE compared to ¹³⁷Cs-based erosion rates. We assume that the underestimation is due to winter processes that cause soil erosion on sites without dwarf shrubs that is not considered by the USLE. Dwarf shrubs may possibly prevent from damage of soil erosion through winter processes. The USLE is not able to perform well on the affected sites. Thus, a first attempt was done to create an alpine factor for the USLE based on the measured data. 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3aaccidents 3adwarf cultivars 3agrasslands 3apastures 3aphotographs 3aprediction 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3ashrubs 3asnowmelt 3asoil erosion 3aspring 3asummer 3avalleys 3awinter 3aSwitzerland1 aSchaub, Monika1 aPrasuhn, Volker1 aBaenninger, Dominik1 aAlewell, Christine0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2009 Oct., v. 172, no. 5 p.615-622dWiley-VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200800297 7aarticle02862naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002300167245013900190300001600329500002400345520126500369650002501634650001301659650001201672650001601684650001201700650001501712650001101727650001401738650001601752650001901768650001301787650001301800650001401813650005301827650003501880650003701915650003201952650002201984650003902006650001102045650001902056650001402075700001802089700001402107700001602121773009802137852000902235856008802244655001202332IND4468132120221119224833.0130530s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446813212DNAL7 a234333712pmid7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-3212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahid, Iqbal Kabir10aInfluence of Glucose Concentrations on Biofilm Formation, Motility, Exoprotease Production, and Quorum Sensing in Aeromonas hydrophila  ap. 239-247.  aIncludes references  aAeromonas hydrophila recently has received increased attention because it is opportunistic and a primary human pathogen. A. hydrophila biofilm formation and its control are a major concern for food safety because biofilms are related to virulence. Therefore, we investigated biofilm formation, motility inhibition, quorum sensing, and exoprotease production of this opportunistic pathogen in response to various glucose concentrations from 0.05 to 2.5% (wt/vol). More than 0.05% glucose significantly impaired (P < 0.05) quorum sensing, biofilm formation, protease production, and swarming and swimming motility, whereas bacteria treated with 0.05% glucose had activity similar to that of the control (0% glucose). A stage shift biofilm assay revealed that the addition of glucose (2.5%) inhibited initial biofilm formation but not later stages. However, addition of quorum sensing molecules N-3-butanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone and N-3-hexanoyl homoserine lactone partially restored protease production, indicating that quorum sensing is controlled by glucose concentrations.

In the resting grain no carboxypeptidase I activity was found in the aleurone layer, scutellum, or starchy endosperm. During germination high levels of enzyme activity appeared in the scutellum and in the starchy endosperm but only low activity was found in the aleurone layer. No mRNA for carboxypeptidase I was observed in the resting grain. By the day 1 of germination the mRNA appeared in the scutellum where its level remained high for several days. In contrast, little mRNA was observed in the aleurone layer. These results indicate that the scutellum plays an important role in the production of carboxypeptidase I in germinating barley grain. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aseed germination 3apeptidases 3aenzyme activity 3abiosynthesis 3amessenger RNA1 aSopanen, T.1 aVoutilainen, R.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Aug., v. 93, no. 4 p.1449-1452x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02549naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009600165300001500261520132400276650002001600650001601620650001101636650002301647650001101670650001301681650001401694650001101708650002501719650001401744650000901758650002401767650001501791653001701806653001901823653001301842653001001855773011201865852000901977856008501986930003302071946001102104655001202115IND4393052520221119225204.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439305252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-007-9104-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnicker, Heike 10aHow does fire affect the nature and stability of soil organic nitrogen and carbon? A review  ap. 91-118.  aAfter vegetation fires considerable amounts of severely or partly charred necromass (referred to here as char) are incorporated into the soil, with long-term consequences for soil C and N dynamics and thus N availability for primary production and C and N transport within the soil column. Considering results reported in the pyrolysis literature in combination with those obtained from controlled charring of plant material and soil organic matter (SOM), it has become clear that common models claiming char as a graphite-like material composed mainly of highly condensed polyaromatic clusters may be oversimplified. Instead, I suggest a concept in which char is a heterogeneous mixture of heat-altered biopolymers with domains of relatively small polyaromatic clusters, but considerable substitution with N, O and S functional groups. Such a concept allows fast oxidation facilitating both microbial attack and dissolution. Although, char is commonly believed to degrade more slowly than litter, over the long term and under oxic conditions, char may degrade to an extent that it becomes indistinguishable from naturally formed SOM. Oxygen depletion or environments with low microbial activity may be necessary for char to survive without major chemical alteration and in considerable amounts for millennia or longer. 3abiogeochemistry 3abiopolymers 3acarbon 3amicrobial activity 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprimary productivity 3apyrolysis 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3avegetation 0aBlack carbon 0aBlack nitrogen 0aAromatic 0aAlkyl0 tBiogeochemistry.g2007 Aug., v. 85, no. 1 p.91-118dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9104-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02796naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001600136245011600152300001800268500002400286520169700310650001102007650000802018650002702026650001702053650001102070650001402081650001102095650001602106650001602122650001302138650001102151650001202162650001202174651001902186651000902205651001302214773011102227852000902338856003902347655001202386IND4412205520221119225136.0081101e20081115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441220552DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.70662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, M.Z.10aShort-term variability in isotopic composition of precipitation: A case study from the Midwestern United States  ap. 4609-4619.  aIncludes references  aOxygen and deuterium isotopes in precipitation were analysed to define local isotopic trends in Iowa, US. The area is far inland from an oceanic source and the observed averages of δ¹⁸O and δ D are - 6·43[per thousand] and - 41·35[per thousand] for Ames, - 7·53[per thousand] and - 51·33[per thousand] for Cedar Falls, and - 6·01[per thousand] and - 38·19[per thousand] for Iowa City, respectively. Although these data generally follow global trends, they are different when compared to a semi-arid mid-continental location in North Platt, Nebraska. The local meteoric water lines of Iowa are δ D = 7·68 δ¹⁸O + 8·0 for Ames, δ D = 7·62 δ¹⁸O + 6·07 for Cedar Falls, and δ D = 7·78 δ¹⁸O + 8·61 for Iowa City. The current Iowa study compares well with a study conducted in Ames, Iowa, 10 years earlier. The differences between Iowa and Nebraska studies are attributed to a variable climate across the northern Great Plains ranging from sub-humid in the east to semi-arid in the west. Iowa being further east in the region is more strongly influenced by a moist sub-humid to humid climate fed by the tropical air stream from the Gulf of Mexico. The average d-excess values are 10·06[per thousand] for Ames, 8·92[per thousand] for Cedar Falls and 9·92[per thousand] for Iowa City. Eighty seven percent of the samples are within the global d-excess range of 0[per thousand] and 20[per thousand]. The results are similar to previous studies, including those by National Atmospheric Deposition Programs and International Atomic Energy Agency. It appears that the impact of recycled water or secondary evaporation on δ¹⁸O values of area precipitation is minimal. 3aCedrus 3aair 3aatmospheric deposition 3acase studies 3acities 3adeuterium 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3ahumid zones 3aisotopes 3aoxygen 3astreams 3atropics 3aGulf of Mexico 3aIowa 3aNebraska0 tHydrological processes.g2008 Nov. 15, v. 22, no. 23 p.4609-4619dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7066 7aarticle02965naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008900126300001600215520165800231650005701889650002101946650005101967650002302018650001502041650001302056650001002069650001402079650001102093650001802104650001102122650001502133650001402148650001702162650002202179650002202201650002502223650002302248700001802271700001502289700001202304700001302316773008802329852000902417930003302426945001302459946001102472655001202483IND2058273720221119225055.0970709e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205827372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarvari, M.10aBaculovirus-mediated trans-epithelial transport of proteins in infected caterpillars  ap. 953-963.  aBaculovirus-mediated abnormal protein trafficking was studied in infected caterpillars by using heterologous proteins. The gene for human complement C1 r was expressed in larvae of Mamestra brassicae by a recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) vector. By following the time-course of recombinant C1 r distribution among various tissues, cell types and cell organelles, we concluded that the dominant site of recombinant protein synthesis was the fat body, although some production in the haemocytes and midgut was also observed. Only about 4% of the cells of the infected organs expressed recombinant C1 r, which was then secreted into the haemolymph. The tracheal and integumental cuticle was rich in recombinant protein from the fourth day after infection although epidermal cells did not synthesize recombinant C1 r. The morphological picture suggested that the accumulation was a consequence of a trans-epithelial transport. This transport process was checked by following the fate of the 49 kDa haemolymph protein and injected ovalbumin in AcMNPV-infected Mamestra brassicae and in Lymantria dispar nuclear polyhedrosis virus infected Lymantria dispar larvae. Both proteins were able to pass the basal membrane of the epidermis and accumulated in the cuticle, while in control larvae neither was transported. The observed transepithelial transport points to the role of baculoviruses in directing recombinant, endo- and exogenous proteins to cuticulated tissues. Based on these results we conclude that the permeability of basal membranes undergoes a characteristic change during the course of baculovirus infection. 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aLymantria dispar 3aLymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aMamestra brassicae 3acomplement 3afat body 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3ahumans 3ainsect larvae 3amidgut 3aorganelles 3aovalbumin 3apermeability 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein transport 3arecombinant proteins 3atransport proteins1 aZavodszky, P.1 aMolnar, K.1 aLow, P.1 aSass, M.0 tJournal of general virology.g1997 Apr., v. 78, no. pt.4 p.953-963x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03975naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100002300177245013600200300001600336500002400352520152300376650002201899650001501921650001801936650001301954650001301967650002001980650003102000650001802031650001502049650002502064650002202089650002402111650001202135650003902147650002502186650004702211650002202258650002902280650002002309650002802329650004002357650001102397650004202408650004602450650002902496650000902525650002402534650002802558650002302586650003402609650006802643650002302711650003002734653002602764700002402790700002702814700002002841700002002861700001802881700002102899700002202920773009402942852000903036856008903045930003303134945002503167946001303192655001203205IND4432860420221119225152.0100219e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443286042DNAL7 a198969392pmid7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2009.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8221 aPeralta, Regina H.10aTaenia crassiceps cysticerci: Characterization of the 14-kDa glycoprotein with homologies to antigens from Taenia solium cysticerci  ap. 295-300.  aIncludes references  aGlycoproteins from the total vesicular fluid of Taenia crassiceps (VF-Tc) were prepared using three different purification methods, consisting of ConA-lectin affinity chromatography (ConA-Tc), preparative electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) (14gp-Tc), and monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity chromatography (18/14-Tc). The complex composition represented by the VF-Tc and ConA-Tc antigens revealed peptides ranging from 101- to 14-kDa and from 92- to 12-kDa, respectively. Immunoblotting using lectins confirmed glucose/mannose (glc/man) residues in the 18- and 14-kDa peptides, which are considered specific and immunodominant for the diagnosis of cysticercosis, and indicated that these fractions are glycoproteins. Serum antibodies from a patient with neurocysticercosis that reacted to the 14gp band from T. crassiceps (Tc) were eluted from immunoblotting membranes and showed reactivity to 14gp from Taenia solium. In order to determine the similar peptide sequence, the N-terminal amino acid was determined and analyzed with sequences available in public databases. This sequence revealed partial homology between T. crassiceps and T. solium peptides. In addition, mass spectrometry along with theoretical Mr and pI of the 14gp-Tc point suggested a close relationship to some peptides of a 150-kDa protein complex of the T. solium previously described. The identification of these common immunogenic sites will contribute to future efforts to develop recombinant antigens and synthetic peptides for immunological assays. 3aTaenia crassiceps 3acysticerci 3aglycoproteins 3aantigens 3apeptides 3aimmunochemistry 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aTaenia solium 3aproteomics 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence homology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aAntibody Specificity 2aAntigens, Helminthxchemistryximmunology. 2aBlotting, Western 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aCross Reactions 2aCysticercusximmunology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFemale 2aGlycoproteinsxchemistryximmunology. 2aHelminth Proteinsxchemistryximmunology. 2aLectinsxdiagnostic use. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aTaeniaximmunology 2aTaenia soliumximmunology 0aglycoprotein antigens1 aEspindola, Noeli M.1 aPardini, Alessandra X.1 aIha, Alberto H.1 aMoura, Hercules1 aBarr, John R.1 aVaz, Adelaide J.1 aPeralta, José M.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2010 Mar., v. 124, no. 3 p.295-300dElsevierx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2009.10.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/02/19  aOther US 7aarticle04496naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015100165300001400316500001500330520279500345650001903140650001803159650002103177650001303198650002403211650001103235650001303246650001303259650001103272650001103283650001703294650001503311650002003326650001703346650001303363650001203376651001103388651001703399653001903416653001603435653001903451653002403470653001903494653002603513653002503539700003003564700001803594700002303612700002203635773011103657852000903768856008503777930003303862946001103895655001203906IND4393052320221119222658.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439305232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-007-9100-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrow, Susan E. 10aDensity fractionation of forest soils: methodological questions and interpretation of incubation results and turnover time in an ecosystem context  ap. 69-90.  a2019-12-05  aSoil organic matter (SOM) is often separated by physical means to simplify a complex matrix into discrete fractions. A frequent approach to isolating two or more fractions is based on differing particle densities and uses a high density liquid such as sodium polytungstate (SPT). Soil density fractions are often interpreted as organic matter pools with different carbon (C) turnover times, ranging from years to decades or centuries, and with different functional roles for C and nutrient dynamics. In this paper, we discuss the development and mechanistic basis of common density-based methods for dividing soil into distinct organic matter fractions. Further, we directly address the potential effects of dispersing soil in a high density salt solution on the recovered fractions and implications for data interpretation. Soil collected from forested sites at H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon and Bousson Experimental Forest, Pennsylvania was separated into light and heavy fractions by floatation in a 1.6 g cm-³ solution of SPT. Mass balance calculations revealed that between 17% and 26% of the original bulk soil C and N content was mobilized and subsequently discarded during density fractionation for both soils. In some cases, the light isotope was preferentially mobilized during density fractionation. During a year-long incubation, mathematically recombined density fractions respired ~40% less than the bulk soil at both sites and light fraction (LF) did not always decompose more than the heavy fraction (HF). Residual amounts of tungsten (W) present even in well-rinsed fractions were enough to reduce microbial respiration by 27% compared to the control in a 90-day incubation of Oa material. However, residual W was nearly eliminated by repeated leaching over the year-long incubation, and is not likely the primary cause of the difference in respiration between summed fractions and bulk soil. Light fraction at Bousson, a deciduous site developed on Alfisols, had a radiocarbon-based mean residence time (MRT) of 2.7 or 89 years, depending on the interpretation of the radiocarbon model, while HF was 317 years. In contrast, both density fractions from H. J. Andrews, a coniferous site developed on andic soils, had approximately the same MRT (117 years and 93 years for LF and HF). At H. J. Andrews the organic matter lost during density separation had a short MRT (19 years) and can account for the difference in respired CO₂ between the summed fractions and the bulk soil. Recognition and consideration of the effects of the density separation procedure on the recovered fractions will help prevent misinterpretation and deepen our understanding of the specific role of the recovered organic matter fractions in the ecological context of the soil studied. 3acarbon dioxide 3afractionation 3anitrogen content 3aisotopes 3asoil organic matter 3amodels 3atungsten 3aleaching 3acarbon 3asodium 3aforest soils 3aecosystems 3abiogeochemistry 3asoil density 3aAlfisols 3aforests 3aOregon 3aPennsylvania 0aorganic matter 0aRadiocarbon 0aLight fraction 0aMean residence time 0aHeavy fraction 0aDensity fractionation 0aSodium polytungstate1 aSwanston, Christopher W. 1 aLajtha, Kate 1 aBrooks, J.

Seven-day-old chickens were randomly divided into nine groups; group 1 negative control, groups 2, 3, 4, 5 positive controls; and groups 6, 7, 8 and 9 experimental groups. On days 7 and 14, groups 1–5 were injected with TE buffer, and groups 6–9 with the vaccine. At 21 days of age, all chickens were inoculated with 5 × 104 sporulated oocysts except for the negative control. Groups 2 and 6 were inoculated with Eimeria tenella, groups 3 and 7 with Eimeria necatrix, groups 4 and 8 with Eimeria acervulina and groups 5 and 9 with Eimeria maxima. Seven days later, all chickens were weighed and slaughtered to obtain intestinal samples. Efficacy of immunization was evaluated on the basis of oocyst decrease ratio, lesion score, body-weight gain and anti-coccidial index. The results indicated that the recombinant plasmid can induce host immune responses by alleviating intestinal lesions, body weight loss and oocyst ratio and imparting good protection against E. tenella and E. acervulina, medium protection against E. necatrix but little effect against E. maxima. It is concluded that the conserved antigen can provide cross protection and should be explored further. 3aEimeria tenella 3aEimeria necatrix 3aEimeria maxima 3aEimeria acervulina 3achickens 3avaccination 3arecombinant vaccines 3arecombinant antigens 3aprotective effect 3aoocysts 3acoccidiosis 3across immunity 3aimmune response 3adisease control 2aAnimals 2aChickensxparasitology 2aCoccidiosisxparasitologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aCross Reactions 2aEimeriaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aEimeria tenellaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPoultry Diseasesxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aRandom Allocation 2aVaccines, DNAximmunology1 aXu, Lixin1 aYan, Ruofeng1 aSong, Xiaokai1 aLi, Xiangrui0 tExperimental parasitology.g2010 Mar., v. 124, no. 3 p.330-333dElsevierx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2009.11.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/02/19  aOther US 7aarticle02404naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009700131300001800228520114200246650001901388650001501407650003701422650001001459650001301469650000901482650001101491650001801502650002101520650001201541650001001553650001101563700001801574700001901592700001501611700004601626700001501672700001501687700001801702700001401720700001501734700001601749773009101765852000901856930003301865945001301898946001101911655001201922IND2062993620221119222845.0980408e199709  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206299362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomerville, R.A.10aImmunodetection of PrPSc in spleens of some scrapie-infected sheep but not BSE-infected cows  ap. 2389-2396.  aThe development of diagnostic tools for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) would greatly assist their study and may provide assistance in controlling the disease. The detection of an abnormal form of the host protein PrP in non-central nervous system tissues may form the basis for diagnosis of TSEs. Using a new antibody reagent to PrP produced in chickens, PrP can be readily detected in crude tissue extracts. PrP from uninfected spleen had a lower molecular mass range than PrP from brain, suggesting a lower degree of glycosylation. A simple method for detecting the abnormal form of the protein, PrP(Sc), in ruminant brain and spleen has been developed. PrP(Sc) was detected in sheep spleen extracts from a flock affected by natural scrapie and was also found in spleens from some, but not all, experimental TSE cases. In spleens from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) no PrP(Sc) was detected. It is therefore suggested that there is differential targeting of PrP(Sc) deposition between organs in these different types of TSE infection which, with other factors, depends on strain of infecting agent. 3aPrPSc proteins 3aantibodies 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3abrain 3achickens 3acows 3aflocks 3aglycosylation 3amolecular weight 3ascrapie 3asheep 3aspleen1 aBirkett, C.R.1 aFarquhar, C.F.1 aHunter, N.1 aGolʹdman, V.

Surveys indicate that this decline occurs in trees throughout the natural range of red spruce and is independent of elevation, tree size, and age class. In addition, crowns of mature red spruce at high elevations across the northeastern United States have been dying back. Understanding the physiological basis for the growth decline is essential for the judicious management of the red spruce resource. A sequence of events is inferred through which an imbalance of aluminum and calcium in fine root environment reduces the rate of wood formation, decreases the amountof functional sapwood and live crown, and leaves large trees more vulnerable to extant secondary diseases and insect pests. 3aPicea rubens 3acalcium 3adeficiency diseases 3aaluminum 3aNortheastern United States 0agrowth rate1 aSmith, K.T.0 tScience.g1988 May 20, v. 240, no. 4855 p.1017-1018x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01844naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245010800149300001600257300002100273500001500294520087600309650002101185650001301206650001601219650001401235650001501249650000901264650002401273650002001297653001701317700001801334773007501352852000901427939003301436946001301469655001201482IND9005337220221119222758.0901101e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900533722DNAL7 a166677012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Barros, E.G.10aPurification and characterization of zein-degrading proteases from endosperm of germinating maize seeds  ap. 297-303.  ap. 297-303. ill.  a2019-12-05  aWe have purified a group of four proteases (molecular mass 26-33 kilodalton) from germinating seeds of maize (Zea mays L. var W64A) using ammonium sulfate and isoelectric precipitations, anion exchange chromatography, and electroelution from preparative nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Their appearance in the endosperm of germinating seeds coincides with the onset of zein degradation. We have shown that these proteases degrade zeins dissolved in alcoholic solution as well as aggregated in protein bodies from developing maize kernels. The apparent molecular weights and net negative charges of each of these proteases are very similar. Additionally, they are inhibited by thiol-blocking agents and activated by reducing compounds. These characteristics suggest that they are a group of cysteine proteases involved in the first steps of storage protein degradation. 3aseed germination 3aZea mays 3aproteinases 3aendosperm 3ahydrolysis 3azein 3aprotein degradation 3aenzyme activity 0apurification1 aLarkins, B.A.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Sept., v. 94, no. 1 p.297-303x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02613naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245018100133300001600314300002100330500001500351520145200366650001201818650001001830650003601840650002601876650002001902650001601922653002401938653001701962653002301979700001902002700001602021700001302037700001802050700001702068773007502085852000902160939003302169946001302202655001202215IND9005337020221119222917.0901101e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900533702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanlerberghe, G.C.10aRelationship between NH4(+1) assimilation rate and in vivo phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity.

Collins cells in the dark was set as an independent variable and the relationship between NH4+ assimilation rate and in vivo activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) was determined. In vivo activity of PEPC was measured by following the incorporation of H14CO3(-) into acid stable products. A linear relationship of 0.3 moles C fixed via PEPC per mole N assimilated was observed. This value agrees extremely well with the PEPC requirement for the synthesis of the amino acids found in total cellular protein. Determinations of metabolite levels in vivo at different rates of N assimilation indicated that the known metabolite effectors of S. minutum PEPC in vitro (KA Schuller, WC Plaxton, DH Turpin, [1990] Plant Physiol 93: 1303-1311) are important regulators of this enzyme during N assimilation. As PEPC activity increased in response to increasing rates of N assimilation, there was a corresponding decline in the level of PEPC inhibitors (2-oxoglutarate, malate), an increase in the level of PEPC activators (glutamine, dihydroxyacetone phosphate), and an increase in the Gln/Glu ratio. Treatment of N-limited cells with azaserine caused an increase in the Gln/Glu ratio resulting in increased PEPC activity in the absence of N assimilation. We suggest glutamate and glutamine play a key role in regulating the anaplerotic function of PEPC in this C3 organism. 3aammonia 3aalgae 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3anet assimilation rate 3aenzyme activity 3ametabolites 0aselenastrum minutum 0aassimilation 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aSchuller, K.A.1 aSmith, R.G.1 aFeil, R.1 aPlaxton, W.C.1 aTurpin, D.H.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Sept., v. 94, no. 1 p.284-290x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01901naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010000166300001400266500002400280520072600304650002501030650001201055650001201067650001401079650001001093650001901103650001101122650001501133650002001148651002301168651001101191653003501202653001901237653001601256700003001272700002401302773010801326852000901434856004801443655001201491IND4405233120221119222833.0080502e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440523312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-007-9246-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErisman, Brad E.10aEvidence of gonochorism in a grouper, Mycteroperca rosacea, from the Gulf of California, Mexico  ap. 23-33.  aIncludes references  aThe sexual pattern and sexual development of the leopard grouper, Mycteroperca rosacea, were investigated from 483 specimens collected from the Gulf of California, Mexico.

Some juveniles passed through an immature bisexual phase of gonadal development, but no evidence of post-maturational sex change was found. The immature bisexual phase is believed to be associated only with male development. The size distribution and size at sexual maturity were similar for both males and females. In accordance with predictions of the size-advantage model, the gonochoric sexual pattern of M. rosacea is likely influenced by its group-spawning mating system. 3aMycteroperca rosacea 3afemales 3agrouper 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amating systems 3amodels 3aprediction 3asexual maturity 3aGulf of California 3aMexico 0aMycteroperca rosacea; Groupers 0aSexual pattern 0aGonochorism1 aRosales-Casián, Jorge A.1 aHastings, Philip A.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2008 May, v. 82, no. 1 p.23-33dSpringer Netherlandsx0378-19097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-007-9246-1 7aarticle02747naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008700174300001800261520120100279650001801480650001601498650001701514650001101531650002101542650001601563650002301579650001101602650002101613650003901634650002301673650002401696650001401720651001601734653002501750653001901775653003801794653003901832653002101871700001801892700002501910700002301935773015001958852000902108856009202117930003302209946001102242655001202253IND4412774420221119222823.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441277442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01854.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, Denise C.10aFruit-based functional foods II: the process for identifying potential ingredients  ap. 2123-2129.  aDeveloping functional food products requires a structured approach for screening potential ingredients. Using the development of a product with antioxidant properties as a model, eight fruit juice concentrates were screened, including New Zealand fruits. The total phenolic content and the antioxidant capacity, using chemical-based assays (ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays), were determined. The potential to protect against oxidative stress in Jurkat cells was also determined. Results indicate that the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity in chemical-based assays were strongly correlated. However, the total phenolic content did not dictate the level of protection from oxidative stress in this cell-based model, suggesting that the type of phenolic compounds present and interactions between them may be important, although the activity of other compounds, such as vitamin C or carotenoids, may also be implicated. This model for screening ingredients may be used to design synergistic combinations of ingredients, and results may provide supportive evidence in the development of functional foods for this and other health targets. 3aascorbic acid 3acarotenoids 3afruit juices 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3ajuice concentrates 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aphenolic compounds 3aproduct development 3ascreening 3aNew Zealand 0aAntioxidant capacity 0acytoprotection 0aferric reducing antioxidant power 0aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 0aphenolic content1 aZhang, Jingli1 aStevenson, Lesley M.1 aSkinner, Margot A.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2008 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.2123-2129dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01854.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04431naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003600133040001800169100003300187245013300220300001800353500002400371506007600395520226800471506003702739650002502776650002702801650001502828650002002843650002202863650001302885650002102898650001802919650001402937650001402951650001802965650001202983650001002995650001903005650002803024650001603052650001003068650001503078650001003093650002503103650002303128650002103151650001003172650005803182650003303240650002203273650001103295650001803306650000903324650003703333650002603370650003203396650002303428650001603451651001203467700002203479700002503501773013703526852000903663856004903672655001203721IND4444544620221207082422.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444454462DNAL7 a210348782pmid7 aPMC30385512pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2010.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFollansbee-Junger, Katherine14aThe Influence of a Behavioral Weight Management Program on Disordered Eating Attitudes and Behaviors in Children with Overweight  ap. 1653-1659.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground Behavioral interventions targeting children with overweight have been successful in facilitating weight loss; however, there is concern that these programs produce disordered eating attitudes among youth. Objective The purpose of this research was to determine whether youth with overweight receiving one of two behavioral interventions were more likely to report an increase in disordered eating attitudes over time compared to a waitlist control and to determine psychosocial predictors of eating-disordered attitudes at 6-month follow-up. Design Participants were randomized to one of two behavioral lifestyle interventions or a waitlist control. Data were collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Participants/setting Participants were 68 youths with overweight, aged 8 to 13 years, and their parent(s) who lived in rural north central Florida. The project ran from January 2006 to January 2008. Intervention Each treatment condition consisted of 12 group sessions over 16 weeks. Main outcome measures Parents completed a demographic form and the Child Feeding Questionnaire. Children completed the Children's Eating Attitudes Test, Schwartz Peer Victimization Scale, and Children's Body Image Scale. Statistical analyses performed Mixed 2×2 analyses of variance were used to examine the effect of treatment on eating attitudes. Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess whether baseline levels of psychosocial variables predicted disordered eating attitudes at follow-up, controlling for baseline eating attitudes and treatment condition. Results Youth who participated in the behavioral interventions did not report significant increases in disordered eating attitudes over time compared to the waitlist control. Across all conditions, higher levels of body dissatisfaction, peer victimization, parent restrictive feeding practices, and concern for child weight at baseline predicted higher levels of disordered eating attitudes at follow-up. Conclusions These findings do not provide evidence that behavioral interventions lead to an increase in unhealthy eating attitudes and behaviors. Future research should examine the effects of incorporating eating disorder prevention in pediatric weight management programs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3aattitudes and opinions 3abody image 3achild nutrition 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aeating disorders 3aeating habits 3aingestion 3alifestyle 3alinear models 3aparents 3apeers 3aquestionnaires 3aweight control programs 3aweight loss 3ayouth 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAttitude to Health 2aBehavior Therapy 2aChild 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aOverweightxpsychologyxtherapy. 2aParentingxpsychology 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSocial Environment 2aWeight Loss 3aFlorida1 aJanicke, David M.1 aSallinen, Bethany J.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2010 Nov., v. 110, no. 11 p.1653-1659dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2010.08.005 7aarticle02652naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008200183300001600265500002400281520099600305650001201301650001301313650001101326650001101337650000901348650000901357650000901366650001401375650001101389650000901400650001201409650002201421650002301443650002101466650002101487650002901508650001101537650001401548650001901562650002101581650002401602650002101626650003201647650002101679650004101700650001901741651001501760651002201775651001101797653002301808653001701831653001101848773012201859852000901981856004801990655001202038IND4428296120221119222832.0091106e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442829612DNAL7 a190672062pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0646-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTepe, Yalçın10aMetal concentrations in eight fish species from Aegean and Mediterranean Seas  ap. 501-509.  aIncludes references  aThe concentrations of cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc were determined by ICP-AES in muscles and livers of eight fish species sampled from the Aegean and Mediterranean seas of Turkey.

The results suggest that nodules in the field do not exhibit an acetylene-linked decline, implying that they have a much larger diffusion resistance in the field than a controlled environment. There was good agreement between the maximum rates of nitrogen fixation, estimated using the acetylene reduction technique, and the maximum rates of nitrogen accumulation in the biomass above ground. This suggests that the acetylene technique can give an accurate measurement of nitrogenase activity over time periods of the order of hours and a useful daily measure of biological nitrogen fixation in the field; rates of nitrogen fixation below a depth of 0.2 m were negligible. When measurements of carbon dioxide were made by passing air upwards through the soil, steady state conditions were not achieved for several hours because of the diffusive flux from the surrounding soil. It is suggested that the unwanted inward diffusive flux can be prevented by ‘air-sealing’ the soil enclosure. 3anitrogen fixation 3alaboratory techniques 3aMedicago sativa 3aroot nodules 3aenvironmental factors 3aseasonal variation 3aacetylene 3aphotosynthesis 3ameasurement 3aEngland 0areduction 0arespiration 0adiffusion resistance 0aflow from roots 0aflow-through technique1 aWoodward, F.I.1 aGosse, G.0 tAnnals of botany.g1991 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.131-136wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088111  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02257naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245008300172300001600255520132200271650003701593650002201630650004301652650002201695650002501717653001101742773009201753852000901845856005701854939003301911946001101944655001201955IND9102455820221119222717.0910607e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910245582DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0881122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCauston, D.R.10aPlant growth analysis: the variability of relative growth rate within a sample  ap. 137-144.  aThere is indirect evidence in the literature that, when calculated by the classical method of growth analysis involving unrestricted random pairing of replicate plants between two harvests, the within-sample variability of mean relative growth rate is greater than it should be. An experiment is described in which two parallel batches of plants, each of four species, were grown in solution culture. The f. wts of all the replicate plants in one batch were measured non-destructively at each of four sampling times, while the other batch was sub-sampled destructively at the same times for both f. wts and d. wts. In general, within any one species, there were no differences between the mean RGRs over any one time interval, whether calculated from the f. wts of the continuously-monitored plants or from f. wts or d. wts of the sub-sampled plants. However, the within-sample variability of the continuously monitored plants was always lower, and usually much lower, than those of the sub-sampled plants. It was concluded that this result provided further indirect evidence that the true within-sample variability of RGR is lower than that indicated by classical growth analysis involving unrestricted random pairing. A correction factor, which may be applied to classical growth analysis experiments, is suggested. 3aBrassica oleracea var. gemmifera 3aHelianthus annuus 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aanalysis of variance 0agrowth0 tAnnals of botany.g1991 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.137-144wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088112  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02558naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245015700151300001600308500002400324520131300348650001101661650001501672650002001687650001601707650002401723650000901747650002001756650001301776650001601789650003501805650000901840651001501849700001601864700001901880700001501899700002101914700001701935700001601952773010801968852000902076856003902085655001202124IND4447911920221119222741.0110125e20110130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444791192DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.77392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, S.10aUsing eddy covariance and stable isotope mass balance techniques to estimate fog water contributions to a Costa Rican cloud forest during the dry season  ap. 429-437.  aIncludes references  aFog deposition, precipitation, throughfall and stemflow were measured in a windward tropical montane cloud forest near Monteverde, Costa Rica, for a 65-day period during the dry season of 2003. Net fog deposition was measured directly using the eddy covariance (EC) method and it amounted to 1·2 ± 0·1 mm day⁻¹ (mean ± standard error). Fog water deposition was 5-9% of incident rainfall for the entire period, which is at the low end of previously reported values. Stable isotope concentrations (δ¹⁸O and δ²H) were determined in a large number of samples of each water component. Mass balance-based estimates of fog deposition were 1·0 ± 0·3 and 5·0 ± 2·7 mm day⁻¹ (mean ± SE) when δ¹⁸O and δ²H were used as tracer, respectively. Comparisons between direct fog deposition measurements and the results of the mass balance model using δ¹⁸O as a tracer indicated that the latter might be a good tool to estimate fog deposition in the absence of direct measurement under many (but not all) conditions. At 506 mm, measured water inputs over the 65 days (fog plus rain) fell short by 46 mm compared to the canopy output of 552 mm (throughfall, stemflow and interception evaporation). This discrepancy is attributed to the underestimation of rainfall during conditions of high wind. 3acanopy 3adry season 3aeddy covariance 3aevaporation 3alabeling techniques 3arain 3astable isotopes 3astemflow 3athroughfall 3atropical montane cloud forests 3awind 3aCosta Rica1 aBurkard, R.1 aFrumau, K.F.A.1 aTobón, C.1 aBruijnzeel, L.A.1 aSiegwolf, R.1 aEugster, W.0 tHydrological processes.g2011 Jan. 30, v. 25, no. 3 p.429-437dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7739 7aarticle02948naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245012000186300001800306520137700324650001301701650001501714650002801729650006101757650001001818650002701828650001101855650001301866650001101879650000901890650002001899650002601919650003101945650003201976650005502008653002402063653003502087653002602122700001802148700001602166700002002182773010702202852000902309856009202318930003302410946001102443655001202454IND4424507820221119222918.0090814e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442450782DNAL7 a192363162pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02014.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Y. L.10aAmbient ozone modifies the effect of tumor necrosis factor G-308A on bronchitic symptoms among children with asthma  ap. 1342-1348.  aTumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has a recognized role in respiratory pathophysiology. One genetic variant (G-308A) in the promoter region affecting the expression of this cytokine may contribute to airway inflammatory diseases, but the studies on bronchitic symptoms were still inconclusive. Because ozone produces oxidative stress, increased airway TNF, and inflammation, the associations of the TNF-308 polymorphism with bronchitic symptoms may vary by ambient ozone exposure. We studied associations of TNF-308 genotype with bronchitic symptoms among asthmatic children in Children's Health Study. The association of TNF G-308A polymorphism with bronchitic symptoms was investigated and we also determined whether the associations vary with ambient ozone exposure. Asthmatic children with TNF-308 GG genotype had a significantly reduced risk of bronchitic symptoms with low-ozone exposure (adjusted OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.31-0.91). The risk was not reduced in children living in high-ozone communities (adjusted OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 0.75-2.70). This difference in genotypic effects between low- and high-ozone environments was statistically significant among asthmatics (P for interaction = 0.01), but insignificant among nonasthmatic children. Our findings suggest a role of gene-environmental interactions on the occurrence of bronchitic symptoms among children with asthma. 3achildren 2aAdolescent 2aAsthmaxphysiopathology 2aBronchial Hyperreactivityxchemically inducedxgenetics. 2aChild 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOzonextoxicity 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgeneticsximmunology. 0abronchitic symptoms 0agene-environmental interaction 0atumor necrosis factor1 aMcConnell, R.1 aBerhane, K.1 aGilliland, F.D.0 tAllergy.g2009 Sept., v. 64, no. 9 p.1342-1348dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02014.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090814b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02599naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245011600150300001400266520109200280650002401372650003401396650002401430650002301454650002301477650002201500650001801522650001201540650001001552650000801562650002701570650000901597650002201606650003401628650001101662650001101673650000901684650001601693650003601709650002501745651001301770653002101783653002601804653001601830700001901846700001501865700001501880773008701895852000901982939003301991945000802024946001302032655001202045991570658920742620221119222855.0930506s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930015082DNAL7 a12969822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennison, D.10aSatisfaction of senior citizens in a nutrition education program with and without computer-assisted instruction  ap. 15-31.  aThis study assessed the receptiveness of senior citizens to the use of microcomputers in a nutrition education program at participating senior citizen subsidized housing sites.

A validated Program Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered to assess overall satisfaction, satisfaction with the method of instruction, and satisfaction with the dietary analysis printout. Independent t-test analysis showed that group A was as satisfied as group B. The majority in group A indicated that learning to use the computer was not difficult and was "somewhat enjoyable" to "very enjoyable." These results indicated that senior citizens were receptive to CAI. Additionally, the use of the microcomputer with older adults was deemed possible for health-related educational programming. Appropriate modification of software was recommended to meet the physical limitations which occur with this age group. 3anutrition education 3acomputer-assisted instruction 3aeducational methods 3aeducation programs 3aprogram evaluation 3aelderly nutrition 3aeating habits 3aelderly 3awomen 3amen 3aattitudes and opinions 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aComputer-Assisted Instruction 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Sciencesxeducation 2aPatient Satisfaction 3aNew York 0alearning ability 0aprogram effectiveness 0acomparisons1 aDennison, K.F.1 aWard, J.Y.1 aWu, Y.W.B.0 tJournal of nutrition for the elderly.g1992, v. 12, no. 1 p.15-31x0163-93667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02359naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245009900170300001600269500001500285520117100300650001601471650001401487650002201501650001601523650001901539650002001558650001801578650001001596650002201606650001201628650002101640651001201661653000901673653001401682653001101696700001601707773009201723852000901815856005701824939003301881946001101914655001201925IND9102456120221119222703.0910607e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910245612DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0881162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahim, M.A.10aEffect of shade on leaf and cell size and number of epidermal cells in garlic (Allium sativum)  ap. 167-171.  a2019-12-04  aGarlic cultivars ‘Bangladesh Local’ and ‘Fructidor’ were grown under field conditions in the south-east of England and subjected to different shading treatments. The effects of shading on final leaf size were related to cell numbers and dimensions. An increase in light intensity reduced leaf length and size of epidermal cells. In the cv. Fructidor, cell length was reduced, but in the cv. Bangladesh Local, both length and width of cells were reduced. The stomatal index decreased with increasing light intensity in both cultivars. Leaf thickness increased with light intensity, resulting in corresponding gains in leaf d. wt per unit area. Data from cv. Fructidor growing in full sunlight indicated that the epidermal tissue adjacent to the abaxial leaf surface had a greater number of cells than that next to the adaxial surface, but no significant differences were found in the corresponding cell depths. The size of epidermal cells in both epidermises decreased from the base to tip of the leaf due to reduction in cell length and width. The influences of environmental factors on leaf growth in general, and those related to shade, are also discussed. 3atemperature 3acultivars 3aplant development 3acell growth 3aAllium sativum 3alight intensity 3acell division 3ashade 3agenetic variation 3astomata 3aplant morphology 3aEngland 0asize 0aepidermis 0aleaves1 aFordham, R.0 tAnnals of botany.g1991 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.167-171wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088116  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01039naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245004300135300001400178500001500192520027800207650001200485650001600497650002500513650002300538653001400561773008600575852001300661939003300674945000800707946001300715852000900728655001200737991570658500742620221119222701.0930506e199212  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930015052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiler, L.J.

They were tested against the results of multi-harvest, multi-N-level fertilizer field experiments on French beans, potatoes, tall fescue and winter wheat. Sub-critical values of % N measured at different times during the growing period were for each crop almost linearly related to relative growth rate, but the values of the regression coefficients varied from experiment to experiment. A single equation was developed that denned the % N in the dry matter at any time with any sub-optimal level of fertilizer-N, in terms of the plant d.wt per unit area of N-sufficient plants measured at that time, and the ratio of the growth rate coefficient (see below) of the N-deficient crop to that of the N-sufficient crop. Even though there were no other variables, the equation removed 86.5% of the variance of all the measured sub-optimal and critical values of % N for the different crops. The growth rate coefficient Kx(F) was defined by the eqn: (Formula) where W(F, t) is plant d.wt per unit area, t is time, x is a coefficient that is strongly correlated with Kx and F,t in parentheses indicates that the variable varies with the level of fertilizer and with time. Kx(F) was always almost constant for long periods of time at each level of fertilizer. This coefficient corrects for the effects of mass per se on growth rate. The apparent similarity in growth/% N relationships for different species was explained in terms of the high N-requirement for the photosynthetic apparatus, the similarity in photosynthetic rates and the low % N in storage and structural tissues. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aFestuca arundinacea 3achemical composition 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3anet assimilation rate 3aplant nutrition 3amathematical models 0adry matter 0agrowth1 aGastal, F.1 aLemaire, G.1 aDraycott, A.1 aMillard, P.1 aNeeteson, J.J.0 tAnnals of botany.g1991 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.181-190wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088118  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03185naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245013600176300001800312500002400330500001500354520145700369650001301826650001301839650001601852650001401868650001201882650001401894650001401908650001301922650001901935650001001954650001201964650001901976650001801995650004102013650003702054650001802091650002702109650001602136650002602152650002402178650002702202650005202229653001502281700002002296700001902316700002102335700002402356700002402380773011602404852000902520856007802529655001202607IND4397470720221119223102.0071104e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439747072DNAL7 a177206892pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm1692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAki, Toshihiko10aDistinct modulations of the hexokinase1-mediated glucose response and hexokinase1-independent processes by HYS1/CPR5 in Arabidopsis  ap. 3239-3248.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Arabidopsis mutant hypersenescence 1 (hys1), that is allelic to constitutive expresser of pathogenesis-related genes 5 (cpr5), displays phenotypes related to glucose signalling and defence responses. In the present study, it is shown that the hys1 mutation boosts the inhibitory effects of glucose upon the greening of seedlings and reduces the antagonistic activities of ethylene and cytokinin toward this inhibition. Neither the glucose content nor the sensitivities to ethylene, cytokinin, and abscisic acid were found to differ between wild-type and hys1 seedlings. However, disruption of the gene encoding hexokinase1 (HXK1), which acts as a glucose sensor, partially suppressed the glucose hypersensitive phenotype of the hys1 mutant. These results thus suggest that the hys1 mutation promotes a process associated with the HXK1-mediated glucose response during greening. By contrast, additional hys1 phenotypes, including an increase in salicylic acid (SA), production of abnormal trichomes, and early senescence, were not suppressed by the loss of HXK1. Surprisingly, the hxk1 and hys1 mutations acted synergistically towards an increased SA accumulation. Hence, HYS1/CPR5 appears to be a versatile protein that modulates both the HXK1-mediated glucose response and various HXK1-indepndent processes that are involved in growth control.

The modified lysozyme exhibited higher hydrophobicity (40,600 U/mg of protein) and lower enzymatic activity (1,020 U/mg of protein) than the hydrophobicity (890 U/mg of protein) and activity (17,950 U/mg of protein) of the lysozyme monomer. Portions of ground pork (150 g) without lysozyme or supplemented with 5 mg/g lysozyme or modified lysozyme and either not heated or heated at 60°C for 10 min were stored at 4 +/- 1°C and sampled at various times between 1 and 144 h. Meat color was not affected by either additive. After storage for 72 h, the mean odor score for meat supplemented with modified lysozyme and heated decreased from 5.0 at 1 h to 4.1, while the scores for all the other preparations were ≤3.2. After 144 h, the counts of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae in meat that was supplemented with modified lysozyme and not heated were, respectively, 1.1 and 0.9 log less than in the controls, and the numbers in such meat that was heated were, respectively, 1.2 and 2.4 log less than the numbers in the controls. The counts in meat supplemented with lysozyme and the controls were comparable. Heat treatment increased the bacteriostatic effect of modified lysozyme on gram-negative bacteria. 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPseudomonas 3aantibacterial properties 3acolor 3aenzyme activity 3aground pork 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3alysozyme 3aodors 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxpharmacology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnterobacteriaceaexdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Safety 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aMuramidasexpharmacology 2aSwine 2aTaste1 aSzablewski, Tomasz0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 Feb., v. 76, no. 2 p.338-342wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-0753Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle00958naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245003200115300001200147300001700159520032800176650002200504650001200526653002100538773008200559852000900641939003300650945000800683946001300691655001200704991570656200742620221119222626.0840213e198205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840041362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aAuthentic Mexican favorites  ap. 146.  ap. 146. ill.  aAlthough the fastest growing ethnic cuisine is Mexican food, several Mexican favorites are undiscovered by Americans.

The mRNA of HSP26 is present as a single mRNA species of 1.1 kilobase pairs in size and is detectable when maize seedlings are treated at 40 degrees C but not at 28 degrees C. Accumulation of HSP26 mRNA was detected after 10 minutes of incubation 40 degrees C, reaching the maximum level after 1 hour. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of maize HSP26 to other HSPs indicated a strong homology to the sequences of two nuclear encoded HSPs that are transported into the chloroplasts during heat shock: pea HSP21 and soybean HSP22. Maize HSP26 was also found to cross-react with anti-pea chloroplast HSP21 antibodies. Because of the sequence homology between maize HSP26, soybean HSP22, and pea HSP21, in vitro chloroplast protein import experiments were conducted. The in vitro synthesized maize HSP26 is specifically imported to the soluble fraction of the chloroplast and processed to a smaller polypeptide. The sequence homology and antibody cross-reactivity between maize HSP26 and pea HSP21 have allowed us to conclude that maize HSP26 is a nuclear-encoded, plastic-localized protein in maize. 3aZea mays 3agenetic code 3achloroplast DNA 3aheat stress 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 0acloning 0aDNA1 aVierling, E.1 aHo, T.H.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Aug., v. 93, no. 4 p.1321-1328x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04016naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100003000167245014600197300001600343500002400359520196400383650002602347650001502373650002902388650001302417650001702430650002402447650001602471650001902487650001202506650000702518650001402525650002402539650001402563650001602577650004002593650002702633650003402660650002802694650003202722650002602754650004002780650002702820650002202847650003102869650003002900650002902930650003802959650001602997650002403013700002803037700002603065700002303091700001703114700002303131700001703154773009803171852000903269856008803278655001203366IND4468133320221119222847.0130530s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446813332DNAL7 a234333832pmid7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-2752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Gonzáles, N.E.10aEffect of the Use of a Neutralizing Step after Antimicrobial Application on Microbial Counts during Challenge Studies for Orange Disinfection  ap. 328-332.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of using a neutralizer after applying antimicrobial treatments and the effect of time lapse between treatment application and subsequent recovery and enumeration of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella were investigated in Valencia oranges. Inoculated oranges surfaces were washed with distilled water for 15 s and then sprayed with a solution containing 200 mg/liter sodium hypochlorite (pH 6.5) for 15 s; they were then dipped in L-lactic acid (2.0% at 55°C) for 1 min or in distilled water at 80°C for 1 min. Posttreatment, oranges were divided into two groups. In the first group, oranges were dipped in neutralization treatment: 270 ml of buffered peptone water for 2 min for lactic acid-treated oranges, 270 ml of Dey-Engley broth for 2 min for chlorine-treated oranges, or 3.7 liters of tap water (25°C) for 10 s for hot water-treated oranges. The second group of treated oranges was not subjected to any neutralizer. All oranges then were kept at room temperature (average 26.2°C) and sampled at 0, 7.5, and 15 min for enumeration of surviving Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. The orange surface (30 cm2) was excised for pathogen enumeration. The presence of free chlorine and changes in pH and temperature on the orange surface were determined in uninoculated, treated oranges. Free chlorine was detected on oranges after treatment; the change in temperature of orange surfaces was greater during treatment with hot water than with lactic acid. Nevertheless, pathogen enumeration did not show any impact of neutralizer use on the residual activity of antimicrobials or any impact of the time elapsed between antimicrobial treatment and recovery of bacterial pathogens from inoculated oranges (P ≥ 0.05). The results of this study indicate that the lack of a neutralizing step before enumeration of pathogens is not likely to affect the accuracy of results during challenge studies to test pathogen reduction strategies on oranges. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSalmonella 3aantimicrobial properties 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3ahot water treatment 3alactic acid 3aneutralization 3aoranges 3apH 3apathogens 3asodium hypochlorite 3atap water 3atemperature 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxpharmacology 2aChlorinexpharmacology 2aCitrus sinensisxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aEscherichia coli O157xdrug effects 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactic Acidxpharmacology 2aSalmonellaxdrug effects 2aSodium Hypochloritexpharmacology 2aTemperature 2aWaterxpharmacology1 aMartínez-Cárdenas, C.1 aMartínez-Chávez, L.1 aRamos-Pérez, N.E.1 aTaylor, T.M.1 aUlloa-Franco, C.C.1 aCastillo, A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 Feb., v. 76, no. 2 p.328-332wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-2753Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03234naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001600188245009600204300001600300500002400316520132900340650001401669650002201683650003101705650001701736650001501753650002301768650001901791650002801810650001901838650001001857650001201867650002601879650001001905650001901915650001601934650001201950650003201962650002801994650001102022650000902033650005502042651001102097651002602108653002302134653002802157653002602185700001502211700002102226700001602247700002202263700001602285773010202301852000902403856009102412930003302503945002502536946001102561655001202572IND4438401320221119222643.0100611e20100701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443840132DNAL7 a204179782pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aP0501 aMunyeme, M.10aTuberculosis in Kafue lechwe antelopes (Kobus leche Kafuensis) of the Kafue Basin in Zambia  ap. 305-308.  aIncludes references  aTuberculosis (TB) has been reported in the Kafue lechwe antelopes (Kobus leche Kafuensis) of Zambia. However, previous reports are restricted to the southern parts in Lochinvar, where only old male animals were investigated. This study was conducted to gather epidemiological information on TB in Lechwe antelopes across sexes and age groups in relation to other explanatory variables of disease occurrence in the Kafue Basin. Animals were hunted under a special licence to investigate diseases in the Kafue Basin during the 2004, 2005 and 2008 hunting seasons. Histopathology, acid-fast staining and mycobacterial culturing from tissue samples were conducted. A total of 119 animals were slaughtered with an estimated age range of 2.5-20 years. Of these, 29 (24.3% [95% CI: 16.5, 32.3%]) had necropsy lesions suggestive of tuberculosis, of which 21 (17.6% [95% CI: 10.7, 24.6%]) tested positive on acid-fast staining while 33 (27.7% [95% CI: 19.6, 35.9%]) showed culture and colony morphological characteristics suggestive of Mycobacterium species. On univariate analysis, animals with poor body condition were twice as likely to have tuberculosis associated lesions as those having good body conditions (OR=2.3, 95% CI: 0.6, 9.3%).

In other species the albino phenotypes are associated with tyrosinase (TYR) gene mutations; therefore TYR was considered the candidate gene for albinism in mink. Four microsatellite markers were chosen in the predicted region of the TYR gene. Genotypes at the markers Mvi6025 and Mvi6034 were found to be associated with the albino phenotype within an extended half-sib family. A BAC clone containing Mvi6034 was mapped to chromosome 7q1.1-q1.3 by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Subsequent analysis of genomic TYR sequences from wild-type and albino mink samples identified a nonsense mutation in exon 1, which converts a TGT codon encoding cysteine to a TGA stop codon (c.138T>A, p.C46X; EU627590). The mutation truncates more than 90% of the normal gene product including the putative catalytic domains. The results indicate that the nonsense mutation is responsible for the albino phenotype in the American mink. 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3astop codon 3aNeovison vison 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3anonsense mutation 3aalbino 3achromosome mapping 3aactive sites 3agenomics 3agenotype 3amink 3aexons 3acysteine 3agenetic markers 2aAlbinismxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial 2aCodon, Nonsense 2aDNA Primers 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aMale 2aMinkxgenetics 2aMonophenol Monooxygenasexgenetics 2aPedigree 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 0aRegal White 0atyrosinase 0agenes1 aFredholm, M.1 aChristensen, K.1 aLeeb, T.0 tAnimal genetics.g2008 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.645-648dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2008.01788.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02636naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245005800145300001800203300002300221520162800244650001801872650001601890650001601906650002501922650002001947650000701967650001001974650001901984650002002003653002002023653001502043700001702058700001602075700001602091773007602107852000902183939003302192946001302225655001202238IND9005051620221119222808.0901015e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900505162DNAL7 a166676252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheibe, R.10aMalate dehydrogenases in guard cells of Pisum sativum  ap. 1358-1364.  ap. 1358-1364. ill.  aGuard cell protoplasts of Pisum sativum show considerable NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity in darkness which can be enhanced severalfold by illumination or treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT). The question arose whether guard cells possess and NADP-MDH different from that present in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll (which is inactivie in darkness or in the absence of DTT). MDH activities were determined in extracts of isolated protoplasts from mesophyll and epidermis, and in mechanically prepared epidermal pieces (with guard cells as the only living cells and no interference from proteases originating from the cell wall digesting enzymes). Guard cells possessed NAD-dependent MDHs of high activity and incomplete exclusion of NADP as a coenzyme. This NADP-dependent activity of the NAD-MDH(s) could not be stimulated by DTT or, inferentially, by light. The DTT- (and light-) dependent NADP-MDH represented 0.05% of the total protein of the guard cells and had a specific activity of 0.1 unit per milligram protein; both values are in the same range as the corresponding ones of the mesophyll cells. Agreement was also found in the extent of light activation, in subunit molecular weight, immunological cross-reactions, and in the behavior on an ion exchange column. The activity of the chloroplastic NADP-MDH in guard cells barely suffices to meet the malate requirement for stomatal opening in the light. It is therefore likely that NAD-MDHs residing in other compartments of the guard cells supplement the activity of the chloroplastic NADP-MDH particularly during stomatal opening in darkness. 3aPisum sativum 3aguard cells 3aprotoplasts 3amalate dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3apH 3alight 3adithiothreitol 3aNADP (coenzyme) 0alight relations 0aregulation1 aReckmann, U.1 aHedrich, R.1 aRaschke, K.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Aug., v. 93, no. 4 p.1358-1364x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03504naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245008900144300001600233500002400249520174700273650002302020650001702043650002502060650002102085650001502106650002902121650001802150650002802168650001502196650001802211650001802229650001702247650001302264650003702277650003502314650002502349650002302374650003502397650001102432650001102443650000902454650001602463650003102479650001702510650003402527700001602561700001902577700001702596700001402613700001602627700001602643700001602659700001702675700001802692773017102710852000902881655001202890IND4368141320221119222639.0050404e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436814132DNAL7 a151592282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrisco, S.10aLow plasma vitamin B-6 concentrations and modulation of coronary artery disease risk  ap. 992-998.  aIncludes references  aBackground: Low concentrations of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), the active metabolite of vitamin B-6, are associated with high C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Both low PLP and elevated inflammatory markers, such as high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen, are related to higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Objectives: The objectives were to evaluate the relation between PLP and acute-phase reactants in affecting CAD risk and to estimate the risk of CAD related to low plasma PLP, either alone or in combination with high concentrations of acute-phase reactants and other classic risk factors for CAD. Design: A case-control study was conducted with 742 participants: 475 with severe multivessel CAD and 267 free from coronary atherosclerosis (CAD-free). We measured plasma PLP, fibrinogen, hs-CRP, and serum lipid concentrations and all major biochemical CAD risk factors, including total homocysteine. Results: A significant, inverse, graded relation was observed between PLP and both hs-CRP and fibrinogen (P < 0.001). The prevalence of PLP concentrations in the lower half of the population (<50th percentile: 36.3 nmol/L) was significantly higher among CAD patients than among CAD-free subjects (P < 0.001). The odds ratio for CAD risk related to low PLP concentrations after adjustments for the major classic CAD risk factors, including hs-CRP and fibrinogen, was 1.89 (95% CI: 1.18, 3.03; P = 0.008). The CAD risk as a result of low PLP was additive when considered in combination with elevated hs-CRP concentrations or with an increased ratio of LDL to HDL. Conclusion: Low plasma PLP concentrations are inversely related to major markers of inflammation and independently associated with increased CAD risk. 3aC-reactive protein 3ablood lipids 3acase-control studies 3acoronary vessels 3afibrinogen 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alipid content 3alow density lipoprotein 3aodds ratio 3arelative risk 3arisk estimate 3arisk factors 3avitamins 2aAcute-Phase Proteinsxmetabolism 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCoronary Artery Diseasexblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPyridoxal Phosphatexblood 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin B 6 Deficiencyxblood1 aGirelli, D.1 aMartinelli, N.1 aOlivieri, O.1 aLotto, V.1 aBozzini, C.1 aPizzolo, F.1 aFaccini, G.1 aBeltrame, F.1 aCorrocher, R.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.992-998dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03714naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002500160245010900185300001600294500002400310520156300334650001401897650002001911650002401931650002801955650002001983650003702003650001802040650001502058650001802073650000802091650002302099650001202122650002202134650001902156650002402175650001002199650002702209650001402236650000902250650001002259650002102269650002002290650002802310650000902338650003802347650001102385650001602396650001102412650000902423650001602432650001902448650002202467650005202489650002402541651002602565700002102591700002502612700001402637700003402651700002202685700002002707700002202727700001802749773011102767852000902878856008102887655001202968IND4449819820221119222847.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444981982DNAL7 a212481952pmid7 a10.3945/jn.110.1337102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinknes, Kathrine J.10aDietary Intake of Protein Is Positively Associated with Percent Body Fat in Middle-Aged and Older Adults  ap. 440-446.  aIncludes references  aData on associations between dietary intake of macronutrients and body composition in the general population are sparse. This population-based, cross-sectional study of 4478 middle-aged (47-49 y) and elderly (71-74 y) men and women from the Hordaland Health Study in western Norway was conducted using a validated FFQ and measurements by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The relation between macronutrient intake [percentage of total energy intake (E%)] and percent body fat was investigated in the total population and in a subgroup with intermediate BMI and stable weight (BMI within the 25th-75th percentile and weight change <5% during the last 6 y; n = 975). In the total population, protein intake (E%) was associated with higher percent body fat (partial r = 0.11; P < 0.001) in multivariate linear regression analysis. In the subgroup with intermediate BMI and stable weight, there was no association between protein intake (E%) and percent body fat. Fat intake (E%) was positively associated (partial r = 0.07) whereas carbohydrate intake (E%) was inversely associated (partial r = -0.07) with percent body fat (P = 0.042 for both) in the subgroup with intermediate BMI and stable weight. Both in the total population and in the stable weight group, physical activity was inversely related to adiposity (partial r = -0.15 and -0.12, respectively; P < 0.001). Our results may explain some of the conflicting data on the effects of macronutrients in different populations and suggest the potential importance of protein intake as a factor in obesity. 3aadiposity 3abody mass index 3acarbohydrate intake 3across-sectional studies 3adietary protein 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aenergy intake 3afat intake 3alinear models 3amen 3amiddle-aged adults 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aprotein intake 3aregression analysis 3awomen 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdiposity 2aAged 2aAging 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxadverse effects 2aFemale 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotor Activity 2aNutrition Surveys 2aOverweightxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aSex Characteristics 0aNorwayxepidemiology.1 ade Vogel, Stefan1 aElshorbagy, Amany K.1 aNurk, Eha1 aDrevon, C.

Samples were analysed quantitatively using a modified McMaster egg counting technique. Whenever a faecal egg count (FEC) result exceeded 250eggs per gram (EPG), the horse was treated with pyrantel, ivermectin or moxidectin. In 52 of 129 horses (40.3%), no strongyle eggs were ever detected over the course of 9 months. In 39 horses (30.2%), strongyle eggs were detected in at least 1 sample, but the egg count never exceeded 250EPG. The remaining 38 (29.5%) horses were treated at least once in response to a FEC that exceeded 250EPG. As a result of this selective anthelmintic scheme, the total number of anthelmintic treatments was reduced to 54% of the number of treatments administered to the same horses in the previous year. Both the maximum and mean FEC dropped significantly after initiation of the study. A statistically significant, negative correlation was demonstrated between the maximum and mean FEC of a horse and its age. Pasture hygiene appeared to reduce FECs, but the effect was not statistically significant. The magnitude of the initial FEC was significantly correlated with the maximum FECs in the subsequent 8 months (p <0.01). The same relationship was observed for the maximum FEC of the first 2 samples. Furthermore, horses which required several anthelmintic treatments had a higher initial FEC and a greater maximum FEC in the first 2 samples than horses which received only one or no treatment. These results suggest that selective anthelmintic treatment accomplished a reduced pasture contamination with strongyle eggs, while simultaneously decreasing the number of anthelmintic treatments. Sustained implementation of a selective treatment strategy has the potential to reduce selection pressure for anthelmintic resistance. These results reported herein will assist equine practitioners in designing and monitoring sustainable anthelmintic treatment programs. 3ahorses 3ahorse diseases 3aStrongylidae 3apyrantel 3aivermectin 3amoxidectin 3adrug therapy 3aova 3anematode infections 3adisease prevalence 3aepidemiological studies 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Diseasesxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aHorses 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aSeasons 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aStrongyle Infections, Equinexdrug therapyxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aStrongyloideaxgrowth & development 3aAustria 3aGermany 0aAustriaxepidemiology. 0aGermanyxepidemiology. 0aegg shedding 0aselective treatment1 aMahling, M.1 aNielsen, M.K.1 aPfister, K.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 July 15, v. 171, no. 1-2 p.116-122dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/08/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02632naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002800184245010200212300001600314500002400330500001500354520105300369650001401422650001601436650000901452650002001461650003001481650001701511650001601528650002001544650002101564650002701585650002701612650003101639650001801670650001801688650001901706651001001725651001201735653001601747700001301763700001601776700001701792773009101809852000901900856008801909930003301997945002502030946001102055655001202066IND4438409020221119222820.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443840902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2010.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF120 0aJ710 0aF2001 aFernández-Aparicio, M.10aIntercropping reduces Mycosphaerella pinodes severity and delays upward progress on the pea plant  ap. 744-750.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMycosphaerella pinodes is a serious pea disease of worldwide distribution. The increasing interest of sustainable tools for disease control, together with the lack of sufficient levels of genetic resistance has brought our interest in the use of intercropping as a tool for management of this disease. Effect of intercropping on M. pinodes severity was studied in field experiments performed in Spain and Tunisia, in which a susceptible pea cultivar was grown as monocrop and as two species mixed intercrop with either faba bean, barley, oat, triticale or wheat. Disease was significantly reduced in terms of both percent of diseased tissue per plant and vertical progress of lesions when pea was intercropped. Faba bean and triticale intercropped with pea showed the highest suppressive ability with above 60% of disease reduction. Oat, barley and wheat showed low to moderate M. pinodes suppressive effects. Suppressive effects can be ascribed to a combined reduction of host biomass, altered microclimate and physical barrier to spore dispersal. 3acultivars 3agrain crops 3apeas 3aspore dispersal 3afungal diseases of plants 3amicroclimate 3ahost plants 3adisease control 3adisease severity 3aMycosphaerella pinodes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aintegrated pest management 3aintercropping 3aPisum sativum 3adisease course 3aSpain 3aTunisia 0afield crops1 aAmri, M.1 aKharrat, M.1 aRubiales, D.0 tCrop protection.g2010 July, v. 29, no. 7 p.744-750dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2010.02.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02690naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011600130300001800246500002800264500001500292520148400307650002401791650002601815650001201841650002401853650002901877650002801906650001501934650002201949650002101971650001101992650001302003653001202016700002402028700002102052700002502073700002002098773014002118852000902258946001302267655001202280IND4412909520221119223014.0081121s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441290952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsili, Enrico10aMicrobial Biofilm Voltammetry: Direct Electrochemical Characterization of Catalytic Electrode-Attached Biofilms  ap. 7329-7337.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-12-06  aWhile electrochemical characterization of enzymes immobilized on electrodes has become common, there is still a need for reliable quantitative methods for study of electron transfer between living cells and conductive surfaces. This work describes growth of thin (<20 μm) Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms on polished glassy carbon electrodes, using stirred three-electrode anaerobic bioreactors controlled by potentiostats and nondestructive voltammetry techniques for characterization of viable biofilms. Routine in vivo analysis of electron transfer between bacterial cells and electrodes was performed, providing insight into the main redox-active species participating in electron transfer to electrodes. At low scan rates, cyclic voltammetry revealed catalytic electron transfer between cells and the electrode, similar to what has been observed for pure enzymes attached to electrodes under continuous turnover conditions. Differential pulse voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy also revealed features that were consistent with electron transfer being mediated by an adsorbed catalyst. Multiple redox-active species were detected, revealing complexity at the outer surfaces of this bacterium. These techniques provide the basis for cataloging quantifiable, defined electron transfer phenotypes as a function of potential, electrode material, growth phase, and culture conditions and provide a framework for comparisons with other species or communities. 3aanaerobic digesters 3aquantitative analysis 3abiofilm 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aGeobacter sulfurreducens 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrochemistry 3acarbon 3abacteria 0aenzymes1 aRollefson, Janet B.1 aBaron, Daniel B.1 aHozalski, Raymond M.1 aBond, Daniel R.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology AEM.g2008 Dec. 1, v. 74, no. 23 p.7329-7337dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle01853naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012600125300001600251300002100267520086100288650001301149650001701162650001301179650001301192650001901205650000801224650001401232650001501246650001601261650002001277650001601297700001701313700001901330773007501349852000901424939003301433946001301466655001201479IND8906597820221119222942.0891215e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890659782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEskins, K.10aLight quality and irradiance level interaction in the control of expression of light-harvesting complex of photosystem II  ap. 163-169.  ap. 163-169. ill.  aEffects of red and blue light at irradiances from 1.6 to 28.3 micromolar per square meter per second on chloroplast pigments, light-harvesting pigment-proteins associated with photosystem II, and the corresponding mRNA were evaluated in maize (Zea mays L.) plants (OP Golden Bantum) grown for 14 days under 14 hours light/10 hours dark cycles. Accumulation of pigments, pigment-proteins, and mRNA was less in blue than in red light of equal irradiance. The difference between blue and red light, however, varied as a function of irradiance level, and the pattern of this variation suggests irradiance-controlled activation/deactivation (switching) of blue-light receptor.

The adsorption time and ionic strength were varied to study their effect on the localisation of the adsorbed PAH. The microscopy showed that a long adsorption time, 24 h, and a high ionic strength, 10⁻¹ M NaCl + 5 x 10⁻³ M NaHCO₃ or higher, resulted in the adsorption of polyallylamine throughout the fibre walls. Shorter adsorption times and/or lower ionic strength resulted in adsorption only to the fibre exterior. By preparing sheets from fibres with polyelectrolyte adsorbed either to the exterior parts or into the fibre cell wall and testing their mechanical behaviour, a link was established between the localisation of adsorbed polyelectrolyte and the mechanical properties. Adsorption to the fibre exterior led to an increase in tensile strength and strain at break. The creep deformation at 90%RH was also slightly reduced by the adsorption of low molecular weight PAH (15 kDa). When polyallylamine was adsorbed throughout the wall of the lignocellulosic fibres, the mechanical properties were not however improved and the creep deformation at 90%RH actually increased somewhat. 3aadsorption 3acell walls 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent labeling 3aionic strength 3amolecular weight 3apaper 3asodium chloride 3atensile strength1 aWågberg, Lars0 tCellulose.g2009 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.87-101dSpringer Netherlandsx0969-02397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-008-9240-6 7aarticle02756naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001200168245013000180300001800310500002400328500001500352520122700367650002301594650001501617650001101632650001101643650002801654650001101682650001501693650002701708650001101735650002201746650001801768650002901786650001601815650002301831650001301854650001101867650001201878653001701890700001701907700001801924700001301942773009101955852000902046856009002055930003302145945002502178946001102203655001202214IND4438637520221119222804.0100618e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443863752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aW0001 aOda, Y.10aEthanol fermentation of sugar beet thick juice diluted with crude cheese whey by the flex yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus KD-15  ap. 1263-1266.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aKluyveromyces marxianus KD-15, called flex yeast, is a strain that is insensitive to catabolite repression and has the capacity to produce ethanol efficiently from a mixture of beet molasses and whey powder. When a fermentation test was conducted in 50 mL of a medium containing 200 mg mL−1 of sugar as sugar beet thick juice diluted with an arbitrary amount of crude whey, strain KD-15 produced over 99 mg mL−1 ethanol in all the media tested, and ethanol formation decreased in proportion to the volume of whey by K. marxianus NBRC 1963, the parental strain of KD-15, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae NBRC 0224, the reference strain for conventional ethanol production. Fermentation of thick juice diluted with whey alone by strain KD-15 at 30 °C initially proceeded slower than that at 33 °C–37 °C but finally bore the highest level of ethanol. The maximum ethanol concentration obtained in 1.5 L of a medium using a 2-L fermentor was elevated by aeration of 15–50 mL min−1and reduced by that in excess of 100 mL min−1. Under optimized conditions in 72 h, strain KD-15 converted all of the sugars derived from thick juice and whey to ethanol at 102 mg mL−1, corresponding to 92.9% of the theoretical yield. 3atemporal variation 3asugar beet 3ajuices 3asugars 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3avolume 3afermenters 3aalcoholic fermentation 3ayeasts 3awaste utilization 3aculture media 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acheese whey 3aethanol production 3akinetics 3ayields 3aethanol 0aoptimization1 aNakamura, K.1 aShinomiya, N.1 aOhba, K.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2010 Aug., v. 34, no. 8 p.1263-1266dPergamonx0961-95347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.03.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03379naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100002800157245017700185300001600362500002400378500001500402520159500417650001702012650002702029650002602056650002102082650003102103650003002134650001602164650002802180650001402208650001302222650001702235650000902252650001402261650002602275650001402301650002402315650002302339650001602362650001202378650001402390651001102404653001702415700002102432700003402453700002102487700002402508773009102532852000902623856008802632930003302720945002502753946001102778655001202789IND4438408020221119222643.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443840802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2010.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aNegrisoli, Aldomario S.10aEfficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes (Nematoda: Rhabditida) and insecticide mixtures to control Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in corn crops  ap. 677-683.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe main insect pest in Brazilian corn is fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) can be used to control this pest, and can be applied together with various insecticides. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of mixtures of EPNs and insecticides to control S. frugiperda in corn crops. In laboratory bioassays three species of EPNs were tested (Heterorhabditis indica, Steinernema carpocapsae and Steinernema glaseri) together with 18 registered insecticides to control S. frugiperda in corn. Efficacy of association between insecticides and EPNs on S. frugiperda larvae was evaluated against the insect's third instar, 2 and 4 days after applications in laboratory. Experiments in the field were performed in two consecutive years, with located application of H. indica and S. carpocapsae (250 IJs/cm²) mixed with chlorpyrifos (0.3 L/ha) and lufenuron (0.15 L/ha) on the corn husk. In laboratory, after two days exposure the interaction between chlorpyrifos and H. indica was synergistic, while interaction with cypermethrin, spinosad, methoxyfenozide and deltamethrin + triazofos was additive, as was interaction between lufenuron, chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin with S. carpocapsae. In contrast, the interaction between chlorpyrifos (Vexter(TM) and Lorsban(TM)) and lufenuron with S. glaseri was synergistic. In the field, the best treatment was the mixture of H. indica with lufenuron (0.15 L/ha), with 62.5% and 57.5% larval mortality in the two evaluation years in the field, respectively. 3achlorpyrifos 3aHeterorhabditis indica 3afield experimentation 3aapplication rate 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3abiological control agents 3aplant pests 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3asynergism 3aZea mays 3ainsect pests 3acorn 3abioassays 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3amortality 3aSteinernema glaseri 3abiological control 3agrain crops 3ainstars 3alufenuron 3aBrazil 0ainsecticides1 aGarcia, Mauro S.1 aBarbosa Negrisoli, Carla R.C.1 aBernardi, Daniel1 ada Silva, Alexandre0 tCrop protection.g2010 July, v. 29, no. 7 p.677-683dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2010.02.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100911b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02833naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002300177245014000200300001800340500002400358500001500382520117200397650002101569650002001590650002701610650001001637650001601647650001301663650001901676650002801695650001201723650002001735650002401755650001401779650001601793650001301809650001501822650002001837650002701857650001601884651001401900653001301914700002201927700002401949700002301973773009101996852000902087856009002096930003302186945002502219946001102244655001202255IND4438635420221119222745.0100618e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443863542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aS100 0aP1201 aMarasabessy, Ahmad10aCoconut oil extraction by the traditional Java method: An investigation of its potential application in aqueous Jatropha oil extraction  ap. 1141-1148.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA traditional Java method of coconut oil extraction assisted by paddy crabs was investigated to find out if crabs or crab-derived components can be used to extract oil from Jatropha curcas seed kernels. Using the traditional Java method the addition of crab paste liberated 54% w w-1 oil from grated coconut meat. Oil extraction using crab paste carried out under controlled temperatures and in the presence of antibiotics showed that enzymes from crab played a dominant role in liberating oil from grated coconut meat and aqueous J. curcas kernel slurries when incubated at 30 °C or 37 °C. However, at higher temperature (50 °C), thermophilic bacterial strains present inside crabs played a significant role in the extraction of oil from both oilseeds tested. A thermophilic bacterial strain isolated from crab paste and identified based on 16s rRNA sequence as Bacillus licheniformis strain BK23, when added as starter culture, was able to liberate 60% w w-1 oil from aqueous J. curcas kernel slurry after 24 h at 50 °C. Further studies of BK23 and extraction process optimization are the challenges to improve Jatropha oil extraction yield and process economy. 3astarter cultures 3aJatropha curcas 3atraditional technology 3acrabs 3acoconut oil 3aslurries 3aCocos nucifera 3anonfood animal products 3aenzymes 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3aoil crops 3amethodology 3acoconuts 3aextraction 3aenzyme activity 3aBacillus licheniformis 3afruit crops 3aIndonesia 0aoilseeds1 aMoeis, Maelita R.1 aSanders, Johan P.M.1 aWeusthuis, Ruud A.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2010 Aug., v. 34, no. 8 p.1141-1148dPergamonx0961-95347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.03.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02413naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003000164245012200194300001600316500002400332520096700356650001101323650002401334650002801358650002101386650001501407650001601422650001401438650002201452650001701474650001001491650001101501650003701512650002501549650003001574650002801604650003001632650005001662650002401712650001401736651001901750700002001769773008501789852000901874856004801883655001201931IND4422127320221119222611.0090619e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442212732DNAL7 a193778972pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-009-1345-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, Alison Elizabeth10aTrade-offs between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal competitive ability and host growth promotion in Plantago lanceolata  ap. 807-816.  aIncludes references  aIn this study we tested for trade-offs between the benefit arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi provide for hosts and their competitive ability in host roots, and whether this potential trade-off shifts in the presence of a plant stress (herbivory). We used three species of AM fungi previously determined to vary in host growth promotion and spore production in association with host plants. We found that these AM fungal species competed for root space, and the best competitor, Scutellospora calospora, was the worst mutualist. In addition, the worst competitor, Glomus white, was the best mutualist. Competition proved to have stronger effects on fungal infection patterns than herbivory, and competitive dominance was not altered by herbivory. We found a similar pattern in a previous test of competition among AM fungi, and we discuss the implications of these results for the persistence of the mutualism and feedbacks between AM fungi and their plant hosts. 3aGlomus 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aScutellospora calospora 3agrowth promotion 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3amutualism 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplant stress 3aroots 3aspores 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aGlomeromycotaxphysiology 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPlantagoxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosis 0aNorth Carolina1 aBever, James D.0 tOecologia.g2009 July, v. 160, no. 4 p.807-816dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1345-6 7aarticle01887naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245008100143300001400224300001900238500001500257520090100272650002501173650002201198650002201220650001101242650001601253650002101269653001701290653002101307700001901328700001901347700001901366773007301385852000901458939003301467946001301500655001201513IND9005333420221119222701.0901031e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900533342DNAL7 a166677162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuh, S.G.10aPurification and characterization of the 22-kilodalton potato tuber proteins  ap. 40-45.  ap. 40-45. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThree abundant proteins of approximate molecular masses of 22, 23, and 24 kilodaltons were purified from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers by DEAE cellulose and CM-52 cellulose ion exchange column chromatography, electroelution, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Antibodies specific to the gel-purified 22-kilodalton protein were prepared. Immunoblot analysis showed that the 22-, 23-, and 24-kilodalton proteins are immunologically related and that these proteins are present in tubers and as higher molecular mass forms in leaves, but not in stems, roots, and stolons. The ratios of amino acid composition were compared among the three purified proteins, and the amino-terminal amino acid sequences were determined for these three proteins.

Slot blot analysis employing an oat beta-tubulin cDNA clone was used to measure beta-tubulin mRNA levels. White light induced a 45% decrease in oat beta-tubulin mRNA abundance by 2 hours after transfer. A saturating red light pulse induced 40 and 55% decreases in beta-tubulin mRNA levels in oats and barley, respectively. Recovery of beta-tubulin mRNA levels was observed after a red light pulse but not after transfer to continuous white light. The red light induced decrease in oat beta-tubulin mRNA abundance was not reversible by a subsequent far-red light treatment. The mesocotyl portion of etiolated oat seedlings exhibited a more dramatic decrease in beta-tubulin mRNA abundance in response to red light than did the coleoptile portion. The results indicate that the well-documented effects of red light on the growth of etiolate seedlilngs are accompanied by changes in the expression of the beta-tubulin genes. 3aAvena sativa 3aHordeum vulgare 3aseedlings 3amesocotyls 3acoleoptiles 3aplant proteins 3amessenger RNA 3achemical composition 3agene expression 3ared light 3afar-red light 3awhite light 3agenomics 3aetiolation 0aregulation1 aCostigan, S.A.1 aZhao, Z.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.1196-1202x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245007700169300001600246500002400262520149900286650002401785650002001809650001401829650002401843650000901867650001501876650001301891650001801904650001001922650001901932650001801951650001301969650002201982650001202004700001902016700002302035773008502058852000902143856004802152655001202200IND4415083620221119222819.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441508362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-008-1174-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShurin, Jonathan B.10aSpatial autocorrelation and dispersal limitation in freshwater organisms  ap. 151-159.  aIncludes references  aDispersal can limit the ranges of species and the diversity of communities. Despite its importance, little is known about its role in freshwater habitats and its relation to habitat type (lentic vs. lotic), especially for organisms with cryptic dispersal methods such as plankton. Poor dispersers are expected to show more clumped distributions or greater spatial autocorrelation (SA) in community composition than good dispersers. We examined patterns of SA across freshwater taxa with different dispersal modes (active vs. passive) and their association with habitat type (lake vs. stream) using 18 spatially explicit community composition data sets. We found significant relationships between SA and body size among taxa in lake habitats, but not in streams. However, the increase in SA with body size in lakes was driven entirely by fishes--organisms ranging in size from diatoms to macro-invertebrates showed equivalent levels of SA. These results support the idea that large organisms are less effective dispersers in aquatic environments, resulting in greater SA in community structure over broad scales. Streams may be effectively more connected than lakes as patterns of SA and body size were weaker in lotic habitats. Our data suggest that the critical threshold where greater body size increases dispersal limitation seems to come at the juncture between invertebrates and vertebrates rather than that between unicellular and multicellular organisms as has been previously suggested. 3aaquatic environment 3aautocorrelation 3abody size 3acommunity structure 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3aplankton 3aspecies diversity 3astreams1 aCottenie, Karl1 aHillebrand, Helmut0 tOecologia.g2009 Feb., v. 159, no. 1 p.151-159dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1174-z 7aarticle01354naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245003100130300001400161300002800175520057600203650001500779650001800794650002000812650002400832653002300856653001300879773007200892852001300964939003300977945000801010946001301018852000901031655001201040991570641580742620221119222655.0860507e198511  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860104572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLingle, R.10aRobotics: thought for food  ap. 61-64.  ap. 61-64. ill., charts.  aThe increase in US industrial usage of robotics and their potential and probable use in the US food industry are discussed.

The C4.5-classification algorithm was used to detect threshold values of management decisions relating to sows' replacement. In order to generate side-effect-free data, three pig production herds, each on a different performance level, were created using a Monte Carlo simulation. The results of applying the C4.5-algorithm on simulated datasets showed different threshold values within the trees depending on sow herd performance. The evaluation parameters differed due to the adjusted number of instances per class and the dataset size. The sensitivity reached a value of 42.1-72.7%, the kappa value was 44.5-78.1%, and the error rate fluctuated between 6.0 and 31.3%. The overall classification accuracy ranged from 85.8 to 93.4% and the specificity reached a value of 93.7-98.8%. The generated decision trees, visualising the threshold values, varied their number of leaves between 2 and 31 and the number of nodes from 3 to 61. 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3aherds 3alearning 3aleaves 3asows 3atrees1 aTolle, K.H.1 aKrieter, J.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2004 Feb., v. 42, no. 2 p.111-127dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001800147245010400165300001800269500002400287520121600311650003501527650001601562650001601578650001601594650001901610650003301629650001701662650002201679650002301701650001301724650002601737650001801763650003201781653001501813700002201828700001801850773010101868852000901969856006901978930003302047945002502080946001302105655001202118IND4438625820221119222916.0100618e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443862582DNAL7 a1279-12862doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF840 0aF2001 aSissons, Mike14aThe Blackpoint Status of Selected Tetraploid Species and Australian Durum Wheats and Breeding Lines  ap. 1279-1286.  aIncludes references  aBlackpoint (BPt) is a brown or black discoloration at the germ end of the grain and occurs in most locations where durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desf.) Husn.] is grown throughout the world. Its presence causes downgrading at market due to the undesirable black specks in semolina and derived pasta. Durum wheat appears to show different genetic susceptibilities to developing BPt; however, there are no extensive studies on this. This study aimed to survey the range of BPt sensitivity mainly in T. turgidum ssp. durum and to identify genotypes with low levels for future breeding efforts. In this study field methods were developed to reliably induce BPt symptoms in durum wheat. Using this approach, a wide range of durum wheat genotypes were evaluated for their BPt sensitivity status in comparison to selected Australian durum wheat cultivars and breeding lines. Only material giving consistently low BPt score (i.e., tolerant, defined as the mean BPt percentage being < or = 10% over years) was identified as suitable for future introgression into a durum wheat breeding program. Several new sources of reduced susceptibility to BPt have been found and are being used in a breeding program. 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3adurum wheat 3agrain crops 3atetraploidy 3abreeding lines 3aplant diseases and disorders 3acrop quality 3agenetic variation 3agenetic resistance 3agenotype 3afield experimentation 3aintrogression 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 0ablackpoint1 aSissons, Shaylene1 aEgan, Narelle0 tCrop science.g2010 , v. 50, no. 4 p.1279-1286dCrop Science Society of Americax0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/1279-12863Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/09  aOther US 7aarticle01985naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245006300134300001400197300002800211520115200239650001501391650002201406650002401428650002201452650002301474650002001497653001001517773008101527852000901608939003301617945000801650946001301658655001201671991570639740742620221119222901.0840213e198204  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840041502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzybyla, Ann.10aSpices & seasonings--new products demand creative new uses  ap. 81-84.  ap. 81-84. ill., charts.  aThe food scientist is constantly challenged to develop unique processed foods. Selecting spices and seasonings is critical to product differentiation. Respondents in a trade survey listed consistent quality and good taste as major factors in a successful product. The potential for ethnic convenience foods and beverages was highly rated. Mexican food is the fastest growing ethnic cuisine; spices and seasonings are crucial in developing the heat level in these foods. Taste panels assist in determining the consumer's preferences. Often processors start with a low spice usage level which is gradually increased as the product is tested with panelists. Onion and garlic will blend with other spices to develop a unique flavor combination. Commercially available spices are sold in various forms (whole, ground, blends, dispersed spices, liquid spices etc.). Ease of dispersion, appearance, cost, and storability determine which spice form is used. Proper spice storage includes storing in an airtight container, keeping cool, and rotating frequently. A taste for more highly spiced food is expected to continue the increase of spice usage.

Many of these challenges occur repeatedly during a plant's lifetime, and their sequence and timing can profoundly influence the fitness outcome of a plant's response. The ability to perceive, store and recall previous stressful events is likely useful for efficient, rapid and cost-effective responses, but we know very little about the mechanisms involved. Using jasmonate-elicited anti-herbivore defence responses as an example, we consider how 'memories' of previous attacks could be created in (1) the biosynthetic processes involved in the generation of the oxylipin bursts elicited by herbivore attacks; (2) the perception of oxylipins and their transduction into cellular events by transcription factors and transcriptional activators; and (3) the role of small RNAs in the formation of long-term stress imprints in plants. 3amemory 3aplant response 3aplant stress 3atranscription factors 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aCell Wall 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Development 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStress, Physiological 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscriptional Activation1 aGAQUEREL, EMMANUEL1 aPANDEY, SHREE P.1 aBaldwin, Ian T.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.617-627dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01862.x 7aarticle02666naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163100001700172245009600189300001800285500002400303520146700327650001101794650001601805650002001821650001701841651001501858700001801873700001601891773014901907852000902056856009402065856006202159930003302221945002502254946001302279655001202292IND4384227020221119222910.0061011e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438422702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb04515.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aJ8001 aLarsen, E.W.10aCumulative Effective Stream Power and Bank Erosion on the Sacramento River, California, USA  ap. 1077-1097.  aIncludes references  aBank erosion along a river channel determines the pattern of channel migration. Lateral channel migration in large alluvial rivers creates new floodplain land that is essential for riparian vegetation to get established. Migration also erodes existing riparian, agricultural, and urban lands, sometimes damaging human infrastructure (e.g., scouring bridge foundations and endangering pumping facilities) in the process. Understanding what controls the rate of bank erosion and associated point bar deposition is necessary to manage large alluvial rivers effectively. In this study, bank erosion was proportionally related to the magnitude of stream power. Linear regressions were used to correlate the cumulative stream power, above a lower flow threshold, with rates of bank erosion at 13 sites on the middle Sacramento River in California. Two forms of data were used: aerial photography and field data. Each analysis showed that bank erosion and cumulative effective stream power were significantly correlated and that a lower flow threshold improves the statistical relationship in this system. These correlations demonstrate that land managers and others can relate rates of bank erosion to the daily flow rates of a river. Such relationships can provide information concerning ecological restoration of floodplains related to channel migration rates as well as planning that requires knowledge of the relationship between flow rates and bank erosion rates. 3arivers 3astream flow 3astream channels 3abank erosion 3aCalifornia1 aFremier, A.K.1 aGreco, S.E.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2006 Aug., v. 42, no. 4 p.1077-1097dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb04515.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20061115b20061202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/11/15  aOther US 7aarticle04352naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166072001700184072001700201100002000218245009300238300001800331500001500349506007600364520172800440506003702168650002002205650001602225650002002241650002302261650001602284650003002300650005302330650001402383650002502397650000902422650001702431650003002448650001502478650001002493650002102503650000902524650002002533650006202553650001002615650002802625650001902653650001102672650001102683650000902694650001602703650002202719650002302741650002802764650003202792650002102824650002102845650004102866650007002907650003202977650001603009651001803025653001803043653001903061700002703080700002103107700002803128700002703156700002503183773013903208852000903347856008303356930003303439945002503472946001303497655001203510IND4413671120221207081317.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441367112DNAL7 a190645112pmid7 aPMC27458302pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.261822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

OBJECTIVE: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) to compare serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the US population in 2000-2004 with those in 1988-1994 and to identify contributing factors. DESIGN: Serum 25(OH)D was measured with a radioimmunoassay kit in 20 289 participants in NHANES 2000-2004 and in 18 158 participants in NHANES III (1988-1994). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight. Milk intake and sun protection were assessed by questionnaire. Assay differences were assessed by re-analyzing 150 stored serum specimens from NHANES III with the current assay. RESULTS: Age-adjusted mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations were 5-20 nmol/L lower in NHANES 2000-2004 than in NHANES III. After adjustment for assay shifts, age-adjusted means in NHANES 2000-2004 remained significantly lower (by 5-9 nmol/L) in most males, but not in most females. In a study subsample, adjustment for the confounding effects of assay differences changed mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations by [almost equal to]10 nmol/L, and adjustment for changes in the factors likely related to real changes in vitamin D status (ie, BMI, milk intake, and sun protection) changed mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations by 1-1.6 nmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, mean serum 25(OH)D was lower in 2000-2004 than 1988-1994. Assay changes unrelated to changes in vitamin D status accounted for much of the difference in most population groups. In an adult subgroup, combined changes in BMI, milk intake, and sun protection appeared to contribute to a real decline in vitamin D status.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3afood intake 3asolar radiation 3anutritional status 3ablood serum 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3alifestyle 3alongitudinal studies 3amilk 3afood choices 3anutrition risk assessment 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Distribution 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aBone Density Conservation Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDairy Products 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aNutritional Status 2aPopulation Surveillance 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRadioimmunoassay 2aSex Distribution 2aSunscreening Agentsxadverse effects 2aVitamin Dxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxblood 2aYoung Adult 3aUnited States 0aeating habits 0asun protection1 aPfeiffer, Christine M.1 aLacher, David A.1 aSchleicher, Rosemary L.1 aPicciano, Mary Frances1 aYetley, Elizabeth A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Dec., v. 88, no. 6 p.1519-1527dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.261823Available from publisher's Web site  a20110625b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/01/20  aOther US 7aarticle01843naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003200110245009100142300001600233520085800249650001101107650001801118650001801136650001101154650001101165650001601176700002101192700002101213700002401234773012201258852000901380856008201389939003301471946001301504655001201517IND4481044120221119223202.0140515e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448104412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Brianq(Brian R.)10aReducing Self-Selection Bias in Feeder Cattle Premium Estimates Using Matched Sampling  ap. 124-138.  aPast value-added research employs hedonic pricing models to estimate premiums associated with value-added feeder cattle characteristics. However, hedonic pricing models require restrictive assumptions and impose a functional form. Producers also self-select into a treatment group, potentially biasing estimates. Using propensity score matching, we reduce potential bias from producer self-selection and from imposing a functional form. Results suggest that hedonic pricing models may be negatively biased in estimates of premiums received by value-added calf producers. Current adopters receive a premium of $5.38/cwt from participation in a certified preconditioning program, while nonadopters would realize $5.17/cwt by adopting certification. Hedonic model values range from $0.52/cwt to $4.32/cwt, for similar or identical preconditioning programs. 3acalves 3acertification 3afeeder cattle 3amodels 3aprices 3avalue added1 aDeVuyst, Eric A.1 aPeel, Derrell S.1 aRaper, Kellie Curry0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2014 Apr., v. 39, no. 1 p.124-138wJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/365423Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140515  aOther US 7aarticle01612naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245006100134300001600195300003000211500001500241520075400256650001801010650002501028650001901053650001701072650002301089653001001112653001901122773008201141852000901223939003301232945000801265946001301273655001201286991570638680742620221119223012.0840221e198305  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840041752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzybyla, Ann.10aHealth awareness trend breathes new life into diet foods  ap. 127-130.  ap. 127-130. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aDiet food research (with particular emphasis on salt and/or sodium reduction and low calorie foods) is discussed. An increased number of food products have been introduced during the last year to meet special dietary needs. Consumer demand for products containing less salt, sugar, calories, fat and caffeine, and more fiber, is at an all time high. The controversies surrounding a proposed sodium data base to be used for sodium labeling, are mentioned. To be marketable, newer reduced calorie foods must have less sugar and oil and sweeteners must be inexpensive, non-fattening, and non-carcinogenic and must taste good. Some of the aspartame-containing products are introduced along with low calorie salad dressing and a sampling of others.

Dose-response profiles displaying Δgrowth, the magnitude of deviation from growth of controls, were generated for probiotics Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis and pathogens Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. Ingredients were manuka honey UMF[trade mark sign]20+(dose-dependently increased probiotics and decreased pathogens); bee pollen (biphasic growth effects against all); Rosehips and BroccoSprouts® (increased all dose-dependently); blackcurrant oil (little effect) and propolis (inhibited all strains). Ingredients were also bioassayed in pairs to assess desirable or undesirable synergistic interactions. Observed synergies included manuka honey (predominantly desirable); rosehips or BroccoSprouts® (desirable and undesirable); blackcurrant oil (desirable) and propolis (tended towards synergies reinforcing its antimicrobial effects), collectively revealing a complex web of interactions which varied by ingredient and bacterial strain. Manuka honey was particularly effective at influencing gut bacteria. The surprising frequency of undesirable synergistic interactions illustrates the importance of pre-testing potential ingredient combinations intended for use in functional foods. 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus reuteri 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanti-infective properties 3abee pollen 3abioassays 3ablack currants 3adose response 3afunctional foods 3ahoney 3aingredients 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aoils 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3apropolis 3arose hips 3aNew Zealand 0aprobiotic 0asynergies1 aMaddox, Ian S.1 aMiles, Michelle C.1 aRodier, Maroussia1 aSkinner, Margot1 aSutherland, Juliet0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2008 Dec., v. 43, no. 12 p.2257-2267dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01863.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02139naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245016000164300001400324500002400338520083000362650001801192650001601210650002201226650001201248650002601260650001101286650001401297650001201311650001601323653001601339653002801355653002401383653004601407653002301453700001501476700001601491700001701507700001701524773010701541852000901648856004801657655001201705IND4442620920221119222948.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444262092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-010-0337-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Fangping10aMolecular cytogenetic identification and relationship of the artificial intergeneric hybrid between Dendranthema indica and Crossostephium chinense by GISH  ap. 91-99.  aIncludes references  aAlthough most of the hybrid embryos aborted at an early developmental stage, a 2n = 27 true intergeneric hybrid between Dendranthema indica (L.)

To clarify the genes required for air-drying tolerance, we performed genome-wide screening using the complete deletion strain collection of diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The screening identified 278 gene deletions responsible for air-drying sensitivity. These genes were classified based on their cellular function and on the localization of their gene products. The results showed that the genes required for air-drying tolerance were frequently involved in mitochondrial functions and in connection with vacuolar H⁺-ATPase, which plays a role in vacuolar acidification. To determine the role of vacuolar acidification in air-drying stress tolerance, we monitored intracellular pH. The results showed that intracellular acidification was induced during air-drying and that this acidification was amplified in a deletion mutant of the VMA2 gene encoding a component of vacuolar H⁺-ATPase, suggesting that vacuolar H⁺-ATPase helps maintain intracellular pH homeostasis, which is affected by air-drying stress. To determine the effects of air-drying stress on mitochondria, we analysed the mitochondrial membrane potential under air-drying stress conditions using MitoTracker. The results showed that mitochondria were extremely sensitive to air-drying stress, suggesting that a mitochondrial function is required for tolerance to air-drying stress. We also analysed the correlation between oxidative-stress sensitivity and air-drying-stress sensitivity. The results suggested that oxidative stress is a critical determinant of sensitivity to air-drying stress, although ROS-scavenging systems are not necessary for air-drying stress tolerance. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacidification 3aair drying 3abreads 3adiploidy 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3ascreening 3astress tolerance 3ayeasts1 aAndō, Akira.1 aTakagi, Hiroshi0 tYeast.g2008 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.179-190dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1577 7aarticle02728naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245017600149300001800325300002300343500001500366520148100381650001501862650001501877650002301892650003801915650001301953650003001966650002001996650001602016653001502032653001302047653001502060653002802075653001702103653001402120700001502134700001402149773007602163852000902239939003302248946001302281655001202294IND8906417720221119222637.0891206e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890641772DNAL7 a166668552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilleford, K.O.10aEvidence for chloroplastic succinate dehydrogenase participating in the chloroplastic respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 1084-1087.  ap. 1084-1087. ill.  a2019-12-05  aA method for isolating intact chloroplasts from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii F-60 was developed from the Klein, Chen, Gibbs, Platt-Aloia procedure ([1983)] Plant Physiol 72: 481-487). Protoplasts, generated by treatment with autolysine, were lysed with a solution of digitonin and fractionated on Percoll step gradients. The chloroplasts were assessed to be 90% intact (ferricyanide assay) and free from cytoplasmic contamination (NADP isocitrate dehydrogenase activity) and to range from 2 to 5% in mitochondrial contamination (cytochrome c oxidase activity). About 25% of the cellular succinate dehydrogenase activity (21.6 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll per hour, as determined enzymically) was placed within the chloroplast. Chloroplastic succinate dehydrogenase had a Km for succinate of 0.55 millimolar and was associated with the thylakoidal material derived from the intact chloroplasts. This same thylakoidal material, with an enzymic assay of 21.6 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll per hour was able to initiate a light-dependent uptake of oxygen at a rate of 16.4 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll per hour when supplied with succinate and methyl viologen. Malonate was an apparent competitive inhibitor of this reaction. The succinate dehydrogenase activity present in the chloroplast was sufficient to account for the photoanaerobic rate of acetate dissimilation in H2 adapted Chlamydomonas (M Gibbs, RP Gfeller, C Chen [1986] Plant Physiol 82: 160-166). 3ametabolism 3athylakoids 3aoxygen consumption 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3ahydrogen 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aenzyme activity 3achlorophyll 0aadaptation 0amalonate 0ainhibition 0asuccinate dehydrogenase 0achloroplasts 0aisolation1 aGombos, Z.1 aGibbs, M.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 July, v. 90, no. 3 p.1084-1087x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02682naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001900185245010600204300001600310500002400326520098600350650002201336650001601358650002001374650002401394650001801418650003401436650001201470650003601482650003701518650002501555650001101580650003401591650003101625650002901656650003001685650003301715653001701748653001601765700002301781700001901804700002101823700002101844773009701865852000901962856008801971930003302059945002502092946001102117655001202128IND4438411120221119222710.0100611e20100715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443841112DNAL7 a203079392pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.02.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8221 aChambers, Emma10aBinding of serum albumin to the anthelmintic drugs albendazole, triclabendazole and their sulphoxides  ap. 172-175.  aIncludes references  aThe binding of drugs to plasma proteins - especially serum albumin - is an important factor in controlling the availability and distribution of these drugs. In this study we have investigated the binding of two drugs commonly used to treat liver fluke infections, albendazole (ABZ) and triclabendazole (TCBZ), and their sulphoxide metabolites to bovine serum albumin (BSA). Both ABZ and TCBZ caused shifts in the mobility of BSA in native gel electrophoresis. No such changes were observed with the sulphoxides under identical conditions. The drugs, and their sulphoxides, caused quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of BSA, indicating association between the drugs and this protein. Quantification of this quenching suggested a 5-10-fold reduction in affinity of the sulphoxides compared to the parent compounds. These results are discussed in respect to previous work on the pharmacodynamics of these fasciolicides and will inform the design of novel anthelmintics. 3aFasciola hepatica 3aalbendazole 3atriclabendazole 3agel electrophoresis 3aserum albumin 2aAlbendazolexpharmacokinetics 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacokinetics 2aBenzimidazolesxpharmacokinetics 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCattle 2aFasciola hepaticaxmetabolism 2aFascioliasisxdrug therapy 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aSerum Albuminxmetabolism 2aSulfoxidesxpharmacokinetics 0adrug binding 0asulphoxides1 aHoey, Elizabeth M.1 aTrudgett, Alan1 aFairweather, Ian1 aTimson, David J.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 July 15, v. 171, no. 1-2 p.172-175dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.02.0433Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/08/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02681naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163100001400172245007000186300001600256500002400272520132300296650001101619650001401630650002501644650001301669650001401682650002201696650001201718650001401730650002201744650002201766651001101788700001301799700001401812700001401826773014701840852000901987856009401996856006202090930003302152945002502185946001302210655001202223IND4384225720221119222923.0061011e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438422572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb04503.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aHsu, M.H.10aInvestigation of Turbidity Maximum in a Mesotidal Estuary, Taiwan  ap. 901-914.  aIncludes references  aTo comprehend the distributions of salinity, temperature, and suspended sediment in the Danshuei River estuary in Taiwan, monthly field surveys were conducted in 2003. These included several high and low slackwater surveys and intensive surveys. The results show that the Danshuei River estuary is predominately a partially mixed estuary. The highest concentration of suspended sediment is typically observed at the Chung-Hsin Bridge, the most upstream sampling station. The suspended sediment concentration exhibits a general decreasing trend in the downstream direction. It may be concluded that the sediments mostly come from the upstream reach. A locally high concentration of suspended sediment is found at the Kuan-Du station because of the local deep channel bathymetry and two-layered estuarine circulation. A vertical two-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is applied to investigate the tidally averaged salinity distribution, residual circulation, and suspended sediment concentration. The modeling results reveal that, under the Q75 flow condition (i.e., low flow), a turbidity maximum occurs at the Kuan-Du station due to the strong estuarine circulation. The model simulation with a much higher river flow condition results in a weaker residual circulation and weaker turbidity maximum. 3arivers 3aestuaries 3aspatial distribution 3asalinity 3asediments 3awater temperature 3asurveys 3aturbidity 3ahydrologic models 3asimulation models 3aTaiwan1 aWu, C.R.1 aLiu, W.C.1 aKuo, A.Y.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2006 Aug., v. 42, no. 4 p.901-914dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb04503.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20061116b20061202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/11/15  aOther US 7aarticle02581naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245014700143300001800290300002300308500001500331520138000346650002501726650001801751650001501769650001701784650002201801650001901823650001201842650001901854650002001873650001601893650002801909653001401937653001701951700001401968700001501982700001901997773007602016852000902092939003302101946001302134655001202147IND8906435020221119222643.0891208e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890643502DNAL7 a166668632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHugly, S.10aEnhanced thermal tolerance of photosynthesis and altered chloroplast ultrastructure in a mutant of Arabidopsis deficient in lipid desaturation  ap. 1134-1142.  ap. 1134-1142. ill.  a2019-12-05  aA mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, deficient in activity of the chloroplast n-6 desaturase, accumulated high levels of C16:1 and C18:1 lipids and had correspondingly reduced levels of polyunsaturated lipds. The altered lipid composition of the mutant had pronounced effects on chloroplast ultrastructure, thylakoid membrane protein and chlorophyll content, electron transport rates, and the thermal stability of the photosynthetic membranes. The change in chloroplast ultrastructure was due to a 48% decrease in the amount of appressed membranes that was not compensated for by an increased amount of nonappressed membrane. This resulted in a net loss of 36% of the thylakoid membrane per chloroplast and a corresponding reduction in chlorophyll and protein content. Electrophoretic analysis of the chlorophyll-protein complexes further revealed a small decrease in the amount of light-harvesting complex. Relative levels of whole chain and protosystem II electron transport rates were also reduced in the mutant. In addition, the mutation resulted in enhanced thermal stability of photosynthetic electron transport. These observations suggest a central role of polyunsaturated lipids in determining chloroplast structure and maintaining normal photosynthetic function and demonstrate that lipid unsaturation directly affects the thermal stability of photosynthetic membranes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3alipid content 3athylakoids 3afluorescence 3aelectron transfer 3aphotosystem II 3amutants 3aultrastructure 3aprotein content 3achlorophyll 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 0amembranes 0achloroplasts1 aKunst, L.1 aBrowse, J.1 aSomerville, C.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 July, v. 90, no. 3 p.1134-1142x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02258naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245015100146300001800297300002300315520129800338650002601636650001701662650001601679650001901695650001301714650001301727650001401740653001401754700002101768773007601789852000901865939003301874946001301907655001201920IND8906435320221119222802.0891208e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890643532DNAL7 a166668662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoisyadi, S.10aCharacterization of the heat shock response in cultured sugarcane cells.

Physiology of the heat shock response and heat shock protein synthesis  ap. 1156-1162.  ap. 1156-1162. ill.  aEffect of heat shock on the growth of cultured sugarcane cells (Saccharum officinarum L.) was measured. Heat shock (HS) treatment at 36 to 38 degrees C (2 hours) induced the development of maximum thermotolerance to otherwise nonpermissive heat stress at 54 degrees C (7 minutes). Optimum thermotolerance was observed 8 hours after heat shock. Development of thermotolerance was initiated by treatments as short as 30 minutes at 36 degrees C. Temperatures below 36 degrees C or above 40 degrees C failed to induce maximum thermotolerance. In vivo labeling revealed that HS at 32 to 34 degrees C induced several high molecular mass heat shock proteins (HSPs). A complex of 18 kilodalton HSPs required at least 36 degrees C treatment for induction. The majority of the HSPs began to accumulate within 10 minutes, whereas the synthesis of low molecular mass peptides in the 18 kilodalton range became evident 30 minutes after initiation of HS. HS above 38 degrees C resulted in progressively decreased HSP synthesis with inhibition first observed for HSPs larger than 50 kilodaltons. Analysis of two-dimensional gels revealed a complex pattern of label incorporation including the synthesis of four major HSPs in the 18 kilodalton range and continued synthesis of constitutive proteins during HS. 3aSaccharum officinarum 3acell culture 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aproteins 3apeptides 3asynthesis 0aresponses1 aHarrington, H.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 July, v. 90, no. 3 p.1156-1162x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02324naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100001800186245007000204300001600274500002400290500001500314520087500329650002101204650002301225650002301248650001401271650001301285650001701298650001701315650001301332650002001345650002601365650000901391650001401400650001601414653003901430653001501469653001701484700002301501773011401524852000901638856009001647930003301737945002501770946001101795655001201806IND4438407320221119223316.0100611e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443840732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ111 0aQ112 0aQ501 0aQ5021 aGin, Benjamin14aThe use of PCM panels to improve storage condition of frozen food  ap. 372-376.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn investigation into the effect of phase change material (PCM) panels placed against the internal walls of a freezer during repeated power loss every 24h over a 2week period was conducted.

When techniques of data subsetting were used in a sensible way and corresponding to the appropriate scale for the evaluation envisaged, multiple linear regression offered a data mining technique which was able to spatially predict relatively complex environmental patterns with parsimonious, interpretable and accurate models, whereby different evaluation scales were best represented by different DTM resolutions. Scenario models based upon the regression formulas were a valuable tool for visualizing management options and evaluating management impacts (tree species selection) on soil functions (carbon storage), which qualifies the presented methodology as a useful aid in decision making. Such upscaling techniques may be used for forecasting long-term effects of ecosystem management, but they provided no information on temporal dynamics. Therefore, time trends of point information on soil solution data were scaled by linking them to soil chemical data which was available in higher spatial resolution, using both statistical and process-oriented methods. 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystem management 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aland use 3alinear models 3along term effects 3asoil 3asoil solution 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCationsxanalysis 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDecision Support Techniques 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aForestry 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aSoilxchemistry 2aTime 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 2aTrees 2aWeights and Measures 0aGermany 0aManagement scenarios 0aSpatial prediction 0aDigital soil mapping 0aPedometrics 0aSpatio-temporal scaling 0aRegionalization1 aWilpert, Klaus von.0 tEnvironmental management.g2010 Dec., v. 46, no. 6 p.878-893dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-010-9468-4 7aarticle03120naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001400181245010300195300001600298500002400314520157200338650002301910650001001933650001601943650001601959650001801975650001901993650002302012650002202035650002502057650002302082650001202105650001102117650001802128650002102146650001402167650001002181650001002191650001602201651001402217700001702231700001702248700002002265773012202285852000902407856006902416930003302485945002502518946001102543655001202554IND4384240820221119223124.0061011e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438424082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-004-1231-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF120 0aF9001 aHoc, P.S.10aHybridization Between Wild and Domesticated Types of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabaceae) in Argentina  ap. 331-337.  aIncludes references  aA polymorphic population of Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. aborigineus (Burkart) Baudet growing in northwestern Argentina was studied. In order to know the origin of this polymorphism, plants belonging to the var. aborigineus, others showing floral dimorphism and individuals with weedy type characters were collected. Their seeds, obtained after fieldwork treatments of autogamy and free pollination in order to know their reproductive system, were sown in a greenhouse. Information of their growth was recorded and several numerical analyses were performed. With the results obtained, we concluded that those individuals that showed floral dimorphism are probably a result of hybridization and/or introgression between the var. aborigineus and cultivated forms that grow in the area. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of divergent segregation in the offspring. Also, the offspring of the F1 was followed and allowed us to conclude the possible existence of degeneration of the hybrid progeny. This degeneration indicates that an unwanted gene flow in the area could lead to a decline in the wild bean population. The vigour and high reproductive success of the offspring belonging to the individuals corresponding to the var. aborigineus, whose progenitor was treated for outcrossing, and the existence of plants with weedy type characteristics, are indicative of the necessity to preserve this germplasm in order to evaluate its agronomic potential as brief as possible. The population here studied constitutes a wild-weed-crop complex growing in Argentina. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3afield crops 3awild plants 3adomestication 3awild relatives 3awide hybridization 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3aplant reproduction 3aflowers 3adioecy 3aintrogression 3agene segregation 3agene flow 3avigor 3aweeds 3aoutcrossing 3aArgentina1 aEspert, S.M.1 aDrewes, S.I.1 aBurghardt, A.D.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2006 Mar., v. 53, no. 2 p.331-337dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-004-1231-33electronic resource  a20061208b20070102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02808naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002300154245009700177300001600274500002400290520151100314650002301825650001001848650001401858650002201872650002201894650002701916650002101943650001401964650002801978650001202006651001002018653001502028700001602043700001802059700001602077773012202093852000902215856006902224930003302293945002502326946001102351655001202362IND4384240620221119222700.0061011e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438424062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-004-6144-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aPiergiovanni, A.R.10aCommon Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)

The variation within a collection constituted by 44 populations belonging to 19 common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) landraces, recently collected in Central Italy, was studied. Most landraces from the Lazio region were collected in the inner valleys of Aniene river basin, those from the Abruzzo region were collected in the Valley Peligna and the basin of the Aterno-Pescara river. Some morphological traits of plant and seeds and the phaseolin pattern were analysed to evaluate the degree of genetic variation among and within the landraces. Both common bean gene pools were represented in the investigated collection, the populations belonging to Andean gene pool were predominant. The landraces 'Cioncone', from Lazio and 'Fagiolo pane aquilano', from Abruzzo showed the rare A phaseolin type. All the collected data were submitted to cluster analysis. Two main subgroups were identified, the former included mainly populations from Abruzzo region and the latter including all the others. Despite this, a considerable resemblance exists between the common bean landraces from Abruzzo and Lazio, as proved by the low rankings on the tree among the populations. The observed similarity is discussed also on the basis of historical relationships between the two sides of the Apennine ridge. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3alandraces 3agenetic variation 3aplant collections 3ageographical variation 3aplant morphology 3aphaseolin 3aplant genetic resources 3ahistory 3aItaly 0agene pools1 aTaranto, G.1 aLosavio, F.P.1 aPignone, D.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2006 Mar., v. 53, no. 2 p.313-322dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-004-6144-73electronic resource  a20061208b20070102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03442naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002300141245007100164300001600235520191500251650001102166650001802177650002102195650001102216650001502227650001302242650001502255650001402270650001102284650001502295650001902310650000902329650003802338650001102376650001402387650001502401650001702416650002602433650002102459650001102480650001002491700002202501700002002523700001902543700001702562700001802579700001402597700002202611700002102633700001702654773015202671856004402823852000902867655001202876IND4514011820221119222635.0150602s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451401182DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.76.6.5542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunakata, Shuntaro10aInduction of thioredoxin-1 in response to oxidative stress in dogs  ap. 554-560.  aOBJECTIVE To determine whether thioredoxin (TRX)-1 can be used as a valid biomarker for oxidative stress in dogs. ANIMALS AND SAMPLES 10 Beagles and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. PROCEDURES Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were used to verify antigen cross-reactivity between human and canine antiâTRX-antibodies. Dogs were assigned to receive 21% or 100% O2 (5 dogs/group) via an artificial respirator during a 3-hour period of isoflurane anesthesia (starting at 0 hours). Blood and urine samples were collected before (baseline) and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after commencement of inhalation anesthesia. Concentrations of TRX-1 and 8-hydroxy-2â²-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in plasma and urine samples were analyzed; urine concentrations were reported as ratios against urine creatinine concentration. RESULTS Canine TRX-1 was recognized by monoclonal human anti-TRX-1 antibodies (clones of adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor [ADF]-11 and ADF21) by western blot analysis. Results of an ELISA indicated that plasma TRX-1 concentration and urine TRX-1-to-creatinine concentration ratio increased rapidly after the 3-hour period of hyperoxia with maximal peaks at 12 and 6 hours, respectively. Urine 8-OHdG-to-creatinine concentration ratio also increased significantly after hyperoxia induction. However, unlike the rapid increase in urine TRX-1-to-creatinine concentration ratio, maximal urine 8-OHdG-to-creatinine concentration ratio was attained at 48 hours after hyperoxia induction. These variables remained unchanged from baseline in the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that human anti-TRX monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with canine TRX, and plasma TRX-1 concentrations were rapidly increased in dogs following an oxidative stress challenge. Thus, TRX may be a valuable clinical biomarker for detecting oxidative stress more rapidly than 8-OHdG in dogs. 3aBeagle 3aT-lymphocytes 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aanesthesia 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3abreathing 3aclones 3acreatinine 3across reaction 3adogs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3ahyperoxia 3aisoflurane 3akidney cells 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aurine1 aTanaka, Yoshikazu1 aNezu, Yoshinori1 aHarada, Yasuji1 aYogo, Takuya1 aHara, Yasushi1 aTian, Hai1 aMatsuo, Yoshiyuki1 aTagawa, Masahiro1 aYodoi, Junji0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2015 June, v. 76, no. 6 p.554-560dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.76.6.554  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001300159245007800172300001600250500002400266500001500290520131900305650001501624650001901639650001801658650001101676650001801687650002601705650000901731653001601740653001601756700002501772700002201797773011401819852000901933856009001942930003302032945002502065946001102090655001202101IND4438406520221119222630.0100611e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443840652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aOmid, M.10aEstimating volume and mass of citrus fruits by image processing technique  ap. 315-321.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn image processing based technique was developed to measure volume and mass of citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges, and tangerines. The technique uses two cameras to give perpendicular views of the fruit. An efficient algorithm was designed and implemented in Visual Basic (VB) language. The product volume was calculated by dividing the fruit image into a number of elementary elliptical frustums. The volume is calculated as the sum of the volumes of individual frustums using VB. The volumes computed showed good agreement with the actual volumes determined by water displacement method. The coefficient of determination (R ²) for lemon, lime, orange, and tangerine were 0.962, 0.970, 0.985, and 0.959, respectively. The Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement for comparison of volumes with the two methods were (−1.62; 1.74), (−7.20; 7.57), (−6.54; 6.84), and (−4.83; 6.15), respectively. The results indicated citrus fruit's size has no effect on the accuracy of computed volume. The characterization results for various citrus fruits showed that the volume and mass are highly correlated. Hence, a simple procedure based on computed volume of assumed ellipsoidal shape was also proposed for estimating mass of citrus fruits. This information can be used to design and develop sizing systems. 3aestimation 3aimage analysis 3acitrus fruits 3avolume 3afruit quality 3aequipment performance 3amass 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aKhojastehnazhand, M.1 aTabatabaeefar, A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 Sept., v. 100, no. 2 p.315-321dElsevier Science Pub.

METHOD:: Adolescent rats were given 1-h unlimited access to chow and ad libitum access to a running wheel until body weight reached <80%, indicating the development of ABA. During adulthood, all groups were given 21 days of access to a palatable food for 2 h/day and ad libitum access to chow. RESULTS:: During adolescence, rats in the ABA paradigm developed increased wheel running and decreased food intake, reaching <80% of body weight after 3 days. However, there were no significant differences between groups in the amount of binge food consumed during adulthood. CONCLUSION:: A brief episode of ABA during adolescence did not lead to increased binge eating later in life. Longer-term models are needed to determine whether a propensity toward binge eating may result from more sustained ABA during adolescence. © 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Competition is thought to be a major influence on community assembly, ecology and evolution; presence of competitors may cause divergence in traits related to resource use (character displacement). 2. Such traits, however, often vary clinally, and this phenomenon may be independent of the presence or absence of competing species. 3. The presence of such clines can either obscure the effects of competition, or create an impression that competition is operating when, in fact, it is not. 4. We corrected for clinal variation while testing for character displacement in two well-studied weasel (Mustela) guilds, in the Nearctic and the west Palaearctic. 5. Without accounting for clines, our results agreed with previous studies suggesting character displacement in these guilds. 6. However, when we corrected for clines, predictions of competition theory were not met - and often we obtained evidence for character convergence in sympatry. 7. This may suggest that the nature of the resource base may be more important than interspecific competition in shaping morphology and size in these carnivores. 8. Our results highlight the need to account for geographic variation when studying character displacement and cast some doubt on prevailing ideas regarding the effect of competition on morphological evolution. 3aMustela 3acarnivores 3aevolution 3ageographical variation 3ainterspecific competition 3aprediction 3asympatry 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aBiota 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMustelidaexanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhenotype 2aPredatory Behavior 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSpecies Specificity 2aToothxanatomy & histology 3aArctic region 0aEurope 0aNorth America1 aSimberloff, Daniel1 aDayan, Tamar0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2011 July, v. 80, no. 4 p.824-834dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01827.x 7aarticle02489naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072001700156072001700173100001700190245011600207300001600323500001500339520103500354650000801389650002101397650001001418650002301428650001701451650001001468650005901478650001101537650001101548650001401559650000901573650001501582650001701597653001101614700002001625700001901645773015101664852000901815856007701824930003301901945002501934946001301959990002301972655001201995IND4413505220221119223051.0081205e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441350522DNAL7 a185288702pmid7 a10.1002/eat.205532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aButton, Eric10aMales assessed by a specialized adult eating disorders service: Patterns over time and comparisons with females  ap. 758-761.  a2019-12-04  aOBJECTIVE:: In view of previous inconsistencies and the limited literature on males with eating disorders, we aimed to examine changes in presentation rates over time and any differences between males and females. METHOD:: In a cohort of 2,554 new patients assessed by a specialized service for adults over a 21-year period, we examined rates by gender over time. We also carried out a detailed comparison of selected clinical and demographic variables on a series of 65 males and females matched by diagnosis and date of assessment. RESULTS:: Approximately 5% of patients were male and there was no evidence of a change in presentation rate by gender over time. Males were more likely to be diagnosed as not having a clinical eating disorder and less likely to abuse laxatives, but otherwise there was little difference in clinical presentation. CONCLUSION:: Eating disorders continue to present predominantly in females and the proportion of males remains broadly stable. © 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  1 aBardone-Cone, Anna M.10aRevisiting differences in individuals with bulimia nervosa with and without a history of anorexia nervosa: Eating pathology, personality, and maltreatment  ap. 697-704.  a2019-12-04  aOBJECTIVE:: Early research in subtyping bulimia nervosa (BN) by history of anorexia nervosa (AN) generally found more similarities than differences, but recent research and limitations of the early work suggest the need to revisit this approach. We examine differences between women with BN with and without a history of AN regarding eating pathology, personality, and childhood maltreatment. METHOD:: Participants were women (aged 18-55) recruited from the community and eating disorder clinics who met DSM-IV criteria for BN; 37 had a history of AN and 101 did not. Participants completed questionnaires related to eating disorder pathology, multidimensional perfectionism, multidimensional impulsivity, and childhood maltreatment. RESULTS:: Women with BN and a history of AN had higher levels of dietary restraint and purging and lower body mass indices as well as higher levels of all forms of childhood neglect and abuse. In contrast, no group differences were found for perfectionism or impulsivity dimensions. CONCLUSION:: The group differences in terms of eating pathology and maltreatment have clinical implications. Further research is needed regarding if and how a history of AN among those with BN may reflect different etiological pathways and predict different outcomes. © 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Seed treatments with R12 or R21 also resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) increase in seed yield of pea. The strain R21 was most effective among the four strains of R. leguminosarum bv. viceae tested in peas. Although, the level of disease control by strain R21 was similar to seed treatment with the fungicide ThiramTM, R21 was more effective in enhancing root nodule production and promoting plant growth. For lentil, treatment of seeds with R. leguminosarum bv. viceae strains R12 or R21 significantly (P < 0.05) reduced incidence of damping-off compared with the untreated control. All of the four strains of R. leguminosarum bv. viceae tested increased lentil seedling height, root nodule mass and shoot biomass, and all except R20 increased root biomass. Seed yield was higher for the treatments of R12 and R21. The strain R12 was most effective among the four strains of R. leguminosarum bv. viceae tested in lentil. Although, strain R12 was as effective as ThiramTM for control of damping-off of lentil, it was more effective than ThiramTM for the production of root nodules and promotion of plant growth. The study concludes that seed treatment with R. leguminosarum bv. viceae is effective in control of Pythium damping-off of pea and lentil and that the efficacy of control is strain specific, strain R21 for control of the disease on pea and strain R12 for control of the disease on lentil. 3aPythium 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3abiomass 3adamping off 3adisease control 3afield experimentation 3alentils 3anodulation 3apeas 3aroot growth 3aroot nodules 3aseed treatment 3aseed yield 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashoots1 aErickson, R.S.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2007 Jan., v. 155, no. 1 p.31-37dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01189.x 7aarticle02358naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001800168245008400186300001600270500002400286500001500310520096800325650002301293650001801316650001701334650001201351650002201363650001601385650002601401650001801427650001201445650002001457653002001477653001601497653002301513653001901536700002001555700001901575773011401594852000901708856009001717930003301807945002501840946001101865655001201876IND4438405220221119222621.0100611e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443840522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ103 0aQ5031 aSchmidt, F.C.10aIntegrated cooking and vacuum cooling of chicken breast cuts in a single vessel  ap. 219-224.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this work was to develop and evaluate integrated processes of cooking and vacuum cooling of chicken breast cuts in a same vessel aiming at avoiding product manipulation and reducing the processing time. In this context, three integrated processes were compared with respect to weight loss and processing time: (i) vapor cooking followed by vacuum cooling; (ii) water immersion cooking followed by draining the cooking water and vacuum cooling; and (iii) water immersion cooking followed by vacuum cooling with the product immerse in the cooking water. Shorter cooling times were obtained using processes (i) and (ii), where the cooling is performed in non-immersed samples, while smaller weight losses are obtained using process (iii). Consequently, for applications in which weight loss is not an issue, processes (i) and (ii) must be used. Alternatively, process (iii) can be used for obtaining smaller weight losses with a larger cooling time. 3amodel food systems 3abreast muscle 3achicken meat 3acooling 3avacuum processing 3amethodology 3aequipment performance 3awater content 3acooking 3acooking quality 0achicken breasts 0anew methods 0aintegrated cooking 0avacuum cooling1 aAragão, G.M.F.1 aLaurindo, J.B.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 Sept., v. 100, no. 2 p.219-224dElsevier Science Pub.

Its area of origin is characterised by typical Mediterranean climate. Traditionally, Altamurano is spring sown, and mainly used as a feed integrator for animals. This landrace was evaluated during 2 years within varietal (16 modern varieties) and sowing date (15 sowings, from October to April, with 'Antares' as a control) trials. Growth analysis was carried out on two sowings. Seed yield was slightly lower than modern varieties, with advantages in late sowings. Reproductive efficiency, mean seed weight, harvest index and oil percentage were often higher than in modern cultivars. Altamurano was also characterised by early flowering, low vegetative growth, long leaf area duration, high light use efficiency during early grain filling phase, and relatively long grain filling period. All these features are connected with its adaptation to spring sowings in Mediterranean areas, characterised by early spring drought. Despite the decrease of its cultivation area from about 400 to less than 100 ha in the last 10 years, Altamurano is still present in the more traditional farms of the area as a heritage of past growing systems and historical adaptation to the environment. 3avariety trials 3asowing date 3aflowering 3afeeds 3alandraces 3asolar radiation 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aphenology 3aleaf area 3aoil crops 3aagronomic traits 3aplant adaptation 3areproductive efficiency 3aharvest index 3aingredients 3aMediterranean climate 3avegetative growth 3aItaly 0acrop yield 0asolar radiation use efficiency 0ayield potential 0aseed weight1 aRossini, F.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2006 Feb., v. 53, no. 1 p.65-75dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-004-0582-03electronic resource  a20061209b20070102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02183naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002200168245010800190300001600298500002400314520080600338650001701144650002301161650001201184650001301196650001501209650001701224650001201241650001401253650002801267650001801295650002101313700002301334700003401357700002401391700002801415773011401443852000901557856009001566930003301656945002501689946001101714655001201725IND4438405320221119222756.0100611e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443840532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ106 0aQ5061 aVan Nguyen, Minh.10aInfluence of salt concentration on the salting kinetics of cod loin (Gadus morhua) during brine salting  ap. 225-231.  aIncludes references  aThe influence of different salt concentrations of 6%, 15%, 18% and 24% (w/w) on mass transfer of water and salt during brine salting of cod loins was studied.

The salting kinetic parameter values for total and water weight changes decreased with increasing salt concentration. Inversely, higher salting kinetic parameter values for salt weight changes were observed for higher brine concentrations. The samples brined at 18% and 24% had identical effective diffusion coefficients and the highest effective diffusion value was found in the cod loins brined at 15%. 3asalt content 3asalt concentration 3asalting 3akinetics 3acod (fish) 3aGadus morhua 3abrining 3adiffusion 3afood processing quality 3afood analysis 3afood composition1 aArason, Sigurjón.1 aThorarinsdottir, Kristin Anna1 aThorkelsson, Gudjon1 aGudmundsdóttir, Agusta0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 Sept., v. 100, no. 2 p.225-231dElsevier Science Pub.

Although the origin of the endotherm is still debatable, it has been attributed to the water-hydroxyl group interactions and/or enthalpic associations between water and carbohydrates. In the present study, physical aging of the starch components of corn flakes prepared with two different levels of starch fragmentation was studied using thermal and rheological methods. A sub-T g endotherm was observed at temperatures around 50-60°C by both DSC and Oscillatory Squeezing Flow measurements. An increase of 1.5% of moisture content was observed for both fragmented flakes during aging. The temperatures at which the sub-T g endotherms occurred were independent of aging and moisture content increase during storage, whilst enthalpy increased with both aging time and moisture content. Although the moisture content of the two types of flakes were different the aging time at which the first endotherm appeared and the rate at which the enthalpy increased were dependent only on the level of starch fragmentation. Corn flakes with a high level of starch fragmentation required a longer period of aging time before the presence of the endotherm could be detected and had a greater rate of increase in enthalpy. Overall, flakes having higher starch fragmentation absorbed more water, and the percent of water uptake decreased with aging time. Flakes with low starch fragmentation exhibited little to no change in water uptake during aging. 3amodel food systems 3afood spoilage 3aenthalpy 3afood analysis 3abiopolymers 3afood storage 3astarch 3awater content 3afood composition 3adensity 3acorn products 0afood quality 0aprocessed fragmented biopolymers 0acorn flakes1 aKhalef, N.1 aWright, K.1 aOkos, M.R.1 aHamaker, B.R.1 aCampanella, O.H.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 Sept., v. 100, no. 2 p.187-193dElsevier Science Pub.

The frequency of slow rusting types in the tall, dwarf, early and late groups appeared comparable. Of the 345 accessions, forty-four genotypes were evaluated for disease intensity, which was converted into AUDPC, number of pustules/leaf and pustule size. Wide range of variation was found for these traits. The slow rusting attribute of 16 genotypes was further confirmed by testing these under unprotected (inoculated) and protected (fungicidal spray) conditions for two successive years for disease intensity by assessing the AUDPC, seed yield/plot, and 100-seed weight. The fast rusting genotypes exhibited lower AUDPC, accompanied with increased seed yield and seed weight when grown under the protected condition, as compared to those raised under the unprotected condition. The genotypes Pant P 11, FC 1, HUDP 16, JPBB 3 and HUP 14 appeared as slow rusting genotypes. 3arust diseases 3apeas 3aUromyces viciae-fabae 3aplant architecture 3adisease severity 3acrop yield 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant genetic resources 3adisease resistance 3agenotype 3aPisum sativum 3adisease course 0aepidemiology 0aarea under the disease progress curve 0aseed weight1 aSrivastava, C.P.1 aSingh, B.D.1 aSarode, S.B.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2006 Mar., v. 53, no. 2 p.219-224dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-004-6149-23electronic resource  a20061208b20070102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle01713naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245004900131300001400180500014400194500001500338520066200353650001901015650001201034650001801046650002001064650002301084650001601107650002101123650001901144653000901163653002301172700001701195773006401212852000901276939003301285945000801318946001301326655001201339991570622310742620221119222715.0880219s1986    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870028272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaull, G.E.10aProteins and growth modulators in human milk  ap. 87-97.  aPaper presented at 4th Annual Bristol-Myers Nutrition Symposium, "Energy and Protein Needs during Infancy," Dec 5-7, 1984, Washington, D.C.  a2019-12-06  aA technical review summarizes and discusses available information on the presence of proteins and growth modulators in human milk as related to infant nutrition and development during breast feeding. Specific attention is given to: the type and levels of proteins in human breast milk; factors present in human milk that modulate growth and promote differentiation; the presence and role of taurine in human milk as a growth modulator; and the specific functions of taurine in infants and in humans, in general. It is concluded that human milk provides the infant with many potentially important functional components in addition to providing nutrients.(wz) 3abreast feeding 3ataurine 3adairy protein 3anutritive value 3ainfant development 3abreast milk 3ainfant nutrition 3agrowth factors 0adiet 0aliterature reviews1 aWright, C.E.0 tBristol Myers nutrition symposia.g1986, v. 4 p.87-977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880219c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle
