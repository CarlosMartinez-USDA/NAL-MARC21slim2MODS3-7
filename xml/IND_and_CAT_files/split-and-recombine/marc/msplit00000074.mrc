Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are a group of eicosanoids containing epoxide formed by epoxygenase (EPX) activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP). Although EETs have been considered to mediate immune responses in some insects, their synthetic machinery was little understood in insects. This study monitored EETs in a lepidopteran insect, Spodoptera exigua, immunized with bacteria and found all four EETs (5,6-EET, 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET) from larval fat body at 247–1,736 pg/g levels. Then to predict EPXs, 140 CYPs were collected from S. exigua transcriptomes and compared with human EPXs. Four CYPs (SeEPX1-SeEPX4) sharing homologies with human EPXs were chosen and assessed in subsequent expression and functional analyses. All four EPXs were expressed in all development stages. In larval stage, all four EPXs were expressed in immune-associated tissues such as fat body and hemocytes. Furthermore, their expression levels were highly enhanced by bacterial challenge in different tissues. RNA interference (RNAi) using gene-specific double stranded RNA injection suppressed their expression levels by more than 55%. RNAi treatments interfered with hemocyte-spreading behavior and nodule formation upon bacterial challenge except RNAi treatment against SeEPX2. All four EETs stimulated cellular immune response measured by nodule formation in S. exigua. The suppressed immune responses by the RNAi treatments against three SeEPXs were rescued by the addition of 8,9-EET. However, other three EETs gave their specific rescue effect depending on SeEPX types under RNAi. In humoral immune response, all four RNAi treatments suppressed expression of antimicrobial peptide genes. This study reports the presence of all four EETs in larval fat body of S. exigua and suggests that four SeEPXs are associated with immune responses mediated by EETs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acell-mediated immunity 3acytochrome P-450 3aeicosanoids 3afat body 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3ahumans 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3ainsects 3alarvae 3atranscriptome 0aCytochrome P450 0aEpoxygenase 0aEpoxyeicosatrienoic acid1 aLee, Dong-Hee1 aKim, Yonggyun0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2020 June, v. 107 p.103643-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2020.1036433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012300175520138600298592002801684650003101712650001201743650001701755650001701772650001401789650001301803650001401816650001701830653002201847653001101869653001701880653001001897700002401907700002601931700003701957700001901994700002902013773010302042856008602145852000902231655001202240IND60648416120221122090913.0190628e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064841612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaez, Irene Becerra10aActivity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 isoforms in sputum samples from individuals infected with M. tuberculosis  aM. tuberculosis stimulates matrix metalloproteinases secretion in the host; however, the patterns of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and 2 (MMP-2) isoforms are unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the activities of these isoforms in sputum samples of patients with varying degrees of mycobacterial load.Sputum samples were recovered from individuals with positive and negative diagnosis of tuberculosis. Bacillary load was determined by bacilloscopy, and presence and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 isoforms determined by gelatin zymography.Of the recovered samples; 39 were from individuals without tuberculosis and 48 with tuberculosis; 12 had low bacillary and 36 high bacillary load. Participation of MMP-2 isoforms were not observed, but in MMP-9, there was a decrease in the latent, associated with lipocalin and homodimeric isoforms. In contrast, there was a rise in the active isoform, all with statistical significance.In conclusion our results show that MMP-2 isoforms do not seems to be directly involved with tuberculosis evolution of infection. However, variations in MMP-9 isoforms were observed, which coincided with the progression of tuberculosis infection. These results raise questions regarding how MMP-9 isoforms might influence the formation and progression of granuloma, and their use as markers of progression of tuberculosis infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3agelatin 3agelatinase A 3agelatinase B 3agranuloma 3apatients 3asecretion 3atuberculosis 0aMetalloproteinase 0aSputum 0aTuberculosis 0aMMP-91 aSampieri, Clara Luz1 aSolano, Fernando Cruz1 aMartínez Cazares, María Teresa1 aMontero, Hilda1 aZenteno Cuevas, Roberto,0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2019 Oct., v. 135 p.103607-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008600159500001400245520122900259592002801488650003001516650001501546650001801561650001501579650001501594650002201609650001901631650001001650650001101660650002301671700002301694700001801717773011901735856007401854852000901928655001201937IND60704470520221117173553.0200723e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070447052DNAL7 a10.3390/w120410022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoa Bui, Xuan 10aWater Network Partitioning into District Metered Areas: A State-Of-The-Art Review  aNAL-light  aA water distribution network (WDN) is an indispensable element of civil infrastructure that provides fresh water for domestic use, industrial development, and fire-fighting. However, in a large and complex network, operation and management (O&M) can be challenging. As a technical initiative to improve O&M efficiency, the paradigm of “divide and conquer” can divide an original WDN into multiple subnetworks. Each subnetwork is controlled by boundary pipes installed with gate valves or flow meters that control the water volume entering and leaving what are known as district metered areas (DMAs). Many approaches to creating DMAs are formulated as two-phase procedures, clustering and sectorizing, and are called water network partitioning (WNP) in general. To assess the benefits and drawbacks of DMAs in a WDN, we provide a comprehensive review of various state-of-the-art approaches, which can be broadly classified as: (1) Clustering algorithms, which focus on defining the optimal configuration of DMAs; and (2) sectorization procedures, which physically decompose the network by selecting pipes for installing flow meters or gate valves. We also provide an overview of emerging problems that need to be studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3afire fighting 3aflowmeters 3afreshwater 3aindustrialization 3ainfrastructure 3apipes 3avolume 3awater distribution1 aS.

The present study uses Level 2 (10 × 10 km) and Level 3 (1° × 1°) Terra/Aqua MODIS (C005) derived aerosol optical depths at 550 nm (AOD₅₅₀) and compares them with ground-based (MICROTOPS-II, MT) sun photometer measured AOD₅₅₀ in the period 2002–2008 over Hyderabad, India. The correlation coefficient (R²) between Level 3 Terra/Aqua MODIS and MT AOD₅₅₀ in all seasons ranges from 0.30 to 0.46. Even lower correlations revealed when the Level 2 MODIS data are used (R² = 0.16–0.30). The Level 3 MODIS AOD₅₅₀ underestimates significantly the MT AOD₅₅₀, while the Level 2 AOD₅₅₀ values are much larger than those of Level 3. The comparison of the Terra/Aqua MODIS AOD₅₅₀ at regional scale, and especially over urban/industrial areas with significant aerosol diurnal variation, constitutes a real challenge and may reveal the ability of the two sensors to capture the temporal variation of the aerosol loading within a time interval of ∼3 h. The results show relatively good correlation (R² ∼ 0.6–0.7) regarding the Level 3 dataset; however, the Level 2 data showed large scatter and very poor correlations. On the other hand, the mean seasonal AOD₅₅₀ values are similar, while Terra AOD₅₅₀ is higher than that obtained from Aqua. Both satellite and ground-based measurements show remarkable increasing trends in AOD over Hyderabad, which are attributed to the extension of the urbanized area, the growing of population, motor vehicles and local emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3adiurnal variation 3aemissions 3aglobal warming 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avehicles (equipment) 3aIndia1 aBadarinath, K.V.S.1 aSharma, Anu Rani1 aKaskaoutis, D.G.1 aKambezidis, H.D.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2011 Mar., v. 45, no. 8 p.1532-1542dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.12.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01372naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245015000165300001400315520022400329592002800553650001300581650002100594650001200615650001500627650001400642650001100656700002200667700002500689700001800714700002400732700002900756700001800785773012400803856007400927852000901001655001201010IND60640730020221120094514.0190504e20160229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064073002DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra90021f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar-Krishnan, Siva10aCorrection: Chitosan supported silver nanowires as a platform for direct electrochemistry and highly sensitive electrochemical glucose biosensing  ap. 22950.  aCorrection for ‘Chitosan supported silver nanowires as a platform for direct electrochemistry and highly sensitive electrochemical glucose biosensing’ by Siva Kumar-Krishnan et al., RSC Adv., 2016, 6, 20102–20108.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3aelectrochemistry 3aglucose 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3asilver1 aChakaravarthy, S.1 aHernandez-Rangel, A.1 aProkhorov, E.1 aLuna-Bárcenas, G.,1 aEsparza López, Rodrigo,1 aMeyyappan, M.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 29, v. 6, no. 27 p.22950-22950dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra90021f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245018000157300002000337520083000357592002801187650001401215650001201229650001101241650001101252650001901263650002501282700001601307700001501323700001901338700001701357773012401374856007401498852000901572655001201581IND60665097120221118004909.0190912e20140807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066509712DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra04463k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Dingqi10aEngineered cation vacancy plane responsible for the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity and improvement in the thermoelectric property of Ga₂Te₃-based semiconductors  ap. 34104-34109.  aBased on the inherent Ga vacancies in Ga₂Te₃, we use the preferential occupation of Cu in the Ga lattice, which can be confirmed by calculating the formation energy and Rietveld refinement, to disturb the vacancy path, and thereby have cleverly manipulated the vacancy plane.

However, with the annealing time extending from 30 days to 95 days, there is a gradual enhancement in kL and limited improvement in the thermoelectric property, which is caused by the amalgamation or restructuring of the discontinuous vacancy planes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acations 3acopper 3aenergy 3asemiconductors 3athermal conductivity1 aLiu, Haiyun1 aDeng, Yuan1 aDu, Zhengliang1 aCui, Jiaolin0 tRSC advances.g2014 Aug. 07, v. 4, no. 64 p.34104-34109dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra04463k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01188naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245012200169300001400291520020000305592002800505650001200533650001400545700002600559700001500585700001200600700001800612700001500630700002200645773012400667856007400791852000900865655001200874IND60640730120221120094557.0190504e20160308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064073012DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra90022d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrasco-Del Amor, A.

The recessive mutant scat (severe combined anemia and thrombocytopenia) alternates between crisis and remission episodes, indicating an aberrant regulatory feedback mechanism common to erythrocyte and platelet formation. Here, we identify a missense mutation (G125V) in the scat Rasa3 gene, encoding a Ras GTPase activating protein (RasGAP), and elucidate the mechanism producing crisis episodes. The mutation causes mislocalization of RASA3 to the cytosol in scat red cells where it is inactive, leading to increased GTP-bound Ras. Erythropoiesis is severely blocked in scat crisis mice, and ∼94% succumb during the second crisis (∼30 d of age) from catastrophic hematopoietic failure in the spleen and bone marrow. Megakaryopoiesis is also defective during crisis. Notably, the scat phenotype is recapitulated in zebrafish when rasa3 is silenced. These results highlight a critical, conserved, and nonredundant role for RASA3 in vertebrate hematopoiesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aanemia 3abone marrow 3acytosol 3aerythrocytes 3aerythropoiesis 3agenes 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amice 3amissense mutation 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aremission 3aspleen 3athrombocytopenia 0amouse model 0ared blood cells 0adevelopment 0ainherited anemia1 aCiciotte, Steven L.1 aGwynn, Babette1 aHildick-Smith, Gordon J.1 aPierce, Eric L.1 aSoltis, Kathleen A.1 aCooney, Jeffrey D.1 aPaw, Barry H.1 aPeters, Luanne L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 July 24, v. 109, no. 30 p.12099-12104dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12049481093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002500186245011000211300001100321506007600332520141100408592002801819506003701847650001101884650002301895650002201918650001401940650001801954650001501972650002201987650001202009650001102021650001502032650001002047650001502057650002202072650001102094650001602105650001102121650002302132650000902155650001602164650001902180650002402199650001602223651001102239651001102250700002202261700001602283773015902299856007902458852000902537655001202546IND50073357420221207080914.0151107e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007335742DNAL7 a244758682pmid7 aPMC39313262pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-11-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDearth-Wesley, Tracy10aEstimated and forecasted trends in domain specific time-use and energy expenditure among adults in Russia  ap. 11.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Examination of historical trends and projections in estimated energy expenditure in Russia is important given the country’s economic downturns and growth. METHODS: Nationally representative data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) from 1995–2011 was used to determine the metabolic equivalents of task (MET)-hours per week from occupational, domestic, travel, and active leisure physical activity (PA) domains, as well as sedentary leisure time (hours per week) among adults 18–60 years. Additionally, we projected what these values would be like in 2020 and 2030 if observed trends continue. RESULTS: Among male adults, the largest contributor to total PA was occupational PA followed by travel PA. In contrast, domestic PA followed by occupational PA contributed most to total PA among female adults. Total PA was 282.9 MET-hours per week in 1995 and declined to 231.7 in 2011. Total PA is projected to decrease to 216.5 MET-hours per week in 2020 and to 193.0 MET-hours per week in 2030. The greatest relative declines are occurring in travel PA. Female adults are also exhibiting significant declines in domestic PA. Changes in occupational and active leisure PA are less distinct. CONCLUSIONS: Policies and initiatives are needed to counteract the long-term decline of overall physical activity linked with a modernizing lifestyle and economy among Russian adults.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aenergy expenditure 3aissues and policy 3alifestyle 3amodernization 3amonitoring 3aphysical activity 3asurveys 3atravel 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aEmployment 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aForecasting 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activities 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotor Activity 2aSedentary Behavior. 2aYoung Adult 3aRussia 0aRussia1 aPopkin, Barry M.,1 aNg, Shu Wen0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.11-11dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-11-113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120245005500138300001500193520194500208592002802153650002002181650001902201650001502220650001002235650001402245650002602259650002602285650000902311650002302320650002502343650000902368650001802377650001802395650002402413650001702437650001302454650001002467653001902477653001202496653001102508653000902519653001302528653001302541653002402554653001302578710005202591773012902643856007302772852000902845655001202854IND60481559220221121143839.0201023e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048155922DNAL7 a10.7589/52.2S.S42doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aAdvances in animal welfare for free-living animals  ap. S4-S13.  aOver several decades, animal welfare has grown into its own free-standing field of scientific study, from its early beginnings in laboratory animal research to eventually include exhibited animals and farm animals. While it has always been present to some degree, consideration of animal welfare for free-ranging animals has lagged behind, developing as a field of study in the last 20 yr or so. Part of that increase was that animal welfare legislation was finally applied to studies being done on free-ranging animals. But it is the appreciation by the biologists and veterinarians working on wild animals, in which the quality of their results is largely controlled by the quality of the animals they use in their studies, which has resulted in increased attention to the well-being or welfare of the animals that they use. Other important influences driving the recognition of wildlife welfare have been changes in the public's expectations of how wild animals are dealt with, a shift in focus of wildlife professionals from managing animals that can be hunted or angled to include nongame species, the decrease in participation in hunting and fishing by members of the public, and the entry of large numbers of women into fish and wildlife agencies and departments and into veterinary medicine. Technical improvements have allowed the safe capture and handling of large or dangerous animals as immobilization drugs and equipment have been developed. The increasing use of sedating drugs allows for handling of animals with reduced stress and other impacts. A number of topics, such as toe-clipping, branding, defining which taxa can or cannot feel pain, catch-and-release fishing, and more, remain controversial within wildlife science. How we treat the wild animals that we deal with defines who we are as wildlife professionals, and animal welfare concerns and techniques for free-ranging animals will continue to develop and evolve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal handling 3aanimal welfare 3abiologists 3adrugs 3aequipment 3afarmed animal species 3afield experimentation 3afish 3alaboratory animals 3alaws and regulations 3apain 3aprofessionals 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary medicine 3awild animals 3awildlife 3awomen 0aAnimal welfare 0acapture 0aethics 0afish 0ahandling 0asampling 0aveterinary medicine 0awildlife2 aJWD Wildlife Welfare Supplement Editorial Board0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2016 Apr., v. 52, no. 2s p.S4-S13dWildife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.7589/52.2S.S43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014200171520177300313592002802086650002802114650002002142650002102162650001202183650001202195650001202207650001302219650001102232650002902243650002702272650001702299650000902316650001602325650001702341650001302358650000902371650001402380650001802394650002402412650000702436650002202443650001502465650001002480650001102490650000902501653002102510653001702531653001902548653002102567653002102588700005502609700001602664700005402680700001502734773010202749856008802851852000902939655001202948IND60648416520221122090903.0190705e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064841652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.1043662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamsuri, A.W.14aThe effects of rice husk ashes and inorganic fertilizers application rates on the phytoremediation of gold mine tailings by vetiver grass  aThis study investigated the effect of rice husk ash (RHA) and inorganic fertilizer on the phytoremediation of heavy metals in mine tailings by vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides L. Nash). The mine tailings were amended with either RHA or iron-coated RHA (Fe-RHA) at 0 or 10% (w/w) application rates and vetiver grass was planted on the tailings. The vetiver grass was fertilized with three rates (0, 50 and 100 kg ha−1) of NPK fertilisers during the 75 days growth period in a glasshouse and the experimental units were arranged in a randomized complete block design. At harvest, the shoot and root of the plants were separated and their uptake of As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, Mn and Zn were determined. Application of RHA showed an increase (p < 0.05) in pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents of the tailings. Growth and total dry biomass of the vetiver was higher (p < 0.05) in the tailings applied with NPK only compared to RHA and Fe-RHA amended tailings Meanwhile, application of NPK and RHA enhanced the heavy metals uptake by vetiver grass from the mine tailings. The plants grown in tailings amended with RHA +100 kg ha−1 NPK had the highest (p < 0.05) As uptake while the highest (p < 0.05) Cd and Cr uptake was observed in plants grown on tailings amended with Fe-RHA + 100 kg ha−1 NPK. The highest (p < 0.05) Cu and Mn uptake were observed in plants grown on tailings receiving only NPK. The bioaccumulation coefficient (BAC) values for all elements were <1.0 while the biotranslocation coefficient (BTC) for Cu, Cr, Mn, and the bioconcentration (BCF) factor for Zn were >1.0. The results suggest that the vetiver grass can be recommended for stabilisation of Zn and for phytoextraction of Cr, Cu and Mn from the mine tailings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysopogon zizanioides 3aNPK fertilizers 3aapplication rate 3aarsenic 3abiomass 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adissolved organic carbon 3afertilizer application 3ageochemistry 3agold 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3ahusk ash 3alead 3amanganese 3amine tailings 3amineral fertilizers 3apH 3aphytoaccumulation 3arice hulls 3aroots 3ashoots 3azinc 0aPhytoremediation 0aHeavy metals 0aBiaccumulation 0aBiotranslocation 0aBioconcentration1 aTariq, F.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4501-89471 aKaram, D.S.1 aAris, A.Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4827-07501 aJamilu, G.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2019 Sept., v. 108 p.104366-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.1043663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03857naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015400165520202300319592002802342650002402370650003002394650001302424650001602437650001302453650001402466650002402480650001002504650001302514650002102527650001902548650001902567650001902586650001802605650001902623650001802642650001802660650001802678650001802696650001002714650000802724650002702732650001302759650001402772650003202786650002002818653003002838653002402868653003002892653001302922653001002935700001802945700002102963700002502984773014103009856008403150852000903234655001203243IND60684440220221120081353.0201023e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068444022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2020.1014492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAria, Hamid10aDifferent cytokine patterns induced by Helicobacter pylori and Lactobacillus acidophilus extracts in PBMCs of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm  aAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a degenerative inflammatory disease with unknown etiology. AAA is characterized by abdominal aortic dilatation more than 3 cm and is often asymptomatic, but the rupture of aneurysm can lead to death. Age, smoking and male sex are major predisposing factors of AAA.This study compares the effect of Helicobacter (H.) pylori and Lactobacillus (L.) acidophilus on the cytokine profile of PBMCs of 5 men with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 5 men with normal/insignificant angiography, CT-Scan and ultrasonography results in the single-culture and in the co-culture with HUVECs. IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17 F, IL-21, IL-22, IFN-γ and TNF-α were measured in culture supernatants using a commercial fluorescent-labeled-bead assay.In general, CagA+ H. pylori-extract induced higher production of IFN-γ, IL-13 and IL-21 by PBMCs. Treatment of patients’ PBMCs with CagA⁺H. pylori-extract induced Th2 cytokines while treatment of controls’ PBMCs with CagA⁺H. pylori-extract increased Th1 cytokines. In the co-culture, however, patients’ PBMCs produced Th1 cytokines irrespective of extract treatment, while controls’ PBMCs produced Th2 cytokines and decreased IL-10. CagA+ H. pylori- as well as L. acidophilus-extract induced higher levels of IL-9 by controls’ PBMCs in co-culture with HUVECs than patients (P = 0.05 and P = 0.01).The cytokine pattern of PBMCs induced by CagA+ H. pylori- and L. acidophilus-extracts in the co-culture with HUVECs shows differences in AAA patients and in comparison to controls. Decreased secretion of IL-9, IL-21 and IL-22 by PBMCs of patients treated with CagA+ H. pylori extract in co-culture, as opposed to non-AAA controls may indicate the active role ECs play in AAA. Simultaneous production of IL-10 and Th1 cytokines in patients and pronounced Th2 cytokines in controls in response to both bacteria may point to the inherent differences between patients and controls, which need further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aaneurysm 3aangiography 3abacteria 3acoculture 3acomputed tomography 3adeath 3aetiology 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-21 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-5 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-9 3amales 3amen 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apatients 3asecretion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aultrasonography 0aAbdominal aortic aneurysm 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aLactobacillus acidophilus 0aCytokine 0aHUVEC1 aKalani, Mehdi1 aHodjati, Hossein1 aDoroudchi, Mehrnoosh0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2020 June, v. 70 p.101449-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2020.1014493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245005200165300001600217520194700233592002802180650001702208650001202225650001002237650001302247650001002260650002302270650002002293650001302313651001702326653002302343653001302366653001202379653001002391653001402401653001402415653001702429700001802446700001602464700001902480773015602499856008302655852000902738655001202747IND60642955920221118084632.0190809e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064295592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrisby, A.W.10aPlant endemism in Griqualand West, South Africa  ap. 127-137.  aGriqualand West, a region in the semi-arid Northern Cape and North-West provinces of South Africa, has been variously suggested to contain a number of range-restricted plant species, and was proposed to be a local centre of plant endemism. The Griqualand West Centre (GWC), hitherto demarcated by geological features and limited floristic data, is hereby investigated to determine the true levels of endemism and its extent of occurrence. Findings suggest that at least 23 plant species have their natural distribution ranges restricted to the Griqualand West region. These endemics represent 1.4% of the region's flora. Although this is a lower than the predicted level of endemism, it matches the trends of endemicity found in other centres in semi-arid savanna of southern Africa. Many of the GWC endemics show indications of holo-endemism owing to their apparent preference for the Ca- and Mg-rich substrates of the Ghaap Plateau. When the total distributions of all GWC endemic species are considered, then the resulting boundary of the GWC is more extensive than the substantial area already proposed previously (>40,000 km2). This study therefore proposes the concept of ‘core area’ in which distant outlier populations of endemic species (>100 km outside the main distribution range with no suitable habitat in between) are discarded during the demarcation of the centre's boundary. It is proposed that this concept is best applied when assessing extensive areas with few endemic species. A more refined GWC core area will allow for more effective conservation and future research efforts by focussing attention on those areas where high numbers of endemic plant species co-occur. Within the GWC core area, specific regions, such as the increasingly densely populated Kimberley region, the banded ironstone hill ranges, and the unique environment that is the Ghaap Plateau, are highlighted as areas of conservation importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3acalcium 3aflora 3ahabitats 3ahills 3aindigenous species 3aplants (botany) 3asavannas 3aSouth Africa 0aCentre of endemism 0aDolomite 0aEndemic 0aGhaap 0aIronstone 0aLimestone 0aNear-endemic1 aSiebert, S.J.1 aStruwig, M.1 aCilliers, D.P.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 Aug., v. 124 p.127-137dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2019.03.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012400156300002000280520037900300592002800679650001800707650001700725650001600742650001900758700001500777700002000792700001800812773012400830856007400954852000901028655001201037IND60665097420221118004749.0190912e20140724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066509742DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra04468a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Shaobo10aFacile preparation of composites composed of high performance thermoplastic and difficult-to-process functional polymer  ap. 31874-31878.  aA facile method is reported to prepare new polymer composites by introducing functional polymer (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) into a melt-processed film of a thermoplastic polymer matrix with a high melting-temperature (syndiotactic polystyrene), which benefits the applications of functional polymers which are difficult to process and vulnerable to high temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3amelting point 3apolystyrenes 3atemperature 3athermoplastics1 aFeng, Yang1 aChen, Guangming1 aWang, Jianjun0 tRSC advances.g2014 July 24, v. 4, no. 60 p.31874-31878dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra04468a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011400169300001800283520185900301592002802160650002202188650002502210650002002235650002702255650002002282650001902302650002702321650001002348650001002358650002102368650001802389650002202407650001102429650002202440650002002462650000902482650002002491650003102511650001002542650001202552650001002564650001002574650001802584650001202602650000902614650002702623650005302650650001402703650001302717650001302730650002902743653000902772653002102781653002602802653001402828653001402842653002202856700001902878700001702897700001802914700001302932773012102945856008803066852000903154655001203163IND60623267220221120220412.0210918e20190225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062326722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Huike10aMolecular and phenotypic responses of male crucian carp (Carassius auratus) exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid  ap. 1395-1406.  aPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has long been produced and widely used due to its excellent water and oil repellent properties. However, this trend has facilitated to the ubiquitous existence of PFOA in environmental matrix, and the potential ecotoxicity on aquatic organisms has not been fully elucidated. To study the tissue-specific bioconcentration and the nervous system- and energy-related biochemical effects of PFOA, as well as the phenotypic alterations by this chemical, male crucian carp (Carassius auratus) were exposed to gradient concentrations of PFOA (nominal 0.2, 10, 500 and 25,000 μg/L) in a flow-through apparatus for 7 days. PFOA was enriched in tissues following an order of blood > kidney ≥ liver > gill > brain > muscle. The bioconcentration factors ranged from 0.1 to 60.4. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the fish brain was inhibited, while liver carboxylesterase was induced in most cases and attenuated with time. The acyl-CoA oxidase activity was dose-dependently elevated and accompanied by a decline of ATP contents. PFOA treatments also inhibited the activity of the electron transport system (ETS). At the transcriptional level, ETS component complexes II and IV were concordantly depressed, and ATP synthesis was also downregulated. The mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α was increasingly upregulated, with related downstream genes upregulated in varying degrees. The phenotypes showed patterns of increased liver pathology and reduced swimming activity. In summary, PFOA leads to adverse effects in Carassius auratus related to multiple aspects, which may be associated with the nervous system, fundamental energy metabolism and other unpredictable factors. The results obtained in this study are expected to help clarify the PFOA toxic mechanisms on energy relevance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius auratus 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadverse effects 3aanimal tissues 3abioaccumulation factor 3ablood 3abrain 3acarboxylesterase 3aecotoxicology 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3akidneys 3aliver 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3aoils 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aphenotype 3aswimming 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPFOA 0aBioconcentration 0aBiochemical responses 0aHistology 0aBehaviour 0aCarassius auratus1 aLü, Guanghua,1 aYan, Zhenhua1 aLiu, Jianchao1 aJi, Yong0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Feb. 25, v. 653 p.1395-1406dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245015300171300001400324506002800338520102200366592002801388506003701416653002501453653001701478653001801495653001701513653001901530700001701549700003401566773018401600856008101784852000901865655001201874IND60784993020221207051528.0200526e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078499302DNAL7 a10.14710/jksa.15.2.58-612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSari, Rosida Puspita10aKajian Metode Elektrofotokatalisis, Elektrolisis dan Fotokatalisis pada Dekolorisasi Larutan Zat Warna Remazol Red RB yang Mengandung Ion Logam Cd2+  ap. 58-61.  aResource is Open Access  aLimbah cair industri tekstil mengandung zat warna dan logam berat.

In the study area, the estimation of tritium-tracer mean transit times (MTTs) in the mixed thermal waters is lacking despite available tritium measurements in 1977 and 2013 and carbon-14 measurements in 2008. As a direct tracer of water movement, tritium radioisotope with a half-life of 12.32 years has been applied to estimate transit times of young waters, especially in the mixture of young and old water components, and tritium sampling was conducted in 2017 to reduce the ambiguity involved with tritium interpretation. For the study area, two scaling factors of latitude effect are established for anthropogenic and ambient tritium levels in precipitation to obtain continuous time-series of tritium in monthly precipitation from the Tokyo area. Annual weighted tritium concentrations in recharge are estimated as a difference between monthly precipitation and evaporation data and are utilized as the tritium input in the convolution integral to obtain tritium-tracer MTTs. Using the exponential piston-flow model (EPM), the representative MTT of shallow groundwater is estimated to be 12.5 ± 4.5 years at TDW-1 well and 15.5 ± 8.5 years at RDW-1 well and uncertainties in MTT due to the EPM ratio and scaling factor are found to be low. For two thermal springs, simulated tritium concentrations of the young groundwater in mixed thermal waters produce unique MTT solutions resulting in MTT of 28.0 ± 12.0 years for THS-1 spring and of 29.5 ± 12.5 years for RHS-1 spring and scaling factor uncertainties are lower than EPM ratio uncertainties, which could be further reduced by an additional tritium sampling. Combining carbon-14 concentrations of 2008 samples with tritium-tracer, the old water MTTs of THS-1 and RHS-1 thermal springs equal to 13500 ± 1500 years and 6900 ± 900 years, respectively, and aggregate MTTs of mixed water are 9189 ± 1023 years for THS-1 spring and 4701 ± 616 years for RHS-1 spring. Using these MTTs with the effective porosity values of 0.01 and 0.03 result in the geothermal reservoir volume of the Tural-Rajwadi area to vary between 347.3 ± 23.3 km³ and 115.8 ± 15.4 km³, respectively, and these volumes could be used to estimate the recharge area with geothermal system depth obtained from deep drilling. In conclusions, we highlight that the environmental tritium provides important information on water circulation in the Tural-Rajwadi area and similar tritium-tracer investigations of young and mixed waters could be conducted in other geothermal areas in Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon 14 3adrilling 3aevaporation 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3ahalf life 3ahot springs 3alatitude 3amodels 3aporosity 3aspring 3atime series analysis 3atritium 3auncertainty 3awater flow 3awells 3aIndia1 aGusyev, Maksym A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7115-17011 aSinha, Uday K.1 aMohokar, Hemant V.1 aDash, Ashutosh0 tApplied geochemistry.g2019 Oct., v. 109 p.104373-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.1043733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04544naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001900162245013200181300001600313520184000329592002802169650001202197650002302209650001202232650001502244650002402259650001302283650002002296650002902316650002602345650002002371650002002391650002602411650001902437650001502456650001802471650002102489650001502510650001302525650001302538650005102551650001902602650004802621650003702669650004302706650001202749650003302761650004102794650002202835650004002857650001102897650002702908650002902935650002602964650003002990650003803020650003903058650005503097650002703152650005403179650003303233650001003266653003403276653001303310653001303323653002003336653001303356653002003369653001203389700001403401700001303415700001603428700001903444700001303463773011303476852000903589856008003598655001203678IND4425083320221118065942.0181204e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442508332DNAL7 a192465042pmid7 a10.1258/la.2008.00800262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchöffmann, G10aHaemodynamic changes and stress responses of piglets to surgery during total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl  ap. 243-248.  aThe purpose of the study was to assess the haemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate) changes and stress responses (serum cortisol and serum amyloid A [SAA] concentrations) to surgery in piglets during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and fentanyl. After preanaesthetic medication with intramuscular midazolam (0.5 mg/kg body mass), ketamine (10 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.5 mg/kg) anaesthesia was induced in five piglets, with intravenous propofol (1 mg/kg) followed by tracheal intubation and mechanical lung ventilation. Soft tissue surgery was performed in the jugular and inguinal regions during TIVA with propofol (8 mg/kg/h) and fentanyl (35 μg/kg/h). Anaesthesia was maintained for 300 min after surgery as the piglets were the control group of a project involving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mean plasma cortisol concentration decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from 59 ± 39.9 nmol/L (mean ± 1 SD) before surgery to 7.5 ± 2.5 nmol/L 300 min after end of surgical procedure. The mean SAA concentrations increased over the same period from 1.6 ± 2.3 μg/mL to 4.2 ± 5.6 μg/mL without statistical significance. The baseline (presurgery) mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 72 ± 9 mmHg compared with 72 ± 11 mmHg 300 min after end of surgery. Neither heart rate nor lactate concentrations changed significantly over the same time points: heart rate was 104 ± 11 and 103 ± 15 beats/min whereas mean lactate concentrations were reduced from 1.14 ± 0.45 mmol/L to 0.90 ± 0.22 mmol/L. Haemodynamic stability, a decrease in serum cortisol and a non-statistically significant rise in mean SAA concentrations suggest that the anaesthetic described suppresses the stress response of piglets to surgery without adverse cardiovascular effects. Therefore, it may prove useful in cardiovascular research.  aPublisher supplied data 3apiglets 3alaboratory animals 3asurgery 3aanesthesia 3ageneral anesthetics 3afentanyl 3adrug evaluation 3acombination drug therapy 3aintravenous injection 3arisk assessment 3aadverse effects 3acardiovascular system 3ablood pressure 3aheart rate 3aanimal stress 3astress tolerance 3abiomarkers 3acortisol 3alactates 2aAdjuvants, Anesthesiaxadministration & dosage 2aAmyloidxblood 2aAnalgesics, Opioidxadministration & dosage 2aAnesthesiaxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnesthetics, Intravenousxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aButorphanolxadministration & dosage 2aDrug Combinations 2aExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation 2aFemale 2aFentanylxpharmacology 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aInjections, Intramuscular 2aKetaminexadministration & dosage 2aMidazolamxadministration & dosage 2aPostoperative Complicationsxetiologyxveterinary. 2aPropofolxpharmacology 2aStress, Psychologicalxbloodxchemically induced. 2aSurgery, Veterinaryxmethods 2aSwine 0aTotal intravenous anaesthesia 0afentanyl 0apropofol 0aserum amyloid A 0acortisol 0astress response 0apiglets1 aWinter, P1 aPalme, R1 aPollak, A.,1 aTrittenwein, G1 aGolej, J0 tLaboratory animals.g2009 July, v. 43, no. 3 p.243-248dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/la.2008.00800263Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02231naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245009500201300001600296506007600312520087300388592002801261506003701289650002001326650002601346650001501372650001701387650002101404650002201425650001701447650001701464650001601481650003601497650002201533650001501555650001201570700001401582773011601596856007601712852000901788655001201797IND60690388520221207051216.0200426e20090501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069038852DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.4.5.82992doi7 aPMC26767582pmcid7 a198161142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoqin10aNegative effects of desiccation on the protein sorting and post-translational modification  ap. 435-437.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBryophytes as the first land plants are believed to have colonized the land from a fresh water origin, requiring adaptive mechanisms that survival of dehydration. Physcomitrella patens is such a non-vascular bryophyte and shows rare desiccation tolerance in its vegetative tissues.

And proteomic alteration supported the cellular structural changes in respond to desiccation stress.¹ In this addendum, we report that Golgi bodies are absent and adaptor protein complex AP-1 large subunit is down-regulated during the course of dehydration.

Escherichia coli has long served as a model of bacterial chemotaxis, and the signal processing by the core of its chemotaxis pathway is well understood. However, most of the research so far has focused on one branch of chemotactic signaling, in which ligands bind to periplasmic sensory domains of transmembrane chemoreceptors and induce a conformational change that is transduced across the membrane to regulate activity of the receptor-associated kinase CheA. Here we quantitatively characterize another, receptor-independent branch of chemotactic signaling that is linked to the sugar uptake through a large family of phosphotransferase systems (PTSs). Using in vivo characterization of intracellular signaling and protein interactions, we demonstrate that signals from cytoplasmic PTS components are transmitted directly to the sensory complexes formed by chemoreceptors, CheA and an adapter protein CheW. We further conclude that despite different modes of sensing, the PTS- and receptor-mediated signals have similar regulatory effects on the conformation of the sensory complexes. As a consequence, both types of signals become integrated and undergo common downstream processing including methylation-dependent adaptation. We propose that such mode of signaling is essential for efficient chemotaxis to PTS substrates and may be common to most bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3achemoreceptors 3achemotaxis 3aintracellular signaling peptides and proteins 3aligands 3amicrobial growth 3amodels 3anutrients 3asugars 0asignal transduction 0asignal integration 0afluorescence resonance energy transfer1 aGrosse, Karin1 aSourjik, Victor0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 July 24, v. 109, no. 30 p.12159-12164dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12053071093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100000700148245010500155300001600260520033000276592002800606650001900634650001600653650001900669650001700688700000700705773016800712856008400880852000900964655001200973IND60515325920221120201058.0160313e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051532592DNAL7 a10.1894/0038-4909-60.4.3932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 12aA Serpentine Antenna Configuration for Passive Integrated Transponder Tag Readers Used at Bat Roosts  ap. 393-397.  aWe developed a new method for deploying a passive integrated transponder (PIT) with a flexible antenna cable hung as a serpentine curtain at a cave entrance.

The study involved sampling during actual household cooking involving use of a variety of fuels including coal balls (CB), fuel wood (FW), dung cakes (DC), crop residues (CR), mixed fuels (MF: dung cakes + fuel woods). Species-wise highest EFs (g·kg⁻¹) were: 34.16 ± 10.1 for PM₂.₅ (CB), 14.18 ± 5.8 for OC (CB), 2.33 ± 1.4 for EC (DC), 1.03 ± 0.2 for K⁺ (CR), 2.21 ± 0.6 NH₄⁺ (DC), 0.61 ± 0.2 for NO₃⁻ (CB), 0.59 ± 0.1 for SO₄²⁻ (CB), 0.69 ± 0.1 for Cl⁻ (CR) among the fuels. Higher OC EFs for CB could be attributed to higher moisture content (>13%) in coal-powder that is used to handmade coal balls. It is observed that, in general, OC3 and EC1 were the dominant thermally evolved carbon mass fractions. The study averaged MCE values were in the range 0.93–0.98, which could be attributed to higher variability in flaming and smoldering episodes during the combustion of selected fuels. Sum of ionic EFs for emissions from DC, CR and MF were found to be higher than those observed for FW and CB. The K⁺/EC and Cl⁻/EC (~1) ratios could be better indicators of CR fuels to differentiate it from FW, whereas NH₄⁺/EC (~1) is suitable to indicate DC. Average annual emission estimates of PM₂.₅ (2.00 ± 0.53 Tg·yr⁻¹), OC (0.86 ± 0.23 Tg·yr⁻¹) and EC (0.11 ± 0.02 Tg·yr⁻¹) for tested fuels are evaluated to be contributing 27, 15 and 4% of total PM₂.₅, OC and EC, respectively, toward annual emission budget from different anthropogenic activities in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aammonium 3aanimal manures 3aanthropogenic activities 3aburning 3acalcium 3acarbon 3achlorides 3achromium 3acoal 3acooking 3acopper 3acrop residues 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3afuel combustion 3afuelwood 3airon 3anitrates 3aparticulates 3apotassium 3asulfates 3awater content 3aIndia 0aDiagnostic ratios 0aEmission budget 0aEmission factor 0aHousehold cooking activities1 aVerma, Madhuri1 aTiwari, Suresh1 aChakrabarty, Rajan K.1 aWatson, John G.1 aChow, Judith C.1 aPanicker, Abhilash S.1 aDeb, Manas Kanti1 aSiddiqui, Mohammad Nahid1 aPervez, Yasmeen Fatima0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 654 p.493-504dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01381naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245015300165300001400318520022700332592002800559650001700587650001600604700003300620700003200653700002200685700002500707700003200732700002800764700001900792700002500811773012400836856007400960852000901034655001201043IND60640730820221120094421.0190504e20160330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064073082DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra90030e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakambari, Ganeshan10aCorrection: Hemocompatible glutaminase free l-asparaginase from marine Bacillus tequilensis PV9W with anticancer potential modulating p53 expression  ap. 32089.  aCorrection for ‘Hemocompatible glutaminase free l-asparaginase from marine Bacillus tequilensis PV9W with anticancer potential modulating p53 expression’ by Ganeshan Shakambari et al., RSC Adv., 2016, 6, 25943–25951.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasparaginase 3aglutaminase1 aBirendranarayan, Anand Kumar1 aAngelaa Lincy, Maria Joseph1 aRai, Sameer Kumar1 aAhmad, Quazi Taushif1 aAshokkumar, Balasubramaniem1 aSaravanan, Matheshwaran1 aMahesh, Ayyavu1 aVaralakshmi, Perumal0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 30, v. 6, no. 38 p.32089-32089dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra90030e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245007400132300001400206506002800220520179500248592002802043506003702071650002402108650002402132650001802156650001402174650001502188650001202203650001202215650001402227650001102241650001602252650000902268653001002277653001902287653001402306773009902320852000902419655001202428IND60784993420221207064823.0120126e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078499342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPRANA, MADE SRI10aStudy on Flowering Biology of Taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.)

Schott.) cultivars was conducted at the Germ Plasm Conservation Garden belonging to the Reserch Centre for Biotechnology of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Cibinong, Bogor Regency. The observation included the emergence of inflorescences, the number of inflorescences in a cluster, the opening of the inflorescence, maturity of pistilate and staminate flowers, and pollinating agents that might play role in the pollination process. The study was aimed at elucidating some baseline information that might be used as a base to carry out breeding programme for future cultivar improvement. The study indicated that the 20 cultivar studied may be divided into 3 cultivar groups, namely a) Cultivars which fully did not appear to flower during the periode of obeservation, which includes Lampung, Enau, Siriwa, Ketan and Bentul biru, b) Cultivars that produced only a few (not more than 3) inflorescences per cluster or per individul plant. This includes cultivars : Bogor, Bentul, Kaliurang and Ketan hitam and c) Cultivars that were profusedly flowering (produced a lot of inflorescences), usually 4-5 inflorescences per cluster and several clusters in an individual plant. This includes cultivars : Sutera, Semir, Lampung hitam, Boring, Burkok, Berod, Lampung hitam, Lompong, Ketune dan Kudo. The cultivar Sutera produced flower quite readily, followed by Burkok. Apart from the few inflorescences it produced, the cultivar Kaliurang also produced rather abnormal shape of inflorescence with only a few pollen grains. Taro flowers proved to be protogenic since the atipulate flowers have become receptive 1-2 days prior to anther dehiscence. Pollination was due to the role of (Dacus dorsalis).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aColocasia esculenta 3abiotechnology 3acultivars 3adehiscence 3aflowers 3agardens 3agermplasm 3apollen 3apollination 3ataro 0atalas 0ainflorescences 0aflowering0 tBiodiversitas.g2007 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.63-66dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245013400177300001800311520099900329592002801328650001901356650001101375650001301386650001001399650000901409650001901418650001601437650002001453650000901473650001601482700002201498700001801520700002301538700002101561773009701582856009001679990002301769852000901792655001201801IND60095779220221123023152.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009577922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2011.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedwell, Paul R.14aThe influence on the soot distribution within a laminar flame of radiation at fluxes of relevance to concentrated solar radiation  ap. 1814-1821.  aAn assessment of the influence of high intensity radiation on the distribution of soot within a laminar ethylene flame is performed. Radiation at fluxes of up to 4.3MW/m², of a similar order encountered with concentrated solar radiation, is provided by a CO₂ laser at 10.6μm. Radiation at this wavelength, in the configuration used in this paper, allows effective isolation of three possible mechanisms of influence: molecular excitation of the fuel, irradiation of the soot, and irradiation of soot precursors. The influence of the radiation on the soot distribution is assessed by laser induced incandescence (LII) imaging in a plane that intersects with the CO₂ laser beam. It is found that the high intensity radiation has a dramatic influence on the flame. The high energy radiation acts to increase the peak volume fraction of the soot by up to 250%. The results show that whilst the effect is most pronounced due to heating of the fuel, heating of the soot can also be significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aethylene 3afuels 3aheat 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3asolar radiation 3asoot 3awavelengths1 aNathan, Graham J.1 aChan, Qing N.1 aAlwahabi, Zeyad T.1 aDally, Bassam B.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2011 Sept., v. 158, no. 9 p.1814-1821dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2011.01.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008200172300001800254520159500272592002801867650002601895650002201921650002501943650001401968650001701982650003101999650001402030650001102044650001902055650000902074651001102083700002002094700001802114700001702132773009702149856008602246852000902332655001202341IND60089006420221119175250.0141102e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008900642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.12.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBluvshtein, Nir10aEvaluating the impact of a limestone quarry on suspended and accumulated dust  ap. 1732-1739.  aRock quarrying and processing is a source of coarse and fine particulate matter, which is transported by wind to the quarry surroundings and may have an environmental impact. The current study evaluated the possible contribution of dust from such a pollution source, a limestone quarry in north Israel, during the dry summer season. Accumulated dust and total suspended particulate matter were collected following an analysis of the prevailing synoptic conditions to evaluate the background dust, its origin and expected mineralogical and chemical properties. We performed comparative gravimetric, chemical and mineralogical analyses between sites lying upwind and downwind of the limestone quarry and defined the background dust and its origin. During the summer season under the Persian trough synoptic system, mineral dust in the research area was mostly composed of material similar to the local lithosphere, mainly carbonate rocks, and thus to the quarried rock. High concentrations of some trace metals, on the other hand, were related to remote sources, as has been documented previously for the Persian trough synoptic condition. Gravimetric analysis found 300 to 400% more accumulated dust and up to 400% more total suspended particulate matter about 1km downwind versus upwind of the quarry. Mineralogical and chemical analyses of the dust samples, and of the quarried rock, revealed that the downwind site is enriched, relative to the upwind site, in the major component of the quarried rock–calcite, and that both sites are enriched in the major components of background dust.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3achemical analysis 3aenvironmental impact 3alimestone 3aparticulates 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution 3asummer 3atrace elements 3awind 3aIsrael1 aMahrer, Yitzhak1 aSandler, Amir1 aRytwo, Giora0 tAtmospheric environment.g2011 Mar., v. 45, no. 9 p.1732-1739dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.12.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014600164300001600310520101600326592002801342650001801370650001001388650001701398650001601415650002501431650001201456650001901468650001201487650001101499650001501510650001101525650002801536650002301564650002101587653002501608653002301633653001801656653002201674653002401696700001701720700002101737700001901758700001801777700001701795700002001812700002201832700002201854700001601876700001601892700002101908773015601929856008302085852000902168655001202177IND60642956320221118084950.0190809e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064295632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.04.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, P.T.10aSeasonal variation in the chemical composition and larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti of essential oils from Vitex gardneriana Schauer  ap. 329-332.  aThe seasonal variation in essential oils from leaves of Vitex gardneriana Schauer was studied.

It is used worldwide as a pesticide in agriculture and public health campaigns, including the control of Aedes aegypti proliferation. It has low volatility, high Kow value and high lability in aerobic aquatic systems but is considered persistent in anaerobic systems, with a half-life of 288.9 days. The objective of this study is to survey the environmental contamination by pyriproxyfen in aquatic environmental matrices, to review the acute and chronic toxicity in non-target aquatic organisms and to make a risk assessment for the organisms addressed in the bibliographic survey. Pyriproxyfen quantification studies in aquatic environmental matrices are quite scarce and punctual—not representative of regional and global contamination. The water of the River Júcar (Spain) presented the highest concentration of PPF (99.59 ng L⁻¹) among the matrices analysed, which is equivalent to 1% of the maximum dose allowed by the World Health Organization for use in drinking water. Acute and chronic aquatic toxicity studies with LC50, EC50, LOEC and NOEC values of PPF were compiled and interpreted to evaluate possible risks to non-target aquatic organisms. Pyriproxyfen caused a high risk at concentrations detected in aquatic environments for Daphnia magna, with probable reproductive effects and occasional survival risk. This species was the most sensitive to the pesticide, with the lowest estimated concentration of 50 % of effect values, followed by a freshwater fish (Xiphophorus maculatus) and estuarine crustaceans (Eurytemora affinis and Leander tenuicornis). The most resistant organisms to PPF within the endpoints addressed in this review were Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Capitella sp. (polychaete). Through the species sensitivity distribution (SSD), it was possible to estimate HC5 at 0.214 μg L⁻¹ and that 2.3 % of the species present high sensitivity to pyriproxyfen in the environmental concentration detected in river water and 25.82 % of the species are affected in the concentration allowed for lavicidal use. In order to obtain more accurate risk estimates, we suggest ecotoxicological assessments in other species, covering various taxa, with emphasis on microcrustaceans due to their fundamental role in the aquatic food web and taxonomic proximity to pesticide target organisms. Furthermore, additional studies of contamination in aquatic environmental matrices are required, with particular attention to freshwater and estuarine environments due to the proximity to the sources of pyriproxyfen and environmental characteristics suggesting high accumulation. Thus, it will be possible to estimate realistic exposure levels and risks in different environments, contributing to effective and safe decision making, integrating development, public health and environmental policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aCapitella 3aDanio rerio 3aDaphnia magna 3aEurytemora affinis 3aXiphophorus maculatus 3aagonists 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic food webs 3achronic toxicity 3adecision making 3adrinking water 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental policy 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3ahalf life 3ahealth promotion 3ainsecticide resistance 3ajuvenile hormones 3alethal concentration 50 3amedian effective concentration 3amosquito control 3apollution 3apyriproxyfen 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3ariver water 3arivers 3asurveys 3aSpain 0aLC50 0aEC50 0aEC90 0aNOEC 0aLOEC 0aPPF 0aJHA 0aJH 0aERA 0aSSD 0aHC5 0aPAF 0aWHO 0aUSEPA 0aIUPAC 0aRQ 0aReview 0aPesticide 0aAquatic contamination 0aEnvironmental risk1 aSouza-Santos, Lília P.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2020 May, v. 222 p.105448-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.1054483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001400186245013100200300002000331506007600351520134500427592002801772506003701800650001701837650002101854650001901875650000901894650001701903650002201920650003301942650002001975650002601995653002002021653002002041700002502061700001802086700002302104700001902127700001802146700002102164700001502185773017602200856007902376852000902455655001202464IND60172182620221207075725.0150602e20120724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017218262DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12055131092doi7 aPMC34097942pmcid7 a227784242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Que10aRegulatory switch enforced by basic helix-loop-helix and ACT-domain mediated dimerizations of the maize transcription factor R  ap. E2091-E2097.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe maize R2R3-MYB regulator C1 cooperates with the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) factor R to activate the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes coordinately. As is the case for other bHLH factors, R harbors several protein–protein interaction domains. Here we show that not the classical but rather a briefly extended R bHLH region forms homodimers that bind canonical G-box DNA motifs. This bHLH DNA-binding activity is abolished if the C-terminal ACT (aspartokinase, chorismate, and TyrA) domain is licensed to homodimerize. Then the bHLH remains in the monomeric form, allowing it to interact with R-interacting factor 1 (RIF1). In this configuration, the R–RIF1 complex is recruited to the promoters of a subset of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, such as A1 , through the interaction with its MYB partner C1. If, however, the ACT domain remains monomeric, the bHLH region dimerizes and binds to G-boxes present in several anthocyanin genes, such as Bz1 . Our results provide a mechanism by which a dimerization domain in a bHLH factor behaves as a switch that permits distinct configurations of a regulatory complex to be tethered to different promoters. Such a combinatorial gene regulatory framework provides one mechanism by which genes lacking obviously conserved cis -regulatory elements are regulated coordinately.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthocyanins 3aaspartate kinase 3achorismic acid 3acorn 3adimerization 3anucleotide motifs 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aregulator genes 3atranscription factors 0agene regulation 0apromoter switch1 aPattanaik, Sitakanta1 aFeller, Antje1 aWerkman, Joshua R.1 aChai, Chenglin1 aWang, Yongqin1 aGrotewold, Erich1 aYuan, Ling0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 July 24, v. 109, no. 30 p.E2091-E2097dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12055131093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245008200176520148900258592002801747650002101775650001701796650001901813650001101832650001501843650002901858650002101887650002801908653003601936653001701972653002001989700001802009700002302027700002002050700006502070700002202135700001702157773011602174856008702290852000902377655001202386IND60671695620221121114656.0200228e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067169562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1121292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasaeian, Alibakhsh10aSolar humidification-dehumidification desalination systems: A critical review  aShortage of potable water resources is becoming a major and concerning threat to sustainable development. This situation prompts the importance of employing urgent solutions of water desalination. However, desalination is very capital-intensive and consumes significant amounts of energy; since it is currently mostly driven by fossil fuels across the world, it could leave a very large carbon footprint. In this regard, moving towards green energy supplies for desalination is a must for today's world. Among multiple desalination techniques, humidification-dehumidification is one of the most efficient methods to be considered for remote regions with moderate fresh water demand. This is majorly because it requires minimal operational and maintenance considerations. In this review paper, solar humidification-dehumidification desalination is investigated and studied throughout the literature. Accordingly, all considerable research efforts of the field are analyzed and they are classified into three major categories, namely experimental studies, numerical studies, and optimization, exergy, and economic studies. This classification is conducted to make an appropriate balance among the performed studies based on the research methodology. Each section is in turn categorized and discussed comprehensively and the corresponding major research points are introduced.

Preconcentration of the analytes is performed by ionic-liquid-based dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction, with the cleaned-up extract as disperser solvent and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate as extraction solvent. Under the optimized conditions, correlation coefficients (r) were 0.998–0.999 and standard errors (S y/ₓ) were 2.67–3.37 × 10³for calibration curves in the range 50–1000 ng g⁻¹. Detection limits, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, ranged from 6 to 9 ng g⁻¹. Intra-day and inter-day repeatability, expressed as relative standard deviation, were in the ranges 1.0–6.9 % and 2.4–9.4 %, respectively. Recovery varied between 84 % and 106 %. The developed method was successfully used for analysis of the analytes in 28 edible oils. The dibutyl phthalate content of four of the 28 samples (14 %) exceeded the specific migration limit established by domestic and international regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3acooking fats and oils 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3adibutyl phthalate 3afood contamination 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionic liquids 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3asolid phase extraction1 aLiu, Shuhui1 aFan, Yingying1 aSun, Jianzhi1 aZhang, Xiaoke0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 July, v. 406, no. 18 p.4563-4569dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-7814-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04067naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245011900167300001600286500001400302500002000316520212800336592002802464596007002492596003602562596007902598650001502677650002802692650001202720650002402732650002002756650002302776650001502799650001102814650002502825650001102850650001602861650001502877650001002892650001402902650001402916650001302930650001002943650002202953650002502975650001303000650001403013651001103027700005903038700005803097700005903155700005703214773011803271856007903389852000903468655001203477IND60722989420221117225450.0210109e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072298942DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.136842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstandie, Noémie14aThe shape of the predator biomass distribution affects biological pest control services in agricultural landscapes  ap. 193-204.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding how community composition of service‐providing organisms affects ecosystem functioning is a key challenge in ecology. Although it has been proposed that taxonomic diversity and functional traits mediate this relationship, how several facets of community structure affect the delivery of key ecosystem services remains to be explored. In this study, we investigated how abundance, taxonomic richness as well as the shape of biomass distribution in predator communities affect biological pest control services in vineyard landscapes. Our analyses were based on a dataset combining samples of arthropod predators, measures of predation rates of grape pests and characterization of environmental covariables for 42 fields located in South‐Western France. We found that beside the abundance or the taxonomic richness of predators, the shape of biomass distribution (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the distribution) influences the level of biological control. Predator communities largely dominated by low biomass species provided the bulk of biological control services. Lower levels of predation resulted from increased proportions of large biomass species and more evenly distributed biomass values in the communities. Our results indicate that the top‐down control provided by low biomass species decreases as the relative proportion of large biomass species increases in the predator community. This suggests that biological control may be affected by negative interactions (e.g. intraguild predation, behavioural interactions) between predators arising from the recruitment of large individuals in the community. Our study revealed that the shape of biomass distribution is a major aspect of functional diversity in predator communities providing insights into the mechanisms that link biodiversity and ecosystem services. While our study focuses on biomass, considering other traits involved in trophic interactions may increase our ability to predict the level of biological control in ecosystems.

This new reaction therefore not only provides an alternative strategy for the α-hydroxylation of arones but also highlights the possibility of using the inexpensive common solvent DMF as a source of oxygen in organic synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adimethylformamide 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxygen 3asolvents1 aChen, Cui1 aZhou, Peng0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Feb. 17, v. 82, no. 4 p.2219-2222dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.6b027513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245012300151300001800274520186700292592002802159650001202187650002202199650001702221650001202238650001202250650001202262650002202274650001402296650001602310650001902326650001402345650001702359650001902376650001102395650001002406650001002416650001002426650001602436650001502452650002202467650001102489651001002500700001102510700001202521700001602533700001202549773011102561856007202672852000902744655001202753IND60479113220221120224101.0160117e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047911322DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.28342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Y.10aLife‐History Plasticity of Riparian Annual Plants Adapted to Extreme Variations in Water Level: Mesocosm Experiments  ap. 1311-1318.  aThe riparian zones of reservoirs associated with regulated rivers in China experience annual fluctuations in water level of up to 30 m that may vary in timing from year to year. Few plant species can tolerate such hydrological perturbation, but short‐lived riparian annuals might be evolutionarily pre‐adapted to such conditions. This study investigated plasticity of life history in four annual species: one typically associated with free‐flowing rivers (Panicum bisulcatum) and three that colonize reservoir margins (Cyperus michelianus, Fimbristylis miliacea and Eclipta prostrata). We found that all four species produced non‐dormant seeds that survived prolonged submergence; germination percentage was independent of the time of exposure by receding waters. Although growth was reduced as a result of shorter growing seasons, all four species completed their life cycles and produced seeds before winter. In addition, P. bisulcatum and C. michelianus allocated biomass to seed production, at the expense of roots and stems, in response to later establishment. All species responded to later establishment with a reduced vegetative growth period before seed production. C. michelianus, F. miliacea and E. prostrate could also delay the onset of flowering time by up to 2 months. P. bisulcatum, a plant that can flower only after exposure to short days, consequently had a fixed flowering time and could accommodate delayed establishment only with a progressively shorter period of vegetative growth. This lower flexibility might explain its absence from reservoir margins. The conceptual framework presented here offers a tool to predict the establishment of vegetation under hydrological disturbance in riparian environments and thereby provides insights into improved restoration practice.

Currently, one innovative solution is The Cocoon™, which has been designed as a new ecotechnology for improving seedling establishment. The Cocoon consists of a doughnut‐shaped container made of recycled cardboard that provides water and shelter at least during the first year of a seedling, which is the most critical for plant establishment. To determine the effectiveness of this ecotechnology under different conditions, the Cocoon was tested on a variety of soils, climates, vegetation, and land uses. Six planting trials were performed in Spain and Greece, which covered a range from humid to arid climates. With the objective of studying its functionality, the survival of the seedlings, their vigor, and growth were monitored for 2 years. Compared with conventional planting systems, the Cocoon has effectively increased seedling survival, especially under dry growing conditions (low rainfall, soils with low water holding capacity). The Cocoon also allowed for higher growth of some species (olive trees, holm oaks, and Aleppo pines). Moreover, a positive correlation between the rainfall on the site and the biodegradation degree of the Cocoon device was observed. Overall, the Cocoon becomes more efficient in arid climates or adverse growing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aLIFE15 CCA/ES/000125cEU Life Program  aLIFE19 CCM/ES/001199cEU Life Program 3abiodegradation 3acardboard 3adesertification 3aland degradation 3aolives 3aplant establishment 3arain 3aseedlings 3avegetation 3avigor 3awater conservation 3aGreece 3aSpain1 aAlba‐Patiño, Daniela1 aGarcía, Sergio,1 aCampo, Julián1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0009-138X1 aLovenstein, Harrie1 aVan Leijen, Gertruud1 aCastro, Antonio J.1 aGonzález, Francisco,1 aViera, Gustavo1 aKourkoumpas, Dimitrios‐Sotirios1 aZioga, Argyro Aliki1 aPapadelis, Christos Emmanouel1 aAndreu, Vicente1 aGimeno, Eugènia1 aKallen, Sven1 aAlcañiz, Josep Maria0 tLand degradation & development.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 33, no. 1 p.133-144dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.41343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245010100201506007600302520138400378592002801762506003701790650001901827650001201846650002001858650002001878650002201898650001401920650001301934650001601947650000901963650001301972650001001985700001901995700002102014773012002035856007402155852000902229655001202238IND60674441820221207110345.0191025e20191017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067444182DNAL7 a10.3390/ani91008212doi7 aPMC68270952pmcid7 a316274092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Helen 10aGiven the Cold Shoulder: A Review of the Scientific Literature for Evidence of Reptile Sentience  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe searched a selection of the scientific literature to document evidence for, and explorations into reptile sentience. The intention of this review was to highlight; (1) to what extent reptile capability for emotions have been documented in the scientific literature; (2) to discuss the implications this evidence has for the trade in reptiles; and (3) to outline what future research is needed to maximise their captive welfare needs. We used 168 keywords associated with sentience, to search through four journal databases and one open-access journal. We recorded studies that explored sentience in reptiles and those that recognised reptile sentience in their experiments. We found that reptiles were assumed to be capable of the following emotions and states; anxiety, distress, excitement, fear, frustration, pain, stress, and suffering, in 37 articles. We also found four articles that explored and found evidence for the capacity of reptiles to feel pleasure, emotion, and anxiety. These findings show that reptiles are considered to be capable of experiencing a range of emotions and states. This has implications for how reptiles are treated in captivity, as a better understanding could help to inform a range of different operational initiatives aimed at reducing negative animal welfare impacts, including improved husbandry and consumer behaviour change programmes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal welfare 3aanxiety 3abehavior change 3acaptive animals 3aconsumer behavior 3adatabases 3adistress 3afearfulness 3apain 3areptiles 3atrade1 aCarder, Gemma 1 aD’Cruze, Neil 0 tAnimals.g2019 Oct. 17, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani91008213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245013400166300001600300520129600316592002801612650001901640650002601659650001601685650001101701650002601712650001801738650002001756650005201776650002501828650001701853700001501870700001801885700001501903773009901918856005502017852000902072655001202081IND4468600920221120091103.0120315e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446860092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2011.02505.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidal, E.10aEstimation of the accuracy of two diagnostic methods for the detection of Plum pox virus in nursery blocks by latent class models  ap. 413-422.  aThe control of Plum pox virus (PPV), the most important viral disease that affects stone fruit trees, requires the use of reliable detection methods. The effectiveness of spot real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for the detection of PPV in samples collected from nursery blocks was compared with a validated PPV detection technique, the double antibody sandwich indirect enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (DASI‐ELISA) using the PPV‐specific monoclonal antibody 5B‐IVIA/AMR. In total, 5047 nursery plants were analysed by both techniques. The agreement between the techniques was almost perfect (Cohen’s kappa index of 0·88 ± 0·01). The diagnostic parameters (sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios) of both techniques were simultaneously evaluated in 2473 nursery plants by latent class models using maximum likelihood functions and a Bayesian approach. The sensitivity and specificity of both techniques did not vary according to the latent model applied. Spot real‐time RT‐PCR was more sensitive while DASI‐ELISA was more specific for PPV detection. In addition, the findings demonstrate that latent class models are a flexible and potent statistical method to estimate the accuracy of diagnostic tests for plant pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlum pox virus 3adiagnostic techniques 3afruit trees 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anursery crops 3aplant pathology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astatistical analysis 3astone fruits1 aMoreno, A.1 aBertolini, E.1 aCambra, M.0 tPlant pathology.g2012 Apr., v. 61, no. 2 p.413-422dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2011.02505.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245011600156300001800272520170500290592002801995650002102023650002402044650002102068650001502089650001702104650002002121650001402141650001502155650001102170650002202181650001502203651001702218651001302235700001802248700002302266700001502289700001702304773011102321856007202432852000902504655001202513IND60479113320221120224146.0160117e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047911332DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.28162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhomikong, P.10aDiversity and Community Structure of Fishes in the Regulated Versus Unregulated Tributaries of the Mekong River  ap. 1262-1275.  aDiversity and community structure of fishes were studied in three neighbouring tributaries of the Mekong River in Thailand, namely the Mun, Songkhram and Gam Rivers. The rivers are located in the same ecoregion but have contrasting levels of both hydrological regulations and mitigation measures; the Mun River has a hydropower dam with a fish ladder and sluice gates that are opened during the wet season each year, the Gam River has several irrigation dams with a fish ladder at each dam site, and the Songkhram River has no dams along its river course. A total of 124 freshwater fish species were sampled in these rivers from August 2009 to June 2010. Overall species richness was highest in the Songkhram River (112), followed by the Mun (97) and Gam (54) Rivers. Average per site species richness was also significantly different among rivers but not among sampling months. Abundance–biomass comparison plots revealed considerably overlapping distributions of these two metrics from the dry to early rainy seasons in the Songkhram River and, to a lesser extent, in the Mun River. Fish assemblage data were classified into six clusters with similar community structure. Fish assemblages in the Gam River constituted a single cluster, while those in the other two rivers formed multiple clusters depending on the sampling season. The results of the cluster analysis are discussed in relation to the dominance of the three migration guilds (white, black, and grey fishes) of the Mekong River fishes. The effectiveness of the mitigation measures was determined to be limited in alleviating adverse impacts of dams in these tributaries of the Mekong River.

The objective of this study was to establish reference ranges of a set of representative isoprostanes and prostaglandins, which are stable biomarkers of lipid peroxidation often correlated with oxidative stress-related disorders. First, a quantitative ultra performance liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated. The proposed analytical method was tailored for its application in the field of neonatology, enabling multi-analyte detection in non-invasive, small-volume urine samples. Then, the lipid peroxidation product concentrations in a total of 536 urine samples collected within the framework of two clinical trials including extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGAN) were analyzed. The access to a substantially large number of samples from this very vulnerable population provided the chance to establish reference ranges of the studied biomarkers. Up to the present, and for this population, this is the biggest reference data set reported in literature. Results obtained should assist researchers and pediatricians in interpreting test results in future studies involving isoprostanes and prostaglandins, and could help assessing morbidities and evaluate effectiveness of treatment strategies (e.g., different resuscitation conditions) in the neonatal field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3abiomarkers 3aclinical trials 3adata collection 3agestational age 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3aliquid chromatography 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aneonates 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aprostaglandins 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine1 aEscóbar, Javier,1 aQuintás, Guillermo,1 aLliso, Isabel1 aTorres-Cuevas, Isabel1 aNúñez, Antonio,1 aCubells, Elena1 aRook, Denise1 avan Goudoever, Johannes B.1 aVento, Máximo0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 July, v. 406, no. 18 p.4345-4356dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-7824-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245012900194300001400323500002000337520161400357592002801971596004201999596006002041650001202101650001802113650002002131650002302151650001202174650003102186650001502217650002102232650006502253650001802318650001702336650001702353651001302370700005502383700005402438700006302492700006202555700005702617700005902674773013202733856007302865852000902938655001202947IND60762124720221119193145.0220107e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076212472DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.41302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Cholho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8491-954510aSpatial assessment of land degradation using MEDALUS focusing on potential afforestation and reforestation areas in Ethiopia  ap. 79-93.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEthiopia currently faces severe land degradation and desertification and has attracted increasing attention for international restoration projects. However, selecting appropriate potential afforestation and reforestation areas is challenging because of limited geospatial assessment tools on a national scale. Therefore, the globally used MEDALUS approach was applied to identify areas sensitive to land degradation and desertification, and indices were utilized to establish the main drivers from 2000 to 2019. The value of the environmentally sensitive area index (ESAI) ranged from 1 to 1.58. Addis Ababa, Afar, Somali, and Tigray had relatively high ESAI values, approaching the over 1.42 which regarded critical thresholds. However, the main driver of land degradation and desertification was identified as the management quality index (MQI) and the analysis of relationships indicated that the climate quality index, soil quality index, and MQI caused changes in the vegetation quality index. Increasing housing, agricultural transitions, and urbanization, were identified by on‐site visual interpretation. Even though some land cover changes and fluctuations of the indices existed on a national scale, the deforestation areas in Amhara, Benshangul‐Gumaz, and Oromia West have the highest priority for forest restoration projects. Thus, international attention to afforestation and reforestation clean development mechanism (A/R CDM) and reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is required to combat desertification and to secure land degradation neutrality in Ethiopia.  aPublisher supplied data  aS211215L030320cKorean Forest Service  a2020R1C1C1007165cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aclimate 3adeforestation 3adesertification 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3ageospatial data processing 3aland cover 3aland degradation 3areducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 3areforestation 3asoil quality 3aurbanization 3aEthiopia1 aKim, Whijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7093-73121 aKim, Jiwon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1856-41141 aGebru, Belay Manjur1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6607-23201 aAdane, Girma Berhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1495-89091 aChoi, Yun Eui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9114-63091 aLee, Woo‐Kyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2188-359X0 tLand degradation & development.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 33, no. 1 p.79-93dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.41303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04198naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005100144245024800195300001800443520237100461592002802832650001302860650001602873650001002889650001102899650001402910650002302924650001402947650002802961650001002989650003302999650001203032650001703044650001003061650001503071653001403086653002803100653003303128653002003161700001303181700005403194700001403248700001503262700005403277700005403331700005403385773015303439856007903592852000903671655001203680IND60686096920221117233612.0210121e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068609692DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-172192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyo, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2111-096810aFeeding colostrum or a 1:1 colostrum:milk mixture for 3 days postnatal increases small intestinal development and minimally influences plasma glucagon-like peptide-2 and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 concentrations in Holstein bull calves  ap. 4236-4251.  aThis study evaluated how feeding colostrum- or a colostrum-milk mixture for 3 d postnatal affects plasma glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and small intestinal histomorphology in calves. Holstein bulls (n = 24) were fed colostrum at 2 h postnatal and randomly assigned to receive either colostrum (COL), whole milk (WM), or a 1:1 COL:WM mixture (MIX) every 12 h from 12 to 72 h. A jugular venous catheter was placed at 1 h postnatal to sample blood frequently for the duration of the experiment. Samples were collected at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, and 12 h. Following the 12-h meal, blood was collected at half-hour intervals until 16 h and then at 1-h intervals from 16 to 24 h. A 27-h sample was taken, then blood was sampled every 6 h from 30 to 60 h. Again, blood was taken at half-intervals from 60 to 64 h, then at 65 and 66 h, following which, a 2-h sampling interval was used until 72 h. Plasma GLP-2 (all time points) and serum IGF-1 (at time points: 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h) were both analyzed. Duodenal, jejunal, and ileal tissues were collected at 75 h of age to assess histomorphology and cellular proliferation. Feeding COL, rather than WM, increased plasma GLP-2 by 60% for 2 h and tended to increase GLP-2 by 49.4% for 4 h after the 60-h meal. Insulin-like growth factor-1 area under the curve (from 12 to 72 h) tended to be 27% greater for COL than WM calves but was otherwise unaffected by treatment. Ileal crypts tended to proliferate more with MIX than WM, whereas ileal crypt proliferation did not differ for COL compared with MIX or WM and was not different between treatments in the proximal jejunum. Villi height was increased 1.8 and 1.5× (COL and MIX vs. WM) in the proximal and distal jejunum, respectively, whereas MIX duodenal and ileal villi height tended to be 1.5 and 1.4× that of WM. Crypt depth did not differ in any region. Surface area of the gastrointestinal tract was reduced for WM by 60 and 58% (proximal jejunum) and 38 and 52% (ileum) relative to COL and MIX and was 54% less than MIX in the distal jejunum. Overall, extended COL feeding minimally increased plasma GLP-2 and serum IGF-1 compared with WM feeding.

Hypervirulent strains of the pathogen, which are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality of CDI, produce the binary actin-ADP ribosylating toxin Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT) in addition to the Rho-glucosylating toxins A and B. CDT depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton, increases adherence and colonization of Clostridia by induction of microtubule-based cell protrusions and, eventually, causes death of target cells. Using a haploid genetic screen, we identified the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor as the membrane receptor for CDT uptake by target cells. Moreover, we show that Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, which is a related binary actin-ADP ribosylating toxin, enters target cells via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor. Identification of the toxin receptors is essential for understanding of the toxin uptake and provides a most valuable basis for antitoxin strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium difficile 3aClostridium perfringens 3aantitoxins 3acolitis 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3ahaploidy 3alipoproteins 3amicrofilaments 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogens 3areceptors 3atoxins1 aCarette, Jan E.1 aBell, George W.1 aSchwan, Carsten1 aGuttenberg, Gregor1 aBrummelkamp, Thijn R.1 aAktories, K.,0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Sept. 27, v. 108, no. 39 p.16422-16427dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11097721083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003100138245012100169300001800290520189800308592002802206650001102234650001102245650001302256650001502269650001102284650002202295650001102317650001602328650003002344650002302374650002502397650001602422650001102438651002202449651001702471651001002488700002802498700002702526700002302553700002702576773011102603856007202714852000902786655001202795IND60479113720221120213827.0160117e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047911372DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.28252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández‐Martínez, M.10aTemporal Variability and Potential Predictability of the Streamflow Regimes in the North‐Eastern Iberian Peninsula  ap. 1287-1298.  aThis paper investigates the temporal variability and potential predictability of streamflow regimes in the north‐eastern Spain for the 1970–2010 period. Two different regimes are found, those characterized for having peak flows in the winter and those where this maximum appears in the spring. The main characteristic time scales of streamflows in each area are studied by singular spectral analysis (SSA). While winter streamflow regime only shows interannual variability (quasi‐oscillatory modes around 5.5 and 2.3 years), spring streamflow (2.6 and 6.6 years) also presents a decadal variability component. Based on this result, a modelling process is conducted using autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, for interannual variability modelling, and stable teleconnections between global oceanic sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and river flow, for decadal variability modelling. Finally, a one‐step‐ahead prediction experiment is computed to obtain forecasted streamflows. The results for winter streamflow regime modelling show a phase concordance between the raw and the forecasted streamflow time series of around 70% and a correlation around 0.7, for the validation period (2001–2010). For spring streamflow, additionally to the ARMA modelling for the interannual component, a model based on the SST has been established that involves some oceanic regions from previous seasons located, fundamentally, not only in the North Atlantic but also in the Indian Ocean. The combined model (SST + ARMA) significantly improves the prediction based on the ARMA model alone, showing a phase concordance and a correlation around 90% and 0.7 respectively. This modelling scheme provides predictability skills of the rivers from the Inland Catalan Basins at different time scales, representing an added value for water planning.

One of the most important ways to improve the efficiency is using the organic Rankine cycles. In this study, the waste heat from industrial complexes with temperature in the range of 120–300 °C was used to generate power through an organic Rankine cycle with different working fluids. In this regard, carrying out energy and exergy analyses on the organic Rankine cycle revealed that for each heat source temperature the maximum efficiency happens when a specific working fluid utilizes at a certain boiler pressure. According to the results, a heat source temperature of 120 °C had the highest energy and exergy efficiencies at a maximum pressure of 624(kPa) for working fluid of R245fa. Also, the optimum working fluids for the heat source temperatures of 150 and 200 °C were R152a and R141b, respectively. These working fluids also had the highest efficiency at the maximum pressures of 2735 and 847.5(kPa). Furthermore, for the heat source temperatures of 250 and 300 °C, Benzene and Water had the highest efficiencies that occurred at the maximum pressures of 398.8 and 452.1(kPa).  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3aexergy 3aheat 3aindustry 3apower generation 3atemperature 0aORC 0aWorking fluid 0aBoiler pressure 0aHeat source temperature1 aMohammadi, Saeed1 aTayyeban, Edris0 tEnergy.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.116856-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010200166520121400268592002801482650002701510650002501537650001601562650002801578650002201606650001701628650001201645650002101657650001401678650001101692650001901703650002501722650002401747651001001771653002301781653002201804653001801826700001601844700001501860700001301875700001401888700002001902773009001922856008502012852000902097655001202106IND60681524220221120161750.0200217e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068152422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Hongye10aConstraining the oligopoly manipulation in electricity market: A vertical integration perspective  aIn the recent years, the electricity market deregulation reforms are prevalent in many countries, bringing about the problem of market power abuse. As a typical property right structure transformation approach, the vertical integration has rarely been considered and analyzed as a countermeasure towards market power abuse problem. Facing the diverging attitudes on the vertical integration around the world, the problems of whether the vertical integration should be allowed in the wholesale market still remains vague. Thus, the paper proposes a framework to analyze the decision scheme of vertically integrated companies and their corresponding impacts on the market operation. The model is built in the bilevel format, with the consideration on the particularities of electricity markets. The nonlinear model is then transformed into the linearization format. Based on the real generation mix data in Guangdong province, China, the market equilibrium with/without vertical integration is presented, combined with the analysis on the market clearing price, social welfare, and profit allocation. Finally, the policy suggestions on the vertical integration in the deregulated electricity market is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abusiness enterprises 3aelectricity 3agovernment deregulation 3aissues and policy 3amarket power 3amarkets 3anonlinear models 3aoligopoly 3aprices 3asocial welfare 3avertical integration 3awholesale marketing 3aChina 0aElectricity market 0aStrategic bidding 0aMarket policy1 aChen, Qixin1 aZhang, Yan1 aLiu, Kai1 aXia, Qing1 aKang, Chongqing0 tEnergy.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.116877-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002900188245014400217300001600361506007600377520118700453592002801640506003701668650001201705650001701717650002601734650001401760650001201774650001001786650001301796650003101809650001401840650001901854700002501873700002101898700001701919700002401936700002201960773009401982856008102076852000902157655001202166IND60121154720221207085619.0150216e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012115472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-014-2689-62doi7 aPMC40772562pmcid7 a250678472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHałka-Grysińska, Aneta10aInfluence of the Modifier Type and its Concentration on Electroosmotic Flow of the Mobile Phase in Pressurized Planar Electrochromatography  ap. 941-950.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this work was to find a relationship between electroosmotic flow (EOF) velocity of the mobile phase in pressurized planar electrochromatography (PPEC) and physicochemical properties like zeta potential, dielectric constant, and viscosity of the mobile phase as well as its composition. The study included different types of organic modifiers (acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, acetone, formamide, N-methylformamide and N,N-dimethylformamide) in the full concentration range. In all experiments, chromatographic glass plates HPTLC RP-18 W from Merck (Darmstadt) were used as a stationary phase. During the study we found that there is no linear correlation between EOF velocity of the mobile phase and single variables such as zeta potential or dielectric constant or viscosity. However, there is quite strong linear correlation between EOF velocity of the mobile phase and variable obtained by multiplying zeta potential of the stationary phase–mobile phase interface, by dielectric constant of the mobile phase solution and dividing by viscosity of the mobile phase. Therefore, it could be concluded that the PPEC system fulfilled the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski equation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetone 3aacetonitrile 3aelectrochromatography 3aequations 3aethanol 3aglass 3amethanol 3aphysicochemical properties 3aviscosity 3azeta potential1 aPłocharz, Paweł W.1 aTorbicz, Andrzej1 aSkwarek, Ewa1 aJanusz, Władysław1 aDzido, Tadeusz H.0 tChromatographia.g2014 July, v. 77, no. 13-14 p.941-950dSpringer-Verlagx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-014-2689-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245009800185300001600283520082600299592002801125650001801153650002101171650002201192650001301214650001201227650003501239650001101274650002001285650001201305650001201317650001301329650001101342650001201353650000901365650001901374650000901393650000901402650001401411650001401425650001201439650001501451650001101466650001601477650001401493650001301507650000801520650001301528650000901541651001101550653003701561653003501598653003001633653003201663653003001695653003501725653003501760653003401795653003301829653002101862653003301883653002001916653001101936653001901947700002701966700004301993700003202036700003002068773010002098856008702198852000902285655001202294IND60573424020221119191921.0190402e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057342402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.07.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Wagna Piler Carvalho10aBioaccessibility assessment of toxic and essential elements in produced pulses, Bahia, Brazil  ap. 112-122.  aThe objective of this study was to analyze the effect of heat treatment on the bioaccessibility of major (K, Ca, Mg, P) and trace elements (As, Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Sb, Sn, and Zn) in three different pulse species: Vigna unguiculata L.

The North American population was monitored for a three‐year period during institutional transfers and breeding introductions. In total, 26 fishing cats, including 15 different breeding pairs were monitored during 20 transfers. Most institutional transfers occurred in the fall months (September, October and November; 62%; n = 13) and males were transferred more often (62%; n = 13). Breeding success (observed copulations) was recorded in 33% (n = 5) of pairs but only 13% (n = 2 pairs) produced offspring during the study period. Institutions with successful breeding pairs had a greater number of indoor, off‐exhibit enclosures (2.67 ± 0.29 enclosures; n = 5) compared to facilities with unsuccessful pairs (1.69 ± 0.25 exhibits; n = 6; p = 0.035). In addition, facilities housing successful pairs performed positive reinforcement training more frequently (14.77 ± 3.27 training days/month) than facilities with unsuccessful pairs (4.00 ± 2.73 days/month; p = 0.035). A binomial generalized linear model showed that friendly vocalizations (p = 0.000) during physical introductions of intended breeding pairs predicted copulation success. Introductions performed when a female was exhibiting estrous behavior (p = 0.020), was also predictive of copulation success. Results from this study are the first comprehensive analyses of captive management in the fishing cat. Environmental factors and management approaches are highlighted that could advance animal welfare and improve reproductive success in this species.  aPublisher supplied data  cSmithsonian's Animal Behavior Group  cOklahoma City Zoo's Conservation Action Now Grant  cGeorge Mason University  cAmerican Association of Zookeepers 3aPrionailurus viverrinus 3aanimal welfare 3aautumn 3abreeding 3acopulation 3adisease prevalence 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3alinear models 3amales 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3avocalization 3azoos1 aFreeman, Elizabeth W.1 aBauer, Erika1 aRockwood, Larry1 aParsons, Edward C.

The spinach powder (1, 2, and 3 g/100 g) was supplemented with refined wheat flour to investigate its effect on physicochemical and antioxidant properties of bread. The mixing, pasting, and rheological properties of dough, as well as physical, antioxidant, and sensory properties of bread were analyzed. Results showed that water absorption%, stability and development time, protein weakening, and starch crystallinity of spinach samples increased to 62.40%, 5.92/min, 2.05/min, 0.76 Nm, and 0.21 Nm. The peak viscosity, final viscosity, setback, and breakdown values were significantly decreased to 2205.71, 2485.05, 1122.74, and 843.36 cP, respectively. Samples exhibited the highest elastic (218017 Pa) and viscous (94257.76 Pa) moduli and the lowest specific volume (3.12 cm³/g), color attributes, and sensorial properties. Furthermore, breads stored for different periods showed the minimum hardness (4151.67 N), chewiness (826.33 N), and resilience (0.08) compared to control. In addition, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and 2,2′-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid properties were also significantly improved in corresponding samples. Findings suggest that incorporating spinach into wheat flour could be a viable approach to produce healthy bread enriched with fiber, protein, and antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAdequate Intakes 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abreads 3achewiness 3acolor 3acrystal structure 3adietary fiber 3adough 3adurum wheat 3ahardness 3ahuman health 3aspinach 3astarch 3aviscosity 3awheat flour 0aSpinach powder 0aDough and bread preparation 0aRheological properties1 aRashid, Alam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7487-71961 aYang, Liping1 aXu, Yan1 aKraithong, Supaluck1 aZhou, Yibin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Oct., v. 150 p.112058-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1120583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01441naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245012100162300001800283520044900301592002800750650001200778650002600790650002500816650001200841650001300853650002200866700001700888700001400905773011800919856008101037852000901118655001201127IND60563427520221119105232.0170217e20170217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056342752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b028172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Junjie10aAtom-Economic Synthesis of Pentaleno[2,1-b]indoles via Tandem Cyclization of Alkynones Initiated by Aminopalladation  ap. 1977-1985.  aAn atom-economic Pd(OAc)₂-catalyzed tandem cyclization of alkynones to synthesize pentaleno[2,1-b]indoles was developed efficiently.

This systematic review focused on the evaluation of the potential risk of the transmission of Toxocara by dogs&rsquo; fur, considering their involvement as the main animal species in AAIs. Three databases were considered: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, and the PRISMA guidelines were used. Out of 162 articles found, 14 papers were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review. Although the findings were very heterogeneous, they showed that regular parasitological surveillance to plan effective control programs is strongly needed to guarantee the health of pets and consequently the public health, according to the concept of One Health. Since AAIs involve patients and/or users potentially susceptible, it is very important to appropriately treat dogs enrolled in these interventions after an accurate diagnosis of parasitic zoonoses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOne Health initiative 3aToxocara 3adatabases 3adogs 3aeggs 3afur 3aguidelines 3amonitoring 3apatients 3apets 3apublic health 3asystematic review 3azoonoses1 aSantaniello, Antonio 1 aFioretti, Alessandro 1 aCringoli, Giuseppe 1 aRinaldi, Laura 1 aMenna, Lucia  Francesca0 tAnimals.g2019 Oct. 19, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani91008273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100005800180245007900238300001600317500002000333506007600353520173200429592002802161506003702189650001402226650001202240650001002252650001302262650002702275650001302302650002302315650002602338650002802364650000902392651001902401700002002420773011102440856007302551852000902624655001202633IND60635665220221207084628.0190402e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063566522DNAL7 a10.1002/zoo.214762doi7 aPMC68501822pmcid7 a306720082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeaver, Joseph1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7036-850012aA retrospective study of mortality in Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in UK zoos  ap. 200-208.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIUCN currently classifies the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) as “Least Concern,” however, across its six to nine subspecies, some isolated populations are classified as “Endangered” or “Critically Endangered.” Despite this and the species’ relative ubiquity in European zoos, a retrospective mortality study of a captive population has not previously been performed. By analyzing necropsy reports, animal records, and the European studbook, we were able to ascertain a cause of death for 38 (73%) of the 52 recorded lynx deaths in UK zoos during the study period (January 1, 2000 to November 1, 2015). “Culling” as part of population management was the most common cause of death (21%) followed by neoplastic (16%), circulatory (11%), neurological (11%), and genitourinary (11%) disease. “Geriatric” individuals accounted for 62% of lynx to die within the study period, 23% were “neonates” and 15% “adults.” Neoplasia, circulatory disease, and culling were the leading causes of death in each of these age categories, respectively. Excluding “culls” and “neonates,” the mean age at death was 18.81 ± 0.42 years, consistent with existing data. Squamous cell carcinoma was reported in three individuals (8%) and suspected idiopathic epilepsy in four individuals (11%), warranting further investigation. Intraspecific killing (3%) and neonatal mortality, excluding culls, (14%) were reported with lower prevalence than expected based on previous studies of similar species. The lack of data available and high incidence of culling of individuals with a high inbreeding coefficient highlights the need for improved record‐keeping and consultation with the studbook coordinator, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLynx lynx 3aanimals 3adeath 3aepilepsy 3ainbreeding coefficient 3anecropsy 3aneonatal mortality 3aretrospective studies 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3azoos 3aUnited Kingdom1 aWaters, Michael0 tZoo biology.g2019 Mar., v. 38, no. 2 p.200-208dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34050x0733-31887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/zoo.214763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016100171520125700332592002801589650001401617650001701631650002801648650001101676650000901687650001601696650001001712650002101722650001701743650001201760651001401772653003801786653001701824653001201841653001801853653004401871700002001915700001301935700001901948773009001967856008502057852000902142655001202151IND60681524420221120145319.0200217e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068152442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1169082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendis, Thushini10aEconomic potential analysis of photovoltaic integrated shading strategies on commercial building facades in urban blocks: A case study of Colombo, Sri Lanka  aBuilding integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are becoming a viable solution for clean on-site energy production and utilisation. In tropical climates, although rooftops are ideal for photovoltaic (PV) module integration, the available area may be insufficient to meet building energy demand due to the increase in high-rise urban buildings, causing a requirement for the utilisation of facades. However, the high solar elevation angle means that facades are unfavourably oriented towards receiving incident irradiation. Also, the issue exists of high solar heat gains into built spaces. This paper evaluates the utilisation of horizontally inclined PV integrated shading strategies to combat these issues based on the urban context of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Various strategies are evaluated in terms of their inclination angles and the distance between installations, and urban blocks in Colombo are analysed in terms of how they affect the solar potential in the urban canyon. The results are analysed in terms of economic potential to determine the optimised installation strategies based on urban block type. The results suggest that installations inclined at 30° at a distance-to-length ratio of 4 provide the greatest economic viability in this context.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acase studies 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3aheat 3airradiation 3ashade 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atropics 3aSri Lanka 0aBuilding integrated photovoltaics 0aOptimisation 0aFacades 0aUrban density 0aPhotovoltaic integrated shading systems1 aHuang, Zhaojian1 aXu, Shen1 aZhang, Weirong0 tEnergy.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.116908-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1169083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013400156300002000290520129600310592002801606650004401634650002201678650003501700650001401735650002301749650001101772650001901783650001601802650002801818650001401846650001701860650001301877650001301890650001401903650001101917650002001928650001101948650001301959650003701972700001302009700001802022700001702040700002002057700001502077773013602092856007502228852000902303655001202312IND60537728420221119223817.0160809e20140625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053772842DNAL7 a10.1021/ie50082132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Jinhui10aAerobic Oxidation of Cyclohexane Effectively Catalyzed by Simply Synthesized Silica-Supported Cobalt Ferrite Magnetic Nanocrystal  ap. 10294-10300.  aSilica-supported magnetic cobalt ferrite complex oxides, CoFe₂O₄/SiO₂, with different loading of 5, 10, 20, and 50% were simply prepared by a sol–gel autocombustion method using colloidal aqueous silica solution as a cheap silica source. The as-prepared samples were well characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N₂ physisorption. Metals contents of the samples were also determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Their catalytic performances were evaluated on cyclohexane oxidation using oxygen as oxidant in the absence of solvents and reductants. The supported catalysts have shown high catalytic activities for cyclohexane oxidation. Especially, when 5% loading of CoFe₂O₄/SiO₂ was employed, 4181 turnover number and 95.4% selectivity for cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol were obtained under 1.6 MPa of initial oxygen pressure at 418 K after 6.0 h of reaction. The sample of 50% of CoFe₂O₄/SiO₂ has strong magnetism and can be magnetically separated easily. This sample was employed as catalyst to optimize the reaction conditions. The catalyst showed prominent reusability, and no obvious loss in activity was observed when reused in six consecutive runs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acyclohexanones 3aengineering 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3ananocrystals 3anitrogen 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3areducing agents 3asilica 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aBo, Lili1 aCai, Xiaodong1 aWang, Haiyan1 aZhang, Qianping1 aSu, Lingdi0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 June 25, v. 53, no. 25 p.10294-10300dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie50082133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245013100213520097300344592002801317653003301345653002101378653003401399653003301433653002001466653001901486700001901505700002501524700002501549700001801574773011101592856008701703852000901790655001201799IND60671696920221121042903.0200106e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067169692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchottroff, Felix1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1018-966610aChallenges and limitations for the decontamination of high solids protein solutions at neutral pH using pulsed electric fields  aPulsed electric fields (PEF) can be used to pasteurize aqueous liquid foods at reduced temperatures to provide increased product quality, depending on the individual product to be treated. Thus, the continuous decontamination of high solids (10–25% dm) protein solutions by PEF at neutral pH was investigated in detail in this study, evaluating different processing strategies.indicate that, independent of the individual matrix used (10, 18, 25% whey protein; 10% skim milk concentrate, skim milk), inactivation levels obtained using a co-linear treatment chamber were in the same range and seemingly only based on heat-induced mechanisms. The use of further alternative treatment chamber configurations did also not positively influence the effectiveness of continuous PEF pasteurization. This confirms the protective effect of proteins considering inactivation of microorganisms by PEF and the decreased efficiency of the treatment for foods at neutral pH levels.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPulsed electric fields (PEF) 0aListeria innocua 0aHigh solids protein solutions 0aTreatment chamber evaluation 0aDecontamination 0aPasteurization1 aJohnson, Katja1 aJohnson, Nicholas B.1 aBédard, Matthieu F.1 aJaeger, Henry0 tJournal of food engineering.g2020 Mar., v. 268 p.109737-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013600171300001600307520106700323592002801390650002101418650002501439650001301464650002301477650002201500650002801522650001801550650001201568650001201580650001301592650003901605650001501644650001301659650001301672650001501685650001001700653001001710653000801720653000801728653000701736653000801743653000901751653001201760653005001772653001601822653001501838653001501853653001101868700001801879700001801897700002001915700001801935773010001953856008702053852000902140655001202149IND60573424220221119191857.0190402e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057342422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.07.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorab, Hamida10aProteomic analysis of sweet algerian apricot kernels (Prunus armeniaca L.) by combinatorial peptide ligand libraries and LC–MS/MS  ap. 935-945.  aAn investigation on the proteome of the sweet kernel of apricot, based on equalisation with combinatorial peptide ligand libraries (CPLLs), SDS-PAGE, nLC-ESI-MS/MS, and database search, permitted identifying 175 proteins. Gene ontology analysis indicated that their main molecular functions are in nucleotide binding (20.9%), hydrolase activities (10.6%), kinase activities (7%), and catalytic activity (5.6%). A protein-protein association network analysis using STRING software permitted to build an interactomic map of all detected proteins, characterised by 34 interactions. In order to forecast the potential health benefits deriving from the consumption of these proteins, the two most abundant, i.e. Prunin 1 and 2, were enzymatically digested in silico predicting 10 and 14 peptides, respectively. Searching their sequences in the database BIOPEP, it was possible to suggest a variety of bioactivities, including dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme I (ACE) inhibition, glucose uptake stimulation and antioxidant properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aantioxidant activity 3aapricots 3acatalytic activity 3acomputer software 3adipeptidyl-peptidase IV 3agene ontology 3aglucose 3aligands 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aseeds 0aCPLLs 0aEEP 0aACN 0aFA 0aPPI 0aPDMQ 0aApricot 0aCombinatorial peptide ligand libraries (CPLL) 0aGO analysis 0aLC–MS/MS 0aProteomics 0aPrunin1 aLammi, Carmen1 aArnoldi, Anna1 aKabouche, Zahia1 aAiello, Gilda0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.935-945dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.07.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245009600177520132300273592002801596650002501624650001601649650001901665650001301684650001501697650001901712650001201731650001701743650001301760650001601773650000701789650000901796650001901805650001101824653001001835653001101845653003101856700001701887700002101904700002401925700001801949773012201967856008102089852000902170655001202179IND60743590220221118025151.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074359022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1120602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifudin, Shaiful Adzni10aFermentation and characterisation of potential kombucha cultures on papaya-based substrates  aThe rising demands and increasing health-conscious population in global beverages consumptions promote the development of new variety of kombucha beverages using various plant and fruits. This study aimed to isolate, identify and characterise the microorganisms found in the kombucha starter. Isolated microorganisms showed high similarity (99%) towards an acetic acids bacterium, Komagataeibacter rhaeticus MFS1 and a yeast, Dekkera bruxellensis MFS1. Under low pH tolerance test, D. bruxellensis MFS1 was remained viable (log7 CFU/mL) but no viable cell was observed for K. rhaeticus MFS1 after 3 h exposure at pH 2. However, both strains retained viability when exposed to pH 3–4 for 3 h. When tested bile salt tolerance at different concentration (0.3–1%), D. bruxellensis MFS1 showed high tolerance with viability up to log7 CFU/mL after 4 h exposure at 1% concentration. In contrast, K. rhaeticus MFS1 only retained the viability up to 2 h under bile salt environment. The presence of 1.45–1.62% acetic acid with less than 0.5% ethanol was detected at the end of 4-days fermentation in both kombucha papaya samples. These preliminary results showed the potential of using these isolated strains as starter cultures for the production of novel functional fermented beverages from papaya pulp and leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDekkera bruxellensis 3aacetic acid 3aacid tolerance 3abacteria 3abile salts 3acell viability 3aethanol 3afermentation 3akombucha 3anew variety 3apH 3apulp 3asalt tolerance 3ayeasts 0aSCOBY 0aPapaya 0apH and bile salt tolerance1 aHo, Wan Yong1 aYeap, Swee Keong1 aAbdullah, Rosmawati1 aKoh, Soo Peng0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Nov., v. 151 p.112060-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1120603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012400166300002000290520134900310592002801659650002501687650001401712650001701726650001801743650001301761650001401774650001601788650002501804700001901829700001601848700001301864700001601877700001501893700005901908700005501967773013102022856008402153852000902237655001202246IND60747635720221121055216.0210817e20210804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074763572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c017272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Yujian10aDigestive Elimination of Coexisting Microplastics for Determination of Particulate Black Carbon in Environmental Waters  ap. 11184-11190.  aDetermination of particulate black carbon (PBC) in the environment is of great importance but faces a new challenge due to the increasing occurrence of coexisting microplastics (MPs), which are an emerging contaminant with properties very similar to those of PBC and cannot be discriminated in the chemical digestion procedure of the reported PBC analysis method. Herein, a comprehensive method has been developed for accurately determining PBC by digestive elimination of the coexisting MPs and other non-black carbon organic matter. Water samples were filtered with a glass fiber membrane (0.3 μm pore size), and the collected substances with the membrane were subjected to sulfonation with chlorosulfonic acid and Fenton digestion in sequence and then to the total organic carbon analyzer for quantification of PBC. Under the optimized conditions, MPs of various sizes and polymer types were efficiently eliminated (>91.0%), whereas various PBC samples were undigested with recoveries over 91.7% except for the relatively low recovery of 65.6% for the PBC prepared at a low pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C. The feasibility of the proposed method was verified by analysis of real water samples with a spike recovery of 88.6–100.2%. We anticipate that this work will pave an avenue for reliable determination of PBC in the presence of MPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adigestion 3aglass fibers 3amicroplastics 3aporosity 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3atotal organic carbon1 aSheng, Xueying1 aDong, Lijie1 aLi, Peng1 aLi, Qingcun1 aYu, Sujuan1 aZhou, Qingxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8801-91301 aLiu, Jingfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7134-70260 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 04, v. 93, no. 32 p.11184-11190dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c017273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007600169520148400245592002801729653002701757653002701784653001801811653002301829653001901852700001401871700001301885700001501898700002201913700002301935700001901958700005501977773011102032856008702143852000902230655001202239IND60671697020221120102144.0200106e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067169702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQayum, Abdul10aCharacterization and comparison of α-lactalbumin pre-and post-emulsion  aThe main purpose of this research was to comparatively explore the influence of ultrasound (US, 600 W for 30 min) high-pressure homogenization (HPH, 80 MPa for 4 cycle) and combined (US-HPH) treatments on oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion stabilized with α-lactalbumin (α-LA) pre- and post-emulsification. Compared with US pre-treatment, US post-treatment resulted in increase in emulsifying activity (from 103.23 to 113.38 m²/g), emulsifying stability (from 50.79 to 63.74 min) and zeta-potential (from 29.4 to 31.8 mV) of α-LA stabilized emulsion. Particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) of US-HPH α-LA post-emulsion reduced by about 8.94% and 29% than those of US-HPH α-LA pre-emulsion, respectively. US-HPH α-LA post-emulsion had no phase separation for two weeks of storage at ambient temperature upon visual appearance. The observations of the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed that a remarkable decline in particle size was observed in US-HPH α-LA post-emulsion. Flow behavior of emulsion stabilized with α-LA was detected to be shear-thinning in all treatments. There was no significant alteration in SDS-PAGE in all treatments of pre-and post-emulsification (p > 0.05). The most suitable processing method to produce a fine and stable emulsion was a combined US-HPH post-treatment, having an improving influence on physiochemical and emulsifying properties of emulsion stabilized with α-LA for potential industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEmulsifying properties 0aRheological properties 0aParticle size 0aEmulsion stability 0aα-lactalbumin1 aChen, Wei1 aMa, Ling1 aLi, Tianqi1 aHussain, Muhammad1 aBilawal, Akhunzada1 aJiang, Zhanmei1 aHou, Juncai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2943-33980 tJournal of food engineering.g2020 Mar., v. 269 p.109743-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009000166300001600256520170200272592002801974650001602002650002402018650002102042650002302063650002402086650002202110650003502132650001902167650001802186650001002204650002402214650003502238650002302273650001502296650001602311650002002327650001702347650001502364650001102379650001402390650002902404650001302433700002002446700001602466700001602482700001402498700002002512700001602532700002602548700001602574700001902590700001502609700001902624773013002643856008202773852000902855655001202864IND60592704620221119025650.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059270462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-018-0068-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Mrinmoy10aInsights into phytase-containing transgenic Lemna minor (L.) as a novel feed additive  ap. 211-224.  aThis study assessed the effect of supplementation of novel transgenic phytase on growth performance and bone mineralization in Korean native broiler chickens. The experiment was designed using four dietary groups: those with a diet supplemented with (A) recombinant phytase, (B) transgenic phytase from the plant Lemna minor, (C) or wild-type L. minor as well as (D) a control group that was supplemented with commercially available feed. Three hundred 1-day-old Korean native broiler chicks were used and divided into these four dietary treatment groups having three replicates of 25 birds each (n = 75). The results showed increases in growth performance and bone mineralization in Groups B and C; compared with Groups A and D. Hematological analyses revealed notable contrasts in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin levels among the experimental groups, whereas no impacts of dietary treatment were observed on total eosinophil, lymphocyte, heterophil, monocyte, and basophil levels. The relative expression profiling of candidate genes showed that the genes involved in growth response, meat quality, and P–Ca metabolism were significantly highly expressed in the phytase-supplemented groups. Hence, it is suggested that dietary supplementation with transgenic phytase plant L. minor for enhancing growth performance is a promising new approach in the broiler feed industry. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the most comprehensive analysis using a broiler model that provides a workable platform for further research on the cost-effective production of feed with different compositions that might be beneficial in the livestock feed industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLemna minor 3abone mineralization 3abroiler chickens 3acost effectiveness 3adietary supplements 3aerythrocyte count 3aerythrocyte sedimentation rate 3afeed additives 3afeed industry 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetically modified organisms 3agrowth performance 3ahemoglobin 3aheterophils 3alivestock feeds 3ameat quality 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amonocytes 3anutritional intervention 3aphytases1 aSharma, Neelesh1 aGera, Meeta1 aKim, Nameun1 aHuynh, Do1 aZhang, Jiaojiao1 aMin, Taesun1 aSodhi, SimrinderSingh1 aKim, MinBae1 aRekha, V.P.

Its hallmark overt pharmacological effect is wet-dog shakes (WDS) in rats. The vigorous shaking associated with icilin is dependent on NMDA receptor activation and nitric oxide production, but little else is known about the biological systems that modulate the behavioral phenomenon. The present study investigated the hypothesis that alpha₂-adrenoceptor activation inhibits icilin-induced WDS. Rats injected with icilin (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5mg/kg, i.p.) displayed dose-related WDS that were inhibited by pretreatment with a fixed dose of clonidine (0.15mg/kg, s.c.). Shaking behavior caused by a fixed dose (2.5mg/kg) of icilin was also inhibited in a dose-related manner by clonidine pretreatment (0.03–0.15mg/kg, s.c.) and reduced by clonidine posttreatment (0.15mg/kg, s.c.). Pretreatment with a peripherally restricted alpha₂-adrenoceptor agonist, ST91 (0.075, 0.15mg/kg), also decreased the incidence of shaking elicited by 2.5mg/kg of icilin. Pretreatment with yohimbine (2mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the shaking induced by a low dose of icilin (0.5mg/kg). The imidazoline site agonists, agmatine (150mg/kg, i.p.) and 2-BFI (7mg/kg, i.p.), did not affect icilin-evoked shaking. These results suggest that alpha₂-adrenoceptor activation inhibits shaking induced by icilin and that increases in peripheral, as well as central, alpha₂-adrenoceptor signaling oppose the behavioral stimulant effect of icilin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagmatine 3aagonists 3abrain 3aclonidine 3amice 3anitric oxide 3arats 3ayohimbine 2aAdrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonistsxtherapeutic use 2aAdrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aAgmatinexpharmacology 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aClonidinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHead Movementsxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMovement Disordersxetiologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aPyrimidinonesxadverse effects 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2xmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aYohimbinexpharmacology1 aCowan, Alan1 aLisek, Renata1 aRaymondi, Natalie1 aRosenthal, Aaron1 aHirsch, Daniel D.1 aRawls, Scott M.0 tBrain research.g2011 Apr. 12, v. 1384 p.110-117dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008600169300002000255520132500275592002801600650001801628650002501646650001501671650002201686650001601708650002101724650002501745650001801770650002001788650001401808650001701822650001901839650000901858650001401867650002601881700002601907700002401933700002001957700001301977700001501990700001302005700001502018700005302033773013102086856008402217852000902301655001202310IND60747635820221121055223.0210817e20210806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074763582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c017612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhangjie10aImproving the Sensitivity for Quantifying Heparan Sulfate from Biological Samples  ap. 11191-11199.  aHeparan sulfates (HSs) are widely expressed glycans in the animal kingdom. HS plays a role in regulating cell differentiation/proliferation, embryonic development, blood coagulation, inflammatory response, and viral infection. The amount of HS and its structural information are critically important for investigating the functions of HS in vivo. A sensitive and reliable quantitative technique for the analysis of HS from biological samples is under development. Here, we report a new labeling reagent for HS disaccharides analysis, 6-amino-N-(2-diethylamino)ethyl quinoline-2-carboamide (AMQC). The AMQC-conjugated disaccharides are analyzed by LC-MS/MS in positive mode, significantly improving the sensitivity. The use of AMQC coupled with authentic ¹³C-labeled HS disaccharide internal standards empowered us to determine the amount and the disaccharide composition of the HS on a single histological slide. We used this method to profile the levels of HS in the plasma/serum and tissues/organs to assist the disease prognosis in two animal models, including the acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury mouse model and the burn injury mouse model. The method may uncover the roles of HS contributing to the diseases as well as provide a potential new set of biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomarkers 3ablood coagulation 3ablood serum 3aburns (injuries) 3acell differentiation 3aembryogenesis 3aheparan sulfate 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3aliver diseases 3amice 3aprognosis 3aquantitative analysis1 aDhurandhare, Vijay M.1 aMahung, Cressida A.1 aArnold, Katelyn1 aLi, Jine1 aSu, Guowei1 aXu, Ding1 aMaile, Rob1 aLiu, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8552-14000 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 06, v. 93, no. 32 p.11191-11199dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c017613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013500165300001600300520139700316592002801713650001601741650001201757650002001769650001601789650001301805650002301818650001001841650001401851650001501865650001401880653001201894653002001906653001201926653001101938653001201949700001401961773012001975856008602095852000902181655001202190IND60762125720221119193421.0220108e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076212572DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2021.19343992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopal, E.10aEffects of fully or partially slatted flooring designs on the performance, welfare and carcass characteristics of broiler chickens  ap. 804-809.  a1. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of fully (FSF) or partially (PSF) flooring designs on animal-based welfare indicators in a fast-growing broiler genotype. Growth performance and carcass characteristics were assessed. 2. One-d-old male chicks were randomly assigned to three groups: fully slatted flooring (100% slatted floor), partially slatted flooring (50% litter floor and 50% slatted floor) and conventional floor pens with litter (control, 100% deep litter) with 5 replicates of 14 male chicks. The litter was rice hull, as is usual in practice. 3. Measurements of live body weight, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, mortality and performance index were collected before depopulation at 42 d old. Welfare assessments were done by individual ante- and post-mortem carcass inspection during depopulation and after slaughter. 4. Broiler live body weight (P < 0.03) and feed intake (P < 0.003) and ante-mortem welfare indicators (P < 0.001) were positively affected by FSF and PSF compared to the conventional deep litter system. Post-mortem lesion scores on wings and shoulder were similar in all floor types but there were significant differences for the lesions on breast (P < 0.003) and pygostyle (P < 0.05). 5. In conclusion, FSF and PSF resulted in higher body weights, while reducing incidence of foot pad and hock joint deformations in live animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3abreasts 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agenotype 3agrowth performance 3amales 3amortality 3arice hulls 3aslaughter 0aBroiler 0aflooring design 0awelfare 0agrowth 0acarcass1 aPetek, M.0 tBritish poultry science.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 62, no. 6 p.804-809dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45506x1466-17997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2021.19343993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024004000134024001200174040001800186100001600204245008300220300001800303506017300321520093600494592002801430650001901458650001501477650001201492650001401504650001801518650001701536650001501553650001301568650001501581650001301596653002001609653000901629653001201638653001301650653004301663700001501706700002101721700001301742700002101755700001501776773011601791856008701907856011401994956009602108961000902204852000902213655001202222IND60573424420221214224058.0190402e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057342442DNAL7 a3387112aris7 a10113/57342442hdl7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.07.0562doi8 ans13501  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Shuang10aReduction of biogenic amines in sufu by ethanol addition during ripening stage  ap. 1244-1252.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the content of biogenic amines (BAs) in different types of sufu samples obtained from different producers, and the effect of ethanol in reducing BA levels during sufu ripening. The results showed that different manufacturing processes altered the distribution of BAs in commercial sufu. Putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, and tryptamine were the main and common BAs in red, white and grey sufu. The contents of putrescine, cadaverine, tryptamine, β-phenylethylamine and tyramine in the grey sufu of all producer brands were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those in the white and red sufu. The addition of ethanol to the dressing mixture had a significant influence in reducing the total content of BAs in laboratory-made sufu. The slight increase in polypeptide and amino nitrogen contents after the addition of ethanol indicated a reduction in the degradation of water soluble protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino nitrogen 3acadaverine 3aethanol 3ahistamine 3amanufacturing 3apolypeptides 3aputrescine 3aripening 3atryptamine 3atyramine 0aBiogenic amines 0aSufu 0aEthanol 0aRipening 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography1 aWang, Ying1 aCheng, Yongqiang1 aLiu, Yan1 aYadav, Madhav P.1 aYin, Lijun0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.1244-1252dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.07.0563Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/57342443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/YADAV%20REPRINT_1.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014700157300002000304520133700324592002801661650001601689650001501705650001601720650001001736650001201746650001101758650001701769650001801786650001601804650002001820700001801840700002201858700001901880700002001899700002101919773013601940856007502076852000902151655001202160IND60537728820180405000000.0160809e20140625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053772882DNAL7 a10.1021/ie500994m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzimi, Golnar10aMn–Fe Oxides with Support of MgAl2O4, CeO2, ZrO2 and Y2O3–ZrO2 for Chemical-Looping Combustion and Chemical-Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling  ap. 10358-10365.  aThe feasibility of utilizing a combined oxide (Mn₀.₇₅Fe₀.₂₅)₂O₃ as an oxygen carrier for chemical-looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) has been investigated. To increase the strength and attrition resistance of such particles, the oxygen carrier was prepared together with MgAl₂O₄, CeO₂, ZrO₂ and Y₂O₃–ZrO₂ as supports. The oxygen-carrier particles were prepared using spray-drying. Each material was calcined for 4 h at 950, 1100 or 1200 °C. The materials were studied in a batch fluidized bed reactor to investigate their oxygen release and uptake potential and also their reactivity with CH₄ and syngas. To gauge the mechanical stability of the different materials, the attrition resistance was measured in a jet-cup apparatus. With the exception of the material with MgAl₂O₄, the oxygen uncoupling property of the active combined oxides was largely kept intact using the added support materials. On the basis of the results from the reactivity tests and the measured attrition rates for all the particles, the material utilizing ZrO₂ support seems to be the most promising candidate as an oxygen carrier for gaseous and solid fuels. However, due to phase transformations of the ZrO₂ at higher temperatures, the calcination and operational temperature should likely not exceed 950 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceric oxide 3acombustion 3aengineering 3afuels 3amethane 3aoxygen 3aspray drying 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3azirconium oxide1 aLeion, Henrik1 aMattisson, Tobias1 aRydén, Magnus1 aSnijkers, Frans1 aLyngfelt, Anders0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 June 25, v. 53, no. 25 p.10358-10365dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie500994m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008900169300001800258520147200276592002801748650001501776650002601791650001401817650001001831650001501841650001901856650001401875700002001889773009701909856008602006852000902092655001202101IND60089003620221119180628.0141102e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008900362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chang-fu10aComparisons of radial plume mapping algorithms for locating gaseous emission sources  ap. 1476-1482.  aThis paper presents the simulation and field evaluation results for two mathematical algorithms applied in the horizontal radial plume mapping (HRPM) technique with optical remote sensing instruments. In the simulation study, 450 test maps with skewed distributions (i.e., bivariate lognormal distribution) were generated in a two-dimensional domain. The HRPM techniques with the smooth basis function minimization (SBFM) algorithm and non-negative least square (NNLS) algorithm were then applied to reconstruct the plumes, assuming a nine-beam scanning beam geometry. The SBFM algorithm was able to identify the peak locations better than the NNLS algorithm when the plumes were near the origin. On the other hand, the NNLS performed better when the plumes were away from the origin. In the field validation study, four experiments were conducted in an open space with the same nine-beam geometry. In each experiment, two tracer gases were released simultaneously at two different locations, and an OP-FTIR was set up to collect the IR spectra. The collected path-integrated concentration data were then used to reconstruct the source locations. The results confirm the conclusions obtained in the simulation study of a better performance from the SBFM algorithm than from the NNLS algorithm for plumes near the origin. We also developed a screening criterion to determine which algorithm results should be chosen as the final estimates in future field applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aequipment 3agases 3aopen space 3aremote sensing 3ascreening1 aZhang, Shiying,0 tAtmospheric environment.g2011 Mar., v. 45, no. 7 p.1476-1482dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04537naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245011100159300001200270520259100282592002802873596005902901596007502960596005503035650003503090650002103125650001303146650001903159650001603178650001403194650001103208650001503219650001903234650001403253650001803267650001903285650001803304650001903322650001603341650001403357650001603371650001403387650001503401650002803416650001403444650001703458650001603475700001903491700001903510700001503529700001403544700001303558700001203571700002003583700001903603700001203622700001703634700001903651773011303670856008303783852000903866655001203875IND60709298920221120233510.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070929892DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04331-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lu10aROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation participates in the response against Neospora caninum infection  ap. 449.  aBACKGROUND: Neospora caninum is an obligate intracellular protozoan that causes neosporosis, N. caninum infection is a major cause of abortion in cattle worldwide. Currently, specific treatment for neosporosis is not available. The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a cytoplasmic protein complex that plays an important role in host defense against N. caninum infection, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. METHODS: The reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor and the ROS inducer, wild-type (WT) and NLRP3-deficient peritoneal macrophages or mice were used to investigate the role of ROS in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and controlling parasite burdens. ROS production, cell death and cell viability, production of inflammasome-mediated IL-1β or IL-18, cleavage of caspase-1 and NLRP3 expression, as well as parasite burdens were detected. RESULTS: In vitro, N. caninum induced ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner in peritoneal macrophages. The pretreatment of ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated N. caninum-induced ROS production, LDH release, IL-1β secretion and NLRP3 expression, whereas N. caninum proliferation was notably increased. In contrary, the ROS inducer pyrogallol (PG) significantly enhanced ROS production and NLRP3 inflammasome activity and decreased the parasite burden in N. caninum-infected peritoneal macrophages. NADPH-dependent ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by N. caninum can also be confirmed by using the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). However, the NAC or DPI pre-treatment or PG treatment did not significantly alter N. caninum-induced inflammasome activities and parasite proliferation in Nlrp3⁻/⁻ peritoneal macrophages. In vivo, IL-18 releases in serum and parasite burdens in peritoneal exudate cells were significantly increased in PG-treated WT mice after infection with N. caninum; however, IL-18 productions and parasite burdens were not changed in PG-treated Nlrp3⁻/⁻ mice. Furthermore, PG treatment in WT mice infected with N. caninum significantly decreased the mortality, weight loss and parasite burdens in tissues and histopathological lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Neospora caninum-induced NADPH-dependent ROS generation plays an important role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and controlling parasites. The ROS inducer PG can control N. caninum infection mainly by promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome axis can be a potential therapeutic target for neosporosis.  aPublisher supplied data  a31902296cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2015 CB 150300cNational Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)  a2019M661217cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNeospora caninum 3aProtozoa 3aacetylcysteine 3ablood serum 3acaspase-1 3acattle 3acell death 3acell viability 3achlorides 3adose response 3ahistopathology 3ainflammasomes 3ainterleukin-18 3amacrophages 3amortality 3aneosporosis 3aparasites 3apyrogallol 3areactive oxygen species 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3aweight loss1 aWang, Xiao-Cen1 aGong, Peng-Tao1 aZhang, Nan1 aZhang, Xu1 aLi, Shan1 aLi, Xin1 aLiu, Shao-Xiong1 aZhang, Xiao-Xu1 aLi, Wei1 aLi, Jian-Hua1 aZhang, Xi-Chen0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.449-449dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04331-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014900155300002000304520178300324592002802107650004402135650002202179650003002201650002802231650003102259650001302290650001302303650001302316650001402329700001602343700002002359700001902379700001602398700001702414700001602431700001802447700001502465773012402480856007402604852000902678655001202687IND60640727420221120112754.0190504e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064072742DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra13266a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDulski, M.10aExperimental (FTIR, BDS) and theoretical analysis of mutarotation kinetics of d-fructose mixed with different alcohols in the supercooled region  ap. 57634-57646.  aThe mutarotation kinetics of pure molten d-fructose and its binary mixture with alcohols (i.e., sorbitol and maltitol) have been reported using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The time evolution of the integrated intensity and structural relaxation time acts as a suitable dynamical observable to monitor the progress of the reaction in FTIR and BDS, respectively, leading to the construction of kinetic curves for the process. The bands at 776 cm⁻¹ (νᵦ) and 990 cm⁻¹ (να) indicate the respective vibrations originating from the β and α-isomers of d-fructose. The rate constants estimated from FTIR, (kIR) are shorter than those obtained from BDS, (kBDS) studies and the activation energies determined from both spectroscopies differ by more than 30 kJ mol⁻¹. This is interpreted in the context of specific reaction pathways that contribute to the rate constants and drive mutarotation. Additionally, it is found that the rate of mutarotation depends on the system studied i.e., in binary mixtures consisting of sorbitol and d-fructose it becomes faster, while in solid dispersion with maltitol it gets slower. This fact can be explained by taking into account the viscosity of the system. In addition, natural bond orbital (NBO) calculations and an electrostatic potential surface (EPS) analysis were carried out to gain insight into the atomic charge distribution and description of the possible interactions between d-fructose and alcohol molecules. We note that there are some differences between both systems under examination in the strength of H-bonds. However, the impact of these interactions on the progress on mutarotation is not as significant as viscosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3adensity functional theory 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afructose 3amaltitol 3asorbitol 3aviscosity1 aCecotka, A.1 aTripathy, S.

All the characters showed significant differences across the varieties and planting techniques. S-19 showed highest seed productivity (487.50 kg/ha) under line sowing and clipped planting technique. The most promising planting technique to get maximum seed yield was the line sowing and clipped followed by line sowing and non-clipped, seedling transplanting and clipped, whereas least promising one was top cutting and transplantation in puddle soil. The experiment suggested the possibility of seed production in humid sub-tropics of Terai zone if suitable planting technique is followed in marginal upland situation with optimum management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorchorus 3aagricultural sciences 3afield experimentation 3ahighlands 3ajute 3aseed productivity 3aseed yield 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asubtropics 3aIndia 0aJute seed production 0aPlanting technique0 tAgricultural science digest.g2013 June, v. 33, no. 2 p.154-157dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2003x0976-05477nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008000165520109100245592002801336650002801364650001101392650001401403650002601417650002201443650002201465650001001487650002001497653002601517653001901543653002701562653001801589653001501607653001701622700001401639700001601653700005701669773010701726856008601833852000901919655001201928IND60684438020221122160612.0200305e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068443802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hao10aAlginate fiber toughened gels similar to skin intelligence as ionic sensors  aThe stretchable hydrogels provide potential alternatives to bionic skins. However, skin simulation remains seriously challenging due to its complex nature, including mechanical property, protective effect, and sensory capability. Herein, conductive gels toughened by sodium alginate fibers in oil-water system were developed for preparation of skin-like ionic sensors. The dynamic network was constructed by polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate fibers, providing a wide scope of mechanical properties, such as high toughness, anti-fatigue fracture and remodelability. Moreover, salts imparted good conductivity to gels. As a result, gels exhibited sensory capability toward stress and strain, so they were considered sensors to monitor various movements of human body. In particular, gels demonstrated temperture tolerance ranging from −20 °C to 40 °C and non-drying for 6 days at 25 °C. In this study, gels showed complex intelligence similar to natural skin, and might find applications in artificial intelligence, human-mechanial interactions, and smart wearable devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3amechanical properties 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aprotective effect 3asalts 3asodium alginate 0aSodium alginate fiber 0aSkin-like gels 0aMechanical performance 0aAnti-freezing 0aNon-drying 0aIonic sensor1 aGao, Yang1 aRen, Xiuyan1 aGao, Guanghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2947-23110 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 May 01, v. 235 p.116018-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013700169300001600306520183300322592002802155650001302183650002402196650002302220650001102243650002502254650001902279650001002298650001902308650001302327650001402340650001702354650001502371650001902386650001302405653001902418653002002437653002302457653002702480653001702507700001602524700001602540700001802556700001602574700005702590773011902647856008802766852000902854655001202863IND60650951020221122074128.0200509e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065095102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xiaofei10aComparative analyses of wetland plant biomass accumulation and litter decomposition subject to in situ warming and nitrogen addition  ap. 769-778.  aThe effects of climate warming on boreal wetland plant structure and carbon (C) sequestration on local scale may be overestimated. An in situ passive warming experiment manipulated by open-top chambers and artificial nitrogen (N) addition was deployed in a lacustrine wetland of Xingkai Lake for 3 consecutive years. The annual changes and allocations of the aboveground biomass of Glyceria spiculosa, and decomposition dynamics of the total litter and cotton strips as standard references were observed. Results showed that the aboveground biomass was significantly affected by warming and increased from 99.43 ± 10.59 g m⁻² (ambient) to 112.02 ± 8.08 g m⁻² (ca. +1 °C) and 117.21 ± 9.92 g m⁻² (ca. +2 °C). N addition had a more positive effect on the annual aboveground biomass accumulations than warming, for the relative importance weights of N addition were 2.60 and 1.49 times greater than warming in 2011 and 2013 respectively. Their main effects on the allocations had significant interannual variations, and their interaction effects were dependent on organ and year. The decomposition constant (k-value) of the litter and cotton strips were 0.747 yr⁻¹ and 2.057 yr⁻¹, respectively. Compared to warming and N addition, the internal quality characterized by Lignocellulose index and soil organisms reflected by litterbag size played overwhelming role in decomposition dynamics, with 2 orders greater of relative importance weights in 2011 and 2012. Our results highlight the importance of interannual variation for differentiating the contributions of external and internal factors to boreal wetland plant biomass accumulation and decomposition. Given the asymmetric responses of accumulation and decomposition, the C storage in the litter would increase in long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlyceria 3aaboveground biomass 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aglobal warming 3alakes 3alignocellulose 3anitrogen 3aphytomass 3aplant litter 3asoil biota 3awetland plants 3awetlands 0aGlobal warming 0aPlant responses 0aGlyceria spiculosa 0aWetland carbon balance 0aXingkai Lake1 aGuo, Jiawei1 aLu, Xianguo1 aWang, Guoping1 aJiang, Ming1 aZou, Yuanchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1520-96780 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 691 p.769-778dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012800205300001100333520150600344592002801850596006801878650003101946650001101977650001901988650001002007650002602017650002302043650001902066650001102085650001702096650001602113650003402129650001702163650001402180650002502194700001802219700001902237700002002256773011902276856008302395852000902478655001202487IND60709299420221120233530.0220619e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070929942DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-020-00533-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Hu-Zhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7425-656810aAnti-inflammatory effect of unripe apple polyphenols-chitooligosaccharides microcapsule against LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells  ap. 51.  aIn order to improve the synergistic effect of unripe apple polyphenols (APP) and chitooligosaccharides (COS), apple polyphenols-chitooligosaccharides microcapsule (APCM) were prepared by spray-drying method. The effects of APCM on the release of polyphenols in simulated gastrointestinal digestion model, as well as the anti-inflammatory effect against LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells were also evaluated. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and HPLC analysis of APP and APCM showed that during the spray-drying process, most of the polyphenols are successfully encapsulated in COS. The simulated gastrointestinal digestion model results showed that about 98% of polyphenols released from APCM within 60 min. Anti-inflammatory effect of APCM on LPS induced RAW 264.7 cells showed that although APP showed a strong inhibitory effect on cell viability at 0.6 mg/mL, the effect of APCM on cell viability was less and could maintain a high level at the same concentration. In addition, APCM significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α production via the elevation of cytokine IL-10 as the concentration increases, respectively. The results suggest that APCM alleviate the intensity of inflammatory processes by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, as well as additionally by promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10. These findings provide scientific and theoretical support for the claim that traditional medicine treats inflammation-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  aSu Teach 2019III)cQinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aapples 3acell viability 3acells 3achitooligosaccharides 3ain vitro digestion 3ainterleukin-10 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3apolyphenols 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aspray drying 3asynergism 3atraditional medicine1 aCui, Chun-Lan1 aJeong, Woo-Sik1 aChung, Shin-Kyo0 tApplied biological chemistry.g2020 Dec., v. 63, no. 1 p.51-51dSpringer SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-020-00533-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007300168300001800241520121200259592002801471650001201499650001201511650001601523650001501539650002501554650001701579650001101596650001701607650002501624650002601649650001101675650001201686650001301698650002501711650002201736650002101758653001701779653001201796653002601808653002301834653002101857700001801878700002001896773013001916856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60577180820221120121703.0170807e20170807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057718082DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b012472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Hai-Bo10aThermally Insulating and Flame-Retardant Polyaniline/Pectin Aerogels  ap. 7012-7019.  aBiomass-based thermally insulating and flame-retardant polymer aerogels were fabricated from renewable pectin (PC) and aniline via polymerization–coagulation and a supercritical drying process. A special physical cross-linking action existed between PC and polyaniline (PA). The resultant aerogels showed three-dimensional networks with hierarchical pores and high surface areas (103–205 m² g–¹). With benefits from the cross-linking structure, the pectin-based aerogels exhibited good compressive strengths (4.7–9.2 MPa) and water resistance. The results from thermal conductivity measurements and thermogravimetric analysis revealed that these aerogels also had low thermal conductivity (0.033–0.038 W m–¹ K–¹) and considerable thermal stability. The limiting oxygen index, vertical burning tests, microscale combustion, and cone calorimetry tests further confirmed that the inherently low flammability of the aerogels could be achieved by the flame retardancy of PA and the cross-linking action between PA and PC. These aerogels with good mechanical properties, water resistance, and low thermal conductivity and flammability show promising prospects in the field of thermal insulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3aburning 3acalorimetry 3acombustion 3acompression strength 3acrosslinking 3adrying 3aflammability 3ainsulating materials 3amechanical properties 3aoxygen 3apectins 3apolymers 3athermal conductivity 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aBiomaterials 0aAerogel 0aMechanical properties 0aThermal insulation 0aFlame retardancy1 aChen, Mingjun1 aChen, Hong-Bing0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Aug. 07, v. 5, no. 8 p.7012-7019dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b012473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01544naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245008000127300001600207500001900223520063700242592002800879650002600907650002600933650002600959650001100985650002600996651001001022653001101032653001301043653002201056773014301078852000901221655001201230IND60709792220221122215420.0200908e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070979222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusila, T.10aPerformance of tuberose cultivars under north coastal Andhra Pradesh, India  ap. 161-162.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA field experiment was conducted at Regional Agricultural Research Station, Anakapalli of Acharya N.G.

Yet data on sperm whales are scarce from rich and unique biodiverse areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. This work aimed to assess levels of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) in blubber of sperm whales stranded along the Italian coast between 2008 and 2016. POP mean concentrations (dl-PCBs: 6410 ng/g l.w.; PBDEs: 612 ng/g l.w.; PCDD/Fs: 57.8 pg/g l.w.) were mostly in line with what has been previously reported on the same species in the Mediterranean environment and tended to be higher than those reported from other geographical regions. The relative abundance followed the order dl-PCBs > PBDEs ≫ PCDD/Fs. Interestingly, the non-ortho dl-PCB pattern (126 > 169 > 77) was similar to that described in other studies worldwide and different from what is described in its main prey. This could be linked to particular metabolic activities in sperm whales against these highly toxic contaminants. Total TEQs ranged from 275 to 987 pg/g l.w. and showed the pattern Σnon-ortho-dl-PCBs > Σortho-dl-PCBs > PCDDs > PCDFs, with PCBs' contribution about 96%. These findings highlight the high abundance of PCBs still found in the Mediterranean environment despite having been banned for decades. All sperm whales analyzed in this study surpassed the threshold of 210 pg WHO-TEQ/g l.w. proposed as starting point of immunosuppression in harbour seals; a level of contamination that may have contributed to an impairment of their immune system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aPhoca vitulina 3aPhyseter macrocephalus 3abiochemical pathways 3ablubber 3acoasts 3afurans 3aimmune system 3aimmunosuppression 3amarine mammals 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3atoxicity 3aMediterranean Sea 0aPOPs 0aPollution 0aTEQ 0aCetaceans 0aPhyseter macrocephalus 0aDioxin-like1 aMuñoz-Arnanz, J.1 aMarsili, L.1 aMazzariol, S.1 aFossi, M.C.1 aJimenez, B.,0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Feb. 25, v. 653 p.1417-1425dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.4363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009400175520101700269592002801286650002301314650003101337650002201368650001901390650002301409650002401432650002501456650001301481650003701494650001201531653000901543653000801552653000901560653001401569653001001583653000901593653000901602653000901611653001001620653000901630653001001639653002301649653001601672653001301688653002501701653002101726653003101747700001801778700001801796700005801814700001701872700001701889773010701906856008602013852000902099655001202108IND60684438120221122161810.0220118e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068443812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNachtigall, Carsten10aProduction and molecular structure of heteropolysaccharides from two lactic acid bacteria  aIn the dairy industry, exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced in situ from lactic acid bacteria are of great interest because of their contribution to product texture. Some EPS cause ropiness which might be linked to specific physical and chemical EPS properties. EPS show a broad variety of chemical structures and, because analysis is rather complex, it is still a major challenge to establish structure-function relationships. The aim of this study was to produce EPS with different degree of ropiness, perform in-depth structural elucidations and relate this information to their behaviour in aqueous solutions. After cultivation of Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7919 and Lactococcus lactis LL-2A and subsequent EPS isolation, both EPS showed similar macromolecular properties, but pronounced differences in monosaccharide composition and glycosidic linkages. Our data suggests that mainly the side chains in the EPS from LL-2A might be responsible for a higher ropiness than that observed for EPS from DGCC7919.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aaqueous solutions 3adairy industry 3aexopolysaccharides 3aglycosidic linkages 3alactic acid bacteria 3aropiness 3astructure-activity relationships 3atexture 0acEPS 0aEPS 0afEPS 0aHPAEC-PAD 0aPMAAs 0aHSQC 0aH2BC 0aCOSY 0aTOCSY 0aHMBC 0aNOESY 0aExopolysaccharides 0aCultivation 0aRopiness 0aMethylation analysis 0aNMR spectroscopy 0aCoil overlap concentration1 aSurber, Georg1 aHerbi, Frauke1 aWefers, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8598-93421 aJaros, Doris1 aRohm, Harald0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 May 15, v. 236 p.116019-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011800180300001800298520161700316592002801933650001801961650001501979650002301994650001202017650001302029650001102042650000902053650002502062650001302087650001202100650002102112650001102133650001002144650001802154650001402172650000902186650001202195650001802207653001702225653001502242653001802257653001402275653001102289653002102300653002002321700002302341700003002364773013002394856008502524852000902609655001202618IND60577180920221120131800.0170807e20170807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057718092DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b012542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalasubramanian, Pandian10aDetritus to Functional Auxiliary: Twin Properties Polymer from Woody Biomass for Leather Post-Tanning Application  ap. 7020-7029.  aEconomic feasibility and dual functionalities are contemplated as the most substantial parameters for polymers applicable in leather industries. In this work, we have identified an easy step to utilize black liquor (paper and pulp industrial waste) as a dual functional auxiliary in the post-tanning stage of leather processing. By a simple acidification method, soluble lignin (liquid lignin) was separated, and the percentage of acid input was optimized. A detailed characterization of liquid lignin products emphasized their improved functionality, better organic content, and appropriate particle size and surface potential. The presence of more hydroxyl groups with larger aromatic rings in liquid lignin results in improved leather quality with high surface smoothness and filling. In order to determine the dyeing property influenced by liquid lignin, three types of dyes were used as a dyeing agent. Along with the retanning ability, lignin was able to influence the dyeing greatly by good adsorption with minimal leaching. The liquid lignin at post-tanning process discussed herein was compared with commercial products; the leather re-tanned with liquid lignin showed greater performance with respect to environmental pollution, good dyeing characteristic, and good retanning property. Dual functionalities like retanning (fullness) along with improved dyeing characteristics divulge this liquid lignin as a twin properties polymer. Finally, liquid lignin with high organic content acts as a better twin properties polymer: detritus converted to functional auxiliary for sustainable leather processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aadsorption 3aaromatic compounds 3abiomass 3adetritus 3adyeing 3adyes 3aeconomic feasibility 3aleaching 3aleather 3aleather industry 3alignin 3apaper 3aparticle size 3apollution 3apulp 3apulping 3awaste liquors 0aBlack liquor 0aPulp waste 0aLiquid lignin 0aRetanning 0aDyeing 0aGrain smoothness 0aDual functional1 aRamalingam, Sathya1 aRao, Jonnalagadda Raghava0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Aug. 07, v. 5, no. 8 p.7020-7029dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b012543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245013200158300001600290520146700306592002801773650002801801650001101829650001601840650002401856650001801880650001501898650001101913650000701924700001301931700001401944700001701958700001601975700001901991700001602010773009802026856007802124852000902202655001202211IND60481557120221120121613.0160205e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048155712DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015010812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bin10aEvaluation and optimization of the metal‐binding properties of a complex ligand for immobilized metal affinity chromatography  ap. 518-524.  aThe simultaneous determination of two binding parameters for metal ions on an immobilized metal affinity chromatography column was performed by frontal chromatography. In this study, the binding parameters of Cu²⁺ to l‐glutamic acid were measured, the metal ion‐binding characteristics of the complex ligand were evaluated. The linear correlation coefficients were all greater than 99%, and the relative standard deviations of two binding parameters were 0.58 and 0.059%, respectively. The experiments proved that the frontal chromatography method was accurate, reproducible, and could be used to determine the metal‐binding parameters of the affinity column. The effects of buffer pH, type, and concentration on binding parameters were explored by uniform design experiment. Regression, matching and residual analyses of the models were performed. Meanwhile, the optimum‐binding conditions of Cu²⁺ on the l‐glutamic acid‐silica column were obtained. Under these binding conditions, observations and regression values of two parameters were similar, and the observation values were the best. The results demonstrated that high intensity metal affinity column could be effectively prepared by measuring and evaluating binding parameters using frontal chromatography combined with a uniform design experiment. The present work provided a new mode for evaluating and preparing immobilized metal affinity column with good metal‐binding behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffinity chromatography 3acopper 3acorrelation 3aexperimental design 3aglutamic acid 3ametal ions 3amodels 3apH1 aLi, Rong1 aLi, Shiyu1 aChen, Xiaoli1 aYang, Kaidi1 aChen, Guoliang1 aMa, Xiaoxun0 tJournal of separation science.g2016 Feb., v. 39, no. 3 p.518-524dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015010813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245006500161506002800226520101500254592002801269506003701297653002301334653001301357653002401370653003901394653003001433773012801463856007901591852000901670655001201679IND60784989920221207090608.0190430s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078498992DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.21714072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulakh, P.E.10aHistorical regularities of development of plant introduction  aResource is Open Access  aIn the historical aspect, the main stages and patterns of the development of plant introductions are considered.

Considering the introduction of plants from these positions, it can be argued that this science is cur rently experiencing another paradigm shift. The binary direction in natural science and in the introduction of plants in particular, is regarded as a brake in its development. This is opposed to the systemic approach and the trinitarian methodology as an alternative to the binary one. Trinitarian worldview is not opposed to the binary, but develops and supplements it, restoring ideas about the integrity that was lost in the analytic era. Based on this methodology, we formulated the information-energy theoryof plant introduction and its importance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aplant introduction 0aparadigm 0aintroductory stages 0abinary and trinitarian methodology 0ainformation-energy theory0 tÌntrodukcìâ roslin.g2018, v. 77dNAS of Ukraine, M.M.

Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is expressed in CD8 T cells by the combination of these two signals. More importantly, depletion of IRF8 in these cells abrogated the differentiation of naive CD8 T cells into effector cells in an experimental graft-vs.-host disease mouse model. We also show that IRF8 seems to not operate upstream of other critical factors such as T-bet and eomesodermin, which have been implicated in effector maturation. Collectively, our work shows that IRF8 integrates the TCR/costimulation and γc-cytokine–signaling pathways and mediates the transition of naive CD8 T cells to effector cells, thus identifying IRF8 as one of the molecular regulators of CD8 T-cell differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3acytotoxicity 3ainterferon regulatory factor-8 0acommon γc-cytokine 0aT-cell receptor signaling 0aCD8 effector differentiation 0atranscription factors 0aJak31 aZhang, Hong1 aTerunuma, Atshushi1 aOzato, Keiko1 aTagaya, Yutaka1 aKatz, Stephen I.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 July 24, v. 109, no. 30 p.12123-12128dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12014531093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245010700175500001900282520078200301592002801083650001101111650001501122650001401137650000901151650002201160650001401182650002301196650001301219653001801232653001801250653002501268653001401293653001701307653002401324700002301348700002201371700002501393773009701418856009001515852000901605655001201614IND60709299720221120233522.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070929972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.1056872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrado, Aline M.10aFirst description of the immature stages of Fannia sabroskyi Seago, 1954 (Insecta, Diptera, Fanniidae)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEgg, larvae and the puparium of Fannia sabroskyi Seago, 1954 (Diptera, Fanniidae) are described and illustrated for the first time.

The result of installation of the submerged vane technology demonstrated its effectiveness in sediment management and motivated its further use as a solution to problems of erosion, scour and meander evolution, which are common occurrence in the rivers of the country. Since this 1991 installation, more than 18 projects have been completed and the technical effectiveness of the system has been improved. Compared to traditional solutions, the results demonstrate beneficial economic impacts due to shorter execution times, reduction in annual maintenance costs, and diminished environmental impacts. Characteristics of design and construction and results obtained from five projects are described that are representative of the diversity of conditions and difficulties for the application of this technology in Colombia. Lessons learned for adaptation by river management authorities are derived from the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3adesign 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironmental impact 3aevolution 3aoccurrence 3arivers 3asediments 3asolutions 3atechnology 3awater 3aColombia1 aDurán-Ariza, Argelino 1 aDuarte-Méndez, Santiago 0 tWater.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120409843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100000700142245011600149300001400265520150500279592002801784650001401812650002501826650002201851650001701873650001501890650002401905650001501929650002301944650002101967650001401988650001702002650001602019651001802035651001302053651001302066651001802079700000702097700000702104700000702111773011402118856007802232961001202310852000902322655001202331IND60515323220221123014753.0160313e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051532322DNAL7 a10.1656/045.023.01032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aSoil Macroinvertebrate Communities Across a Productivity Gradient in Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America  ap. 25-44.  aWithin the temperate, deciduous forests of the eastern US, diverse soil-fauna communities are structured by a combination of environmental gradients and interactions with other biota. The introduction of non-native soil taxa has altered communities and soil processes, and adds another degree of variability to these systems. We sampled soil macroinvertebrate abundance from forested sites in Missouri (MO), Michigan (MI), Massachusetts (MA), and New Hampshire (NH), with the objective of comparing community assemblages and evaluating the role of invasive earthworms along the temperature—productivity gradient represented by the sites. The primary detritivores encountered were earthworms and millipedes. Earthworms were collected only in MO and MI, and at much greater density in MO. Millipedes were found at every site except in MO, and at their highest mean density in NH. Warmer temperatures, higher litter productivity, and low Oa horizon depth (as found in MO) were correlated with high earthworm activity. Oa horizon depth was the greatest in NH, where the macroinvertebrate community was dominated (in terms of abundance) by predators and herbivores, not detritivores. Our results are suggestive of, and congruent with, the concept of earthworms as ecosystem engineers, as we found that the presence of non-native earthworm species was associated with significant differences in soil characteristics such as apparent rapid decomposition rates and reduced carbon storage in the Oa horizon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplopoda 3acarbon sequestration 3adeciduous forests 3adetritivores 3aearthworms 3aecosystem engineers 3aherbivores 3amacroinvertebrates 3aorganic horizons 3apredators 3asoil ecology 3atemperature 3aMassachusetts 3aMichigan 3aMissouri 3aNew Hampshire1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2016 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.25-44dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1092-61947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F045.023.01033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003500146245011400181520138600295592002801681650002301709650001801732650002401750650001101774650001101785650001301796650001001809650001801819650000901837650003601846650001801882650001401900650001001914650001501924650001101939650001201950700005901962700002202021700002002043700002502063773010002088856008102188852000902269655001202278IND60648414720221122060943.0190712e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064841472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2019.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennechart-Collette, Catherine10aEvaluation of methods for elution of HEV particles in naturally contaminated sausage, figatellu and pig liver  aFoodborne transmission of HEV is a growing public health concern in industrialised countries, where the disease is mainly autochthonous, caused by zoonotic HEV of either genotype 3 or 4. Foodstuffs containing pig's liver were suspected on several occasions to be the cause of autochthonous cases of HEV infection, while the transmission was associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver. In assessing the risk related to the presence of HEV in food, detection methods were previously developed but HEV detection rates seem to vary with the type of samples and methods. As foodstuff containing pig liver can be contaminated with HEV internally, an efficient virus extraction procedure is required. The aim of this study was to evaluate six methods for their efficiency in releasing HEV viral particles from figatelli, pig liver sausages and liver samples previously tested positive for the presence of HEV. The ratio weight to volume of elution buffer (1:5) and the FastPrep®-24 homogeniser showed to significantly improve the quantity of HEV genomes released per gram of figatelli and pig liver sausages. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate several methods for elution of HEV particles from naturally contaminated pig liver products, and may be extended for quantifying other viral genomes from food of animal origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal-based foods 3abottled water 3adeveloped countries 3afruits 3agenome 3agenotype 3aliver 3aliver sausage 3ameat 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3apublic health 3ashellfish 3aswine 3avegetables 3avirion 3aviruses1 aFraisse, Audrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9567-62701 aGuillier, Laurent1 aPerelle, Sylvie1 aMartin-Latil, Sandra0 tFood microbiology.g2019 Dec., v. 84 p.103235-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2019.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01589naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009100165300002000256520058300276592002800859650001400887650002300901650001300924650001900937650002300956650003300979650001201012650001301024700001901037773012401056856007401180852000901254655001201263IND60665095520221118004903.0190912e20140721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066509552DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra04427d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeattie, Christopher10aVanadiumⱽ(salen) catalysed synthesis of oxazolidinones from epoxides and isocyanates  ap. 31345-31352.  aThe combination of a vanadiumⱽ(salen) complex V⁺O(salen) EtOSO₃⁻ and tetrabutylammonium bromide forms a highly active catalyst system for the reaction between epoxides and isocyanates leading to oxazolidinones.

These processes explain “anomalous” CO₂ fluxes measured over this and other ecosystems. Emission of CO₂ by ventilation of cavities requires an open double membrane system (host rock and soil) through which air movement can take place (H₂Oᵥₐₚₒᵤᵣ, CO₂, ²²²Rn, etc.). An experimental study on the behavior of the soil and host rock porous system under changing air humidity conditions, coupled with a broad analytical approach addressing CO₂ fluxes using the eddy-covariance technique and monitoring of the cave microclimate serves to define the suitable environmental conditions favoring air transfer between the cave atmosphere and exterior. This study shows the correlation between evapotranspiration, CO₂ emissions, and cave ventilation processes due to the daytime opening of the soil membrane. Thus, the role of the soil as a membrane/interface or transfer medium can be observed, and it is directly dependent on weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3acaves 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3aevapotranspiration 3agas exchange 3ahumidity 3amicroclimate 3amonitoring 3asoil pore system 3asoil water 3asummer 3atemperature 3awind1 aFernandez-Cortes, A.1 aBenavente, D.1 aSerrano-Ortiz, P.1 aKowalski, A.S.1 aSanchez-Moral, S.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2011 Mar., v. 45, no. 7 p.1418-1427dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012100165300001600286520094500302592002801247650000801275650001501283650001101298650001901309650003001328650002501358650000901383650001501392650001601407650001701423650002901440650001801469650001701487653000901504653001901513653001401532653003601546700001201582700005101594700001701645773011701662856008701779852000901866655001201875IND60642954020221118084648.0190923e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064295402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Bin10aTechno-economic analysis of oxy-fuel IGCC power plants using integrated intermittent chemical looping air separation  ap. 290-301.  aThree oxy-fuel IGCC power plants using different air separation technologies and carbon compression and compression (CCP) are developed to near-zero CO2 emission power systems.

To investigate the transport pathways of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) by wheat (Triticum acstivnm L.), the uptake of five perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs): TFA (C2), PFPrA (C3), PFBA (C4), PFHxA (C6), PFOA (C8), and a perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid: PFOS (C8)) were studied using hydroponic experiments. Various inhibitors including a metabolic inhibitor (Na₃VO₄), two anion channel blockers (9-AC, DIDS), and two aquaporin inhibitors (AgNO₃, glycerol) were examined. The wheat root and shoot showed different concentration trends with the carbon chain length of PFAAs. The uptake of TFA was inhibited by Na₃VO₄ and 9-AC whereas PFPrA was inhibited by Na₃VO₄, AgNO₃ and 9-AC. For the other four PFAAs, only Na₃VO₄ was effective. These results together with the result of concentration-dependent uptake, which followed the Michaelis-Menten model, indicate that the uptake of PFAAs by wheat is mainly an energy-dependent active process mediated by carriers. For the ultra-short chain PFCAs (C2 and C3), aquaporins and anion channels may also be involved. A competition between TFA and PFPrA was determined during the plant uptake but no competition was observed between these two shorter chain analogues with other analogues, neither between PFBA and PFHxA, PFBA and PFBS, PFOA and PFOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3auptake mechanisms 3aaquaporins 3aTriticum 3aglycerol 3awheat 3ahydroponics 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3acarbon 3aphysicochemical properties 3arisk assessment 3asulfonic acids 3aenzyme kinetics 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3arisk reduction 3aroots 3asilver nitrate 3acarboxylic acids 3ashoots 0aPerfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) 0aPlant uptake mechanism 0aActive/passive processes 0aAnion channels 0aWater channels1 aSun, Hongwen1 aWang, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3156-92461 aChen, Hao1 aYao, Yiming1 aZhao, Zhen1 aAlder, Alfredo C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 654 p.19-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.4433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012000168500001400288520153000302592002801832650002001860650001101880650001501891650001001906650001001916650001101926650002201937650001601959650000901975650001001984650004301994650001102037650001302048650001402061650001002075650002202085650001602107650001002123650001202133653003002145653001502175653001402190653001902204653003402223700002802257700005702285773010802342856008102450852000902531655001202540IND60709300220221118025713.0201202e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070930022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2020.1139332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlghanim, Hussain10aDevelopment of DNA methylation markers for sperm, saliva and blood identification using pyrosequencing and qPCR/HRM  aNAL-light  aDiscrimination of body fluids can provide important information in the investigation of crime scenes. The goal of this project was to identify new sets of tissue specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) and develop assays that can be utilized for forensic discrimination of body fluids, in particular sperm, saliva and blood. In this study, a sample set containing semen with sperm, semen without sperm, buccal swabs, saliva (oral fluids), venous blood, menstrual blood, vaginal secretions, and sweat/skin samples were used to develop four assays. Two methods for the analysis of DNA methylation biomarkers were developed in this paper: pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR/high resolution melt (HRM) analysis. Using an epigenome wide association study, two markers, NMUR2 and UBE2U, were found to be specific for sperm, based on the fact that mean DNA methylation levels for semen (containing sperm cells) were significantly lower than mean DNA methylation levels of other body fluids. In addition, one marker (SA-6) was hypermethylated in saliva when compared to other body fluids. The assays developed for NMUR2, UBE2U and SA-6 markers can be applied in forensic tissue identification using both pyrosequencing and HRM analysis. Additionally, a set of CpG sites in the AHRR locus were hypomethylated in blood when compared to other tissues using pyrosequencing. However, this locus was not amenable to HRM analysis. Overall, this work demonstrates the discovery and application of tDMRs for forensic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aassays 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3acrime 3afluids 3aforensic sciences 3ainformation 3aloci 3apaper 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asaliva 3asampling 3asecretion 3asemen 3asequence analysis 3aspermatozoa 3asweat 3atissues 0aBody fluid identification 0aEpigenetic 0aForensics 0aPyrosequencing 0aHigh resolution melt analysis1 aBalamurugan, Kuppareddi1 aMcCord, Bruce1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8366-19250 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 611 p.113933-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2020.1139333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01183naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015600159300001300315520022600328592002800554650001400582700002100596700001800617700001500635700001900650700001900669773012200688856007400810852000900884655001200893IND60640728620221120071620.0190504e20160125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064072862DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra90004f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Tariq A.10aCorrection: One step synthesis of highly functionalized thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole, triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine and triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine  ap. 9437.  aCorrection for ‘One step synthesis of highly functionalized thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole, triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine and triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine’ by Tariq A.

The spray is formed upstream of the exit plane and carried with air or nitrogen into a hot co-flowing stream of vitiated combustion products. The fluid dynamics is kept intentionally simple and the boundary conditions are well-defined such that the burner lends itself easily to computations. The stability characteristics are presented here for a range of liquid fuels as a function of the controlling parameters. For each fuel, three types of flames are identified based on their visual appearance. These flames are all lifted but differ in the shape of the leading edge and heat release zones. These characteristics are similar for all fuels and three flames, one from each type, are selected for further study. Measurements of mean temperature, velocity and droplet fields as well as high-speed LIF images of OH, Mie scattering from droplets and chemiluminescence of CH∗ are made in the selected flames of ethanol. It is found that the leading edge of the flame, which is a hardly visible light-blue zone close to the jet exit plane, is marked by the presence of OH (but not CH∗), and slight increases in peak temperature above the levels of the co-flow. Further downstream, there exists an intense blue region that is characterized by higher OH levels, significant emission of CH∗, and temperatures that are much higher than those of the co-flow. This is the region where the bulk of the heat release is taking place. Pockets of CH∗ are seen to appear in this region and grow as they are advected further downstream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achemiluminescence 3acombustion 3adroplets 3aethanol 3afluid mechanics 3afuels 3aheat 3anitrogen 3astreams 3atemperature1 aMasri, A.R.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2011 Aug., v. 158, no. 8 p.1577-1590dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.12.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02057naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245010100203500001400304520073400318592002801052650001401080650002101094650001301115650002101128650002201149650002201171650001401193650001601207650001401223650001601237653002301253653001601276653001801292700001801310700006001328700006101388773010801449856008101557852000901638655001201647IND60709300320221118025854.0201111e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070930032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2020.1139342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagai, Haruki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9160-088212aA test potential booster for fast-scan cyclic voltammetry with an electrophysiological amplifier  aNAL-light  aFast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is a powerful technique for studying the local dynamics of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. FSCV is attractive to researchers employing electrophysiological techniques because it can be performed using an electrophysiological voltage-clamp amplifier. However, the narrow test potential range of electrophysiological amplifiers (typically, ±1 V) limits testable species of analytes. Here we devised a booster that extends the test potential range. Using the booster, we could detect the oxidation current of adenosine peaking near a test potential of +1.5 V. The booster should promote combined electrophysiological and electrochemical studies of synaptic release and neural secretion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3achemical species 3adynamics 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrophysiology 3aneurotransmitters 3aoxidation 3aresearchers 3asecretion 3avoltammetry 0aCyclic voltammetry 0aAmperometry 0aVoltage-clamp1 aYokoi, Taichi1 aKanō, Masanobu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0725-32921 aTabata, Toshihide1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6158-647X0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 610 p.113934-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2020.1139343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245011800173300001800291520123800309592002801547650001401575650000901589650001101598650001701609650001301626700002001639700001301659700001401672773009601686856009001782990002301872852000901895655001201904IND60095777320221121005734.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009577732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZoller, B.T.10aPDF model for NO calculations with radiation and consistent NO–NO₂ chemistry in non-premixed turbulent flames  ap. 1591-1601.  aA consistent method to derive the parameterized NO source term from a given flamelet library is presented. The approach was tested by conducting PDF simulations and comparing computed solutions of the Sandia D flame with measurements. The parameterization is based on laminar flamelets with additional parameters for NO formation and radiation. To obtain feedback of the NO concentration on the NO source term, evolution to equilibrium is calculated with a complex chemical mechanism (including nitrogen chemistry), whereas the concentration of all non-nitrogen species are parameters obtained from flamelet profiles. With this method, which requires an appropriate initialization of the nitrogen containing species, unrealistically large NO source terms are avoided, which is a shortcoming of previously devised methods. In addition, to properly account for radiative heat losses, an additional progress variable was introduced. Simulation results obtained with our PDF method are in excellent agreement with experimental data. While the NO concentration values appear too high (by approximately 30% at the exit of the burner), if radiation effects are ignored, their match is very good, if radiation effects are taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aheat 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen1 aAllegrini, J.M.1 aMaas, U.1 aJenny, P.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2011 Aug., v. 158, no. 8 p.1591-1601dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.12.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245004000211300002000251506007600271520085800347592002801205506003701233650001501270650002301285650001401308650001001322653001201332653001401344700002001358700001701378700002101395773017601416856007901592852000901671655001201680IND60172180220221207075733.0150602e20120724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017218022DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12031821092doi7 aPMC34097512pmcid7 a227118322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacCallum, Robert M.10aEvolution of music by public choice  ap. 12081-12086.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMusic evolves as composers, performers, and consumers favor some musical variants over others. To investigate the role of consumer selection, we constructed a Darwinian music engine consisting of a population of short audio loops that sexually reproduce and mutate. This population evolved for 2,513 generations under the selective influence of 6,931 consumers who rated the loops’ aesthetic qualities. We found that the loops quickly evolved into music attributable, in part, to the evolution of aesthetically pleasing chords and rhythms. Later, however, evolution slowed. Applying the Price equation, a general description of evolutionary processes, we found that this stasis was mostly attributable to a decrease in the fidelity of transmission. Our experiment shows how cultural dynamics can be explained in terms of competing evolutionary forces.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaesthetics 3aconsumer attitudes 3aequations 3amusic 0aculture 0aalgorithm1 aMauch, Matthias1 aBurt, Austin1 aLeroi, Armand M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 July 24, v. 109, no. 30 p.12081-12086dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12031821093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245010400210520103800314592002801352650002901380650001401409650002001423650002401443650002601467650002001493650002401513650001401537650001901551650001901570650001801589650002201607653002501629653001501654653004001669653002001709653002701729700002101756700005601777700005601833773010701889856008601996852000902082655001202091IND60684438920221122161741.0220118e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068443892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1160322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDacrory, Sawsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2361-866910aIn situ synthesis of Fe3O4@ cyanoethyl cellulose composite as antimicrobial and semiconducting film  aCyanoethyl cellulose (CEC)/ magnetite (Fe₃O₄) flexible composite film with enhanced dielectric and magnetic properties was successfully prepared.

Recent empirical evidence in health care and physical activity promotion contexts provides a foundation for testing the feasibility and impact of a Self Determination Theory-based (SDT) exercise referral consultation. METHODS: An exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial comparing standard provision exercise referral with an exercise referral intervention grounded in Self Determination Theory. Individuals (N = 347) referred to an exercise referral scheme were recruited into the trial from 13 centres. Outcomes and processes of change measured at baseline, 3 and 6-months: Minutes of self-reported moderate or vigorous physical activity (PA) per week (primary outcome), health status, positive and negative indicators of emotional well-being, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QOL), vitality, and perceptions of autonomy support from the advisor, need satisfaction (3 and 6 months only), intentions to be active, and motivational regulations for exercise. Blood pressure and weight were assessed at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: Perceptions of the autonomy support provided by the health and fitness advisor (HFA) did not differ by arm. Between group changes over the 6-months revealed significant differences for reported anxiety only. Within arm contrasts revealed significant improvements in anxiety and most of the Dartmouth CO-OP domains in the SDT arm at 6 months, which were not seen in the standard exercise referral group. A process model depicting hypothesized relationships between advisor autonomy support, need satisfaction and more autonomous motivation, enhanced well being and PA engagement at follow up was supported. CONCLUSIONS: Significant gains in physical activity and improvements in quality of life and well-being outcomes emerged in both the standard provision exercise referral and the SDT-based intervention at programme end. At 6-months, observed between arm and within intervention arm differences for indicators of emotional health, and the results of the process model, were in line with SDT. The challenges in optimising recruitment and implementation of SDT-based training in the context of health and leisure services are discussed.

The turbulent flame properties of such mixtures are of fundamental interest because of their strong stretch sensitivity, and of practical interest since they are the primary constituents of syngas fuels. Data are reported at mean flow velocities and turbulence intensities of 4<U₀<50m/s and 1<uᵣₘₛ ′/SL,₀<100, respectively, for H₂/CO blends ranging from 30% to 90% H₂ by volume. Two sets of experiments are reported. In the first, fuel blends ranging from 30% to 90% H₂ and mixture equivalence ratio, ϕ, were adjusted at each fuel composition to have nominally the same un-stretched laminar flame speed, SL, ₀. In the second set, equivalence ratios were varied at constant H₂ levels. The data clearly corroborate results from other studies that show significant sensitivity of ST,GC to fuel composition. In particular, at a fixed uᵣₘₛ ′ and SL, ₀, values of ST,GC increase by a factor of almost 2 when H₂ levels are increased from 30% (at ϕ=0.61) to 90% (at ϕ=0.48). Moreover, ST,GC in the 90% H₂ case is three times larger than the ϕ=0.9 CH₄/air mixture with the same SL, ₀ value. An important conclusion from this work is these fuel effects are not simply a low turbulence intensity phenomenon – they clearly persist over the entire range of turbulence intensities used in the measurements. We also describe physics-based correlations of these data, using leading points concepts and detailed kinetic calculations of the stretch sensitivity of these mixtures. These results are used to develop an inequality for negative Markstein length flames that bounds the turbulent flame speed data and show that the data can be collapsed using the maximum stretched laminar flame speed, SL,ₘₐₓ, rather than SL, ₀.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3asynthesis gas 3aturbulent flow1 aMarshall, Andrew1 aShin, Dong Hyuk1 aNoble, David1 aSeitzman, Jerry1 aLieuwen, Timothy C.,0 tCombustion and Flame.g2011 Aug., v. 158, no. 8 p.1602-1614dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.12.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245007500209300002000284506007600304520160700380592002801987506003702015650001502052650001202067650001502079650001002094650001502104650001802119650001902137650001202156653002602168653002702194653002102221700002102242700001402263700002402277773017602301856007902477852000902556655001202565IND60172180320221207075713.0150602e20120724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017218032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12032671092doi7 aPMC34097282pmcid7 a227534732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammond, Thomas M.10aMolecular dissection of Neurospora Spore killer meiotic drive elements  ap. 12093-12098.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMeiotic drive is a non-Mendelian inheritance phenomenon in which certain selfish genetic elements skew sexual transmission in their own favor. In some cases, progeny or gametes carrying a meiotic drive element can survive preferentially because it causes the death or malfunctioning of those that do not carry it. In Neurospora , meiotic drive can be observed in fungal spore killing. In a cross of Spore killer (Sk) × WT (Sk -sensitive), the ascospores containing the Spore killer allele survive, whereas the ones with the sensitive allele degenerate. Sk-2 and Sk-3 are the most studied meiotic drive elements in Neurospora , and they each theoretically contain two essential components: a killer element and a resistance gene. Here we report the identification and characterization of the Sk resistance gene, rsk (resistant to Spore killer). rsk seems to be a fungal-specific gene, and its deletion in a killer strain leads to self-killing. Sk-2 , Sk-3 , and naturally resistant isolates all use rsk for resistance. In each killer system, rsk sequences from an Sk strain and a resistant isolate are highly similar, suggesting that they share the same origin. Sk-2 , Sk-3 , and sensitive rsk alleles differ from each other by their unique indel patterns. Contrary to long-held belief, the killer targets not only late but also early ascospore development. The WT RSK protein is dispensable for ascospore production and is not a target of the spore-killing mechanism. Rather, a resistant version of RSK likely neutralizes the killer element and prevents it from interfering with ascospore development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNeurospora 3aalleles 3aascospores 3adeath 3agerm cells 3ameiotic drive 3aneutralization 3aprogeny 0aintragenomic conflict 0asegregation distortion 0aselfish elements1 aRehard, David G.1 aXiao, Hua1 aShiu, Patrick K.

These areas require water supply via water trucks and/or portable pumps to obtain water from rivers and groundwater. The Central Java government committed to implementing a program involving the construction of 1000 small reservoirs by 2020 to overcome water shortages. However, the technically ideal sites are mostly privately owned, which requires lengthy and costly land acquisition. To avoid the uncertainty of land acquisition, some small reservoirs were placed on state-owned land, which did not require land acquisition. The consideration of putting more emphasis on state-owned land rather than technically ideal sites for the construction of small reservoirs raise the issue on the location suitability of those reservoirs. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of the location of small reservoirs in the Bodri-Kuto river basin using the monthly standardized precipitation index (SPI). We used rainfall records of 25 stations in the river basin from 2000 to 2016 and analyzed yearly and monthly rainfall data. The yearly analysis shows that the dry conditions (SPI < -0.5) from 2005 to 2009 affected more than half of the rainfall stations (>50%), whereas the rainfall stations that experienced more dry years included Kedung Wungu, Babadan, Bojong, Ketapang, Sekopek, and Podowaras (more than 9 out of 17 years). The monthly SPI shows that during July, August, and September, all the rainfall stations experience moderately dry or worse conditions (SPI < -0.50). Using 25 rainfall stations, we determined the spatial spread of dry conditions using monthly SPI values from July, August, and September. Overlay of the spatial spread of dry conditions with the location of small reservoirs can be used to evaluate the suitability of small reservoir locations. We found that 1 (3%) location is very suitable, 7 (21%) locations are suitable, 24 (73%) locations are moderately suitable, and 1 (3%) location is less suitable. The findings indicate that the spatial distribution of SPI can be used as an additional criterion for evaluating the suitability of small reservoirs’ locations should technically ideal locations be unavailable.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3aexhibitions 3agroundwater 3aland 3ameteorological data 3apublic ownership 3apumps 3arain 3ariver water 3aspatial distribution 3atrucks 3auncertainty 3avillages 3awater shortages 3awatersheds 3aIndonesia1 aHarjanti, Theresia  Novie Secunda1 aSriyana, Ignatius 1 aSuryadi, Fransiskus 0 tWater.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120409933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001400181245007900195300001800274520099200292650001301284650001501297650001601312650001001328650002301338650004601361650004101407650004301448650005201491650002901543650002501572650002301597650004901620650004801669650002901717650005301746650005001799651001201849651001801861653003501879653002901914700001401943700001801957700001401975700001901989773007802008852000902086856010702095856008502202930003302287945002502320946001102345655001202356IND4443030720221122003151.0100928e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444303072DNAL7 a204962512pmid7 a10.1080/194400410038011662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The most abundant analyte was zearalenone-4-sulfate, which was found in 13 composites, albeit in low concentrations. Furthermore, deoxynivalenol was detected in eight, zearalenone in seven, and deoxynivalenol-3-glucopyranoside in two composites. None of the remaining six analytes was found in any matrices, which suggests that, if at all present, the concentrations of these latter metabolites are very low and, hence, do not impose any danger to consumers. The highest mycotoxin content was found in bran flakes with 254 ng g-1 deoxynivalenol, 6 ng g-1 zearalenone-4-sulfate, and 44 ng g-1 zearalenone. 3aFusarium 3amycotoxins 3agrain foods 3abeers 3afood contamination 2aEdible Grainxadverse effectsxchemistry. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFast Foodsxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aFood Contaminationxstatistics & numerical data 2aFood Inspectionxmethods 2aFusariumxmetabolism 2aLimit of Detection 2aMycotoxinsxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aTrichothecenesxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aZearalenonexanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aAustria 0aGreat Britain 0aconjugated Fusarium mycotoxins 0afree Fusarium mycotoxins1 aCrews, C.1 aMacDonald, S.1 aKrska, R.1 aBerthiller, F.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Aug., v. 27, no. 8 p.1148-11527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400410038011663Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02459naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245007000172300001800242520118900260650001501449650001201464650001701476650002001493650001701513650001301530650002501543650002101568650001201589651001301601651001501614653002201629653001701651653002201668700002601690700002401716700002301740773012401763852000901887856008501896930003301981946001102014655001202025IND4443714920221122013025.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444371492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-010-9920-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeichmann, Jessica L. 12aA note on amphibian decline in a central Amazonian lowland forest  ap. 3619-3627.  aThe massive reductions in amphibian populations taking place across the globe are unprecedented in modern times. Within the Neotropics, the enigmatic decline of amphibians has been considered predominantly a montane phenomenon; however, recent evidence suggests amphibian and reptile populations in lowland forests in Central America are waning as well. Unfortunately, very little baseline data are available for conducting large scale time series studies in order to further investigate and confirm declines in the lowland forests of tropical America. Here we compare leaf litter herpetofauna abundance at sites in the Central Amazon, sampled first in 1984-1985 and again in 2007. We find no evidence for a decline in abundance or biomass of amphibians over a period of 22 years at this site. This conclusion differs markedly from the decline of 75% in amphibian populations over 35 years at a lowland site in Costa Rica. To explore potential declines in lowland Neotropical amphibian populations in detail, we suggest that existing baseline data be comprehensively compiled and analyzed for previously sampled sites and that these sites be re-sampled using comparable methodologies. 3aamphibians 3abiomass 3aherpetofauna 3alowland forests 3aplant litter 3areptiles 3atime series analysis 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aAmazonia 3aCosta Rica 0aAmphibian decline 0aConservation 0aLong term studies1 aBruce Williamson, G. 1 aLima, Albertina P. 1 aAllmon, Warren D. 0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2010 Nov., v. 19, no. 12 p.3619-3627dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-010-9920-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01933naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003300145245011200178300001800290520088700308653000901195653002001204653000901224653000901233653000901242653000901251653000801260700002901268700002401297700003401321773013301355852000901488856008501497946001301582655001201595IND4444040820221122012441.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444404082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00280-010-1403-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFariña-Sarasqueta, Arantza 10aValue of gene polymorphisms as markers of 5-FU therapy response in stage III colon carcinoma: a pilot study  ap. 1167-1171.  aPurpose The role of pharmacogenetics in chemotherapy response in colon carcinoma is controversial. We studied the value of known SNPs in genes involved in 5-FU metabolism as biomarkers of chemotherapy response in patients with stage III colon carcinoma. Methods DNA was isolated from normal colonic tissue of 60 patients with stage III colon carcinoma treated adjuvantly with 5-FU combined with leucovorin. The tested SNPs were validated SNPs on the OPRT, TYMS and DPYD genes and a synonymous SNP on the TYMP gene. Real-time PCR, sequencing and RFLP were used for genotyping. Results None of the studied genotypes was associated with any of the tumor or patient characteristics. Moreover, none of the genotypes studied had effect on patient survival. Conclusion In conclusion, the tested SNPs are not biomarkers of chemotherapy response in our stage III colon cancer patients group. 0a5-FU 0aColon carcinoma 0aOPRT 0aDPYD 0aTYMS 0aTYMP 0aSNP1 avan Lijnschoten, Gesina 1 aRutten, Harm J.

  1 aGuzman, J.A.10aSurface Runoff Transport of Escherichia coli after Poultry Litter Application on Pastureland  ap. 779-786.  aEscherichia coli transported in surface runoff from dissolution of applied poultry litter is a major variable in assessing fecal contamination of streams. However, the relative magnitude of the E. coli concentration from a specific poultry litter application and relative to the time lag between litter application and rainfall are not completely understood. This research investigated E. coli transport in runoff on fourteen 2 m x 2 m pastureland plots. Poultry litter was manually applied (4,942 kg ha-1) in twelve plots followed by artificial rainfall with intensities equivalent to 2-year and 5-year storm events. Rainfall was applied in duplicate plots immediately after poultry litter application and 24 and 120 h after litter application. Experiments were also conducted on two control plots without poultry litter application. Surface runoff was collected using a flume installed in a trench. E. coli was quantified from sampled runoff and used as an indicator of fecal contamination by the most probable number (MPN) technique. No significant differences were observed in average event mean concentrations (EMCs) relative to storm intensity. Statistically significant differences were observed in average EMCs relative to time lag between litter application and rainfall. A nonlinear relationship was observed between average E. coli EMC and time lag, with the EMC decreasing between 0 h (1.6 x 105 MPN/100 mL) and 24 h (1.3 x 104 MPN/100 mL) and then increasing at 120 h (4.3 x 104 MPN/100 mL). E. coli were always detected in the control plots (average EMC of 6.8 x 103 MPN/100 mL), indicating the presence and transport of fecal bacteria from sources independent of the immediate poultry litter application. Even though poultry litter application may increase E. coli concentrations in runoff, other sources of fecal contamination serve as a significant component of the total E. coli EMC, especially as the time lag between litter application and rainfall events increases. 3apastures 3aland application 3aagricultural runoff 3aEscherichia coli 3abacterial contamination 3atemporal variation 3arain 3aquantitative analysis 3arainfall simulation 3astorms 3afeces 3awater pollution 3apoultry manure 0amost probable number technique 0aevent mean concentrations1 aFox, G.A.1 aPayne, J.B.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 3 p.779-7867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=3&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/25  aOther US 7aarticle03178naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245011100159300001600270520190700286650001502193650002102208650002802229650001602257650002602273650002502299650002302324650002302347650001302370650002602383650002402409700002002433700001502453700001802468773006802486852000902554856012202563930003302685945002502718946001302743655001202756IND4440199320221121185211.0100722e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444019932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLuck, J.D.10aReducing Pesticide Over-Application with Map-Based Automatic Boom Section Control on Agricultural Sprayers  ap. 685-690.  aThe use of precision agriculture technologies such as automatic guidance and map-based automatic boom section control on agricultural sprayers has increased substantially over the past few years. The purpose of these systems is to decrease pesticide application inaccuracy by reducing pass-to-pass overlaps or by turning boom sections off when the boom passes over previously covered areas or beyond field boundaries. The objectives of this study were to compare areas treated by a sprayer before and after the addition of an automatic boom section control system and determine if there was a relationship between field shape factors, specifically perimeter-to-area (P/A) ratio, and pesticide over-application. Coverage files were downloaded from a self-propelled agricultural sprayer with a 24.8 m boom divided into five manually controlled sections. Prior to the subsequent cropping season, automatic boom section control (seven sections) was installed on the sprayer. Application inaccuracy was calculated for the 21 study fields by comparing the actual sprayed area (based on boom section control state: on/off) versus the total projected field area. A comparison between the average percent over-application from fields during season one (12.4%) and season two (6.2%) revealed a significant reduction in off-target application. This reduction represents savings to agricultural producers, potentially justifying the purchase and implementation of this technology. Further analysis indicated an increasing trend in over-application for manual and automatic boom section control as the P/A ratio increased for the study fields. Over-application increased at a greater rate with manual boom section control, which suggests that as field inclusions (grassed waterways or other obstacles) increase, automatic boom section control will provide a greater opportunity for producers to reduce these errors. 3apesticides 3aapplication rate 3apesticide use reduction 3aspray booms 3aprecision agriculture 3aapplication coverage 3aapplication volume 3acontrol components 3aaccuracy 3afield experimentation 3avegetated waterways1 aZandonadi, R.S.1 aLuck, B.D.1 aShearer, S.A.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 3 p.685-6907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=3&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/25  aOther US 7aarticle02821naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001900198245007300217300001600290500001500306520119100321650002301512650001601535650003401551650001301585650002101598650001701619650001001636650004301646650002101689650003301710650002801743650002401771651001901795651001801814653002301832653001101855700001801866700001701884700001701901700001501918773007601933852000902009856010702018856008502125930003302210945002502243946001102268655001202279IND4439585220221121185901.0100708e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443958522DNAL7 a204860032pmid7 a10.1080/194400410036366382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The SML(T), given in European Commission Directive 2002/72/EC as amended, is 15 mg kg-1. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was carried out on the articles to confirm the plastic type. Articles were exposed to the food simulant 3% (w/v) aqueous acetic acid under conditions representing their worst foreseeable use. Formaldehyde and HMTA in food simulants were determined by a spectrophotometric derivatization procedure. Positive samples were confirmed by a second spectrophotometric procedure using an alternative derivatization agent. As all products purchased were intended for repeat use, three sequential exposures to the simulant were carried out. Formaldehyde was detected in the simulant exposed to 43 samples. Most of the levels found were well below the limits set in law such that 84% of the samples tested were compliant. However, eight samples had formaldehyde levels that were clearly above the legal maximum at six to 65 times the SML(T). 3amodel food systems 3aacetic acid 3apackaging materials migration 3amelamine 3afood composition 3aformaldehyde 2aColor 2aCooking and Eating Utensilsxstandards 2aEquipment Design 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFormaldehydexchemistry 2aPlasticsxchemistry 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0afood contamination 0adishes1 aBradley, E.L.1 aDavies, C.R.1 aBarnes, K.A.1 aCastle, L.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 June, v. 27, no. 6 p.879-8837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400410036366383Available from publisher's Web site  a20101115b20101204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle04122naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245015800166300001600324520255000340650001202890650001402902650001102916650001202927650001102939650001102950650001802961650001402979650000902993650001503002650001503017650000903032650001103041650001003052650001903062650000903081650001403090650001603104650000903120650001403129650001803143650001503161650001303176650001703189650001703206650001503223650000903238651001403247653002003261773012503281852000903406856008503415930003303500946001103533655001203544IND4446877520221121185828.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444687752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-010-0304-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirch, Gavin F. 10aContaminated soil and sediments in a highly developed catchment-estuary system (Sydney estuary, Australia): an innovative stormwater remediation strategy  ap. 194-208.  aPurpose The objective of the current research was to provide a strategy to remediate stormwater from an old, high-developed catchment dominated (94%) by diffuse sources. Contaminated catchment soils, a dense road network and extensive residential development have resulted in degraded sediments in the receiving basin. Retrofitting stormwater remedial devices in such catchment-estuarine systems is difficult, costly and long term. Materials and methods The metal content of soils, road dust and gully pot deposits was investigated to assess catchment sources. Fluvial input was assessed using loading models and analyses of water and bedload sediments in two canals draining the catchment, whereas 45 surficial samples were collected from the adjacent estuary to determine impact. All materials were digested using aqua regia and analysis was by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometer and ICP plasma atomic emission spectrometer. Sediment quality guidelines were used to make an initial assessment of degradation by single chemicals and the mean ERM quotient approach was used to determined probable toxicity for mixtures of contaminants. An additional 13 samples were subjected to four laboratory ecotoxicological tests. Results and discussion Soil (mean 62, 410 and 340 μg g⁻¹ for Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively) and sediments (mean 180, 320 and 640 μg g⁻¹, respectively) in the catchment-estuary system (Iron Cove, Sydney Harbour, Australia) contain greatly elevated metal concentrations. Contaminants associated with baseflow (none, or <5 mm day⁻¹ rainfall) are deposited close to the mouths of two canals discharging to the estuary and this sediment is toxic to benthic animals, whereas chemicals carried by high flow (>50 mm day⁻¹ rainfall) bypass the cove in a buoyant, freshwater plume. Remediation of baseflow and some first-flush stormwater will remove approximately 10% metals and 30-50% TN trapped in the embayment and harvest 2 to 4 ML day⁻¹ of urban water runoff. Conclusions The current approach provides an opportunity to remove a large proportion of total stormwater-derived metals and TN trapped in the adjacent embayment, inexpensively and rapidly. The scheme will prevent stormwater-related chemicals from being deposited in the waterway where adverse biological risk is highest. The potential for recycling and harvesting enormous volumes of treated stormwater in highly desirable parts of intensely urbanised environments is in keeping with the concept of “cities as water supply catchments”. 3aanimals 3abase flow 3abasins 3abedload 3acities 3acopper 3aecotoxicology 3aestuaries 3aflow 3aguidelines 3aharvesting 3alead 3amodels 3amouth 3apolluted soils 3arain 3arecycling 3aremediation 3arisk 3asediments 3aspectrometers 3astormwater 3atoxicity 3aurbanization 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aAustralia 0aReceiving basin0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2011 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.194-208dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-010-0304-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03220naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001500198245010900213300001600322500001500338520109300353650004401446650001801490650002601508650002601534650001101560650002501571650002301596650002401619650001401643650001901657650002101676650004601697650003901743650003401782650002301816650003901839650003701878650002301915650002301938650004501961650004402006650004202050650001502092650002902107653002502136653001002161653001602171653001602187700001802203700001502221700002102236700002202257700001602279773007602295852000902371856008502380930003302465945002502498946001102523655001202534IND4440518420221121185905.0100729e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444051842DNAL7 a204372832pmid7 a10.1080/194400410037058212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The method allows analysis of the whole sample with the detection of both active and inactive ingredients in these complex matrices. Among the 20 formulations analysed, two were strictly herbal and four had a composition corresponding to declared ingredients on the packaging or the leaflet. The others were all adulterated. Eight formulations contain sibutramine alone at doses ranging from 4.4 to 30.5 mg/capsule. Five formulations contain sibutramine (from 5.0 to 19.6 mg/capsule or tablet) in combination with phenolphthalein (from 4.4 to 66.1 mg/capsule), and the last formulation was adulterated with synephrine (19.5 mg/capsule). Quantification of the actives was carried out with 1H-NMR. Several other compounds were also characterized including methylsynephrine, vitaberin, sugars, vitamins, etc. DOSY NMR is thus proposed as a useful tool for detection of unexpected adulteration. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3adose response 3aquantitative analysis 3alaboratory techniques 3adosage 3aadulterated products 3aactive ingredients 3adietary supplements 3adetection 3aweight control 3aherbal medicines 2aAnti-Obesity Agentsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aCyclobutanesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aDietary Supplementsxanalysis 2aDrug Contamination 2aDrug and Narcotic Controlxmethods 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxchemistry 2aFood Contamination 2aLimit of Detection 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aPharmaceutic Aidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPhenolphthaleinxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSynephrine 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 0ainactive ingredients 0adrugs 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aBalayssac, S.1 aGilard, V.1 aDesoubdzanne, D.1 aMalet-Martino, M.1 aMartino, R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.903-9167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400410037058213Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02633naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072001700144100001400161245006700175300001600242500001500258520114100273650003001414650001401444650003201458650001101490650002601501650001901527650002301546650001201569650001301581650002201594650001601616650003001632650002801662650001101690650001301701650002301714650002201737650001601759650001901775653001601794653001801810700001801828773009501846852000901941856008401950930003302034945002502067946001102092655001202103IND4440218920221121120325.0100722s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444021892DNAL7 a10.3923/ppj.2010.101.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNejat, N.10aPhytoplasma Detection in Coconut Palm and Other Tropical Crops  ap. 112-121.  a2019-12-05  aPhytoplasmas are small bacteria with very small genomes which also have extremely low levels of the nucleotides guanine plus cytosine (G+C). They are associated with hundreds of plant diseases globally. The uneven distribution and low concentration of phytoplasmas in the phloem of infected plant, especially in woody hosts, and variations in titre according to season and plant organ are also important obstacles for efficient diagnosis. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), nested PCR and real-time PCR have been employed for phytoplasma detection. PCR is the most versatile tool for detecting phytoplasmas in their plant and insect hosts. Nested PCR with a combination of different universal primers can improve the diagnosis of unknown phytoplasmas present with low titre in the symptomatic host. Universal ribosomal primers nested with group-specific primers are extremely useful when the phytoplasma to be diagnosed belongs to a well-defined taxonomic group. Real-time PCR has been shown to be an effective method of quantifying the titre of phytoplasmas within the plant. This paper also discuss phytoplasma diseases on coconut palm. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3anut crops 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3agenome 3aphytoplasmal diseases 3ainsect vectors 3aseasonal variation 3aguanine 3acytosine 3adisease detection 3ahost plants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apathogen identification 3aphloem 3acoconuts 3amicrobial genetics 3adisease diagnosis 3aPhytoplasma 3aCocos nucifera 0amethodology 0aplant tissues1 aVadamalai, G.0 tPlant pathology journal.g2010, v. 9, no. 3 p.112-121wJournal:jnl4250891x1812-54257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3923/ppj.2010.101.1103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110307b20110402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02197naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245011800161300001600279520106000295650001301355650001501368650001601383650002101399650001801420650001901438650001701457650001201474650001501486651001201501653001001513653001501523700002001538773011501558852000901673856008501682939003301767946001101800655001201811IND4449660720221121090435.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444966072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-010-0684-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTam, Vu T. 12aA multi-analysis remote-sensing approach for mapping groundwater resources in the karstic Meo Vac Valley, Vietnam  ap. 275-287.  aRemote sensing data can be integrated with analyses of topography, structural geology, hydrogeology and geophysics. The integration gives premises for the delineation of zones of potential groundwater resources in strongly fractured and karstified deep aquifers in the uplifted Meo Vac Highland, northern Vietnam. Remote sensing analysis outlines geological faults with hydrogeological significance. These faults are combined with a derived lineament density map, interpreted analysis of surface flow direction and existing hydrogeological data, resulting in indications of groundwater flow direction. An analysis of the SPOT 5 band ratio 4/1, together with indications of surface-flow direction in low terrains, results in a determination of underground cavern passages. The delineated zones of potential groundwater resources are verified by detailed hydrogeological field surveys and geophysical measurements. Remote sensing analysis is shown to effectively contribute to the investigation of groundwater resources for a hydrogeologically complex area. 3aaquifers 3ageophysics 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aoverland flow 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3asurveys 3atopography 3aVietnam 0aKarst 0aLineaments1 aBatelaan, Okke 0 tHydrogeology journal.g2011 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.275-287dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-010-0684-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03440naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245014300189300001600332520178200348650002502130650001402155650001802169650001502187650001002202650000902212650004902221650001002270650001102280650002702291650001102318650002502329650000902354650001602363650005502379650003202434650002602466650004602492650003502538650001602573653002302589653001402612700001602626700001902642773010402661852000902765856009202774930003302866946001102899655001202910IND4442474920221121090418.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444247492DNAL7 a208544682pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0463.2010.02653.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOO, JA SEUNG10aImmunohistochemical characteristics of diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary carcinoma: comparison with conventional papillary carcinoma  ap. 744-752.  aKoo JS, Shin E, Hong SW. Immunohistochemical characteristics of diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary carcinoma: comparison with conventional papillary carcinoma. APMIS 2010; 118: 744-52. Diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary carcinoma (DSVPC) is a rare variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). It shows different clinicopathologic features to the conventional PTC, but the immunohistochemical characteristics of DSVPC are yet to be more clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical features of DSVPC, which are different from those of PTC. Tissue microarray was constructed from the paraffin-embedded tissue of 49 DSVPC and 50 conventional PTC samples. Immunohistochemical stains for p63, p53, galectin-3, cytokeratin 19, β-catenin, Bcl-2, EMA, E-cadherin, CD15, and CD56 were performed on each tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical stain for p63 was negative in all conventional PTCs, but 14 (28.6%) cases of DSVPC showed p63 expression (p = 0.000). p53 was expressed in 38 (76.0%) cases of conventional PTC and 21 (42.9%) cases of DSVPC (p = 0.001). Galectin-3 was expressed in all 50 cases of conventional PTC, but eight (16.3%) cases of DSVPC did not express galectin-3 (p = 0.003). EMA was expressed more in DSVPC (40.8%) than in conventional PTC (20.0%, p = 0.024). In univariate analyses, Bcl-2 positivity (p = 0.016) and EMA negativity (p = 0.036) in DSVPC were associated with shorter time interval to tumor recurrence, but there was no significance for the two in multivariate analyses. DSVPC, a rare variant of PTC, has different immunohistochemical features from the conventional PTC, showing higher expression rate of p63 and lower expression rate of p53. It also shows galectin-3 negativity and EMA positivity. 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acarcinoma 3athyroid gland 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCarcinoma, Papillaryxmetabolismxpathology. 2aChild 2aFemale 2aGalectin 3xmetabolism 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasm Recurrence, Localxmetabolismxpathology. 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRetrospective Studies 2aThyroid Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aTissue Array Analysisxmethods 2aYoung Adult 0aDiffuse sclerosing 0apapillary1 aSHIN, EUNAH1 aHONG, SOON WON0 tAPMIS.g2010 Oct., v. 118, no. 10 p.744-752dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0903-46417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2010.02653.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03539naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072001700142100001600159245009400175300001400269500001500283520183000298650003002128650001702158650001302175650001902188650002302207650002802230650002102258650001702279650001502296650001102311650003702322650001402359650001102373650001102384650003802395650001202433650002702445650001902472650001802491650001902509653003202528653002602560653001102586700001902597700001302616700002102629700001602650700001802666773009302684852000902777856008202786930003302868945002502901946001102926655001202937IND4440217920221121090427.0100722s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444021792DNAL7 a10.3923/ppj.2010.56.642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAchor, D.S.10aSequence of Anatomical Symptom Observations in Citrus Affected with Huanglongbing Disease  ap. 56-64.  a2019-12-05  aThis study was undertaken to develop a better understanding of the relationship between symptom development and the nature of the citrus disease, huanglongbing. The most characteristic symptom of huanglongbing (HLB) is the non-symmetrical mottled chlorosis of leaf blades. Starch accumulation and phloem collapse have been associated with symptom development in this disease presumed to be caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. Several hypotheses regarding phloem disruption to starch accumulation to chlorosis evolved concerning symptom development. These were tested using light and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Samples collected and fixed for TEM with various stages of HLB symptoms, revealed the following: starch accumulation occurred after phloem plugging and cell collapse and therefore, localized carbohydrate deficiency may be a factor. Starch packing of chloroplasts did not rupture the outer membranes, but the inner grana structure was disrupted thus, leading to chlorosis. This occurred only in parts of the leaf where phloem plugging occurred. Sieve elements were obstructed by both amorphous and filamentous materials and both occurred in readily observed amounts, while bacteria were insufficient to directly cause plugging. The amorphous material was positively identified as callose by immunoassay with gold labeling. Phloem protein 2 was identified in the filamentous plugging material using immunoassay with gold labeling. This information supports the development of HLB symptoms in the following sequence: phloem plugging and necrosis with cell wall swelling of sieve elements and companion cells followed by some phloem cell collapse, presumed sugar backup in localized leaf blade areas leading to starch accumulation until chloroplast structure is disrupted with resulting chlorosis. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3achloroplasts 3anecrosis 3asieve elements 3abacterial proteins 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3agreening disease 3aimmunoassays 3acell walls 3astarch 3atransmission electron microscopy 3achlorosis 3aCitrus 3aleaves 3aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 3acallose 3aphloem companion cells 3ahistopathology 3acitrus fruits 3adisease course 0asigns and symptoms (plants) 0aplant vascular system 0aphloem1 aEtxeberria, E.1 aWang, N.1 aFolimonova, S.Y.1 aChung, K.R.1 aAlbrigo, L.G.0 tPlant pathology journal.g2010, v. 9, no. 2 p.56-64wJournal:jnl4250891x1812-54257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3923/ppj.2010.56.643Available from publisher's Web site  a20101004b20101108c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03773naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245012400146300001600270500002400286520171700310650002002027650002002047650001402067650001002081650002402091650001802115650001102133650002002144650002102164650001702185650003002202650001302232650001502245650002602260650000902286650001402295650001402309650002502323650001202348650003402360650002602394650002902420650002202449650002302471650000902494650001902503650001402522650002202536650003302558650006802591650002602659650002202685650003502707650004902742650000902791650000902800650001702809650003302826700001702859700001902876700001702895700001702912700001702929773009602946852000903042655001203051IND4363852720221121064224.0040812s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436385272DNAL7 a151823942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeuranen, S.10aCombination of polydextrose and lactitol affects microbial ecosystem and immune responses in rat gastrointestinal tract  ap. 905-914.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of various dietary fibres on gut health have been studied extensively but their combined effects are scarcely documented. In the present study the effects of 2% (w/w) polydextrose (PDX), 2% (w/w) disaccharide lactitol, or 2% (w/w) PDX+2% (w/w) lactitol on gut microflora, microbial metabolism and gut immune responses were investigated in rats. Both PDX and lactitol alone had an effect on many of the studied parameters, but their combination had stronger than additive effects in some parameters. The PDX+lactitol combination altered the microbial community structure as seen by a culture-independent method, percentage guanine+cytosine (%G+C) profiling, increasing the areas of %G+C 35-39 (P<0.0001) and %G+C 45-49 (P=0.0002), and decreasing %G+C 65-74 (P<0.0003). These changes were also reflected in the microbial metabolism so that the production of biogenic amines and branched volatile fatty acids was significantly reduced, by 12 (P=0.03) and 50% (P=0.002), respectively, indicating a shift from putrefactive towards saccharolytic metabolism. PDX increased the secretion of IgA in the caecum (P=0.007). Secretion of IgA increased even more, almost ten-fold, with the combination of PDX+lactitol (P<0.0001) when compared with the control group. Lactitol increased the production of butyrate by caecal microbes by two- to three-fold when compared with the PDX or control group (P<0.0001). Butyrate is a preferred energy source for mucosal cells; thus a boost in the availability of energy for immune cells may have still added to the synergistic effects of PDX and lactitol on immune cells. It is noteworthy that improvement in the IgA secretion occurred without signs of mucosal inflammation. 3aadditive effect 3abiogenic amines 3abutyrates 3acecum 3acommunity structure 3adietary fiber 3aenergy 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactitol 3ametabolism 3amicrobial communities 3arats 3asecretion 3asynergism 3avolatile fatty acids 2aAnimals 2aBiogenic Aminesxbiosynthesis 2aButyratesxmetabolism 2aCatharticsxpharmacology 2aCecumxmetabolism 2aCytosinexanalysis 2aDiet 2aDrug Synergism 2aEcosystem 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFood Additivesxpharmacology 2aGastrointestinal Tractxdrug effectsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aGlucansxpharmacology 2aGuaninexanalysis 2aImmunoglobulin Axbiosynthesis 2aIntestinal Mucosaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSugar Alcoholsxpharmacology1 aTiihonen, K.1 aApajalahti, J.1 aKettunen, A.1 aSaarinen, M.1 aRautonen, N.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2004 June, v. 91, no. 6 p.905-914dCABI Pubx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002800161245009600189300001800285500001500303520094700318650002401265650003601289650002701325650002001352650002601372650002001398650001701418650001901435650001301454650002001467653002301487653001701510655002201527700002501549700001701574700001501591700002201606700001601628700002301644700001701667773009101684852000901775856007401784930003301858945002501891946001101916655001201927IND4437929020221121064219.0100603e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443792902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A review  ap. 295–309.  a2019-12-05  aInterest in nutrient absorption and accumulation is derived from the need to increase crop productivity by better nutrition and also to improve the nutritional quality of plants as foods and feeds. This review focuses on contrasting data on the importance for human health of food mineral nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, Na and P) and also the trace elements considered essential or beneficial for human health (Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se and Zn). In addition, environmental stresses such as salinity, drought, extreme temperatures and light conditions that affect mineral content were revised in the light that the effect of these factors depends on the species or cultivar, and the specific plant organ, as well as the intensity and duration of the stress. Differences between inorganic and organic fertilisation practices on the mineral levels were also analysed to evaluate the influence of external factors on the quality of plant-based foods. 3amineral fertilizers 3achemical constituents of plants 3afertilizer application 3anutritive value 3aenvironmental factors 3ahuman nutrition 3ahuman health 3aabiotic stress 3aminerals 3amineral content 0aliterature reviews 0afood quality 7aInternet resource1 aDominguez-Perles, R.1 aMoreno, D.A.1 aMuries, B.1 aAlcaraz-Lopez, C.1 aBastias, E.1 aGarcia-Viguera, C.1 aCarvajal, M.0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2010 , v. 30, no. 2 p.295–309-295–3097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.agronomy-journal.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/06/11  aNon-US 7aarticle04403naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001700198245005700215300001600272500001500288520168700303650001101990650001002001650005802011650001702069650002202086650001402108650001602122650002602138650001502164650001602179650001502195650001502210650002102225650001802246650001302264650001302277650001702290650002202307650001902329650001902348650002402367650004102391650003902432650004402471650002302515650002402538650003902562650005902601650002302660650003502683650003402718650004102752650004202793650003302835650001202868650002402880650002902904650003702933650002402970650001202994650000903006651001303015651001303028653001403041653001803055653001703073700001603090700001603106700001703122700001803139773007503157852000903232856010603241856008503347930003303432945002503465946001103490655001203501IND4438265520221121075951.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443826552DNAL7 a203493712pmid7 a10.1080/194400409035717542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMikusova, P.10aContamination by moulds of grape berries in Slovakia  ap. 738-747.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper describes the first map, albeit partial, of toxigenic fungi re-isolated from grape berries collected in three out of the six most important Slovakia winemaking areas in two different periods of the harvest year 2008. Low temperatures and high relative humidity during July 2008 favoured the development of grape fungal diseases that cause rots such as Plasmopara, Uncinula, Botrytis, Metasphaeria, Elsinoë, and Saccharomycetes. In the analysed samples, the following genera of toxigenic fungi were identified in the range of 1-4%: Aspergillus, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Ulocladium, and Trichoderma Trichothecium, while the genera Aspergillus, Alternaria, Fusarium, and Penicillium were in the range 11-29%. A. niger, A. carbonarius, some strains of A. carbonarius-with 'crystals' and strains of A. uvarum-uniseriate were identified; these species are considered ochratoxigenic (able to produce variable amounts of toxins). In addition, a non-ochratoxigenic strain of A. ibericus and a Fusarium strain able to biosynthesize small amount of fumonisins, beauvericin, and enniatins were identified. P. expansum, able to produce citrinin, represents 29.7%, of the Penicillium genus together with P. verrucosum, P. glabrum, P. citrinum, and P. crustosum. An analysis for the identification and quantification of the main toxins: ochratoxin A, fumonisins, beauvericin, enniatins, and fusaproliferin was performed on grape samples; it was consistent with the results of the mycological analysis. Toxigenic fungi should be checked throughout the years and their occurrence compared with all environmental factors to avoid health risks. 3agrapes 3awines 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aochratoxin A 3amass spectrometry 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3asecondary metabolites 3aaflatoxins 3agrape juice 3awinemaking 3afumonisins 3aclimatic factors 3amolds (fungi) 3aFusarium 3amycology 3abiosynthesis 3atoxigenic strains 3agrowing season 3afood pathogens 3aon-farm food safety 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCitrininxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aDepsipeptidesxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aFood Contamination 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aFumonisinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFungixcytologyxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aLimit of Detection 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aMycotoxinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aOchratoxinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aSeasons 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aTerpenesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aVitisxmicrobiology 2aWeather 2aWine 3aSlovakia 0aSlovakia 0abeverages 0afruits (food) 0afruit juices1 aRitieni, A.1 aSantini, A.1 aJuhasova, G.1 aSrobarova, A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.738-7477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g9220575693Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400409035717543Available from publisher's Web site  a20100622b20100703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/06/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02745naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245006800158300001600226500001500242520162000257650001501877650001601892650003001908650001001938650001101948650001401959650001901973651001101992653001702003653002102020653000902041700001502050773006802065852000902133856012202142930003302264945002502297946001302322655001202335IND4436903220221121075925.0100513e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443690322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Layouts from 207 Norwegian freestall barns, 94 new and 113 rebuilt, constructed during 1995-2005, and with a mean of 42.0 ± 16.5 freestalls for lactating cows, were obtained and the areas dedicated for milking cows were analyzed. The mean total cow area (TCA) was 8.37 ± 1.09 m 2 per freestall, ranged from 5.88 to 12.61 m 2 , decreased with increased number of stalls, and was higher for new buildings compared to rebuilt buildings. The mean freestall area was 2.78 ± 0.18 m 2 per freestall and represented 33.2% of the TCA. Both alley area and feed bunk space decreased with increasing number of freestall rows. The mean alley area was 3.70 ± 0.63 m 2 per freestall and represented 44.2% of the TCA. Widths of feed alleys (3.21 ± 0.43 m) and freestall alleys (2.25 ± 0.44 m) varied considerably, and a high proportion was below the American recommendations. However, only a minor proportion was below the international recommendations. Barns with automatic milking systems (AMS) had approximately 1.0 m 2 less milking area per freestall compared to barns with milking parlors. Nearly 25% of the barns had no separation area for maternity and sick cows, and even 16% of new barns had no space for this important group of cows. Increased herd size and choosing AMS over traditional parlors were structural factors that reduced building space. However, in several barns, space was minimized by decreasing the alley widths and skipping the separation area, which is absolutely not recommendable. 3adairy cows 3afree stalls 3aanimal space requirements 3abarns 3adesign 3alactation 3acattle housing 3aNorway 0amilking cows 0aspace allocation 0acows1 aBøe, K.E.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 2 p.605-6117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=2&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100519b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/19  aOther US 7aarticle02983naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245024500192300001600437520107100453650002301524650001801547650000901565650001501574650002801589650001701617650001401634650002001648650001201668650001801680650001201698650001601710650003801726650002701764650002201791650002001813650003001833650003001863650004101893651001801934651001301952651001801965653002201983653001702005653000802022653002002030653002402050700002402074700002302098773013402121852000902255856008502264930003302349946001102382655001202393IND4442071720221121075949.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444207172DNAL7 a198886642pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-1191-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEchols, Brandi Shontia 10aPreliminary results of laboratory toxicity tests with the mayfly, Isonychia bicolor (Ephemeroptera: Isonychiidae) for development as a standard test organism for evaluating streams in the Appalachian coalfields of Virginia and West Virginia  ap. 487-500.  aSelecting the most appropriate test species for sediment and water column assays has been a primary goal for ecotoxicologists. Standard test organisms and established test guidelines exist, but the USEPA-recommended species may not be the most sensitive organisms to anthropogenic inputs. This paper describes preliminary results of toxicity tests with the mayfly, Isonychia bicolor (Ephemeroptera). Results suggested that Isonychia were moderately sensitive to NaCl after 96 h with an average LC₅₀ value of 3.10 g NaCl per liter. This value decreased after 7 days of exposure, resulting in a mean LC₅₀ value of 1.73 g NaCl per liter. When exposed to a coal-mine-processed effluent, Isonychia generated LC₅₀ values that ranged from 13% to 39% effluent. I. bicolor were more sensitive to the coal processing effluent than Ceriodaphnia dubia with conductivity lowest observable effects concentration (LOEC) values for mayfly survivorship that ranged from 1,508 to 4,101 μS/cm, while LOEC values for C. dubia reproduction ranged from 2,132 to 4,240 μS/cm. 3aCeriodaphnia dubia 3aEphemeroptera 3acoal 3aguidelines 3alethal concentration 50 3areproduction 3asediments 3asodium chloride 3astreams 3asurvival rate 2aAnimals 2aCoal Mining 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aInsectaxdrug effects. 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSalt Tolerance. 2aSodium Chloridextoxicity 2aToxicity Testsxstandards 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 3aWest Virginia 0aVirginia 0aWest Virginia 0aIsonychia bicolor 0aConductivity 0aTDS 0aReference tests 0aSpecies comparisons1 aCurrie, Rebecca J. 1 aCherry, Donald S. 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Oct., v. 169, no. 1-4 p.487-500dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-1191-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02219naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245008200174300001600256520109200272650001701364650001601381650001601397650001001413650001601423650001901439650002401458650002601482653001801508700001301526700001201539773006801551852000901619856012201628930003301750945002501783946001301808655001201821IND4436903520221121075908.0100513e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443690352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhao, S.10aTechnical Note: Extraction of Wing Venation Characteristics by Image Analysis  ap. 643-646.  aWing venation characteristics, such as the wing diagram and coordinates of vein junctions, are species-specific and are usually used in studies of insect identification. Image analysis methods are quick and precise means to measure these characteristics. An image analysis method is proposed that enables extraction of the wing diagram and automatic identification of vein junctions. A color image of an insect wing is converted to a binary image of wing venation based on thresholding. A distance-to-boundary map of the complement of the binary image is computed using a distance transform function. The vein skeleton is obtained by a watershed transform. The lookup table method is applied to find coordinates of vein junctions. The proposed method is capable of producing a smooth vein skeleton diagram and can extract the coordinates of vein junctions. This approach is not limited to high-quality images and is simple because the characteristics are obtained almost simultaneously. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is repeatable and useful for wing analysis. 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3aDelphacidae 3awings 3ablood veins 3aimage analysis 3apest identification 3ainsect identification 0awing venation1 aDing, W.1 aLiu, D.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 2 p.643-6467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=2&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100519b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/19  aOther US 7aarticle02803naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245007700211300001600288520168300304653002701987653004402014653001502058700002402073700002302097700002302120700002302143773020602166852000902372856008502381946001102466655001202477IND4448865120221121075944.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444886512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00775-010-0732-02doi7 aPMC31924312pmcid7 a211538512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFielding, Andrew J. 12aA hyperactive cobalt-substituted extradiol-cleaving catechol dioxygenase  ap. 341-355.  aHomoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase from Brevibacterium fuscum (HPCD) has an Fe(II) center in its active site that can be replaced with Mn(II) or Co(II). Whereas Mn-HPCD exhibits steady-state kinetic parameters comparable to those of Fe-HPCD, Co-HPCD behaves somewhat differently, exhibiting significantly higher [graphic removed] and k cat. The high activity of Co-HPCD is surprising, given that cobalt has the highest standard M(III/II) redox potential of the three metals. Comparison of the X-ray crystal structures of the resting and substrate-bound forms of Fe-HPCD, Mn-HPCD, and Co-HPCD shows that metal substitution has no effect on the local ligand environment, the conformational integrity of the active site, or the overall protein structure, suggesting that the protein structure does not differentially tune the potential of the metal center. Analysis of the steady-state kinetics of Co-HPCD suggests that the Co(II) center alters the relative rate constants for the interconversion of intermediates in the catalytic cycle but still allows the dioxygenase reaction to proceed efficiently. When compared with the kinetic data for Fe-HPCD and Mn-HPCD, these results show that dioxygenase catalysis can proceed at high rates over a wide range of metal redox potentials. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism in which the metal mediates electron transfer between the catechol substrate and O₂ to form the postulated [M(II)(semiquinone)superoxo] reactive species. These kinetic differences and the spectroscopic properties of Co-HPCD provide new tools with which to explore the unique O₂ activation mechanism associated with the extradiol dioxygenase family. 0aBioinorganic chemistry 0aExtradiol-cleaving catechol dioxygenase 0aCobalt(II)1 aKovaleva, Elena G. 1 aFarquhar, Erik R. 1 aLipscomb, John D. 1 aQue, Lawrence Jr. 0 tJournal of biological inorganic chemistry JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry.g2011 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.341-355dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0949-82577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00775-010-0732-03Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02871naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245013300146300001600279520141800295650002501713650003901738650002001777650001301797650001601810650001801826650001101844650001501855650001501870650002201885651000901907653003101916653003101947653002601978653003302004700001602037700001602053700001802069700001502087700001702102773006802119852000902187856012202196930003302318945002502351946001302376655001202389IND4436902520221121061713.0100513e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443690252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAndersen, D.S.10aUse of the Soil-Plant-Air-Water Model to Predict Hydraulic Performance of Vegetative Treatment Areas Controlling Open Lot Runoff  ap. 537-543.  aAlternative treatment systems to control runoff from open beef feedlots may enhance environmental security and protect water quality. Several Midwestern states have issued National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits allowing beef feedlots to use vegetative treatment systems (VTSs) to control and treat feedlot runoff. Monitoring VTSs has provided data to validate performance modeling strategies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the Soil-Plant-Air-Water (SPAW) model to predict the hydraulic performance of vegetative treatment areas (VTAs). Two approaches, one using the field module and the other the pond module of the SPAW model, were investigated. The model results from the SPAW field and pond modules were compared to monitored performance data from five VTAs in Iowa. Modeling statistics were calculated to evaluate SPAW's ability to predict VTA hydraulic performance. Based on the 18 site-years of data collected, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (BIAS), and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation (RSR) were 0.95, 8%, and 0.22, respectively, on an annual basis. The NSE, BIAS, and RSR for the field module were 0.32, 32%, and 0.83, respectively. The results showed that the SPAW model could be used successfully to predict the hydraulic performance of VTAs, with the pond module being more successful than the field module. 3aenvironmental models 3asoil-plant-atmosphere interactions 3awaste treatment 3afeedlots 3abeef cattle 3afilter strips 3arunoff 3awater flow 3aprediction 3apollution control 3aIowa 0aSoil-Plant-Air-Water model 0avegetative treatment areas 0ahydraulic performance 0avegetative treatment systems1 aBurns, R.T.1 aMoody, L.B.1 aHelmers, M.J.1 aHorton, R.1 aPederson, C.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v. 53, no. 2 p.537-5437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=53&issue=2&conf=t&orgconf=t20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100519b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/19  aOther US 7aarticle04755naa a2200997 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001600198245012100214300001600335500001500351520161700366650001701983650002702000650002202027650000902049650001702058650003302075650001402108650002502122650003002147650002602177650001302203650001402216650002002230650002202250650001702272650002602289650002602315650002802341650002102369650001802390650002302408650001902431650001802450650001202468650002602480650002102506650004002527650003002567650002402597650002402621650002302645650004702668650004202715650006902757650007702826650003102903650003402934650002902968650005402997650001403051650003303065650002403098650002503122650001403147651001003161651001003171653002803181653001803209653001503227653002303242653001403265653001303279700001803292700001403310700001403324700001403338700001403352700001603366700001903382773007503401852000903476856010603485856008503591930003303676945002503709946001103734655001203745IND4438267020221121061932.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443826702DNAL7 a203525492pmid7 a10.1080/194400409035730402doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMoretti, A.10aIdentification, mycotoxin risk and pathogenicity of Fusarium species associated with fig endosepsis in Apulia, Italy  ap. 718-728.  a2019-12-05  aIn a survey carried out on 87 rotted fig fruits samples collected in the Apulia region of Italy, the authors isolated 126 Fusarium strains identified as F. ramigenum (69 strains), F. solani (49), F. proliferatum (five) and three not identified. Investigation on the fertility of the strains belonging to F. proliferatum and F. ramigenum revealed that only strains of F. proliferatum were fertile. The identity of F. ramigenum strains was confirmed by sequencing a portion of the translation elongation factor-1 gene. When Fusarium species were analysed for their toxigenicity, 37/69 strains of F. ramigenum produced fusaric acid (FA) up to 525 mg kg-1; 30 strains produced beauvericin (BEA) up to 190 mg kg-1; 60 strains produced fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2) up to 1575 mg kg-1 of total FBs; and two strains produced fusaproliferin (FUP) up to 345 mg kg-1; all five strains of F. proliferatum produced FA at low levels; two strains produced BEA up to 205 mg kg-1; one strain produced FB1 and FB2, 1100 and 470 mg kg-1, respectively; and one strain produced FUP, 820 mg kg-1; F. solani (30 strains) produced FA, 13 strains up to 215 mg kg-1. Few fungal extracts showed high toxicity toward brine shrimp larvae and in some cases in relation to BEA and FA content. A pathogenic assay on fig fruits showed that all three species were pathogenic, with higher virulence of F. ramigenum. These data report for the first time the production of BEA and FB1/FB2 by F. ramigenum and show that it is a main agent of fig endosepsis in Apulia and can contribute to fumonisin contamination of fresh and dried figs. 3aFicus carica 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amass spectrometry 3afigs 3afumonisin B2 3acapillary gas chromatography 3aphenotype 3apostharvest diseases 3afungal diseases of plants 3asecondary metabolites 3agenotype 3avirulence 3aFusarium solani 3asequence analysis 3afumonisin B1 3aquantitative analysis 3aFusarium proliferatum 3apathogen identification 3ain vitro studies 3amolds (fungi) 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3afungal spores 2aAnimals 2aArtemiaxdrug effects 2aBiological Assay 2aCell Extractsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aDepsipeptidesxmetabolism 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aFicusxmicrobiology 2aFood Contamination 2aFruitxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFusaric Acidxbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aFusariumxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aGenes, Mating Type, Fungal 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aMycotoxinsxbiosynthesis 2aPeptide Elongation Factor 1xchemistryxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTerpenesxmetabolism 2aVirulence 3aItaly 0aItaly 0amolecular sequence data 0afruits (food) 0afumonisins 0aFusarium ramigenum 0aisolation 0aFusarium1 aFerracane, L.1 aSomma, S.1 aRicci, V.1 aMulè, G.1 aSusca, A.1 aRitieni, A.1 aLogrieco, A.F.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.718-7287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g9220575693Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400409035730403Available from publisher's Web site  a20100623b20100703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/06/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03509naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213100001800230245008200248300001500330500015100345500001500496520151600511650001002027650001602037650002102053650001602074650001602090650002802106650001902134650002202153650002102175650001902196650001702215650000902232650002602241650001202267650002302279650001402302650002002316650002502336650001502361650001002376653002302386653003402409653001402443653001002457653002802467653001602495653003202511655002202543700002302565773008402588852000902672856008502681930003302766945002502799946001102824655001202835IND4437189520221121061658.0100518e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443718952DNAL7 a10.1017/S17421705100001042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Because the social aspects of local food have been more fully addressed in previous literature, this review focuses instead on the ecological aspects of farming and food. First, the literature on natural resource use in agriculture provides contextual understanding of water use, biodiversity, soils and agro-ecological methods. The complex relationship between climate change and agriculture is described and models assessing the impacts of climate change on agriculture are detailed. The geography of local food is specifically addressed by describing methods for assessing natural resource use in local food, including food miles, consumer transportation, scale and community, agricultural methods and diet. Finally, future research paths are suggested to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the environmental impact of local food. Such research would encompass the geography of local food through development of broader, more inclusive strategy, including the concept of the ‘ecological appetite’ of crops and foods, the union of both social and ecological aspects of resource use, the linkages between rural and urban producers and consumers and the inclusion of farmers’ ecological knowledge. Overall, the geography of local food seeks to assess the where of food production and consumption, while incorporating key issues of how (agro-ecological methods benefiting the community) and what (locally appropriate crops). 3afoods 3aurban areas 3aplant adaptation 3arural areas 3aagriculture 3asustainable agriculture 3aagroecosystems 3asimulation models 3awater management 3aclimate change 3abiodiversity 3adiet 3acommunity development 3afarmers 3aconsumer attitudes 3ageography 3afood production 3aenvironmental impact 3afood miles 3acrops 0aliterature reviews 0afarmers' ecological knowledge 0aconsumers 0aplace 0aconsumer transportation 0alocal foods 0anatural resource management 7aInternet resource1 aOberholtzer, Lydia0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2010 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.99-1087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17421705100001043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100803b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/06/13  aNon-US 7aarticle04269naa a2200949 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001400198245014400212300001600356500001500372520114900387650001601536650002701552650002201579650002601601650004301627650002501670650002601695650001401721650001801735650001401753650002201767650001001789650002401799650001501823650001901838650002101857650001801878650001701896650002201913650001901935650002201954650005201976650003202028650004102060650004402101650002302145650004202168650007802210650001802288650002202306650002302328650003402351650004102385650005402426650001402480650004402494650003002538650002402568650002902592650006102621650004502682650002702727651001002754651001002764653001602774653002802790653001402818653001302832653002102845700001602866700001402882700001802896700001602914700001702930700001602947773007502963852000903038856010603047856008503153930003303238945002503271946001103296655001203307IND4438267920221121061819.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443826792DNAL7 a202049122pmid7 a10.1080/194400409035717882doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Eighty-one strains of F. poae isolated from durum wheat kernels, identified by species-specific polymerase chain reaction and translation elongation factor-1 gene sequence analysis, were genetically characterized by the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique and analysed by high-pressure liquid chromatography for their ability to produce the beauvericin (BEA) and trichothecene mycotoxins. A high level of variability was observed by using AFLP analyses, with the lowest level of genetic similarity among the strains being approximately 61%. Most of the strains, 95%, produced BEA at <2655 µg g-1; 88% produced the trichothecene nivalenol at <865 µg g-1 and 76% produced the trichothecene fusarenon-X at <167 µg g-1. These data show that F. poae can produce high amounts of BEA together with trichothecenes, and can represent a high potential mycotoxin risk in Italy for wheat colonized by this species. 3adurum wheat 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3apostharvest diseases 3asecondary metabolites 3aincidence 3aFusarium poae 3avirulence 3asequence analysis 3aseeds 3amicrobial detection 3aprovenance 3atrichothecenes 3aclimatic factors 3amolds (fungi) 3abiosynthesis 3atoxigenic strains 3afood pathogens 3agenetic variation 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aEdible Grainxmicrobiology. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDepsipeptidesxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aFood Contamination 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFusariumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Variation 2aLimit of Detection 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aMycotoxinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aPeptide Elongation Factor 1xchemistryxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aTranscriptional Elongation Factorsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aTrichothecenesxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aTriticumxmicrobiology 3aItaly 0aItaly 0abeauvericin 0amolecular sequence data 0aisolation 0aFusarium 0atoxin production1 aAlvarez, C.1 aRicci, V.1 aFerracane, L.1 aRitieni, A.1 aLogrieco, A.1 aMoretti, A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.729-7377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g9220575693Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400409035717883Available from publisher's Web site  a20100623b20100703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/06/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01756naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245004400162300001600206520080300222650002001025653002901045653002601074653002701100700001801127700001401145700001301159700001601172773010401188852000901292856008501301930003301386946001101419655001201430IND4428300620221121061831.0091106e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442830062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00292-009-1205-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarz, S. 10aSalivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma  ap. 472-477.  aMucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) represents the most common malignant salivary gland tumour.

The correct diagnosis relies on demonstration of classical MEC features, assisted by histochemical and immunohistochemical stains in equivocal cases. The current article aims to demonstrate, on the basis of own observations, how the detection of the MEC-typical t(11, 19) translocation may be of great value in difficult-to-classify cases.

W04426 (12 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 On the basis of long time series of climate and discharge in 108 nonhumid catchments in China this study analyzes the spatial and temporal variability of annual water-energy balance using the Budyko hypothesis. For both long-term means and annual values of the water balances in the 108 catchments, Fu's formula derived from the Budyko hypothesis is confirmed. A high correlation and relatively small systematic error between the values of parameter omega in Fu's equation optimized from the water balance of individual year and calibrated from the long-term mean water balance show that Fu's equation can be used for predicting the interannual variability of regional water balances. It has been found that besides the annual climate conditions the regional pattern of annual water-energy balance is also closely correlated with the relative infiltration capacity (K(s)/i(r)), relative soil water storage (S(max)/E0), and the average slope (tan beta). This enables one to estimate the parameter omega from catchment characteristics without calibration from the long time series of water balances. An empirical formula for the parameter omega in terms of the dimensionless landscape parameters is proposed. Applications of Fu's equation together with the parameter omega estimated by this empirical formula have shown that Fu's equation can predict both long-term mean and annual value of actual evapotranspiration accurately and predict both long-term mean and interannual variability of runoff reasonably. This implies that the Fu's equation can be used for predicting the annual water balance in ungauged basins. 3atemporal variation 3aoverland flow 3amathematical models 3aevapotranspiration 3aequations 3awatersheds 3aspatial variation 3aenergy balance 3arunoff 3aclimatic factors 3ahydrologic models 3aChina 0aslope 0aBudyko hypothesis 0awater balance1 aSun, F.1 aLiu, Z.1 aCong, Z.1 aNi, G.1 aLei, Z.0 tWater resources research.g2007 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.W04426 (12 p-W04426 (12 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/02  aOther US 7aarticle02749naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100001800232245013400250300001600384520081300400650001701213650001701230650002001247650002001267650002901287650002601316650002301342650002101365650002701386650001901413650005901432650003401491650002701525650003301552650002701585650002601612650004801638651001001686651001001696700002101706700001701727700001901744700001901763700001901782773007601801852000901877856010701886856008501993930003302078945002502111946001102136655001202147IND4439584720221121061648.0100708e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443958472DNAL7 a201750092pmid7 a10.1080/194400409035717702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Initially, unsound beans were found to account for 95% of contamination in a batch of coffee, whatever the methods used for post-harvest processing. It was also found that beans displaying traces of attacks by Colletotrichum kahawae were the greatest contributors to OTA contamination. In a second stage, the study compared the contamination of sound beans with that of beans attacked by Colletotrichum kahawae. On average, beans attacked by Colletotrichum kahawae had a statistically higher OTA content than sound beans (18.0 µg kg-1 as opposed to 1.2 µg kg-1). In addition, the average OTA content in unsound beans varied depending on growing conditions. 3acoffee beans 3aochratoxin A 3acrop production 3afood processing 3aplant cultural practices 3apostharvest treatment 3afood contamination 3afood composition 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aColletotrichum 2aCoffeexchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aColletotrichumxpathogenicity 2aFabaceaexmicrobiology 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aOchratoxinsxanalysis 2aPrunusxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 3aKenya 0aKenya1 aMburu, Joseph K.1 aDurand, Noel1 aClarke, Renata1 aFrank, John M.1 aGuyot, Bernard0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 June, v. 27, no. 6 p.836-8417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400409035717703Available from publisher's Web site  a20101115b20101204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03047naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245009300185300001400278520126000292650002001552650002501572650002901597650002901626650001301655650002601668650001901694650001001713650001801723650001601741650001901757650001901776650001401795650001701809650001201826650001501838650002101853650001401874650003801888650001101926653002101937653001801958653001101976653002301987653001302010700002502023700002302048700002102071700002502092700002202117700002402139773013202163852000902295856008502304930003302389946001102422655001202433IND4428297020221121061539.0091106e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442829702DNAL7 a191656142pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0613-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Robert K. 10aQuantifying structural physical habitat attributes using LIDAR and hyperspectral imagery  ap. 63-83.  aStructural physical habitat attributes include indices of stream size, channel gradient, substrate size, habitat complexity, and riparian vegetation cover and structure.

High-resolution remote sensing provides unique capabilities in detecting a variety of features and indicators of environmental health and condition. LIDAR is an airborne scanning laser system that provides data on topography, channel dimensions (width, depth), slope, channel complexity (residual pools, volume, morphometric complexity, hydraulic roughness), riparian vegetation (height and density), dimensions of riparian zone, anthropogenic alterations and disturbances, and channel and riparian interaction. Hyperspectral aerial imagery offers the advantage of high spectral and spatial resolution allowing for the detection and identification of riparian vegetation and natural and anthropogenic features at a resolution not possible with satellite imagery. When combined, or fused, these technologies comprise a powerful geospatial data set for assessing and monitoring lentic and lotic environmental characteristics and condition. 3adata collection 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental indicators 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahabitats 3ahyperspectral imagery 3alentic systems 3alidar 3alotic systems 3amorphometry 3aremote sensing 3ariparian areas 3aroughness 3aspatial data 3astreams 3atopography 3avegetation cover 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aLasers 0aPhysical habitat 0aHyperspectral 0aStream 0aChannel morphology 0aRiparian1 aWatkins, Russell L. 1 aHeggem, Daniel T. 1 aJones, K.

  1 aLeth, T.10aEstimated intake of benzoic and sorbic acids in Denmark  ap. 783-792.  a2019-12-05  aThe monitoring of food additives and recent dietary surveys carried out in Denmark have earlier been used to estimate the intake of sweeteners and nitrite in relation to acceptable daily intakes. The ubiquitous use of the preservatives benzoic and sorbic acids raises the question of the magnitude of the intake of these preservatives in relation to acceptable daily intakes. This area is explored in this paper. The content of benzoic and sorbic acids in all food groups, where they are allowed, was monitored in Denmark 17 times between 2001 and 2006 with a total of 1526 samples. Transgressions of maximum limits, illegal use or declaration faults were found in about 3% of samples. From repeated investigations on fat-based foods (salads and dressings), marmalade and stewed fruit, it is concluded that the amounts used in industry have been relatively stable throughout the whole period, although limited data for marmalade show some variation. Most foods in the categories soft drinks, dressings, fat-based salads, pickled herrings, and marmalade contain benzoic and sorbic acid, and sliced bread also contains in some cases sorbic acid. The median daily intake and intake distribution of benzoic and sorbic acids were calculated with data from the Danish National Survey of Dietary Habits and Physical Activity (age from 4 to 75 years) conducted in 2000-2004 with 5785 participants. The median intakes of both benzoic acid and sorbic acid are well below the acceptable daily intakes of 0-5 and 0-25 mg kg-1 body weight (bw) day-1 for benzoic and sorbic acid, respectively. However, the 90th percentile based on the average of the samples with a content of benzoic acid is higher than the acceptable daily intake for both men and women, with the highest value of 16 mg kg-1 bw day-1 for both boys and girls in the 4-6-year-old age group. Based on the average of all samples, the 95th percentile is over the acceptable daily intake for men up to 34 years and for women up to 24 years, and the 90th percentile for men up to 18 years and for women up to 10 years. Soft drinks, salads and dressings are the main contributors to benzoic acid intake. The sorbic acid intake based on the average of all samples is well below the acceptable daily intake. However, for the intake based on the average of samples with content, the 95th percentile exceeds the acceptable daily intake. This is caused by the dominating contribution to the intake of sorbic acid from sliced bread, but since only seven out of 42 samples have added sorbic acid, the calculation based on the average of samples with content will exaggerate the intake. With a built-in safety factor of 100 in the acceptable daily intakes and judging from the literature, the high intakes of benzoic acid should not cause any concern for ill-effects. However, there must be a reason to reconsider the maximum limits especially for benzoic acid in soft drinks, dressings and salads and for sorbic acid in sliced bread. 3afood labeling 3adietary exposure 3amarmalades 3afood composition 3afood additives 3agirls 3awomen 3aseafoods 3abreads 3abenzoic acid 3aherring 3asalad dressings 3amen 3asorbic acid 3afood safety 3apickled foods 3asalads 3agender differences 3asoft drinks 3aboys 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBenzoic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aBody Weight 2aDiet Records 2aDiet Surveys 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFood Additivesxmetabolism 2aFood Analysis 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSorbic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aYoung Adult 3aDenmark 0aDenmark 0afoods 0aacceptable daily intakes1 aChristensen, T.1 aLarsen, I.K.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 June, v. 27, no. 6 p.783-7927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400410035986063Available from publisher's Web site  a20101115b20101204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03028naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179072001700196100002300213245006600236300001300302500001500315520156200330650001701892650001701909650002101926650002601947650001501973650002801988650002802016650001502044650001102059650002302070650001002093650001802103651001002121653002002131653001702151700002202168700002402190700001902214700002002233773008202253852000902335856008502344930003302429945002502462946001102487655001202498IND4434776720221121040548.0100401e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443477672DNAL7 a10.1017/S17421705099902872doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In leaf-beet protected cultivation, weed control is one of the most important problems because of its fairly long crop cycle (approximately 4–5 months). The aim of this research was to set up an efficient non chemical weed control strategy performed with innovative machines built and set up by the University of Pisa. A two-year (2006–2007) ‘on-farm’ experimental trial was carried out in Crespina (PI). A conventional weed management technique (consisting of one pre-transplanting chemical treatment) was compared with an innovative physical weed control strategy in an organic production system (consisting of using a stale seedbed technique, in several post-emergence precision hoeing and in-row hand-weeding treatments). In the conventional technique, leaf-beet was manually transplanted, while it was sown with a precision pneumatic planter in the organic system. All innovative machines for physical weed control were adjusted and set up for the protected cultivation. Similar yields were recorded for the two systems in this two-year trial. Total labor time (for weed management and crop planting) was appreciably lower in the conventional system in the first year of the experiment (−67%), while in the second year, some improvement in the physical weed control techniques decreased labor needs with respect to the conventional technique (−40%). Weed dry biomass at harvest was significantly lower in the organic cropping system (on average −50%). 3aweed biology 3aplant growth 3aapplication rate 3agreenhouse production 3aherbicides 3amechanical weed control 3adry matter accumulation 3acrop yield 3ahoeing 3aorganic production 3abeets 3aBeta vulgaris 3aItaly 0acrop production 0ahand weeding1 aFontanelli, Marco1 aFrasconi, Christian1 aGinanni, Marco1 aPeruzzi, Andrea0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2010 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.8-157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17421705099902873Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02359naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010100164300001400265520122700279650001501506650001201521650001701533650002501550650001501575650002701590650001701617650003001634700001601664700001701680700001801697700001601715773011601731852000901847856008501856930003301941946001101974655001201985IND4428313420221121040625.0091106e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442831342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-009-0141-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Xiaoping 10aNo association between the polymorphisms in CDX2 coding regions and colorectal cancer in Chinese  ap. 27-30.  aCDX2 has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variants in CDX2 contributed to the development and progression of colorectal cancer in a Chinese population. We detected the polymorphisms in the CDX2 coding regions in 126 patients with colorectal cancer and matched tumor-free subjects by PCR-based DHPLC. The correlation between the genotypes and clinicopathological parameters among colorectal cancer cases was also investigated. Three SNPs were identified in the coding region of the CDX2 gene. Neither the genotype frequencies nor allele frequencies of CDX2 polymorphisms showed significant difference from those in healthy controls. There were also no significant association between genotypes and clinicopathological features. When we examined the linkage disequilibrium between three SNPs using expectation-maximization algorithm, we found that there is strong linkage disequilibrium among these SNPs, but no significant difference was found in haplotypes distribution. Our present data suggest that the CDX2 polymorphisms may not be used as a useful marker to predicate susceptibility of colorectal cancer in Chinese. 3aalgorithms 3aalleles 3abiochemistry 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahaplotypes 3alinkage disequilibrium 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction1 aXu, Enping 1 aQuan, Sheng 1 aHuang, Qiong 1 aLai, Maode 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2009 Nov., v. 331, no. 1-2 p.27-30dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-009-0141-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20091106b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03896naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245016600158300001800324520259500342650001302937650000902950650002502959650001502984650002402999650002003023650001103043650002203054650002003076650002003096650002203116653001703138653003103155700001703186773006903203852000903272856012203281930003303403945002503436946001303461655001203474IND4431579720221121040711.0100122s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443157972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aIrmak, S.10aOn the Dynamics of Stomatal Resistance: Relationships between Stomatal Behavior and Micrometeorological Variables and Performance of Jarvis-Type Parameterization  ap. 1923-1939.  aTwo Jarvis-type models, the original Jarvis model (J-model) and the Green and McNaughton model (GM-model), were evaluated for estimating leaf stomatal resistance (r(s)) for a non-stressed maize canopy. The parameters of the models were optimized, and their performances were compared against measured r(s). A new modified Jarvis-type model (NMJ-model) was developed by including a new term, r(s_min) exp(-LAI), where r(s_min) = minimum stomatal resistance (s m -1) and LAI = green leaf area index, to account for the influence of canopy development stage on r(s), especially during partial canopy. Through an extensive field campaign, hourly r(s), photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), air and leaf temperatures (T(a) and T(L)), porometer cup temperature (T(c)), air relative humidity above the canopy (RH(a)) and on the leaf surface (RH(L)), wind speed (u(3)) and direction at 3 m, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), LAI, and incoming shortwave radiation (r(s)) were measured for a subsurface drip-irrigated non-stressed maize canopy. The relationship between r(s) and T(a), T(L), T(c), RH(a), VPD, R(s), u(3), and wind direction are presented. On a seasonal average basis, the J-model and the NMJ-model had similar performance in estimating r(s) (r2 = 0.74, RMSD = 48.8 s m -1 for the J-model; and r2 = 0.74, RMSD = 50.1 s m -1 for the NMJ-model; RMSD = root mean square difference between modeled and measured r(s)). The inclusion of the variation in the LAI and r(s_min) term (r(s_min) exp(-LAI)) during the growing season in the NMJ-model improved the r(s) estimates, especially in the higher r(s) range (r(s) > 250 s m -1 ), as compared with the J-model. When the period for only partial canopy cover is considered, when LAI ranged from 1.20 to approximately 2.5, the addition of the LAI term in the NMJ-model resulted in 8% improvement in r2 and 10% improvement in RMSD relative to the J-model (r2 = 0.64, RMSD = 35.5 s m -1 for the NMJ-model; and r2 = 0.59, RMSD = 39.0 s m -1 for the J-model) when estimating r(s). The estimated r(s) using T(L) rather than T(a) correlated very well with the measured values, but with a slight decrease in performance for both the J-model and the NMJ-model. Overall, the performance of the J-model and the NMJ-model decreased by 17% when T(L) rather than T(a) was used to estimate r(s) as compared with the measured r(s). While the results demonstrated the superior performance of the NMJ-model over the J-model, especially during the partial canopy conditions, its performance needs further investigation and validation in other climatic settings. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3astomatal conductance 3aestimation 3amathematical models 3aleaf area index 3acanopy 3aplant development 3alight intensity 3aair temperature 3arelative humidity 0aJarvis model 0aGreen and McNaughton model1 aMutiibwa, D.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2009, v. 52, no. 6 p.1923-19397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=52&issue=6&conf=t&orgconf=t20093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100202b20100305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle02650naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245010200163300001800265500001500283520129700298650001901595650001701614650002601631650002301657650001201680650001301692650001401705650002101719650001301740650001301753650002001766650003201786653001601818653003101834700001801865700001801883700001501901773007901916852000901995856010702004930003302111945002502144946001102169655001202180IND4444488920221121040418.0101102e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444448892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Due to the large dosages of calcium required for the maintenance of dialysis patients, this study investigated whether the source of calcium chosen for supplementation, including the form of administration (i.e. chewable forms or capsules), has an influence on the total amount of strontium and aluminium ingested daily. A convenience sample of various calcium supplement tablets and antacids was acquired, and strontium and aluminium quantification was performed by wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The use of readily available oyster shell-based calcium was found potentially to increase the total amount of ingested strontium substantially with concentrations reaching (2.26 ± 0.05) (mg Sr)·(g Ca)-1, while the use of antacids or chewable supplements was found to contain concentrations reaching as high as (1.2 ± 0.3) (mg Al)·(g Ca)-1 in the supplements analysed within this work. It is recommended that the choice of calcium supplement prescribed to individuals undergoing haemodialysis be closely regulated and noted as a possible factor in the prevalence of bone disorders reported in these patients. 3ahuman diseases 3ahemodialysis 3aquantitative analysis 3aat-risk population 3acalcium 3aantacids 3astrontium 3adietary exposure 3aaluminum 3apatients 3amineral content 3adietary mineral supplements 0arisk groups 0aoyster shell based calcium1 aJakubovic, R.1 aPejovic-Milic1 aHeyd, D.V.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Oct., v. 27, no. 10 p.1405-14147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aINDd7CTe2011/01/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03108naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001600195245008100211300001800292500001500310520156900325650002301894650002201917650002401939650002501963650003401988650001902022650002102041650001502062650002102077650002102098650002002119650002302139650001402162650002502176650001502201651001302216653002302229700001902252700001802271700001302289773007902302852000902381856010702390930003302497945002502530946001102555655001202566IND4444490620221121040407.0101102e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444449062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The approach combined data of migrant concentration in the foods resulting from a stochastic simulation with consumption data of food packaged in paperboard. The results from the exposure model were validated with experimental values actually found in the food. A short surveillance exercise was conducted with samples collection from market shelves to identify and quantify the phthalates present in both the packages and the food. The distribution of values for the di-butyl phthalate concentration in the packages was used as the input of the initial concentration in the Weibull model to estimate the concentration of this phthalate in the foods. This distribution of occurrence data was then combined with the packaging usage data in a probabilistic simulation with a Monte Carlo sampling method. Exposure values ranged between zero and 8.95 µg day-1 kgbw, a value close to the tolerable daily intake established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)-10 µg day-1 kgbw. However, the 97.5th percentile and the average were 1.82 and 0.44 day-1 kgbw, respectively, indicating that further refinement of the estimates is not necessary. Other phthalates were also detected in the packaging samples: di-isobutyl phthalate and di-ethylhexyl phthalate. The latter was present in all packaging samples collected and was detected in a few food samples at values requiring further investigation. 3aMonte Carlo method 3asimulation models 3apackaging materials 3astochastic processes 3apackaging materials migration 3afood packaging 3amodel validation 3aphthalates 3adietary exposure 3afood composition 3ahuman nutrition 3aWeibull statistics 3adetection 3aprobabilistic models 3apaperboard 3aPortugal 0afood contamination1 aOliveira, J.C.1 aPereira, J.R.1 aHogg, T.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Oct., v. 27, no. 10 p.1451-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aINDd7CTe2011/01/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03006naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001200161245019800173300001800371500001500389520139900404650002801803650001801831650001701849650002301866650001301889650002401902650003801926650002601964650001501990650002102005650001902026650001302045651001002058653002402068700001402092700001202106700001402118700001402132700001402146700001402160700001302174700001302187773007902200852000902279856010702288930003302395945002502428946001102453655001202464IND4445421520221121040626.0101123e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444542152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTao, J.10aDevelopment of competitive indirect ELISA for the detection of tetrodotoxin and a survey of the distribution of tetrodotoxin in the tissues of wild puffer fish in the waters of south-east China  ap. 1589-1597.  a2019-12-05  aA monoclonal antibody against tetrodotoxin (TTX) was produced from the hybridoma cell line T6D9, which was established by the fusion of Sp2/0 myeloma cells with spleen cells isolated from a Balb/c mouse immunized with the TTX-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate. This monoclonal antibody belongs to the IgG1 subclass; the affinity constant of the antibody is 2.4 x 10(-8) mol l-1. The relative cross-reactivity of the antibody with TTX was 100%, but with saxitoxin, KLH and bovine serum albumin (BSA) it was less than 1%, respectively. The titre of the antibody in ascites was 6.4 x 10(6); the reference working concentration was 1:1.2 x 10(5). By using this monoclonal antibody, a competitive indirect enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA) for the analysis of TTX was developed. The linear portion of the dose-response curve of TTX concentration was in range 5-500 ng ml-1. The limit of detection was 5 ng ml-1 according 10% inhibition with TTX to anti-TTX monoclonal antibody. The concentration of TTX inhibiting 50% of antibody binding was about 50 ng ml-1. The recoveries from TTX spiked samples were 79.5-109.5%. In addition, the toxicity of some wild puffer fish specimens captured from south-east China and the Yangzi River in Jiangsu province was determined. The results indicate that the toxicity and toxin tissue distribution vary in different species of wild puffer fish. 3ainterspecific variation 3afood analysis 3atetrodotoxin 3afood contamination 3aseafoods 3atissue distribution 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amonoclonal antibodies 3awild foods 3afood composition 3aTetraodontidae 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aspecies differences1 aWei, W.J.1 aNan, L.1 aLei, L.H.1 aHui, H.C.1 aFen, G.X.1 aJun, L.Y.1 aJing, Z.1 aRong, J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Nov., v. 27, no. 11 p.1589-15977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aINDd7CTe2011/01/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03448naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001900161245016200180300001800342500001500360520178000375650002002155650001802175650001602193650002302209650002102232650002102253650001902274650002102293650002002314650002002334650001202354651001102366651001002377651001302387651001002400653000902410653002502419653001702444653002402461653003502485700001802520700001702538700001602555700001802571700001702589773007902606852000902685856010702694930003302801945002502834946001102859655001202870IND4444487820221121015606.0101102e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444448782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Monthly European Union market baskets of commercial baby foods were designed for the first 9 months of life by the 'babyfood' study group of the CASCADE Network of Excellence for the specific purpose of assessing exposure to potentially toxic substances in infants fed with such foods. The present paper reports the different steps that led to the preparation of monthly pooled samples of commercial baby foods ('Infant formulae and follow-on formulae' and 'Other baby foods') that may constitute the extreme case of the diet for an infant who would not be breast fed at all. Several market baskets were generated for an 'average European Union infant' and for infants of four selected countries (Italy, Sweden, Spain, and the Slovakia), fed with either milk infant formulae, soy infant formulae or hypoallergenic infant formulae and weaned (at the fifth month) with commercial baby foods and beverages available on the European Union market. Market share data for 2007 for baby foods were used to design the baskets. Holding companies and the name of all their products were identified. Monthly diets for European Union infants were elaborated in terms of food categories (e.g. infant cereals) of typologies of products (e.g. infant cereals without gluten) and of a specific product. The number of baskets generated was 30 for 'Infant formulae and follow-on formulae' (including 62 products) and 13 for 'Other baby foods' (including 35 products). These market baskets were designed to be used for the determination of certain contaminants and nutrients in the diet of European Union infants and for the assessment of their effects on infant health. 3anutrient intake 3aweaning foods 3afood groups 3afood contamination 3adietary exposure 3ainfant nutrition 3aEuropean Union 3afood composition 3ainfant formulas 3adietary surveys 3ainfants 3aSweden 3aItaly 3aSlovakia 3aSpain 0adiet 0amilk infant formulas 0ainfant foods 0asoy infant formulas 0ahypoallergenic infant formulas1 aPandelova, M.1 aLe Donne, C.1 aFerrari, M.1 aSchramm, K.W.1 aLeclercq, C.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Oct., v. 27, no. 10 p.1337-13517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aINDd7CTe2011/01/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03168naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001800196245011800214300001600332520180900348650001802157650001702175650002102192650001702213650001602230650001602246650003002262650001702292650001402309650001502323650001202338650002002350650002002370650001702390653002402407700001902431773008502450852000902535856008502544930003302629945002502662946001102687655001202698IND4444207920221121015618.0101028e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444420792DNAL7 a10.1017/S17421705100002812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLindh, Helena10aCommunicating imperceptible product attributes through traceability: A case study in an organic food supply chain  ap. 263-271.  aCompanies in the food industry are driven to improve their traceability for several reasons. The primary reasons are food safety and quality. Another is the response to the increased interest among consumers in imperceptible product attributes such as organic, fair trade, dolphin-safe and non genetically modified (non-GMO). Such attributes are hard to distinguish and thus require generally enhanced traceability in order to verify their existence. This has led to an emergent area in which actors engage in gaining and maintaining traceability and communicating it to the consumers. This paper describes the relations between the actors in a supply chain (SC) in the field of organic food systems. It examines the objectives each actor has for gaining and maintaining traceability throughout the SC. The focus on organic relates to the challenge for the companies to ensure this imperceptible product attribute throughout the entire food system. A single case study was conducted in an organic food system providing organic ice cream products. The data collection included semi-structured interviews, observations, a review of internal documents and a survey among the participating companies. The findings illustrate and elaborate on the objectives companies have for engaging in traceability. The objectives identified are divided into three categories: food safety and quality, managing the SC and internal resources and communication with consumers. The survey confirms the results from the interviews that all actors want to engage in traceability. They prioritize the objectives differently, however. The study highlights the value of close relations between the actors when addressing consumer concerns regarding product and process characteristics, such as the imperceptible organic attribute. 3aorganic foods 3asupply chain 3ahuman food chain 3atraceability 3afood safety 3aecolabeling 3ainformation dissemination 3acase studies 3aice cream 3ainterviews 3asurveys 3afood production 3afood processing 3afood quality 0asupply chain actors1 aOlsson, Annika0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2010 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.263-2717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17421705100002813Available from publisher's Web site  a20110210b20110305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03733naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125024001900146040001800165072001700183072001700200100001900217245014000236300001800376506007600394520169600470506003702166650002502203650002202228650002002250650001502270650002002285650001802305650002602323650001702349650002102366650002402387650002202411650001502433650002902448650002302477650002202500650002502522650001802547650001502565650001702580653001202597653002602609653002502635655002202660700001502682700001602697700001902713700002002732700001802752700001202770773014202782852000902924856006702933930003303000945002503033946001303058655001203071IND4381993520221207124318.0060717e20050201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438199352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.04092331022doi7 aPMC5450872pmcid7 a156650942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing the entire biosynthetic pathway for the tyrosine-derived cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin as accomplished by insertion of CYP79A1, CYP71E1, and UGT85B1 from Sorghum bicolor were shown to accumulate 4% dry-weight dhurrin with marginal inadvertent effects on plant morphology, free amino acid pools, transcriptome, and metabolome. In a similar manner, plants expressing only CYP79A1 accumulated 3% dry weight of the tyrosine-derived glucosinolate, p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate with no morphological pleitropic effects. In contrast, insertion of CYP79A1 plus CYP71E1 resulted in stunted plants, transcriptome alterations, accumulation of numerous glucosides derived from detoxification of intermediates in the dhurrin pathway, and in loss of the brassicaceae-specific UV protectants sinapoyl glucose and sinapoyl malate and kaempferol glucosides. The accumulation of glucosides in the plants expressing CYP79A1 and CYP71E1 was not accompanied by induction of glycosyltransferases, demonstrating that plants are constantly prepared to detoxify xenobiotics. The pleiotrophic effects observed in plants expressing sorghum CYP79A1 and CYP71E1 were complemented by retransformation with S. bicolor UGT85B. These results demonstrate that insertion of high-flux pathways directing synthesis and intracellular storage of high amounts of a cyanogenic glucoside or a glucosinolate is achievable in transgenic A. thaliana plants with marginal inadvertent effects on the transcriptome and metabolome.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 3atransgenes 3aSorghum bicolor 3agrain sorghum 3acyanogenic glycosides 3abiosynthesis 3acytochrome P-450 3ahexosyltransferases 3acomplementary DNA 3aglucosides 3ametabolic detoxification 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant development 3aabnormal development 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 0adhurrin 0acyanogenic glucosides 0aglucosyltransferases 7aInternet resource1 aMorant, M.1 aOlsen, C.E.1 aEkstrøm, C.T.1 aGalbraith, D.W.1 aMøller, B.L.1 aBak, S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2005 Feb. 1, v. 102, no. 5 p.1779-1784x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.04092331023electronic resource  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/09  aOther US 7aarticle03207naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125024001900146040001800165072001700183072001700200072001700217072001700234100001700251245006100268300001800329506007600347520140900423506003701832650001801869650002801887650002201915650002501937650002501962650001101987650002801998650002102026650002202047650001202069650001902081653003702100653003402137653002802171655002202199700001502221700002402236700001702260700001602277700001802293700001702311773014202328852000902470856006702479930003302546945002502579946001302604655001202617IND4381992020221207124328.0060717e20050201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438199202DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.04051831012doi7 aPMC5478182pmcid7 a156651072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We identify a unique population of nutrient amino acid transporters (NATs) within the sodium-neurotransmitter symporter family and have characterized a member of the NAT subfamily from the larval midgut of the Yellow Fever vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti (aeAAT1, AAR08269, which primarily supplies phenylalanine, an essential substrate for the synthesis of neuronal and cuticular catecholamines. Further analysis suggests that NATs constitute a comprehensive transport metabolon for the epithelial uptake and redistribution of essential amino acids including precursors of several neurotransmitters. In contrast to the highly conserved subfamily of orthologous neurotransmitter transporters, lineage-specific, paralogous NATs undergo rapid gene multiplication/substitution that enables a high degree of evolutionary plasticity of nutrient amino acid uptake mechanisms and facilitates environmental and nutrient adaptations of organisms. These findings provide a unique model for understanding the molecular mechanisms, physiology, and evolution of amino acid and neurotransmitter transport systems and imply that monoamine and GABA transporters evolved by selection and conservation of earlier neuronal NATs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aamino acid transporters 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3amidgut 3aphysiological transport 3afree amino acids 3aelectrophysiology 3aoocytes 3aXenopus laevis 0anutrient amino acid transporters 0aneurotransmitter transporters 0amolecular sequence data 7aInternet resource1 aKohn, A.B.1 aMeleshkevitch, E.A.1 aDasher, M.K.1 aSeron, T.J.1 aStevens, B.R.1 aHarvey, W.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2005 Feb. 1, v. 102, no. 5 p.1360-1365x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.04051831013electronic resource  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/09  aOther US 7aarticle03325naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201072001700218100001600235245012100251300001800372506007600390520144500466506003701911650002201948650002201970650002601992650001502018650002002033650002202053650002302075650003102098650001502129650002102144650002502165650001802190653001702208653002002225655002202245700001802267700001802285700001602303700001302319700001102332700002302343700001902366700001902385700001702404773014302421852000902564856006702573930003302640945002502673946001302698655001202711IND4383247120221207124328.0060831e20060606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438324712DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06030431032doi7 aPMC14826592pmcid7 a167207002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Several tumor-associated antigens in tumor cells have been identified as targets for therapeutic mAbs. Here we describe the production of mAb BR55-2 (IgG2a) in transgenic plants that recognizes the nonprotein tumor-associated antigen Lewis Y oligosaccharide overexpressed in human carcinomas, particularly breast and colorectal cancers. Heavy and light chains of mAb BR55-2 were expressed separately and assembled in plant cells of low-alkaloid tobacco transgenic plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. LAMD609). Expression levels of plant-derived mAb (mAbP) were high (30 mg/kg of fresh leaves) in T1 generation plants. Like the mammalian-derived mAbM, the plant mAbP bound specifically to both SK-BR3 breast cancer cells and SW948 colorectal cancer cells. The Fc domain of both mAbP and mAbM showed the similar binding to FcγRI receptor (CD64). Comparable levels of cytotoxicity against SK-BR3 cells were also shown for both mAbs in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay. Furthermore, plant-derived BR55-2 efficiently inhibited SW948 tumor growth xenografted in nude mice. Altogether, these findings suggest that mAbP originating from low-alkaloid tobacco exhibit biological activities suitable for efficient immunotherapy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atransgenic plants 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amonoclonal antibodies 3atransgenes 3agene expression 3aneoplasm antigens 3abiopharmaceuticals 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3acell lines 3abreast neoplasms 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aimmunotherapy 0aplantibodies 0aLewis Y antigen 7aInternet resource1 aGlogowska, M.1 aBandurska, K.1 aOkulicz, M.1 aDeka, D.1 aKo, K.1 aLinden, J. van der1 aLeusen, J.H.W.1 aPogrebnyak, N.1 aGolovkin, M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2006 June 6, v. 103, no. 23 p.8804-8809x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06030431033electronic resource  a20070321b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/20  aOther US 7aarticle03180naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245018400179300001800363500001500381520153600396650001501932650002301947650002401970650001801994650002102012650003402033650001902067650001602086650001502102650001602117650002102133650002602154650002302180651001602203651001002219653002302229653001702252653001002269700001702279700001902296700001802315700001602333700001302349773007902362852000902441856010702450930003302557945002502590946001102615655001202626IND4447313520221120215741.0110108e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444731352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLorenzini, R.10aSaturated and aromatic mineral oil hydrocarbons from paperboard food packaging: estimation of long-term migration from contents in the paperboard and data on boxes from the market  ap. 1765-1774.  a2019-12-05  aIn the absence of a functional barrier, mineral oil hydrocarbons from printing inks and recycled fibres tend to migrate from paper-based food-packaging materials through the gas phase into dry food. Concentrations easily far exceed the limit derived from the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Since the estimation of long-term migration into the food by testing at 40°C for 10 days is difficult, it seems preferable (and easier) to use the mineral oil content in the paperboard. Evaporation experiments showed that hydrocarbons eluted up to about n-C24 are sufficiently volatile for relevant migration into dry food: in worst-case situations, about 80% migrate into the packed food. The extraction of the paperboard was optimised to give good recovery of the relevant hydrocarbons, but to discriminate against those of high molecular mass which tend to disturb gas chromatographic analysis in on-line coupled normal phase HPLC-GC-FID. Even though some of the relevant hydrocarbons had already evaporated, the average concentration of < C24 mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH) in the paperboard boxes of 102 products from the Swiss and Italian market was 626 mg kg-1. Nearly 15% of investigated boxes still contained more than 1000 mg kg-1 < C24 MOSH up to over 3000 mg kg-1 (maximum = 3500 mg kg-1). This amount of MOSH in the board have the potential of contaminating the packed food at a level exceeding the limit, derived from the JECFA ADI, hundreds of times. 3aestimation 3avolatile compounds 3apackaging materials 3afood analysis 3amolecular weight 3apackaging materials migration 3afood packaging 3amineral oil 3apaperboard 3aevaporation 3afood composition 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3achemical structure 3aSwitzerland 3aItaly 0afood contamination 0ahydrocarbons 0aboxes1 aFiselier, K.1 aBiedermann, M.1 aBarbanera, M.1 aBraschi, I.1 aGrob, K.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.1765-17747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110404b20110507c00000000  aINDd7CTe2011/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03316naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245012100158300001800279500001500297520198700312650001502299650001402314650002302328650001802351650003002369650001202399650002302411650001702434651001902451653002402470653001602494653002002510700001902530700001502549700001402564700001602578773007902594852000902673856010702682930003302789945002502822946001102847655001202858IND4447313220221120215647.0110108e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444731322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHeres, L.10aTracing and analytical results of the dioxin contamination incident in 2008 originating from the Republic of Ireland  ap. 1733-1744.  a2019-12-05  aHigh levels of dioxins (PCDD/Fs) in pork were discovered in France and the Netherlands at the end of 2008. The contamination was rapidly traced back to a feed stock in the Republic of Ireland (RoI). Burning oil, used for the drying of bakery waste, appeared to be contaminated with PCBs. Consequently, very high levels up to 500 pg TEQ g-1 fat were found in pork. The congener pattern clearly pointed to PCB-oil as a source, but the ratio between the non-dioxin-like indicator PCBs (PCBs 28, 52, 101, 138, 152 and 180) and PCDD/Fs was much lower than observed during the Belgian incident, thereby limiting the suitability of indicator PCBs as a marker for the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. This paper describes the tracking and tracing of the incident, the public-private cooperation, the surveillance activities and its results. A major lesson to be learned from this incident is the importance of good private food safety systems. In this incident, it was the private surveillance systems that identified the origin of contamination within 10 days after the first signal of increased dioxin levels in a product. On the other hand, retrospective analyses showed that signals were missed that could have led to an earlier detection of the incident and the source. Above all, the incident would not have occurred when food safety assurance systems had been effectively implemented in the involved feed chain. It is discussed that besides primary responsibility for effective private food safety systems, the competent authorities have to supervise whether the food safety procedures are capable of coping with these kinds of complex food safety issues, while private food companies need to implement the law, and public authorities should supervise and enforce them. Finally, it is discussed whether the health risks derived from consumption of the contaminated batches of meat may have been underestimated during the incident due to the unusually high intake of dioxins. 3amonitoring 3adetection 3afood contamination 3afood industry 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3adioxins 3afeed contamination 3atraceability 3aIrish Republic 0afood safety systems 0afood safety 0aquality control1 aHoogenboom, R.1 aHerbes, R.1 aTraag, W.1 aUrlings, B.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.1733-17447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110404b20110507c00000000  aINDd7CTe2011/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03132naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245008900177300001300266500005600279500001500335520176700350650001402117650001602131650001502147650002302162650002202185650002102207650002702228650002502255650003002280650001802310650002002328650002102348653001102369653004802380655002702428700002402455773007802479852000902557930003302566945002502599946001302624961001302637655001202650IND4402951320221120224216.0080319s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440295132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBauer, P.J.12aA comparison of transgenic and conventional cutlivars: (Part 1) yield, HVI, and AFIS  ap. 2944.  aConference held January 5-9, 2004, San Antonio, TX.  a2019-12-06  aConcerns have been raised about the effect of transgenic technology on cotton fiber quality. Our objective was to compare transgenic cultivars to their recurrent parents for yield and fiber properties. Cotton was planted at three planting dates (mid-April, early May, and mid-May) in 2000 and 2001 at Clemson University's Pee Dee Research and Education Center near Florence SC. Cultivars grown in the experiment were DPL 458, DPL 655, DPL 5415, and DPL 5690. DPL 458 and DPL 655 are transgenic cultivars that have genes for insect resistance (Bt) and Round-Up (glyphosate) herbicide resistance. The other two are conventional varieties. There was no difference in yield between the transgenic and conventional cultivars at any planting date in either year. The conventional cultivars had 0.5% higher lint percent than the transgenic cultivars (averaged over both years and all planting dates). For HVI fiber properties, the conventional cultivars had higher micronaire than the transgenic cultivars at the mid-April and mid-May planting dates in 2000, but cultivars did not differ for micronaire at the early-May planting date in 2000 or at any planting date in 2001. Averaged over years and planting dates, the transgenic cultivars had significantly higher fiber length (0.01 in) and fiber strength (0.2 gm/tex) but lower fiber length uniformity (0.2%) than the conventional cultivars. Cultivars types did not differ for HVI Rd or +b. There were no substantial differences between the transgenic and conventional cultivars for AFIS fiber quality measurements made on the raw cotton fiber and on slivers collected during carding and drawing. In summary, we found little difference between the transgenic and conventional cultivars for yield and fiber properties. 3acultivars 3alint cotton 3atransgenes 3aGossypium hirsutum 3atransgenic plants 3adelta-endotoxins 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aherbicide resistance 3aalkyl (aryl) transferases 3afiber quality 3apest resistance 3abacterial toxins 0acotton 0a5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase 7aconference publication1 aMcAlister, D.D.

The defect appears as a surface roughness that occurs primarily on the shoulder area of the fruit. The fruit appearance is damaged and storability is severely compromised. Microscopic inspection reveals that the surface roughness consists of many microscopic cracks that occur in parallel lines. Our objectives were to describe this defect and evaluate the role of weather conditions and fruit surface moisture in inducing it. Field experiments were conducted in 2001 and 2002 in Southwest Michigan, using the industry standard cultivar Mountain Spring and recommended practices for irrigated, staked fresh market production. The effects of fruit surface wetness and nutrition on quality were evaluated by comparing responses to a plastic rain shelter; Surround WP kaolin spray (to enhance surface wetness); a foliar spray of calcium (Ca at 2 g.L(-1)), boron (B at 300 mg.L(-1)), Ca plus B, water alone; and no treatment. A complementary greenhouse experiment investigated the effects of low and high rates of foliar sprays. A very consistent association was found between defect incidence and precipitation events that followed periods of hot, dry weather during rapid fruit expansion. Fruit quality was highest and incidence of defects least in fruit produced under plastic rain covers, with an average marketable yield of 62,270 vs. 44,340 kg.ha(-1) for the control. A 28% reduction in defects was consistently associated with Ca + B sprays across harvests and years. In contrast, 18% more fruit had shoulder check defect with kaolin spray, a consistent increase in defect across years compared to control fruit. Greenhouse and field studies gave markedly similar results, except for a water spray control. Incidence of defect was consistently low with the highest rate of B foliar spray. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aboron 3acalcium 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3afoliar spraying 3afresh market 3afruit quality 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aindustry 3airrigation 3akaolin 3anutritive value 3aplastics 3arain 3astorage quality 3asurface roughness 3atomatoes 3aMichigan1 aSnapp, S.S.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2004 July, v. 129, no. 4 p.599-607dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245016200178300001600340520181700356650001502173650001902188650001402207650002402221653001802245653001702263653002102280653001602301653001302317653001202330700002602342700002502368700002102393700002102414700002402435700002202459700002002481700001802501700003002519700002002549700002502569700002302594700001702617700002002634700002202654700002102676700002002697700001902717700002102736700002302757700002602780700002602806700001902832773010502851852000902956856009202965930003303057946001303090655001203103IND4395536520221120194514.0070930e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439553652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00093.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWade, Paulq(Paul R.)10aKiller whales and marine mammal trends in the north pacific--a re-examination of evidence for sequential megafauna collapse and the prey-switching hypothesis  ap. 766-802.  aSpringer et al. (2003) contend that sequential declines occurred in North Pacific populations of harbor and fur seals, Steller sea lions, and sea otters. They hypothesize that these were due to increased predation by killer whales, when industrial whaling's removal of large whales as a supposed primary food source precipitated a prey switch. Using a regional approach, we reexamined whale catch data, killer whale predation observations, and the current biomass and trends of potential prey, and found little support for the prey-switching hypothesis. Large whale biomass in the Bering Sea did not decline as much as suggested by Springer et al., and much of the reduction occurred 50-100 yr ago, well before the declines of pinnipeds and sea otters began; thus, the need to switch prey starting in the 1970s is doubtful. With the sole exception that the sea otter decline followed the decline of pinnipeds, the reported declines were not in fact sequential. Given this, it is unlikely that a sequential megafaunal collapse from whales to sea otters occurred. The spatial and temporal patterns of pinniped and sea otter population trends are more complex than Springer et al. suggest, and are often inconsistent with their hypothesis. Populations remained stable or increased in many areas, despite extensive historical whaling and high killer whale abundance. Furthermore, observed killer whale predation has largely involved pinnipeds and small cetaceans; there is little evidence that large whales were ever a major prey item in high latitudes. Small cetaceans (ignored by Springer et al.) were likely abundant throughout the period. Overall, we suggest that the Springer et al. hypothesis represents a misleading and simplistic view of events and trophic relationships within this complex marine ecosystem. 3aecosystems 3aEnhydra lutris 3apredation 3apopulation dynamics 0aNorth Pacific 0akiller whale 0aSteller sea lion 0aharbor seal 0afur seal 0awhaling1 aBurkanov, Vladimir N.1 aDahlheim, Marilyn E.1 aFriday, Nancy A.1 aFritz, Lowell W.1 aLoughlin, Thomas R.1 aMizroch, Sally A.1 aMuto, Marcia M.1 aRice, Dale W.1 aBarrett-Lennard, Lance G.1 aBlack, Nancy A.1 aBurdin, Alexander M.1 aCalambokidis, John1 aCerchio, Sal1 aFord, John K.B.1 aJacobsen, Jeff K.1 aMatkin, Craig O.1 aMatkin, Dena R.1 aMehta, Amee V.1 aSmall, Robert J.1 aStraley, Janice M.1 aMcCluskey, Shannon M.1 aVanBlaricom, Glenn R.1 aClapham, Phil.0 tMarine mammal science.g2007 Oct., v. 23, no. 4 p.766-802dBlackwell Publishing Incx0824-04697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00093.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02747naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245005700161300001300218500005600231500001500287520174700302650002402049650001902073650001602092650002102108650002202129650001302151653001102164655002702175773007802202852000902280930003302289945002502322946001302347961001302360655001202373IND4402950420221120194552.0080319s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440295042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRobert, K.Q.10aRoadmap to evaluation of cotton's processing quality  ap. 2716.  aConference held January 5-9, 2004, San Antonio, TX.  a2019-12-06  aThis purpose of this work is to lay down a technical research strategy by which the utility value of cotton as a raw material for textile processing can be defined and predicted from measured fiber properties. From the time a cotton is harvested, a series of opening and cleaning mechanisms are applied, both before and after ginning. This sequence is continued in the textile mill as the crucial aspect of the opening-cleaning, blending, and alignment of fibers which constitutes preparation for spinning. Opening and cleaning principles and machinery employed in the gin and mill are sufficiently similar to allow for a unified description of the cotton cleaning process. The governing principle is that to be cleaned to a given degree of fineness of foreign matter, the cotton must be opened to that level of fineness. In the present work, a mathematical framework is proposed for describing cotton cleanability as a trade-off between the reduction of foreign matter on the one hand, and the amount of mechanical damage which on the other hand must necessarily be inflicted upon the cotton to achieve that level of opening. If indices of cleaning and damage are appropriately defined, then cleaning is modeled mathematically as an algebraic extinction process, while damage can be viewed as a saturation process. Most importantly, the trade-off between cleaning and damage can be shown to have certain systematic features which can be utilized to characterize the processability of a cotton and to predict optimum processing strategies. A significant feature of this analysis is that it demonstrates how a cotton bale's processing (ginning and mill preparation) history influences its performance in downstream operations such as spinning. 3amathematical models 3acotton ginning 3alint cotton 3acotton gin trash 3amechanical damage 3acleaning 0acotton 7aconference publication0 tProceedings of the Beltwide Cotton Conferences.g2004,  p.2716-27167nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01967naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009200169300001600261520102100277653002101298653002301319653001301342653001201355653002401367700002201391773010501413852000901518856009201527930003301619946001301652655001201665IND4392460220221120194645.0070617e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439246022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-7692.2007.00130.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBan, Stephen10aQuantification of terrestrial haul-out and rookery characteristics of steller sea lions  ap. 496-507.  aSteller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) are known to have occupied the same terrestrial haul-out and rookery sites across the North Pacific Rim for centuries, but it is not known why they choose and stay at these locations, or what defines their preferred habitat. Classifying and comparing the shoreline type of haul-outs and rookeries against sites not used by Steller sea lions showed that they preferentially locate their haul-outs and rookeries on exposed rocky shorelines and wave-cut platforms. However, no preference was found for selecting rookeries on sheltered shore types. Shoreline types used less frequently by sea lions included fine-to-medium-grained sand beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, gravel beaches, and sheltered rocky shores. Quantifying the shoreline types used by sea lions confirms anecdotal reports of habitat preferences and may prove useful in identifying and protecting sea lion terrestrial habitat, or in forecasting how climate change might affect the distribution of sea lions. 0aSteller sea lion 0aEumetopias jubatus 0ahaul-out 0arookery 0aterrestrial habitat1 aTrites, Andrew W.0 tMarine mammal science.g2007 July, v. 23, no. 3 p.496-507dBlackwell Publishing Incx0824-04697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2007.00130.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070617b20070702c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03187naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167100002000184245012400204300001800328520132800346650002101674650001601695650001801711650002101729650002301750650002601773650002201799650001801821650002001839650001701859650002101876650001601897650001001913650005001923650002801973650002802001650001102029650002302040650002302063650005702086650003802143653005102181700002002232700001702252773007902269852000902348856010702357856008802464930003302552945002502585946001102610655001202621IND4443033520221120194650.0100928e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444303352DNAL7 a205211902pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2010.4882522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTkacikova, Sona10aLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry determination of maduramycin residues in the tissues of broiler chickens  ap. 1226-1232.  aMaduramycin is a polyether ionophoric coccidiostat used to prevent coccidiosis in poultry at a prescribed concentration over a certain time interval. Due to public health concerns about the presence of coccidiostat residues in poultry, the aim of the present study was to determine the level of maduramycin residues in the tissues of broiler chickens fed commercially produced feed containing 5 mg kg-1 of maduramycin in complete feed throughout the 5-day withdrawal period (WP). The residues were investigated by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with electrospray ionisation (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method were 0.3 and 0.8 µg kg-1, respectively. The average recovery based on matrix-fortified calibrations for chicken tissues was 90%. Maduramycin was found to be rapidly distributed in all tissues. The highest concentrations of maduramycin residues were found in the heart followed by the skin, liver, gizzard, kidneys and, finally, muscle (thigh and breast). On day 5 of the WP, residue concentrations of maduramycin did not decline below the LOQ of the method. Our results emphasize the need to establish a maximum residue limit (MRL) for maduramycin to control its residue levels in edible tissues from chickens before slaughter. 3abroiler chickens 3amaduramicin 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3afood contamination 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3adrug residues 3atissue analysis 3achicken meat 3aveterinary drugs 2aCalibration 2aChild 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aCoccidiostatsxanalysis 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aHumans 2aLactonesxanalysis 2aLimit of Detection 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 0aliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry1 aKozarova, Ivona1 aMate, Dionyz0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Sept., v. 27, no. 9 p.1226-12327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2010.4882523Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02519naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012600161300001600287520162700303650002001930653001601950653001401966653001601980773010701996852000902103856008502112930003302197946001102230655001202241IND4444351620221120194522.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444435162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-010-9529-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEfe, S.

A total of 100 sterilized rain gauges were randomly distributed on the basis of 50 each to the eastern and western division of the oil company operating in the region. The rainwater samples harvested through this process were transferred into sterilized plastic containers and kept in coolers and taken immediately to the laboratory for analysis soon after every rain event. The rainwater samples were analysed in the laboratory with the most appropriate techniques. The physicochemical characteristics of rainwater harvested were subjected to paired t test and 3-year moving average statistical analysis. The following are the results: There is widespread acid rain in the region, this is evident from pH values that span 4.98-5.15 and 5.06 mean values. The result also revealed that acid rain (pH) varied significantly (P > 0.05), and it decreases with increasing distance from gas flare sites throughout the period of study. Other physicochemical characteristics of rainwater resources conform to safe limit with the exception of turbidity, TSS, Pb and NO₃, which is also significant at P > 0.05 with increasing distance from the gas flare sites, as such they decreases with increasing distance. This certainly has serious environmental effects on the human and other species, soil, water and vegetation resources and calls for the extinction of gas flaring, in this region. Sources of water that are acidified should be periodically limed to reduce the acid concentration in such water. 3aacid deposition 0aHeavy metal 0aGas flare 0aNiger Delta0 tNatural hazards.g2010 Nov., v. 55, no. 2 p.307-319dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9529-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20101029b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02989naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167072001700184100001700201245012900218300001800347500001500365520104800380650001801428650002601446650004301472650001001515650002101525650002601546650002101572650001401593650001901607650001401626650002401640650002401664650005001688650002501738650002101763650002301784650002401807650003101831650003501862653006001897653001601957653001601973653001201989653002102001700001302022773007902035852000902114856010702123856008802230930003302318945002502351946001102376655001202387IND4443033420221120213426.0100928e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444303342DNAL7 a205269222pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2010.4878752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

After pre-treatment using a Waters Oasis HLB cartridge, the sample solution was separated on two C18 columns using a column-switching technique with a six-port valve. UV detection was performed at 210 nm. The effects of eluent composition and eluate volume on the retention and elution of neotame on SPE cartridge were investigated. The method is simple, rapid, sensitive and has good reproducibility. RSD was lower than 5% (n = 5). The calibration curve of neotame was in the range 5-100 µg/ml with good linearity (r2 = 0.999). Because neotame was concentrated 10 times from an original sample to a sample solution by solid-phase extraction (SPE), the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 0.5 mg/kg. The recovery yields of neotame spiked in foods was >92% with a coefficient of variation <3.2%. The proposed column-switching HPLC method can be successfully used to determine neotame in routine inspection work. 3afood analysis 3aartificial sweeteners 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3acakes 3adietary exposure 3aequipment performance 3afood composition 3adetection 3afruit products 3abeverages 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDipeptidesxanalysis 2aFruitxchemistry 2aLimit of Detection 2aReference Standards 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 0acolumn-switching high-performance liquid chromatography 0amethodology 0anew methods 0aneotame 0apreserved fruits1 aChen, Bo0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Sept., v. 27, no. 9 p.1221-12257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2010.4878753Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02726naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011600128300001600244500002400260520134900284650002101633650002601654650001201680650002601692650001901718650001701737650001201754650001301766650001101779650001401790650001201804650001301816650002201829650001301851650004701864650001501911650000901926650002601935650001001961651001201971651001101983700002301994700002402017700001602041773017802057852000902235655001202244IND4363945020221120213421.0040818s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436394502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrosser, J.W.10aBuilding a replacement sour orange rootstock: somatic hybridization of selected mandarin + pummelo combinations  ap. 530-534.  aIncludes references  aSour orange has been a premier citrus rootstock worldwide due to its ability to perform on challenging soils and to produce and hold high-quality fruit. However, increasingly widespread quick-decline isolates of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) have destroyed entire industries on sour orange in some countries, and are in the process of destroying millions of trees on sour orange in Florida. CTV also threatens other citrus locations planted heavy to sour orange, including Texas and Mexico. An acceptable alternative rootstock to replace sour orange is in high demand but has yet to be developed. Molecular analyses have recently determined that sour orange is probably a hybrid of pummelo and mandarin. We report the production of 12 new mandarin + pummelo somatic hybrids produced by protoplast fusion from selected superior mandarin and pummelo parents, in efforts to develop a suitable replacement sour-orange-like rootstock that is resistant to CTV-induced quick decline. Somatic hybrids from all 12 parental combinations were confirmed by a combination of leaf morphology, flow cytometry, and RAPD analyses (for nuclear hybridity). These new mandarin + pummelo somatic hybrids are being propagated by rooted cuttings as necessary to conduct quick-decline resistance assays and to assess horticultural performance in replicated field trials. 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3adecline 3afield experimentation 3aflow cytometry 3ahorticulture 3ahybrids 3aindustry 3aleaves 3amandarins 3aparents 3aplanting 3aprotoplast fusion 3apummelos 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arootstocks 3asoil 3asomatic hybridization 3atrees 3aFlorida 3aMexico1 aMedina-Urrutia, V.1 aAnanthakrishnan, G.1 aSerrano, P.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2004 July, v. 129, no. 4 p.530-534dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245017600129300001600305500002400321520172500345650001202070650001702082650001502099650001302114650001402127650001402141650001202155650001302167650001602180650001602196650000902212650001702221650001102238650001202249650001602261650001702277650001202294650001302306650001402319650001102333650003102344650001602375650001602391650002102407700001702428773017802445852000902623655001202632IND4363944720221120213541.0040818s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436394472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, N.O.10aInheritance of seed set, germination, and day neutrality/heat delay insensitivity of garden chrysanthemums (Dedranthema xgrandiflora) under glasshouse and field conditions  ap. 509-516.  aIncludes references  aCommercial chrysanthemums are short day (SD) plants. Recently, several day neutral (DN) garden genotypes have been identified. Both glasshouse and garden cultivars vary in heat delay insensitivity (HDI). This research analyzed yield components (seed set, germination, yield potential) and tested a DN/HDI ideotype for its effectiveness. Progeny from a 6 x 6 diallel were embryo rescued, clonal ramats were grown in two environments (glasshouse-long days; field-long to short days) and evaluated for flowering, early flowering response groups, thermozero temperature response, low long day leaf number (LDLN), high leaf initiation rates, and low mean stem lengths of the terminal shoot. Self seedset ranged from 0% to 8% while outcross seedset was 0% to 92%. General and specific combining ability were highly significant for seed set, the reciprocals, and their interactions. Germination averaged 67%, while yield potential was 44%. Cotyledon pigmentation in embryo rescued seedlings was 7% albinos, 15% anthocyanin (transposable elements), and 78% normal (green). SD parents did not flower in either photoperiod although PPSL-10 carried alleles for DN. SD x DN crosses produced some DN progeny and fit a 1:3 chi square ratio (DN:SD), indicating DN to be recessive. However, DN x DN crosses also fit a 3:1 chi square ratio, due to HDI. No progeny flowered within the 3 to 6 week ideotype; visible bud date had a heritability of h2 = 0.50. Most progeny were within the LDLN range (h2 = 0.72). Several leaf initiation rates exceeded the ideotype (h2 = 0.003); plant height also matched the ideotype (h2 = 0.66). Both visible bud and flowering dates require significant improvement before progeny match the DN/HDI ideotype. 3aalleles 3aanthocyanins 3acotyledons 3acrossing 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agardens 3agenotype 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3aheat 3aheritability 3aleaves 3aparents 3aphotoperiod 3apigmentation 3aprogeny 3aseed set 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3aspecific combining ability 3atemperature 3atransposons 3ayield components1 aAscher, P.D.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2004 July, v. 129, no. 4 p.509-516dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245014200192300001600334520081000350650003301160650002601193650001601219650001601235650002501251650001701276650001001293650004401303650001101347650005201358650004601410650002601456650004501482650005801527650004201585650002401627650004101651650005301692650006401745653002101809653001901830653002101849653002401870700001601894700002401910700002101934773012301955852000902078856009202087930003302179946001102212655001202223IND4442758420221120203007.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444275842DNAL7 a207354852pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.02075.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHang, Vu Thi Thu10aIn vivo characterization of NcsB3 to establish the complete biosynthesis of the naphthoic acid moiety of the neocarzinostatin chromophore  ap. 119-125.  aNeocarzinostatin (NCS) is an enediyne antibiotic produced by Streptomyces carzinostaticus. The NCS chromophore consists of an enediyne core, a sugar moiety, and a naphthoic acid (NA) moiety. The latter plays a key role in binding the NCS chromophore to its apoprotein to protect and stabilize the bioactive NCS chromophore. In this study, we expressed three genes: ncsB (naphthoic acid synthase), ncsB3 (P450 hydroxylase), and ncsB1 (O-methyltransferase), in Streptomyces lividans TK24. The three genes were sufficient to produce 2-hydroxy-7-methoxy-5-methyl-1-naphthoic acid. Production was analyzed and confirmed by LC-MS and nuclear magnetic resonance.

  1 aPikkemaat, M.G.10aApplication of a luminescent bacterial biosensor for the detection of tetracyclines in routine analysis of poultry muscle samples  ap. 1112-1117.  aTetracyclines are extensively used in veterinary medicine. For the detection of tetracycline residues in animal products, a broad array of methods is available. Luminescent bacterial biosensors represent an attractive inexpensive, simple and fast method for screening large numbers of samples. A previously developed cell-biosensor method was subjected to an evaluation study using over 300 routine poultry samples and the results were compared with a microbial inhibition test. The cell-biosensor assay yielded many more suspect samples, 10.2% versus 2% with the inhibition test, which all could be confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Only one sample contained a concentration above the maximum residue limit (MRL) of 100 µg kg-1, while residue levels in most of the suspect samples were very low (<10 µg kg-1). The method appeared to be specific and robust. Using an experimental set-up comprising the analysis of a series of three sample dilutions allowed an appropriate cut-off for confirmatory analysis, limiting the number of samples and requiring further analysis to a minimum. 3aequipment performance 3abiosensors 3adetection 3abioluminescence 3abacteria 3atetracyclines 3apoultry products 3amuscle tissues 3afood analysis 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3afood contamination 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBiosensing Techniquesxeconomics 2aDrug Residuesxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolismxstandards. 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEuropean Union 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Inspectionxeconomicsxmethodsxstandards. 2aLimit of Detection 2aLuciferases, Bacterialxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistry 2aOperonxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aPoultry 2aRepressor Proteinsxmetabolism 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTetracyclinesxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aVeterinary Drugsxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aluminescent bacterial biosensor1 aRapallini, M.L.B.A.1 aKarp, M.T.1 aElferink, J.W.A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Aug., v. 27, no. 8 p.1112-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400410037948663Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03315naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245015800206300001800364520181700382650001202199653001402211653001602225653002002241653001402261653003102275700002302306700002602329700002802355700001602383700001602399700001502415700001702430700002502447700002302472700002302495700002102518700003302539773013302572852000902705856008502714930003302799946001302832655001202845IND4444039120221120203110.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444403912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00280-010-1252-x2doi7 aPMC29196102pmcid7 a201077992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLam, Elaine T. 10aPhase I trial of non-cytotoxic suramin as a modulator of docetaxel and gemcitabine therapy in previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer  ap. 1019-1029.  aPurpose In preclinical models, non-cytotoxic suramin (concentrations <50 μM) potentiates the activity of multiple chemotherapeutic agents. The present study evaluated the safety and tolerability of suramin in combination with docetaxel or gemcitabine in previously chemotherapy-treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Methods Patients received suramin intravenously in combination with either docetaxel on day 1 or gemcitabine on days 1 and 8, of each 21-day treatment cycle. After 3 cycles, patients with partial response (PR) or better continued on the same combination, whereas patients with stable disease (SD) or worse crossed-over to the other combination. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed before and after each treatment. Results Eighteen patients received a total of 79 courses (37 suramin plus docetaxel, 42 suramin plus gemcitabine). The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was febrile neutropenia, observed in three of six patients treated with suramin and docetaxel 75 mg/m². No DLTs were observed with suramin plus docetaxel 56 mg/m² or suramin plus gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m². Common adverse events included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. The target plasma suramin concentration range of 10-50 μM was achieved in 90% of treatments. Discernable antitumor activity was noted in 11 patients (2 PR, 9 SD). Conclusions Non-cytotoxic suramin, in combination with docetaxel 56 mg/m² or gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m², was reasonably well-tolerated with a manageable toxicity profile. Target plasma concentrations were correctly predicted by our previously described dosing nomogram. The observed preliminary evidence of antitumor activity encourages evaluation of this strategy in efficacy trials. 3asuramin 0aDocetaxel 0aGemcitabine 0aChemosensitizer 0aModulator 0aNon-small cell lung cancer1 aAu, Jessie L.- S. 1 aOtterson, Gregory A. 1 aGuillaume Wientjes, M. 1 aChen, Ling 1 aShen, Tong 1 aWei, Yong 1 aLi, Xiaobai 1 aBekaii-Saab, Tanios 1 aMurgo, Anthony J. 1 aJensen, Rhonda R. 1 aGrever, Michael 1 aVillalona-Calero, Miguel A. 0 tCancer chemotherapy and pharmacology.g2010 Nov., v. 66, no. 6 p.1019-1029dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0344-57047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00280-010-1252-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02756naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245008000160300001800240500005600258500001500314520147300329650001101802650002301813650002301836650001201859650002501871650001601896650001501912650001801927650001401945650001501959651001001974653002701984653001502011655002702026700001802053700001602071700001602087773007802103852000902181930003302190945002502223946001302248961001302261655001202274IND4402932720221120203157.0080318s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440293272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Various methods are currently used to determine timing of harvest aid application. One method is the use of growing degree-day units and/or heat units (HU). This concept triggers harvest aid application based on accumulated heat units following cutout, which is defined as the time when the nodes above white flower equals five (NAWF=5). A guideline has been set for harvest aid timing to occur at 850 HU after cutout. In some regions, it appears that this guideline calls for harvest aid application prematurely, and may potentially reduce overall yield. A study was conducted at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in Burleson County, Texas, to assess proper timing of harvest aid application. The study was arranged in a split-plot design with four replications. Treatments consisted of evaluating HU accumulations of 650, 750, 850, 950 and 1050 once the crop has reached NAWF = 3, 4 or 5. There were significant differences in percent open boll counts at defoliation for both NAWF and HU. NAWF = 4 and 950 HU most closely coincided with the 60 percent open boll method of harvest aid timing. Significant differences occurred between NAWF and HU for percent open boll at harvest. No significant differences were observed between NAWF for lint yield; however, there were differences in lint yield for HU with 950 and 1050 yielding more than the other treatments. 3acotton 3aapplication timing 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aflowers 3apreharvest treatment 3adefoliation 3astem nodes 3afiber quality 3aheat sums 3alint yield 3aTexas 0aheat unit accumulation 0acrop yield 7aconference publication1 aCothren, J.T.1 aLemon, R.G.1 aMahan, J.R.0 tProceedings of the Beltwide Cotton Conferences.g2004,  p.1996-19977nnas  aDNAL  a20080324b20080404c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/03/24  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02344naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001500144245017800159300001400337500002400351520147100375650002001846650001401866650001001880651001101890773008401901852000901985856008401994655001202078IND4364384720221120203223.0040913s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436438472DNAL7 a10.1093/forestry/77.1.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilios, E.14aThe influence of stand development process on the height and volume growth of dominant Fagus sylvatica L. s.l. trees in the central Rhodope Mountains of north-eastern Greece  ap. 17-26.  aIncludes references  aThis study was conducted in pure and mixed Fagus sylvatica L. s.l. stands in the central Rhodope Mountains of north-eastern Greece. Forty dominant beech trees were cut and analysed using a stem analysis technique. The trees came from two different groups (structural types) of stands. The first structural type consists of pure Fagus sylvatica L. s.l. stands and the second consists of Fagus sylvatica-Pinus sylvestris L. stands. In each structural type some stands are located in good productivity sites and others in medium-productivity sites. Within each structural type the structure of the stands was the result of the same development process. The development process of pure beech stands was entirely different from the development process of beech-pine stands. The main results of this research indicate that the stand development process, without any interaction with site, influences the height and volume growth of dominant beech trees, at least up to the age of 50 years. The growth environment of Fagus sylvatica-Pinus sylvestris stands, as a result of their development process, gives a strong competitive advantage to dominant beech trees, to such a degree that the dominant beech trees of Fagus sylvatica-Pinus sylvestris stands, in sites of intermediate productivity, exhibit practically the same height and at least the same volume, on average, as those of pure Fagus sylvatica stands of good productivity sites, at least up to the age of 50 years. 3aFagus sylvatica 3amountains 3atrees 3aGreece0 tForestry.g2004, v. 77, no. 1 p.17-26dOxford University Pressx0015-752X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/77.1.173Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02026naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001600144245011600160300001400276500002400290520101000314650001601324650002401340650001601364650001201380650002601392650001201418650001301430650001001443651001101453700001801464700001701482773008401499852000901583856008401592655001201676IND4364387920221120182425.0040913s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436438792DNAL7 a10.1093/forestry/77.1.612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChrimes, D.10aPicea abies sapling height growth after cutting Vaccinium myrtillus in an uneven-aged forest in northern Sweden  ap. 61-66.  aIncludes references  aThe study investigated the hypotheses that Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) sapling growth is reduced by the occurrence of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) through either resource competition or allelopathy. A field experiment was established with a randomized block design and five treatments including one control in an uneven-aged Norway spruce forest. Bilberry stems were cut in a 0.56 m radius (1 m2) around each treated spruce sapling, and removed or left lying. In the following year treatments were repeated on half of the spruce saplings. Sapling height increments were measured for six growing seasons after applying the treatments. Saplings reacted with a decrease in height increment compared with the control during the first and second year after applying treatments, and had height increments similar to the control the following three years. No significant differences were found between treatments removing or leaving bilberry cuttings. The results did not support the hypotheses. 3aPicea abies 3aVaccinium myrtillus 3aallelopathy 3acutting 3afield experimentation 3aforests 3asaplings 3astems 3aSweden1 aLundqvist, L.1 aAtlegrim, O.0 tForestry.g2004, v. 77, no. 1 p.61-66dOxford University Pressx0015-752X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/77.1.613Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03996naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001500143245005500158300001300213500002400226520298500250650001903235650001803254650002203272650001903294650001803313650001203331650001203343650001603355650001303371650002103384650001003405651001803415700001403433773008303447852000903530856008303539655001203622IND4364384620221120182311.0040913s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436438462DNAL7 a10.1093/forestry/77.1.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevy, P.E.10aEstimation of deforestation rates in Great Britain  ap. 9-16.  aIncludes references  aEstimates of national deforestation rates are required for reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. The most direct record of deforestation in Great Britain (GB) is provided by Forestry Commission (FC) unconditional felling licences, which give a value of approximately 500 ha a(-1) for recent years. This probably represents a minimum, as unlicensed felling will also occur but to an unknown extent. The deforestation rate can be estimated indirectly by constructing a forest area budget, assuming deforestation is the residual term remaining after the observed change in forest area is subtracted from the recorded area of newly planted forest. Independent estimates of the total GB forest area can be obtained from the FC Woodland Census, the FC National Inventory of Woodland & Trees, and the Countryside Survey. An additional independent source of estimates of the total Scottish forest area is provided by the National Countryside Monitoring Scheme (NCMS). The observed increase in total area in these data does not differ significantly from the recorded planting rate, and a statistically significant deforestation rate was not detectable. An alternative approach is to use national survey schemes, in which repeated surveys of land use are made in a set of permanent plots. Deforestation rate can be calculated as the sum of transitions from all forest classes to all non-forest classes. Both the NCMS and the Countryside Survey can be used in this way. The NCMS survey can be scaled to give a GB deforestation rate of approximately 1000 ha a(-1), whilst the Countryside Survey gives a value of approximately 20000 ha a(-1). The NCMS value is thought to be more reliable, as the afforestation rate estimated in this way agrees closely with FC figures, whilst the Countryside Survey substantially overestimates afforestation. National mapping data from the Ordnance Survey (OS) can be used in a similar way and, as the whole country is covered by a rolling programme of surveys, sampling bias should be removed. These data show a similar temporal pattern to the felling licence data, but with considerably higher deforestation rates, with a mean of 4059 ha a(-1) and a peak at over 7000 ha a(-1). However, these data suggest that there was substantial conversion of forest to agricultural land (62 per cent of the total deforested area). It seems unlikely that extensive unlicensed felling would have occurred for expanding agricultural land, when there has been little economic or policy incentives to do so, and we therefore suspect that these data may overestimate rural deforestation. The best estimate of the recent deforestation rate may be obtained by combining the data from the FC unconditional felling licences (accounting for conversions to rural uses) with the OS estimate of deforestation for non-rural uses which do not generally require a felling licence. This gives a value of 1375 ha a(-1). 3aUnited Nations 3aafforestation 3aagricultural land 3aclimate change 3adeforestation 3afelling 3aforests 3ainventories 3aland use 3anational surveys 3atrees 3aGreat Britain1 aMilne, R.0 tForestry.g2004, v. 77, no. 1 p.9-16dOxford University Pressx0015-752X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/77.1.93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01743naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245005000163300001600213520088800229650001501117650002301132650002101155700002601176773012501202852000901327856008501336930003301421946001101454655001201465IND4446801620221120182429.0101224e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444680162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10795-010-9096-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllan, Andrew10aGood governance and IWRM--a legal perspective  ap. 239-248.  aDeveloping a methodology for the measurement of governance in the context of water management requires a clear understanding of what is meant by (good) governance, and what is meant by IWRM--terms which are often, but incorrectly, used almost interchangeably.

The paper concludes that while the two are not mutually exclusive, the access points between them appear to concentrate around issues relating to equity, the protection of “silent” interests and the importance of governance in facilitating feedback mechanisms. 3agovernance 3airrigation systems 3awater management1 aRieu-Clarke, Alistair0 tIrrigation and drainage systems.g2010 Dec., v. 24, no. 3-4 p.239-248dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-62917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10795-010-9096-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20110601b20110603c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04110naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100002000232245009700252300001800349520145300367650002101820650001101841650002401852650001701876650000901893650000901902650001301911650002301924650001801947650002101965650001201986650003401998650001602032650001502048650001002063650000902073650007302082650001202155650007802167650002802245650000902273650001102282650001102293650002302304650008902327650003702416650001102453650002302464650000902487650001902496650001602515650002202531650005002553650005102603650005302654650002202707650001602729651001302745651001302758653002902771700001402800700001402814700002002828700001402848700001502862700001902877773007802896852000902974856010702983856008503090930003303175945002503208946001103233655001203244IND4443027620221120182534.0100928e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444302762DNAL7 a205895472pmid7 a10.1080/194400410038011902doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJahurul, M.H.A.10aDietary exposure to heterocyclic amines in high-temperature cooked meat and fish in Malaysia  ap. 1060-1071.  aThe intake of heterocyclic amines is influenced by the amount and type of meat and fish ingested, frequency of consumption, cooking methods, cooking temperature, and duration of cooking. In this study, the dietary intake of heterocyclic amines in Malaysia and their main sources were investigated. Forty-two samples of meat and fish were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector to determine the concentration of the six predominant heterocyclic amines, namely: 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline(MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoxaline (7,8-DiMeIQx), and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). Dietary intake data were obtained using a food-frequency questionnaire when interviewing 600 Malaysian respondents. The level of total heterocyclic amines in food samples studies ranged from not detected to 38.7 ng g-1. The average daily intake level of heterocyclic amine was 553.7 ng per capita day-1. The intake of PhIP was the highest, followed by MeIQx and MeIQ. The results reveal that fried and grilled chicken were the major dietary source of heterocyclic amines in Malaysia. However, the heterocyclic amine intake by the Malaysian population was lower than those reported from other regions. 3adietary exposure 3aadults 3aheterocyclic amines 3acooked foods 3ameat 3afish 3aseafoods 3afood contamination 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3acooking 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAminesxadministration & dosagexanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogensxadministration & dosagexanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFishes 2aFood Contamination 2aHeterocyclic Compoundsxadministration & dosagexanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aHot Temperaturexadverse effects 2aHumans 2aLimit of Detection 2aMale 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aPyridinesxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aQuinolinesxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aQuinoxalinesxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aSeafoodxanalysis 2aYoung Adult 3aMalaysia 0aMalaysia 0ahigh temperature cooking1 aJinap, S.1 aAng, S.J.1 aAbdul-Hamid, A.1 aHajeb, P.1 aLioe, H.N.1 aZaidul, I.S.M.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2010 Aug., v. 27, no. 8 p.1060-10717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400410038011903Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03048naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245009900186300001800285520108700303650001501390650001301405650001501418650001101433650002101444650000701465650002501472650001301497650001101510650001701521650001101538650001301549650002701562650002701589650002801616650002101644650001001665650003201675650003101707650003701738650001301775650004401788650002401832650003101856650002201887650001601909653002401925653001801949653002101967700002101988700002902009700001702038700001902055700001902074700002102093773013402114852000902248856008502257930003302342946001102375655001202386IND4443744620221120131503.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444374462DNAL7 a205356192pmid7 a10.1007/s00449-010-0440-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNisola, Grace M. 10aHydrogen sulfide degradation characteristics of Bordetella sp. Sulf-8 in a biotrickling filter  ap. 1131-1138.  aThe applicability of Bordetella sp. Sulf-8 to degrade Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S) gas in a biotrickling system was investigated. The isolate is a heterotrophic gram-negative, catalase- and oxidase-positive, rod-shaped bacterium which can metabolize thiosulfate or sulfide into sulfate. The mesophilic Bordetella sp. Sulf-8 can grow within a wide pH range using yeast as carbon source, with or without the presence of sulfur. In batch experiments, kinetic constants such as maximum specific growth rate (μ max = 0.12 1/h), saturation constant (K S = 0.017 g/L), and specific sulfur removal rate (88 mg S/g cells h) were obtained. In biotrickling experiments removal efficiencies were satisfactory, but the system performance was observed to be more influenced by empty bed residence time than by H₂S feed gas concentration. Critical and maximum elimination capacities were 78.0 and 94.5 g H₂S/m³ day, respectively. Macrokinetic analysis of the biotrickling system revealed maximum H₂S removal rate V max = 15.97 g S/kg media-day and half saturation constant K S′ = 12.45 ppmv. 3aBordetella 3abacteria 3abiofilters 3acarbon 3ahydrogen sulfide 3apH 3aspecific growth rate 3asulfates 3asulfur 3athiosulfates 3ayeasts 2aBiofilms 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aBordetellaxmetabolism 2aChromatographyxmethods 2aEquipment Design 2aGases 2aHydrogen Sulfidexchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIndustrial Microbiologyxmethods 2aKinetics 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanningxmethods 2aModels, Statistical 2aProteobacteriaxmetabolism 2aSulfurxchemistry 2aTemperature 0aBiotrickling filter 0aGas treatment 0aKinetic analysis1 aTuuguu, Enkhdul 1 aFarnazo, Danvir Mark D. 1 aHan, Mideok 1 aKim, Younghee 1 aCho, Eulsaeng 1 aChung, Wook-Jin 0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 Nov., v. 33, no. 9 p.1131-1138dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-010-0440-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01300naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100006000115245002700175300001300202300001800215500001500233520044200248650001700690650003600707650001200743651001200755653001500767653003500782653001500817653001200832773005700844852000900901939003300910945000800943946001100951655001200962991621248980742620221120131558.0820607s1980    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGC829553952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeston, Joseph,dapproximately 1743-approximately 1825.10aSt. Lawrence revisited  ap. 8-17.  ap. 8-17. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe St. Lawrence neighborhood in Toronto, one of the largest land reclamation ventures of the 1970's, will eventually be a mixed public, private non-profit, and entrepreneurial development.

Here, we examine the genetic structure and diversity in naturally subdivided and artificially fragmented populations of the endangered tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi), a small fish restricted to discrete coastal lagoons and estuaries in California, USA. We use five naturally fragmented coastal populations from a 300- km spatial scale as a standard to assess migration and drift relative to eight artificially fragmented bay populations from a 30- km spatial scale. Using nine microsatellite loci in 621 individuals, and a 522-base fragment of mitochondrial DNA control region from 103 individuals, we found striking differences in the relative influences of migration and drift on genetic variation at these two scales. Overall, the artificially fragmented populations exhibited a consistent pattern of higher genetic differentiation and significantly lower genetic diversity relative to the naturally fragmented populations. Thus, even in a species characterized by habitat isolation and subdivision, further artificial fragmentation appears to result in substantial population genetic consequences and may not be sustainable. 3aEucyclogobius newberryi 3acoastal water 3aestuaries 3afish 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aGenetic Drift 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPerciformesxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aconservation genetics1 aGoldsmith, Greg1 aJacobs, David K.1 aKinziger, Andrew P.0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 Aug., v. 19, no. 16 p.3315-3327dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04755.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20111218b20120106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03407naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001200164245014400176300001600320520141200336650001601748650001401764650001001778650001101788650001401799650002601813650001401839650001301853650001501866650001301881650001401894650001801908650001601926650001801942650002901960650001301989650004502002650006202047650001102109650003402120650002302154650003002177650006902207650002802276650005002304653001702354653001302371700001902384700001902403700001702422700001702439700002002456700002002476773013502496852000902631856008502640930003302725946001102758655001202769IND4442666020221120111117.0100917e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444266602DNAL7 a206526852pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3999-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yu 10aIdentification and quantification of salinomycin in intoxicated human plasma by liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 955-961.  aSalinomycin is a polyether ionophore antibiotic that is widely used in poultry and livestock. Exposure of humans to salinomycin via inhalation or ingestion can cause severe toxicity. The aim of the present work was to develop a simple and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the rapid identification and quantification of salinomycin in human plasma. After removing protein using methanol, plasma samples were eluted from a Waters Xterra ® MS C18 column with an isocratic mobile phase. Detection and quantification of the drug were performed with a triple-quadruple mass spectrometer by monitoring for two specific transitions in the electrospray, positive-ion, multiple-reaction monitoring mode. Assay validation showed good linearity (r ² = 0.998). The detection and quantification limits of the method were 0.6 and 16 pg/mL, respectively. The inter- and intraday coefficients of variation for the assay were both <15%. Twelve authentic plasma samples from intoxicated patients were analyzed using this method. Salinomycin was detected in six samples, at concentrations of between 0.6 and 46.5 pg/mL. The described assay method allows the sensitive and rapid identification and quantification of salinomycin in human plasma, and thus provides a valuable tool for the specific diagnosis of salinomycin intoxication in clinical and emergency rescue practice. 3aantibiotics 3abreathing 3adrugs 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aliquid chromatography 3alivestock 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3apatients 3apoisoning 3arapid methods 3asalinomycin 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxbloodxchemistry. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxeconomicsxmethods. 2aHumans 2aIonophoresxbloodxchemistry. 2aLimit of Detection 2aPyransxbloodxchemistry. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxeconomicsxmethods. 2aStreptomycesxchemistry 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxeconomicsxmethods. 0aHuman plasma 0aLC-MS/MS1 aFang, Junjian 1 aWu, Shengming 1 aMa, Kunpeng 1 aLi, Haijing 1 aYan, Xianzhong 1 aDong, Fangting 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 398, no. 2 p.955-961dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-3999-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02862naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010300165300001800268520135000286650001701636650002001653650001201673650001201685650001401697650001801711650002001729650001601749650001501765650002601780650001501806650001701821650001301838650001601851650002701867650001601894650001101910650001501921650001201936653002101948653000801969653001801977653001601995700001602011700001902027700002202046773011402068852000902182856008502191930003302276946001102309655001202320IND4446337420221120111128.0101210e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444633742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-010-9395-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandepitte, K. 10aEffects of outcrossing in fragmented populations of the primarily selfing forest herb Geum urbanum  ap. 1353-1364.  aIn fragmented landscapes, small populations may be subjected to inbreeding or genetic drift. Gene flow is expected to alleviate the burden of deleterious mutations in such populations. The beneficial effects of outcrossing may, however, depend on life history characteristics such as the species' breeding system. Frequent selfing is expected to purge (sub)lethal alleles and mitigate inbreeding depression, at least if the load of mildly deleterious mutations has not accumulated through genetic drift in populations with a small effective size. Gene-inflow from distant source populations can cause outbreeding depression due to genomic incompatibilities. We tested these predictions using highly fragmented populations of the self-compatible forest herb Geum urbanum. Assessment of mating system parameters using microsatellite markers inferred high selfing rates (92.5%), confirming the predominantly self-fertilizing character of the study species. We conducted experimental pollinations with self and outcross pollen collected from populations at different distances from the target populations. There were no significant signs of inbreeding depression, even in very small target populations. Except for a minor negative effect on the germination rate for the long-distance crosses, we found no effects of outbreeding on fitness estimates. 3aGeum urbanum 3aadverse effects 3aalleles 3aforests 3agene flow 3agenetic drift 3agenetic markers 3agermination 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding depression 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amutation 3aoutbreeding 3aoutbreeding depression 3aoutcrossing 3apollen 3aprediction 3aselfing 0aSelf-pollinating 0aSSR 0aFragmentation 0aForest herb1 aHonnay, O. 1 aJacquemyn, H. 1 aRoldán-Ruiz, I. 0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2010 Nov., v. 24, no. 6 p.1353-1364dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-010-9395-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01849naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010600161300001600267520083500283650001501118653001401133653001701147653001701164653001901181653002501200700001701225700001701242773012401259852000901383856008501392930003301477946001301510655001201523IND4441879320221120111232.0100827e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444187932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10913-010-0032-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Y.

Due to difficulties involved in studying soil biota, and to taxonomic biases in conservation research, the full extent of soil biodiversity is not well understood, and soil-dwelling organisms are rarely candidates for conservation. The biogeography of soil biota differs significantly from that of plants or animals aboveground, and the taxonomic and functional diversity of soil-dwellers allows them to have a multitude of ecological effects on aboveground organisms. Soil organisms exhibit levels of biodiversity several orders of magnitude greater than those found in their aboveground counterparts on a per-area basis. The biodiversity of soils underpins many crucial ecosystem services which support the plants and animals typically targeted by conservation efforts. Strategies detailed in this paper provide practitioners with the ability to address many of the challenges related to incorporating soils and soil organisms into conservation planning. 3afunctional diversity 3aplanning 3aanimals 3aecosystem services 3awildlife management 3asoil 3aplants (botany) 3ahabitats 3abiogeography 0aSoil integrity 0aMicrobial diversity 0aSoil biological crust 0abiodiversity0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2010 Dec., v. 19, no. 13 p.3743-3756dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-010-9924-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02971naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245014100184300001800325520142600343650001701769650001701786650001301803650001201816650006401828650001101892650003701903650003801940650001101978650002201989650003402011650001402045650002202059650006702081653002702148653001402175653001502189700002102204700002102225773011502246852000902361856008502370930003302455946001302488655001202501IND4440997020221120121714.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444099702DNAL7 a204735702pmid7 a10.1007/s10439-010-0061-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldous, Ian G. 10aDifferential Changes in the Molecular Stability of Collagen from the Pulmonary and Aortic Valves During the Fetal-to-Neonatal Transition  ap. 3000-3009.  aDuring the fetal-to-neonatal transition, transvalvular pressures (TVPs) on the aortic and pulmonary valves change dramatically—but differently for each valve. We have examined changes in the molecular stability and crosslinking of collagen during this transition. Aortic and pulmonary valves were harvested from fetal and neonatal cattle. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), denaturation of valvular collagen was examined and, using HPLC, the types and quantities of enzymatic crosslinks were examined. No difference in hydrothermal stability was found between the collagens in the fetal aortic and pulmonary valves; this was expected since the TVP is approximately the same across both valves before birth. Only in the neonatal samples was the collagen from aortic valves (higher TVP) less stable than that from pulmonary valves (lower TVP). Surprisingly, the enthalpy of denaturation did not differ either between valve type or with age, suggesting an entropic mechanism of altered molecular stability. A significant difference in immature-to-mature crosslink ratio was found between neonatal aortic and pulmonary valves: a difference absent in fetal valves. This ratio—indicative of remodeling rate—parallels (and may be a function of) the changing in vivo load. This study highlights the relationship between in vivo load and both (i) molecular stability and (ii) collagen remodeling in heart valves. 3aheart valves 3acrosslinking 3acollagen 2aAnimals 2aAortic Valvexembryologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCattle 2aCollagenxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCross-Linking Reagentsxchemistry 2aFemale 2aFetal Development 2aFetusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPregnancy 2aProtein Stability 2aPulmonary Valvexembryologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aTransvalvular pressure 0aPerinatal 0aRemodeling1 aLee, J.

Under Al stress, the changes of rhizosphere pH, root elongation, absorption of Al by wheat roots, organic acids exuded from roots, and some main factors related to Al-tolerant mechanisms have been studied using hydroponics, fluorescence spectrophotometry, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two wheat cultivars, Brevor and Atlas66, differing in Al tolerance are chosen in the study. Accordingly, the rhizosphere pH has a positive effect on Al tolerance. Atlas66 (Al-tolerant) has higher capability to maintain high rhizosphere pH than Brevor (Al-sensitive) does. High pH can reduce Al3+ activity and toxicity, and increase the efficiency of exuding organic acids from the roots. More inhibition of root elongation has been found in Brevor because of the exposure of roots to Al3+ solution at low pH. Brevor accumulate more Al in roots than Atlas66 even at higher pH. Al-induced exudation of malic and citric acids has been found in Atlas66 roots, while no Al-induced organic acids have been found in Brevor. These results indicate that the Al-induced secretion of organic acids from Atlas66 roots has a positive correlation with Al tolerance. Comprehensive treatment of Al3+ and H+ indicates that wheat is adversely influenced by excess Al3+, rather than low pH. 3aabsorption 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3acultivars 3aexudation 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydroponics 3ametal tolerance 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3aphytotoxicity 3aprotons 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asecretion 3awheat1 aBi, S.1 aMa, L.1 aHan, W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Dec. 27, v. 54, no. 26 p.10033-10039x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06117693electronic resource 7aarticle03018naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245013200181300001600313500002400329520118700353650002501540650001001565650001801575650001901593650001301612650000901625650001201634650001401646650001501660650001501675650005701690650001101747650002001758650001101778650002501789650005701814650002301871650004901894650005901943650001402002650000902016650001702025650007002042650001702112653001402129653001002143653002202153653002002175653001902195700002902214773010702243852000902350856006902359655001202428IND4387481520221120101238.0070204s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438748152DNAL7 a171862672pmid7 a10.1007/s00427-006-0125-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyari, Besma10aFGFR1 and anosmin-1 underlying genetically distinct forms of Kallmann syndrome are co-expressed and interact in olfactory bulbs  ap. 169-175.  aIncludes references  aKallmann syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous developmental disease characterised by a partial or complete lack of olfactory bulb development. Two genes underlying this disease have so far been identified: the KAL-1 gene, which encodes anosmin-1, an extracellular matrix protein that promotes axonal guidance and branch formation in vitro; and KAL-2, which encodes the known FGFR1. The implication of FGFR1 and anosmin-1 in the same developmental disease led us to test whether anosmin-1 and FGFR1 interact during the development of the olfactory system. In this paper, we showed that the two proteins co-localise in the olfactory bulb during development in rat. Using cross-immunoprecipitation assays of olfactory bulb extracts, we also demonstrated that anosmin-1 and FGFR1 are comprised within the same protein complex. Moreover, we show that anosmin-1 expression in CHO transfected cells increases FGFR1 accumulation, suggesting that anosmin-1 may act as a positive extracellular regulator of FGFR1 signalling. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that anosmin-1 is an essential component of a FGFR1 pathway that plays a key role during olfactory bulb morphogenesis. 3aextracellular matrix 3agenes 3amorphogenesis 3aolfactory bulb 3aproteins 3arats 2aAnimals 2aCHO Cells 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aExtracellular Matrix Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aKallmann Syndromexembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOlfactory Bulbxabnormalitiesxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aPregnancy 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReceptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransfection 0aAnosmin-1 0aFGFR1 0aKallmann syndrome 0aOlfactory bulbs 0aFGF signalling1 aSoussi-Yanicostas, Nadia0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2007 Feb., v. 217, no. 2 p.169-175dSpringer-Verlagx0949-944X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-006-0125-03electronic resource 7aarticle03276naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002200146040001800168100002000186245010700206300001600313500002400329506007600353520139400429506003701823650001301860650001001873650001801883650002101901650001401922650002401936650002601960650001601986650001202002650002402014650002502038650005302063650002502116650004602141650002002187650001202207650003102219650001402250650006302264650005202327650002402379653001702403653001702420653002902437700002302466700002402489773010702513852000902620856006902629655001202698IND4387480620221207120301.0070204s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438748062DNAL7 a172379442pmid7 a10.1007/s00427-006-0122-32doi7 aPMC45803322pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatus, David Q.10aFGF signaling in gastrulation and neural development in Nematostella vectensis, an anthozoan cnidarian  ap. 137-148.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal transduction pathway serves as one of the key regulators of early metazoan development, displaying conserved roles in the specification of endodermal, mesodermal, and neural fates during vertebrate development. FGF signals also regulate gastrulation, in part, by triggering epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in embryos of both vertebrates and invertebrates. Thus, FGF signals coordinate gastrulation movements across many different phyla. To help understand the breadth of FGF signaling deployment across the animal kingdom, we have examined the presence and expression of genes encoding FGF pathway components in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. We isolated three FGF ligands (NvFGF8A, NvFGF8B, and NvFGF1A), two FGF receptors (NvFGFRa and NvFGFRb), and two orthologs of vertebrate FGF responsive genes, Sprouty (NvSprouty), an inhibitor of FGF signaling, and Churchill (NvChurchill), a Zn finger transcription factor. We found these FGF ligands, receptors, and response gene expressed asymmetrically along the oral/aboral axis during gastrulation and in a developing chemosensory structure of planula stages known as the apical tuft. These results suggest a conserved role for FGF signaling molecules in coordinating both gastrulation and neural induction that predates the Cambrian explosion and the origins of the Bilateria.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnthozoa 3agenes 3ainvertebrates 3aneurodevelopment 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3avertebrates 2aAnimals 2aEmbryonic Induction 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFibroblast Growth Factorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGastrulaxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenetic Linkage 2aLigands 2aNervous Systemxembryology 2aPhylogeny 2aReceptors, Fibroblast Growth Factorxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSea Anemonesxembryologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSignal Transduction 0aGastrulation 0aNeurogenesis 0aEvolution of development1 aThomsen, Gerald H.1 aMartindale, Mark Q.0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2007 Feb., v. 217, no. 2 p.137-148dSpringer-Verlagx0949-944X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-006-0122-33electronic resource 7aarticle03286naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245006000191300001800251520137000269650001301639650002301652650001901675650002201694650002001716650001401736650002001750650001801770650003201788650001601820650002301836650002401859650001301883650001301896650003701909650001301946650002901959653001301988653001102001653001302012700002402025700002202049700001802071700001802089700002202107700001602129700001502145700002802160700002202188700002302210700001902233700002102252700001802273700002302291700002102314700001802335773011402353852000902467856009202476930003302568946001102601655001202612IND4441997720221120034322.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444199772DNAL7 a207383952pmid7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07778.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwainston, Neil10aEnzyme kinetics informatics: from instrument to browser  ap. 3769-3779.  aA limited number of publicly available resources provide access to enzyme kinetic parameters. These have been compiled through manual data mining of published papers, not from the original, raw experimental data from which the parameters were calculated. This is largely due to the lack of software or standards to support the capture, analysis, storage and dissemination of such experimental data. Introduced here is an integrative system to manage experimental enzyme kinetics data from instrument to browser. The approach is based on two interrelated databases: the existing SABIO-RK database, containing kinetic data and corresponding metadata, and the newly introduced experimental raw data repository, MeMo-RK. Both systems are publicly available by web browser and web service interfaces and are configurable to ensure privacy of unpublished data. Users of this system are provided with the ability to view both kinetic parameters and the experimental raw data from which they are calculated, providing increased confidence in the data. A data analysis and submission tool, the kineticswizard, has been developed to allow the experimentalist to perform data collection, analysis and submission to both data resources. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing integration with other manufacturer instruments covering a range of analytical techniques. 3aInternet 3aanalytical methods 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenzyme kinetics 3aextensibility 2aElectronic Data Processing. 2aData Mining 2aDatabases, Protein 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aInternet 2aKinetics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSoftware 2aSystems Biologyxmethods 0adatabase 0aenzyme 0ametadata1 aGolebiewski, Martin1 aMessiha, Hanan L.1 aMalys, Naglis1 aKania, Renate1 aKengne, Sylvestre1 aKrebs, Olga1 aMir, Saqib1 aSauer-Danzwith, Heidrun1 aSmallbone, Kieran1 aWeidemann, Andreas1 aWittig, Ulrike1 aKell, Douglas B.1 aMendes, Pedro1 aMüller, Wolfgang.1 aPaton, Norman W.1 aRojas, Isabel0 tFEBS journal.g2010 Sept., v. 277, no. 18 p.3769-3779dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07778.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03087naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245012900180300001600309500002400325520128100349650002101630650002201651650002101673650002601694650002201720650001201742650001101754650003001765650002101795650002601816650002201842650002101864650007201885650002401957650003901981650005702020650002402077650002302101650002802124650005202152650002302204650002702227700001402254700001702268700001602285700001502301700001402316700001802330773009502348852000902443856006902452655001202521IND4386790220221122134116.0070114s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438679022DNAL7 a171714682pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-006-0235-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Weidong10aCloning and Characterization of the Genes Encoding a Glycine Betaine ABC-Type Transporter in Halobacillus trueperi DSM10404T  ap. 124-130.  aIncludes references  aBy using Southern blot hybridization and inverse polymerase chain reaction, a 5.5-kb DNA fragment was obtained from the genomic DNA of Halobacillus trueperi DSM10404T. Sequence analysis revealed that it contained a potential operon with high levels of sequence similarity to the opuA operon encoding glycine betaine transporter from Bacillus subtilis, which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) substrate binding the protein-dependent transporter superfamily. The potential operon, designated as qatA (quaternary amine transporter), consists of three structural genes, which are predicted to encode an ATP-binding protein (QatAA), a membrane-associated protein (QatAB), and an extracellular substrate-binding protein (QatAC). Moreover, the putative promoter region of the operon was found with close homology to the σA-dependent promoter of B. subtilis. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that qatAA, qatAB, and qatAC genes were transcribed in cells of H. trueperi. Cells of Escherichia coli mutant MKH13 harboring qatA on pAY41 were able to grow on selective M9 salt medium containing glycine betaine and accumulated glycine betaine in the cytoplasm, showing that qatAA, qatAB, and qatAC genes together encode a functional glycine betaine transporter. 3aABC transporters 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aHalobacillus trueperi 3aSouthern blotting 3abetaine 3aoperon 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apromoter regions 3areverse transcription 3asequence analysis 3astructural genes 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacillaceaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBetainexmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aZhang, Bo1 aZhao, Baisuo1 aFeng, Deqin1 aYang, Lifu1 aWang, Lei1 aYang, Susheng0 tCurrent microbiology.g2007 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.124-130dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-006-0235-y3electronic resource 7aarticle03118naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245009600187300001300283500002400296520166400320650002401984650001902008650002002027650001002047650000902057650002802066650001602094650003002110650006202140650002902202650004702231650002102278650003102299650003502330650005802365700001602423700001502439700002102454773011202475852000902587856007602596655001202672IND4386339120221123005047.0061224s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438633912DNAL7 a172098072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02046.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachuca, A.10aMetal-chelating compounds produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi collected from pine plantations  ap. 7-12.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate the in vitro production of metal-chelating compounds by ectomycorrhizal fungi collected from pine plantations in southern Chile. Scleroderma verrucosum, Suillus luteus and two isolates of Rhizopogon luteolus were grown in solid and liquid modified Melin-Norkans (MMN) media with and without iron addition and the production of iron-chelating compounds was determined by Chrome Azurol S (CAS) assay. The presence of hydroxamate and catecholate-type compounds and organic acids was also investigated in liquid medium. All isolates produced iron-chelating compounds as detected by CAS assay, and catecholates, hydroxamates as well as oxalic, citric and succinic acids were also detected in all fungal cultures. Scleroderma verrucosum produced the greatest amounts of catecholates and hydroxamates whereas the highest amounts of organic acids were detected in S. luteus. Nevertheless, the highest catecholate, hydroxamate and organic acid concentrations did not correlate with the highest CAS reaction which was observed in R. luteolus (Yum isolate). Ectomycorrhizal fungi produced a variety of metal-chelating compounds when grown in liquid MMN medium. However, the addition of iron to all fungi cultures reduced the CAS reaction, hydroxamate and organic acid concentrations. Catecholate production was affected differently by iron, depending on the fungal isolate. The ectomycorrhizal fungi described in this study have never been reported to produce metal-chelating compound production. Moreover, apart from some wood-rotting fungi, this is the first evidence of the presence of catecholates in R. luteolus, S. luteus and S. verrucosum cultures. 3aRhizopogon luteolus 3aSuillus luteus 3aectomycorrhizae 3afungi 3airon 3aorganic acids and salts 3aplantations 2aBasidiomycotaxmetabolism 2aChelating Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aHydroxamic Acidsxisolation & purification 2aIronxmetabolism 2aMicrobiological Techniques 2aPinus sylvestrisxmicrobiology 2aSiderophoresxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification.1 aPereira, G.1 aAguiar, A.1 aMilagres, A.M.F.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.7-12dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02046.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02539naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245008500187300001400272500002400286520126800310650002501578650001101603650001701614650001101631650001501642650001201657650001701669650001601686650001801702650003601720650001001756650002401766650002701790650001601817700001501833700001501848700001601863700001601879773011301895852000902008856007602017655001202093IND4386338420221123005225.0061224s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438633842DNAL7 a172098112pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02035.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, H.10aPatulin accumulation in apples by Penicillium expansum during postharvest stages  ap. 30-35.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to assess the opportunities of Penicillium expansum to develop and produce patulin in apples during cold storage and in the steps prior to processing of apple products. Two lots of apples var. Golden with different ripeness degree were used. Half of each lot was fungicide treated. Apples were inoculated with P. expansum and stored at 1°C for 6 weeks. The extent of lesions and patulin accumulation both at the end of cold storage and after 3 days at 20°C were assessed. Short storage at 20°C aimed to simulate the transport and storage steps at room temperature before processing. Lesion size significantly increased during the storage at 20°C. An interaction between fungicide treatment and ripeness degree was found; efficiency of fungicide treatment was higher for ripe apples. Although lesions were evident after cold storage, no patulin was detected. Patulin was detected only when fruits were further stored at 20°C. Neither ripeness degree nor fungicide treatment affected patulin accumulation. Cold storage periods of 6 weeks do not lead to patulin accumulation. Shortening preprocessing times at warm temperatures would result into a reduction in patulin content at initial steps of fruits entering the processing plants. 3aPenicillium expansum 3aapples 3acold storage 3afruits 3afungicides 3apatulin 3astorage time 3atemperature 2aFood Handling 2aFruitxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aMalus 2aPatulinxmetabolism 2aPenicilliumxchemistry 2aTemperature1 aMarín, S.1 aRovira, A.1 aRamos, A.J.1 aSanchis, V.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.30-35dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02035.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02767naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245016700128300001600295500001500311520163100326650001701957650001801974650002401992650000902016650001102025650002002036650002102056650001902077650001202096650002302108650001502131650001402146653000802160700001702168700001802185773008802203852000902291930003302300945001302333946001102346655001202357IND2049752320221122203605.0960207e199601  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204975232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbert, T.P.10aDetection of the ORF3 polypeptide of feline calicivirus in infected cells and evidence for its expression from a single, functionally bicistronic, subgenomic mRNA  ap. 123-127.  a2019-12-05  aFeline calicivirus (FCV) is a small positive-stranded RNA virus within the family Caliciviridae. Its genome is 7690 nucleotides in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). The smallest, ORF3, is located at the extreme 3' end of the genome and can potentially encode a polypeptide of approximately 12 kDa. In this paper, we report the identification of an ORF3-encoded polypeptide in FCV-infected cells using an antiserum raised against a bacterially-expressed bacteriophage T7 gene 10-ORF3 fusion protein. Although a small mRNA of 0.5 kb, which could potentially encode ORF3, has been described, reports on the number and size of FCV subgenomic RNAs have varied considerably. To clarify the situation, RNAs from FCV-infected cells were labelled in vivo using [32P]orthophosphate, an approach which provided definitive data. Only two RNA species were detected, the genomic RNA and a subgenomic mRNA of 2.4 kb. The 5' end of the subgenomic mRNA was mapped to position 5227 on the genomic RNA using RNA sequencing and primer extension methods. RNA isolated from FCV-infected cells in which no subgenomic RNA smaller than 2.4 kb was detectable directed the synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate of the ORF3-encoded polypeptide. Furthermore, a synthetic RNA copy of the 2.4 kb subgenomic mRNA of FCV, containing both ORF2 and 3, directed the synthesis of both ORF2 and ORF3 polypeptides in the in vitro translation system. These data strongly suggest that ORF3 is expressed from the 2.4 kb subgenomic RNA and that this RNA is functionally bicistronic. The possible mechanisms by which ORF3 is expressed are discussed. 3apolypeptides 3amessenger RNA 3aopen reading frames 3acats 3agenome 3agene expression 3aprecipitin tests 3aviral proteins 3akidneys 3aFeline calicivirus 3acell lines 3ainfection 0aRNA1 aBrierley, I.1 aBrown, T.D.K.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 Jan., v. 77, no. pt.1 p.123-127x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02963naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245015200124300001600276500001500292520161700307650001301924650002701937650001801964650002201982650001302004650002902017650002602046650002002072650001902092650001902111650001802130653002602148653003902174653001702213653002802230653002502258700003702283700001502320700001602335773008802351852000902439930003302448945001302481946001102494655001202505IND2050113520221122170034.0960229e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205011352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafay, F.10aImmunodominant epitopes defined by a yeast-expressed library of random fragments of the rabies virus glycoprotein map outside major antigenic sites  ap. 339-346.  a2019-12-05  aNineteen yeast colonies secreting rabies virus glycoprotein (G) peptides immunoreactive with polyclonal anti-rabies virus sera were selected from a random expression library. The peptides, around 80 amino acids long, spanned amino acids 54-494 of the G protein. These peptides, together with two constructions including, respectively, immunodominant sites II and III, were analysed for their immunoreactivity with 40 anti-G protein monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) composed of 12 MAbs that reacted with SDS-treated protein in Western blot under reducing conditions (WB+) and 28 representative MAbs that did not react after denaturation (WB-). This last category represents 98% of anti-rabies virus G MAbs. None of the WB- MAbs bound peptides. Of the 12 WB+ MAbs, one bound two peptides situated before the transmembrane domain of the protein and six bound peptides overlapping a region situated between amino acids 223 and 276. These six MAbs define a new antigenic region that would be considered 'immunodominant' if the peptide strategy had been used to study the antigenicity of the protein; however, this region is only recognized by about 1% of our MAbs. Three of these WB+ MAbs had significant neutralizing activity; two were used for the selection of antigenic mutants (MAR mutants). Some mutants had a substitution within the region delimited by the peptides, confirming the pertinence of both the peptide and escape mutant approaches. However, a few mutants had a substitution outside the peptide-delimited region, suggesting that remote mutation(s) could affect epitope accessibility in the native protein. 3aepitopes 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aRabies lyssavirus 3apeptides 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amonoclonal antibodies 3agene expression 3aviral proteins 3aviral antigens 3aglycoproteins 0aglycoprotein peptides 0aneutralizing monoclonal antibodies 0aRabies virus 0aneutralizing antibodies 0avirus neutralization1 aBin Manṣūr, ʻAbd al-Wahhāb.1 aChebli, K.1 aFlamand, A.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 Feb., v. 77, no. pt.2 p.339-346x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01943naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245023100149300001600380520054200396650001600938650002900954650001700983650000901000650001201009650002301021650002801044650004001072650003001112650001101142650001801153650001101171650002501182650001301207650002901220650002901249650000901278650000901287650002501296773009801321852000901419930003301428945001301461946001101474655001201485IND2038592220221122102310.0940407e199312  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203859222DNAL7 a82993462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerpstra, A.H.M.10aComparison of the intravascular metabolism of cholesteryl esters and apoproteins of plasma low- and high-density lipoproteins in the rat (Rattus norvegicus), an animal species without plasma cholesteryl ester transfer activity  ap. 837-843.  aThe intravascular metabolism of the cholesteryl esters (CE) and apoproteins of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) was compared in the rat, an animal species without plasma cholesteryl ester transfer activity (CETA).

Here, we report the characterization of an RNA ligase from the thermophilic archaeon, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. The 381-amino acid Methanobacterium RNA ligase (MthRnl) catalyzes intramolecular ligation of 5'-PO₄ single-strand RNA to form a covalently closed circular RNA molecule through ligase-adenylylate and RNA-adenylylate (AppRNA) intermediates. At the optimal temperature of 65°C, AppRNA was predominantly ligated to a circular product. In contrast, at 35°C, phosphodiester bond formation was suppressed and the majority of the AppRNA was deadenylylated. Sedimentation analysis indicates that MthRnl is a homodimer in solution. The C-terminal 127-amino acid segment is required for dimerization, is itself capable of oligomeization and acts in trans to inhibit the ligation activity of native MthRnl. MthRnl can also join single-stranded DNA to form a circular molecule. The lack of specificity for RNA and DNA by MthRnl may exemplify an undifferentiated ancestral stage in the evolution of ATP-dependent ligases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMethanobacterium 3aRNA 3aRNA ligase (ATP) 3achemical bonding 3adimerization 3aevolution 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atemperature1 aTakagi, Yuko1 aHo, C.

Interactions between apoptosis and genome-maintenance mechanisms have been extensively documented and include transactivation-independent and -dependent functions, in which the tumor-suppressor protein p53 works as a 'molecular node' in the DNA-damage response. Although apoptosis and genome stability have been identified as ancient pathways in eukaryote phylogeny, the biological evolution underlying the emergence of an integrated system remains largely unknown. Here, using computational methods, we reconstruct the evolutionary scenario that linked apoptosis with genome stability pathways in a functional human gene/protein association network. We found that the entanglement of DNA repair, chromosome stability and apoptosis gene networks appears with the caspase gene family and the antiapoptotic gene BCL2. Also, several critical nodes that entangle apoptosis and genome stability are cancer genes (e.g. ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and TP53), although their orthologs have arisen in different points of evolution. Our results demonstrate how genome stability and apoptosis were co-opted during evolution recruiting genes that merge both systems. We also provide several examples to exploit this evolutionary platform, where we have judiciously extended information on gene essentiality inferred from model organisms to human.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3achromosomes 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3ahumans 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3anucleic acids 3aphylogeny 3atumor suppressor proteins1 aDalmolin, Rodrigo J.S.1 aMoreira, José C.F.1 aMombach, José C.M.1 ade Almeida, Rita M.C.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Nov., v. 36, no. 19 p.6269-6283x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn6363Available from publisher's Web site  a20081107b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02350naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245009200164300001600256520084600272650002901118650001201147650001501159650001901174650002201193650000901215650001101224650001601235651001001251651001101261700001501272700002501287700001501312700001801327700001701345700001401362700001401376700001901390700001701409700001601426700001501442700001501457700001901472700001601491700001401507700002501521773012401546852000901670856008301679930003301762946001301795655001201808IND4412382820221121110900.0081107e20081107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441238282DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11639652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Pingzhong12aA Test of Climate, Sun, and Culture Relationships from an 1810-Year Chinese Cave Record  ap. 940-942.  aA record from Wanxiang Cave, China, characterizes Asian Monsoon (AM) history over the past 1810 years. The summer monsoon correlates with solar variability, Northern Hemisphere and Chinese temperature, Alpine glacial retreat, and Chinese cultural changes. It was generally strong during Europe's Medieval Warm Period and weak during Europe's Little Ice Age, as well as during the final decades of the Tang, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties, all times that were characterized by popular unrest. It was strong during the first several decades of the Northern Song Dynasty, a period of increased rice cultivation and dramatic population increase. The sign of the correlation between the AM and temperature switches around 1960, suggesting that anthropogenic forcing superseded natural forcing as the major driver of AM changes in the late 20th century. 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3aglaciation 3amonsoon season 3apopulation growth 3arice 3asummer 3atemperature 3aChina 3aEurope1 aCheng, Hai1 aEdwards, R.

In this study, the EGF-induced increase of CEBPB mRNA is shown to be coincident with the decrease of COX-2 mRNA. We identified that all of the individual CEBPB isoforms, LAP1, LAP2 and LIP, attenuate EGF-induced COX-2 promoter activity. Although increased sumoylation of both LAP1 and LAP2 is observed during the lagging stage of EGF treatment, only the sumoylated LAP1, but not the sumoylated LAP2, is responsible for COX-2 gene repression. In addition, EGF treatment can regulate the nucleocytoplasmic redistribution of HDAC4 and SUMO1. We further demonstrated by loss-of- and gain-of-function approaches that HDAC4 can be a negative regulator while inactivating COX-2 transcription. The sumoylation mutant LAP1, LAP1K174A, exhibits an attenuated ability to interact with HDAC4, and increased COX-2 promoter activity. Furthermore, the in vivo DNA binding assay demonstrated that LAP1K174A and CEBPDK120A, sumoylation-defective CEBPD mutants, attenuate the binding of HDAC4 on the COX-2 promoter. In light of the above, our data suggest that the suCEBPD and suLAP1 are involved in the repression of COX-2 transcription through the recruitment of HDAC4.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aadipogenesis 3again-of-function mutation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3amessenger RNA 3amutants1 aLee, Yi-Chao1 aYang, Wen-Ming1 aChang, Wen-Chang1 aWang, Ju-Ming0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Nov., v. 36, no. 19 p.6066-6079x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn6073Available from publisher's Web site  a20081107b20081206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02359naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011800129300001800247520094900265650003201214650001501246650002201261650002101283650002501304650002501329650001701354650001101371650001001382650001801392650002301410650002501433650002001458650001901478653001301497653002401510653001101534653002801545653002201573653002801595653001901623700001701642700002001659700001801679773009001697852000901787930003301796945001301829946001101842655001201853IND2052769220221121110848.0960827e199606  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205276922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohansen, I.E.10aBiological and molecular properties of a pathotype P-1 and a pathotype P-4 isolate of pea seed-borne mosaic virus  ap. 1329-1333.  aTwo isolates of pea seed-borne mosaic potyvirus, DPD1 and NY, were identified as pathotypes P-1 and P-4, respectively, by their infectivity on Pisum sativum L. lines homozygous for the recessive resistance genes skim-1 and sbm-4. The two isolates differed in several biological characteristics. DPD1 induced transient vein clearing, downward rolling of leaflets and internode shortening on P. sativum, whereas NY only caused a slight growth reduction. DPD1 moved systemically in Chenopodium quinoa whereas NY was restricted to inoculated leaves. DPD1 was frequently transmitted by seeds whereas NY was rarely seed-transmitted: 24% and 0.3%, respectively, in P. sativum '549'. Both DPD1 and NY were transmitted by aphids (Myzus persicae), though a DAG triplet was not present in the N terminus of the coat protein. The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of NY were determined and compared to the corresponding sequences of DPD1. 3aPea seed-borne mosaic virus 3apathotypes 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3apathogenesis 3aleaves 3astems 3aPisum sativum 3aChenopodium quinoa 3adisease transmission 3adisease vectors 3aMyzus persicae 0asymptoms 0aseedborne organisms 0aspread 0aexperimental infections 0aseed transmission 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x899971 aKeller, K.E.1 aDougherty, W.G.1 aHampton, R.O.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 June, v. 77, no. pt.6 p.1329-1333x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02020naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003900110245015900149300001800308520083000326650001801156650001901174650001401193650001501207650001201222650001101234653002501245653001601270653001701286653002301303653001501326700001601341700001601357700001701373700001901390700001901409700001401428773009001442852000901532930003301541945001301574946001101587655001201598IND2053216220221121080014.0960925e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205321622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Drunen Littel-Van Den Hurk, S.10aGlycoprotein H (gII/gp 108) and glycoprotein L form a functional complex which plays a role in penetration, but not in attachment, of bovine herpesvirus 1  ap. 1515-1520.  aThe glycoproteins of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) play important roles in the interactions between virions and target cells. A 108 kDa glycoprotein, designated gII or gp 108, has been identified by two different panels of monoclonal antibodies. The gII- and gp108-specific monoclonal antibodies were shown to react with the same protein, which was identified by N-terminal sequencing as the homologue of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)gH. When BHV-1 gH was purified by immunoadsorbent chromatography, gL was co-purified. The gH-gL complex induced the production of antibodies that neutralized virus infectivity and inhibited virus penetration. Affinity-purified gH-gL did prevent penetration, but not attachment of BHV-1, which suggests that the gH-gL complex is essential for penetration of BHV-1 into susceptible cells. 3aglycoproteins 3aviral proteins 3ainfection 3acell lines 3akidneys 3acattle 0avirus neutralization 0apenetration 0ainteractions 0abovine herpesvirus 0amdbk cells1 aKhattar, S.1 aTikoo, S.K.1 aBabiuk, L.A.1 aBaranowski, E.1 aPlainchamp, D.1 aThiry, E.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 July, v. 77, no. pt.7 p.1515-1520x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02291naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013800125300001800263500001500281520094300296650001801239650002101257650001801278650002401296650002501320650001901345650001001364653002201374653001901396653001601415653000801431653001101439653001901450653002801469653001601497653001901513653002501532653001801557653001401575653002101589700001601610700001501626773009001641852000901731930003301740945001301773946001101786655001201797IND2053215320221121075954.0960925e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205321532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieler, E.14aThe region between the M and S genes of porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus is highly similar to human coronavirus OC43  ap. 1443-1447.  a2019-12-05  aThe nucleotide sequences of the regions between the membrane and spike protein genes of three strains of porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) were determined. A total of 739 (HEV strain 67N) and 751 (strains NT9 and VW572) nucleotides were sequenced. Two ORFs, potentially encoding proteins of 12.8 and 9.6 kDa, were identified. Pairwise comparisons with the corresponding ORFs in bovine coronavirus (BCV) and human coronavirus (HCV) OC43 revealed sequence similarities of greater than 88.5% at the nucleotide and 85.3 % at the amino acid level for the 12.8 kDa ORF product. For the 9.6 kDa ORF product similarities were greater than 96.9% and 95.2%, respectively. An additional 12 nucleotide deletion upstream of the 12.8 kDa ORF start codon was found in HEV 67N compared to NT9 and VW572.

The effectiveness of skin scarification routes as portals of entry for infectivity had not previously been tested experimentally but this study has shown that these are efficient routes for establishing infection in mice using the 139A and ME7 strains of scrapie agent. Scarification had much the same efficiency as inoculation by the intraperitoneal, intravenous or perivenous routes but was not effective in immunocompromised (SCID) mice. It was concluded that replication of infectivity within the lymphoreticular system, which is precluded in SCID mice, is a necessary prerequisite for the development of infection in the central nervous system following inoculation via scarification. 3awounds and injuries 3amice 3aPrPSc proteins 0askin 0aexperimental infection1 aMcConnell, I.1 aFraser, H.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 July, v. 77, no. pt.7 p.1595-1599x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03377naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245014800125300001800273520155700291650002201848650002101870650002501891650002501916650001801941650001401959650002701973650001402000650003202014651001102046653001802057653002502075653002702100653002802127653001902155653001902174653001902193653001902212653001902231653001902250653001902269653001902288653001902307653001902326653001902345653001902364653001902383653001902402653001902421653001902440653001902459653001902478700001902497700001802516700002002534700001702554773009002571852000902661930003302670945001302703946001102716655001202727IND2053216020221121080016.0960925e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205321602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, M.10aHeterogeneity in the haemagglutinin gene and emergence of the highly pathogenic phenotype among recent H5N2 avian influenza viruses from Mexico  ap. 1493-1504.  aMolecular changes in the haemagglutinin (HA)-coding regions and proteolytic cleavage sites from multiple H5N2 subtype viruses isolated during a recent outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in central Mexico have been characterized. Eighteen isolates, collected during a 15 month period (October 1993 to January 1995) from six central states, were sequenced. None of the 18 predicted HA1 amino acid sequences were identical and changes were not restricted to a specific region of the sequence. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA1 sequences demonstrated two virus lineages, designated Puebla and Jalisco, with sequence variation as high as 10.5% for amino acid and 6.2% for nucleotide sequences. During the latter months of the surveillance period, highly pathogenic (HP) strains of AI emerged causing lethal disease in commercial poultry flocks. In each of the HP strains isolated, the HA protein was cleaved in chicken embryo fibroblast cells in the absence of trypsin, and two alterations not found in earlier non-HP isolates were detected. In the HA protein, HP strains all had a glutamic acid replaced by lysine substitution at amino acid position 324 and an insertion of arginine and lysine as new residues 325 and 326. The insertion appears to be due to a duplication of the nucleotide sequence AAAGAA at nucleotide positions 965-970 of the HA1-coding region. Computer-assisted secondary structure analyses place the target for the insertion in a predicted RNA stem-loop structure. A mechanism is suggested by which the polymerase duplicates the sequence. 3aInfluenza A virus 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3amolecular conformation 3aphenotype 3aprotein secondary structure 3aMexico 0aheterogeneity 0aviral hemagglutinins 0acleavage site sequence 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u37165 0agenbank/u37166 0agenbank/u37167 0agenbank/u37168 0agenbank/u37169 0agenbank/u37170 0agenbank/u37171 0agenbank/u37172 0agenbank/u37173 0agenbank/u37174 0agenbank/u37175 0agenbank/u37176 0agenbank/u37177 0agenbank/u37178 0agenbank/u37179 0agenbank/u37180 0agenbank/u37181 0agenbank/u371821 aCrawford, J.M.1 aLatimer, J.W.1 aRivera-Cruz, E.1 aPerdue, M.L.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 July, v. 77, no. pt.7 p.1493-1504x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02701naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245017500124300001800299500001500317520118600332650002401518650002101542650001501563650002201578650001401600650002501614650002501639650001401664650002201678650001401700650001001714651001001724653001401734653001701748653001901765653002501784653002801809653001901837700001501856700001601871700001501887700001501902700001601917700001801933700001301951700001301964700001401977773009001991852000902081930003302090945001302123946001102136655001202147IND2053400520221121080035.0961004e199608  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205340052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuchi, A.10aLarge outbreak of swine influenza in southern Japan caused by reassortant (H1N2) influenza viruses: its epizootic background and characterization of the causative viruses  ap. 1751-1759.  a2019-12-05  aIn the winter of 1989 and the spring of 1990, there were large outbreaks of respiratory disease in two swine herds in Nagasaki Prefecture, southern Japan. Serological surveillance indicated that the majority of swine possessed antibodies to swine influenza virus H1 haemagglutinin and neuraminidase of early H3N2 influenza virus strains. Eight viruses were isolated from swine that showed typical clinical symptoms of influenza. The haemagglutinin and neuraminidase of these isolates were closely related to those of swine H1N1 and early human H3N2 viruses, respectively. At least two types of haemagglutinin antigens, distinguished by two monoclonal antibodies, were involved in the outbreaks. Evolutionary analyses indicated that the haemagglutinin gene of the H1N2 reassortants was closely related to those of a recent swine lineage (A/sw/HK/1/74 and A/sw/Ehime/ 1/80 viruses). However, the neuraminidase genes of the H1N2 reassortants were similar to those of swine N2 viruses which in turn are related to early human H3N2 viruses. A comparison of partial nucleotide sequences revealed that the six other genes of A/sw/Nagasaki/1/89 were derived from those of swine H1N1 virus. 3aserological surveys 3astructural genes 3aantibodies 3aInfluenza A virus 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3asialidase 3agenetic variation 3ainfluenza 3aswine 3aJapan 0aoutbreaks 0aepidemiology 0agenbank/d00782 0aviral hemagglutinins 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d007811 aNerome, K.1 aKanegae, Y.1 aIshida, M.1 aNerome, R.1 aHayashi, K.1 aHashimoto, T.1 aKaji, M.1 aKaji, Y.1 aInaba, Y.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 Aug., v. 77, no. pt.8 p.1751-1759x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02304naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010700123300001800230500001500248520103300263650001801296650000801314650002201322650001101344650003101355650002501386650002501411650002201436650002801458653001901486653001601505653002801521653001901549653001601568653001901584700001301603700001601616700001501632700001401647700001701661773009001678852000901768930003301777945001301810946001101823655001201834IND2053400320221121075956.0961004e199608  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205340032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWutz, G.10aEquine rhinovirus serotypes 1 and 2: relationship to each other and to aphthoviruses and cardioviruses  ap. 1719-1730.  a2019-12-05  aEquine rhinoviruses (ERVs) are picornaviruses which cause a mild respiratory infection in horses. The illness resembles the common cold brought about by rhinoviruses in humans; however, the presence of a viraemia during ERV-1 infection, the occurrence of persistent infections and the physical properties are all more reminiscent of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). cDNA cloning and sequencing of the genomes of ERV-1 and ERV-2 between the poly(C) and poly(A) tracts showed that the serotypes are heterogeneous. Nevertheless, the genomic architecture of both serotypes is most similar to that of FMDV. Indeed, a comparison of the derived protein sequences of ERV-1 shows that their identity is greatest to FMDV. In contrast, most ERV-2 proteins are more related to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) proteins than they are to FMDV or ERV-1. These results place ERV-1 alongside FMDV in the aphthovirus genus of the picornavirus family and indicate that this virus may serve as a model system for examining the biology of FMDV. 3acoat proteins 3aRNA 3acomplementary DNA 3agenome 3aEncephalomyocarditis virus 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3aEquine rhinitis A virus 0agenbank/x96870 0acomparisons 0amolecular sequence data 0aviral proteins 0aAphthovirus 0agenbank/x968711 aAuer, H.1 aNowotny, N.1 aGrosse, B.1 aSkern, T.1 aKuechler, E.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 Aug., v. 77, no. pt.8 p.1719-1730x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02197naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012800124300001800252500001500270520104900285650001401334650002101348650003101369650001201400650002201412650002601434650001301460650002201473650001201495650001701507650001101524653001401535653001101549653001301560653002801573700001801601773009001619852000901709930003301718945001301751946001101764655001201775IND2053403320221121080049.0961004e199608  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205340332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPooma, W.10aTomato golden mosaic virus open reading frame AL4 is genetically distinct from its C4 analogue in monopartite geminiviruses  ap. 1949-1951.  a2019-12-05  aTomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) is a bipartite geminivirus with six well-characterized genes. An additional open reading frame (ORF), AL4, lies within the essential AL1 gone. Recent studies of monopartite, dicot-infecting geminiviruses have revealed that mutations in their analogous C4 ORFs have host-specific effects on infectivity, symptomatology, virus movement and/or viral DNA accumulation. We have investigated whether TGMV has a similar host-specific requirement for AL4. The phenotypes of three TGMV a/4 mutants were determined in a range of hosts, which included species that revealed c4 mutant phenotypes for monopartite geminiviruses. Each TGMV a/4 mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type TGMV in all hosts tested. Additional analyses of double mutants revealed no evidence for functional redundancy between AL4 and the AL3, or AR1 genes. In contrast to the putative C4 proteins of monopartite geminiviruses, TGMV AL4, if it is expressed, is either nonfunctional, or functionally redundant with an essential TGMV gene product. 3aphenotype 3astructural genes 3aTomato golden mosaic virus 3aPetunia 3aDatura stramonium 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3amutation 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3aleaves 0aNicotiana 0agenome 0asymptoms 0aexperimental infections1 aPetty, I.T.D.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 Aug., v. 77, no. pt.8 p.1949-1951x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01773naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012800130300001600258520076600274650002501040650001901065650001601084650001101100650001301111650001901124650001401143650001901157653002201176653002401198700001901222700001701241773008701258852000901345930003301354945001301387946001101400655001201411IND2051814420221121075959.0960621e199605  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205181442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegorburu, F.J.10aFeatures on the surface of the tobacco rattle tobravirus particle that are antigenic and sensitive to proteolytic digestion  ap. 855-859.  aThe particle proteins of tobraviruses and tobamoviruses share six sequence motifs, two of which are also present in furoviruses and hordeiviruses. Analyses of four different polyclonal antisera to tobacco rattle tobravirus by Pepscan revealed that the C-terminal region of the particle protein was immunodominant. The N-terminal region and a central region (residues 11-121) were more weakly immunogenic. These results suggest that these regions are exposed externally on the assembled virus particle. Papain digestion showed that the C terminus can be removed without apparent structural damage to the particle. The external location of the C-terminal region along the sides of the particle could explain some transmission properties of the rod-shaped viruses. 3aTobacco rattle virus 3aviral proteins 3aproteolysis 3apapain 3aepitopes 3aimmunoblotting 3aantiserum 3aviral antigens 0aparticle proteins 0apolyclonal antisera1 aRobinson, D.J.1 aTorrance, L.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 May, v. 77, no. pt.5 p.855-859x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02927naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012600125300001600251520173100267650003201998650002302030650001902053650001902072650002502091650002002116650002302136650001502159650002202174650001902196650002002215653001402235653002902249700001602278700002002294700002102314700001702335773008702352852000902439930003302448945001302481946001102494655001202505IND2051814620221121075952.0960621e199605  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205181462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, R.Y.10aLoss of potyvirus transmissibility and helper-component activity correlate with non-retention of virions in aphid stylets  ap. 861-867.  aThe hypothesis that loss of aphid transmissibility of potyvirus mutants is due to non-retention of virions in the mouthparts was tested by feeding aphids through membranes on purified virions of aphid transmissible (AT or HAT) and non-aphid-transmissible (NAT) tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV) or tobacco etch virus (TEV), in the presence of functional [potato virus Y (PVY) HC or TVMV HC] or non -functional (PVC HC) helper component (HC). TVMV virions were detected, by electron microscopic examination of immunogold-labelled thin sections, in the food canal or cibarium of 57% of 28 aphids fed on the transmissible combination of TVMV-AT and functional HC, while no virions were found in these structures in 25 aphids fed on the nontransmissible combinations: TVMV-NAT and PVY HC, or TVMV-AT and PVC HC. Autoradiography of intact stylets allowed the examination of much larger numbers of aphids, fed on 125I-labelled TEV; 48% of 523 aphid fed on the TEV-HAT and PVY HC combination retained label in the stylets; this correlated well with the percentage transmission in bioassays. In contrast, in non-transmissible combinations, label was found in the stylets of 0.77% of 389 aphids fed on TEV-NAT and PVY HC, and 1.35% of 223 aphids fed on TEV-HAT and PVC HC. No differences were found in the overall amount of label in the bodies of aphids fed on the transmissible and non-transmissible combinations. There was a strong tendency for virions to be retained in the distal third of the stylets; 56% of aphids positive for TVMV, and 82% of those positive for TEV, had label in this area. These data support the concept that virions retained within the stylets are those that are primarily involved in potyvirus transmission. 3aTobacco vein mottling virus 3aTobacco etch virus 3aPotato virus Y 3aviral proteins 3adisease transmission 3adisease vectors 3avectorial capacity 3amouthparts 3avector competence 3aMyzus persicae 3aautoradiography 0aretention 0ahelper component protein1 aAmmar, E.D.1 aThornbury, D.W.1 aLopez-Moya, J.J.1 aPirone, T.P.0 tJournal of general virology.g1996 May, v. 77, no. pt.5 p.861-867x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02168naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245006800122300001600190520098800206650003001194650001901224650002101243650002201264650002401286650001501310650002201325650001001347650002601357650001201383650003501395650002301430650002701453650001401480651001101494651001101505700001501516700001601531700002201547773008701569852000901656930003301665945001301698946001101711655001201722IND2051815320221121075955.0960621e199605  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205181532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, H.10aCharacterization of the African swine fever virion protein j18L  ap. 941-946.  aThe African swine fever virus (ASFV) open reading frame (ORF) that is named j18L in the Malawi (LIL20/1) isolate and E199L in the Ba71V isolate encodes a cysteine rich protein of 195 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 21.7 kDa and a hydrophobic domain near the C terminus.

A. fraterculus larvae have a midgut region with a luminal pH of 3.4, and display a pepstatin-inhibited acid proteolytic activity which has a spec. act. (7.2 U/mg protein) similar to that of M. domestica. 3. The midgut lysozyme from M. domestica and A. fraterculus is more active (high ionic strength) at pH 3.5 than at pH 6.0, the contrary being true for a midgut chitinase. 4. The results suggest that the adaptations to digest bacteria in insects are similar to those in vertebrate foregut fermenters, and that these characteristics were probably present in the Cyclorrhapha ancestor, but not in the Diptera ancestor. 3alysozyme 3aTrichosia pubescens 3amidgut 3afat body 3aAnastrepha fraterculus 3adigestion 3ahemolymph 3apH 3asalivary glands 3acarcass composition 3alarvae 3aenzyme activity 3aMusca domestica 3abacteria 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBacteriolysis 2aBiological Evolution 2aChitinasesxmetabolism. 2aDipteraxmetabolism 2aHousefliesxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrolasesxmetabolism 2aLarvaxmetabolism 2aMuramidasexmetabolism 0aSciaridae1 aTerra, W.R.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1991, v. 100, no. 2 p.265-268x0305-04917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02702naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012500126300001800251500001500269520146100284650001801745650003301763650002201796650002401818650001101842650002501853650001701878650000801895650003201903653003101935653002401966653002801990653001902018653002502037653001902062700001602081700001502097773009002112852000902202930003302211945001302244946001102257655001202268IND2047691720221121000823.0950911e199508  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204769172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoonham, N.14aThe nucleotide sequence and proposed genome organization of oat chlorotic stunt virus, a new soil-borne virus of cereals  ap. 2025-2034.  a2019-12-05  aThe complete genomic sequence of a new virus, first found infecting oats in Wales, UK, has been determined. The genome is a positive-sense ssRNA molecule, 4114 nucleotides in length, examination of which indicates the presence of four ORFs. The first ORF initiating at the 5' terminus (ORF1) encodes a protein with a predicted Mr of 23 476 (p23). ORF2 extends through the amber termination codon of ORF1 to give a protein with a predicted Mr of 84355 (p84). The readthrough domain of p84 contains amino acid sequence similarities with a number of putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. ORF3 is in a different reading frame from ORF1/2 and encodes a protein with an Mr of 48231 (p48), identified as the coat protein by direct peptide sequencing. ORF4 nests within ORF3 but is in a different frame from it and codes for a protein with a predicted Mr of 8220 (p8). Comparisons of peptide sequence, particularly within the putative polymerase region and within the S domain of the coat protein, highlight similarities with members of both the tombusvirus and carmovirus groups. The coat protein region shows most similarity with members of the tombusvirus group, whilst the size and predicted strategy of the genome seem to be intermediate between that of the carmovirus and tombusvirus groups. These features highlight possible evolutionary links with each group whilst being distinct from both. We propose the name of oat chlorotic stunt for this new virus. 3acoat proteins 3aplant diseases and disorders 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3agenome 3aamino acid sequences 3aAvena sativa 3aRNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 0aunclassified plant viruses 0asingle stranded rna 0amolecular sequence data 0aviral proteins 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/x839641 aHenry, C.M.1 aWood, K.R.0 tJournal of general virology.g1995 Aug., v. 76, no. pt.8 p.2025-2034x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02512naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011200128300001800240520136700258650001001625650001901635650001201654650002001666650002101686650001201707650002501719650001301744653001201757700001601769700001601785700001401801700001701815700001701832700001801849700001801867700001701885700002001902773009001922852000902012930003302021945001302054946001102067655001202078IND2047693320221121004200.0950911e199508  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204769332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClouscard, C.10aDifferent allelic effects of the codons 136 and 171 of the prion protein gene in sheep with natural scrapie  ap. 2097-2101.  aScrapie is a transmissible degenerative disease of the central nervous system occurring naturally in sheep. II belongs to the group of prion diseases also affecting man in which an abnormal isoform of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP) accumulating in the brain is responsible for neuronal death. Three main polymorphisms have been described in the sheep PrP gene, at positions 136, 154 and 171. A strong association between susceptibility/resistance to natural scrapie and a dimorphism at codon 136 of the ovine PrP gene has been reported in several breeds, including Romanov. This dimorphism, however, is not found in all scrapie-affected breeds. We have compared the PrP genotypes of Lacaune sheep obtained from enzootically affected flocks with those of apparently healthy sheep. A third variant at codon 171 was also evidenced. The results were compared with those obtained in a single experimental Romanov flock orally challenged with nematode parasites in which scrapie suddenly appeared and killed 80 % of the sheep. We present evidence that, even in different epizootological circumstances, the major genetic factor controlling the susceptibility/resistance to natural scrapie in sheep, is represented by codon 171 genotype of the PrP gene. We also suggest that a modification of the allelic effects of codon 136 can occur in heavily infected animals. 3asheep 3aPrPSc proteins 3ascrapie 3aanimal proteins 3astructural genes 3aalleles 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 0alacaune1 aBeaudry, P.1 aElsen, J.M.1 aMilan, D.1 aDussaucy, M.1 aBounneau, C.1 aSchelcher, F.1 aChatelain, J.1 aLaunay, J.M.1 aLaplanche, J.L.0 tJournal of general virology.g1995 Aug., v. 76, no. pt.8 p.2097-2101x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02145naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002600169245013600195300001800331520089700349592002801246650001401274650002501288650002601313650000901339650002801348650002001376650001401396650002001410700002301430700001801453700002101471700002001492700002701512700002201539773009101561856008601652852000901738655001201747IND4459979920221118040414.0141111e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445997992DNAL7 a252123372pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.05.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega-Gálvez, Antonio10aEffect of high hydrostatic pressure on functional properties and quality characteristics of Aloe vera gel (Aloe barbadensis Miller)  ap. 1060-1065.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of high hydrostatic pressure treatment at three pressure levels (300, 400 and 500Mpa) on the functional and quality characteristics of Aloe vera gel including vitamin C and E, aloin, minerals, phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The results show that HHP exerted a clear influence on minerals content, vitamin C and E content, antioxidant activity, total phenolic and aloin content. After 35days of storage all treated samples presented a decrease in mineral content, except for phosphorus. Total phenolic content and vitamin C and E content decreased at high pressures (500MPa), while all pressurised samples showed a higher antioxidant activity and aloin content than untreated sample after 35days of storage.

Light microscopy, electron microscopy and other biochemical methods were used to show that injection of lithium carbonate nano-sized particles to the periphery of the tumour results in enhanced destructive processes within the tumour. The number of neutrophils and macrophages in the tumour increased, whereas the density of blood vessels and haemoglobin concentration were reduced; the extent of tumour necrosis lipid peroxidation and production of nitric oxide was also increased. At the same time, the activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase remained the same.

The method involved directly treating the lyophilized culture filtrate with a derivatizing reagent, converting the mixture of toxins in the filtrate to their corresponding trimethylsilyl derivatives, and consequent analysis by EI-MS. The method is rapid, sensitive and highly specific for the identification and analysis of the toxins in a complex sample matrix. Analysis of culture filtrates using this method suggested that phytotoxicity correlates with the level of ascaulitoxin in the culture filtrate. A new method for the purification of 2,4,7-triamino-5-hydroxyoctandioic acid, the aglycone of ascaulitoxin, is also described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphytotoxins 3afreeze drying 3aphytotoxicity 3aacids 3arapid methods 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3apurification methods 3aculture filtrates 3aAscochyta 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aRimando, Agnes M.1 aAndolfi, Anna1 aEvidente, Antonio0 tAnalytical methods.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 2, no. 2 p.159-163dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/551553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b9ay00162j3Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/113369_A_New_GC_MS_Fiore_M404.pdf  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03827naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010600162300001600268520202600284592002802310650002302338650001002361650001302371650001002384650001402394650001402408650001302422650001402435650001002449650002502459650001202484650001302496700002002509700002602529700001902555700002102574700002202595700002102617700002302638700002202661700002202683700002102705700002302726700002002749700002002769700002102789700001702810700001802827700001802845700001702863700002902880700002002909700002002929773018202949856007303131852000903204655001203213IND60125933820221117234608.0150428e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593382DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirkiä, Päivi M.10aFecundity selection does not vary along a large geographical cline of trait means in a passerine bird  ap. 808-827.  aLocal environmental and ecological conditions are commonly expected to result in local adaptation, although there are few examples of variation in phenotypic selection across continent‐wide spatial scales. We collected standardized data on selection with respect to the highly variable plumage coloration of pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca Pall.) males from 17 populations across the species' breeding range. The observed selection on multiple male coloration traits via the annual number of fledged young was generally relatively weak. The main aim of the present study, however, was to examine whether the current directional selection estimates are associated with distance to the sympatric area with the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis Temminck), a sister species with which the pied flycatcher is showing character displacement. This pattern was expected because plumage traits in male pied flycatchers are changing with the distance to these areas of sympatry. However, we did not find such a pattern in current selection on coloration. There were no associations between current directional selection on ornamentation and latitude or longitude either. Interestingly, current selection on coloration traits was not associated with the observed mean plumage traits of the populations. Thus, there do not appear to be geographical gradients in current directional fecundity selection on male plumage ornamentation. The results of the present study do not support the idea that constant patterns in directional fecundity selection would play a major role in the maintenance of coloration among populations in this species. By contrast, the tendency for relatively weak mosaic‐like variation in selection among populations could reflect just a snapshot of temporally variable, potentially environment‐dependent, selection, as suggested by other studies in this system. Such fine‐grained variable selection coupled with gene flow could maintain extensive phenotypic variation across populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFicedula hypoleuca 3abirds 3abreeding 3acolor 3afecundity 3agene flow 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amales 3aphenotypic variation 3aplumage 3asympatry1 aAdamík, Peter,1 aArtemyev, Alexandr V.1 aBelskii, Eugen1 aBoth, Christiaan1 aBureš, Stanislav1 aBurgess, Malcolm1 aBushuev, Andrey V.1 aForsman, Jukka T.1 aGrinkov, Vladimir1 aHoffmann, Dieter1 aJärvinen, Antero,1 aKrál, Miroslav1 aKrams, Indrikis1 aLampe, Helene M.1 aMoreno, Juan1 aMägi, Marko,1 aNord, Andreas1 aPotti, Jaime1 aRavussin, Pierre‐Alain1 aSokolov, Leonid1 aLaaksonen, Toni0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 Apr., v. 114, no. 4 p.808-827dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010500179300001800284520106700302592002801369650001801397650002101415650002201436650002001458650001601478650002001494650001401514650002001528650001301548650002201561650002001583653002201603653002101625653002101646653003701667700002401704700003001728700001401758700001201772773010501784856008401889852000901973655001201982IND60122703320221122041824.0150325e20141202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012270332DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9255102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayunigari, Mithil Kumar10aDevelopment of anti-scale poly(aspartic acid–citric acid) dual polymer systems for water treatment  ap. 2903-2909.  aThe formation of calcium sulphate and calcium carbonate scale poses major problems in heat exchangers and water cooling systems, thereby affecting the performance of these types of equipment. In order to inhibit these scale formations, new types of biodegradable water soluble single polymer and dual poly(aspartic acid–citric acid) polymers were developed and tested. The effectiveness of single polymer and four different compositions of poly aspartic acid and citric acid dual polymer systems as scale inhibitors were evaluated. Details of the synthesis, thermal stability, scale inhibition and the morphological characterization of single and dual polymers are presented in this scientific paper. It was found that the calcium sulphate scale inhibition rate was in the range 76.06–91.45%, while the calcium carbonate scale inhibition rate observed was in the range 23.37–30.0% at 65–70 °C. The finding suggests that the water soluble dual polymers are very effective in sulphate scale inhibition in comparison of calcium carbonate scale inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartic acid 3abiodegradability 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium sulfate 3acitric acid 3acooling systems 3aequipment 3aheat exchangers 3apolymers 3athermal stability 3awater treatment 0acalcium carbonate 0acalcium sulphate 0ascale deposition 0awater treatment and dual polymer1 aGupta, Sanjay Kumar1 aVaraprasad, Kokkarachedu,1 aKanny, K.1 aBux, F.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2014 Dec. 2, v. 35, no. 23 p.2903-2909dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.9255103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010600163300001800269520151300287592002801800650001901828650000901847650002401856650001101880650001601891650001301907650001501920651001101935651001101946700001901957700002001976700001701996700001902013773010602032856008102138852000902219655001202228IND60081785920221121061822.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008178592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-013-0414-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiv, Baruch10aTrends in rainfall regime over Israel, 1975–2010, and their relationship to large-scale variability  ap. 1751-1764.  aVariations and trends in the rain regime of Israel are analyzed for 1975–2010, when persistent global warming has been observed. Negative trend is observed over the majority of Israel, statistically significant only in the super-arid region. The decrease is significant over the majority of Israel only in the spring, reflecting a shortening of the rainy season, >3 days/decade. The dry spells are becoming longer, significantly in most of the stations. The factors affecting these variations, synoptic systems, large-scale oscillations and global temperature, were studied for extended period, 1953–2010. A simple multiple stepwise regression model applied for the inter-annual rainfall variations indicates that the occurrence of Cyprus lows is the dominant factor and the Mediterranean oscillation index, MOI2, is also a significant factor. In order to reduce the inter-annual noise and reveal inter-decadal variations, the time-series of the rainfall and its potential predictors were smoothed by 11-year window, showing an increase toward the 1990s, followed by a decrease, at a higher rate, onward. Correspondingly, the aridity lines propagated southward till the mid-1990s and then withdrew back, at a larger rate. The large-scale oscillations and the global temperature explain 83 % of the variance on the inter-decadal time-scale, half of it explained by the global temperature alone. The findings of this study support the expected poleward expansion of the Hadley cell due to global warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal warming 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aspring 3atemperature 3avariance 3awet season 3aCyprus 3aIsrael1 aSaaroni, Hadas1 aPargament, Roee1 aHarpaz, Tzvi1 aAlpert, Pinhas0 tRegional environmental change.g2014 Oct., v. 14, no. 5 p.1751-1764dSpringer-Verlagx1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-013-0414-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100010900140245013100249300001800380520170000398592002802098650003102126650002102157650001602178650003202194650001002226650001102236650002102247650001302268650001402281650003002295650001102325650002402336650001202360650000902372650001702381650003802398700001502436700001802451700001302469700001602482700001802498700001802516700002002534700022102554773014202775856007402917852000902991655001203000IND60642775020221120035607.0190508e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064277502DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb01579h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFanThese authors contributed equally to this work and should be considered as co-first authors., Jiabing10aImplementation of a stratified approach and gene immobilization to enhance the osseointegration of a silk-based ligament graft  ap. 7035-7050.  aA silk scaffold exhibits high potential for the human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction due to its exceptional mechanics as well as biocompatibility. Inefficient ACL interface restoration is thought to be a major hurdle for the common implementation of a silk-based ligament graft. By integrating a stratified approach and gene immobilization, here we developed a gene-immobilized triphasic silk scaffold to enhance ACL osseointegration. Isotropic silk was divided into three regions (respectively corresponding to a ligament, fibrocartilage and the bone region of the native ACL interface) using a custom-made divider, and the lentiviral vector-encoded transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGF-β3) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) was further, respectively, immobilized to phosphatidylserine (PS)-coated fibrocartilage and the bone region of the triphasic silk scaffold. The in vitro assessments displayed that this gene-immobilized triphasic silk scaffold significantly promotes bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) proliferation and differentiation into corresponding cell lineage. Moreover, the gene-modified triphasic silk scaffold combined with BMSCs alone, which was rolled into a compact shaft to be implanted onto rabbit ACL-defect models, revealed roughly complete osseointegration restoration as a result of apparent three-layered tissue formation and robust mechanical ability as early as 12 weeks postoperatively. These outcomes demonstrated that employing the stratified approach and gene immobilization efficiently expedites silk-mediated ACL interface formation, expanding the therapeutic potential of the silk-based ligament graft for ACL reconstruction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanterior cruciate ligament 3abiocompatibility 3abone marrow 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3agenes 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3aisotropy 3amechanics 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amodels 3aphosphatidylserines 3arabbits 3asilk 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta 31 aSun, Liguo1 aChen, Xiaonan1 aQu, Ling1 aLi, Hongguo1 aLiu, Xincheng1 aZhang, Yushen1 aCheng, Pengzhen1 aFanDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery, Xi-Jing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, West Chang-le Road, Xi'an, 710032, China.

The NADC30-like PRRSV was first reported in 2014 in China, where it spread and gradually caused an epidemic. Currently, growing research has shown that NADC30-like strains have greater propensity to recombine with other PRRSV strains, particularly the PPRSV vaccine virus used clinically, making the prevention and control of PRRSV highly complex. To carry out an in-depth molecular biology and virulence analysis, a full-length infectious clone of the NADC30-like strain was successfully constructed and rescued by reverse genetic manipulation. The rescued virus, rZJqz, was indistinguishable from its parental virus, ZJqz21, based on virological characteristics. Further animal experiments demonstrated that rZJqz retained similar pathogenicity and induced the typical clinical symptoms and viral shedding observed in the ZJqz21 challenge model. Together, these results provide a useful tool for further study of the biological characteristics and pathogenicity of NADC30-like strains. Moreover, these findings also provide a solid foundation for studying the recombination of different PRRSVs and developing new and effective universal vaccines in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3agenetic engineering 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aresearch 3areverse genetics 3avaccines 3avirulence 3aviruses 0aNADC30-like strain 0aReverse genetic system 0aFull-length infectious clone 0aPathogenesis1 aChen, Jinxia1 aLi, Liwei1 aLiu, Jiachen1 aTong, Wu1 aZhou, Yanjun1 aTong, Guangzhi1 aWang, Guihua1 aGao, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2291-87120 tVirus research.g2022 July 15, v. 316 p.198801-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2022.1988013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009800170500001900268520162600287592002801913650001701941650001001958650001901968650001301987650001802000650001202018650001502030650001502045650001102060650002802071650000702099650001802106650002402124653002102148653001902169653001702188653001902205653001302224700006202237700002402299700002102323700002302344700006202367773012002429856008302549852000902632655001202641IND60710817620221119075649.0201025e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071081762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArfuso, Francesca10aVenous Blood Acid-Base Status in Show Jumper Horses Subjected to Different Physical Exercises  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to assess whether acid-base profile exhibits changes in regularly trained show jumping horses undergoing increasing exercise workloads. Seven female Italian saddle horses were subjected to three different physical exercise trials of increasing workload identified as three exercise phases (EPs). During EPI horses were subjected to a standardized exercise test consisting of 15 minutes of treadmill, during EPII horses were subjected to a show jumping test (height, 0.9–1.1 m; course length, 300 m), during EPIII horses underwent two jumping sessions carried out over two consecutive days. Blood samples were collected at rest (TPRE), after exercise (TPOST), and 30 minutes after the end of exercise (TPOST₃₀). The values of pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco₂), partial pressure of oxygen (Po₂), bicarbonate level (HCO₃⁻), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (Hct) were measured. A significant effect of exercise workload and time (P < .001) on Po₂, Pco₂, HCO₃⁻, Hb, and Hct values was found. The variation in the studied parameters resulted mostly reversible within TPOST₃₀ in horses when subjected to EPI and EPII, whereas Po₂, Hb, and Hct remained higher at TPOST₃₀ than TPRE in horses when subjected to the second day of jumping section (EPIII) indicating a failure to recover. The results suggest that jumping sessions carried out over two consecutive days represent extra workload for horses, and this should be taken into account by veterinarian to prevent acid-base imbalance and for the maintenance of health and performance in equine athletes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3ablood 3acarbon dioxide 3aexercise 3aexercise test 3afemales 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahorses 3aoxygen partial pressure 3apH 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary medicine 0aAcid-base status 0aAthlete equine 0aJumping test 0aTreadmill test 0aWorkload1 aGiannetto, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3049-11811 aGiudice, Elisabetta1 aFazio, Francesco1 aPanzera, Francesca1 aPiccione, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4736-10870 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 Nov., v. 94 p.103251-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010300174300001800277520127700295592002801572650003401600650002001634650001601654650002501670650001701695650001801712650002501730650001401755650001801769650002001787650002401807650001201831650001401843650001601857650001601873650001401889653001601903653002201919653001601941700002701957700002601984700002502010700006202035700002502097700002202122700002702144700002102171700002602192700002702218700002302245700002302268773011802291856008602409852000902495655001202504IND60551855120221121044455.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Bruno A.M.10aStructural basis of ConM binding with resveratrol, an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant polyphenol  ap. 1136-1142.  aResveratrol can also inhibit the activation of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines at the early gene expression stage. It is well known that lectins are sugar-binding proteins that act as both pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. Thus, the objective of this work was to verify the binding of a polyphenol compound with a lectin of Canavalia maritima (ConM) based on their ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory processes. To accomplish this, ConM was purified and crystallized, and resveratrol was soaked at 5mM for 2h of incubation. The crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group C2, the final refinement resulted in an Rfactor of 16.0% and an Rfree of 25.5%. Resveratrol binds in the rigid β-sheet through H-bonds and hydrophobic interaction with amino acids that compose the fifth and sixth β-strands of the rigid β-sheet of ConM. The ConM and resveratrol inhibited DPPH oxidation, showing synergic activity with the most effective ratio of 2:3 and carbohydrate binding site is not directly related to antioxidant activity. It is the interaction between ConM and resveratrol that indicates the synergism of these two molecules in acting as free radicals scavengers and in reducing the inflammatory process through the inhibition of many pro-inflammatory events.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCanavalia rosea 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abinding sites 3acarbohydrate binding 3acytokines 3afree radicals 3agene expression 3ahydrophobic bonding 3alectins 3aoxidation 3apolyphenols 3aresveratrol 3asynergism 0aResveratrol 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aAntioxidant1 aTeixeira, Claudener S.1 aSilva-Filho, José C.1 aNóbrega, Raphael B.1 aAlencar, Daniel B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7721-01831 aNascimento, Kyria S.1 aFreire, Valder N.1 aGottfried, Carmem J.S.1 aNagano, Celso S.1 aSampaio, Alexandre H.1 aSaker-Sampaio, Silvana1 aCavada, Benildo S.1 aDelatorre, Plínio0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.1136-1142dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011600166300001600282520158800298592002801886650001201914650001201926650002001938650001701958650001401975650002201989650001502011650001502026650002302041650001502064650002702079650001302106650001402119650001902133650001602152650002202168651001402190700002002204700001802224700002102242773018202263856007302445852000902518655001202527IND60125934120221117234526.0150428e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593412DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNistelberger, Heidi M.10aPhylogeography and population differentiation in terrestrial island populations of Banksia arborea (Proteaceae)  ap. 860-872.  aThe Banded Iron Formations (BIFs) of south‐western Australia are terrestrial islands characterized by high species richness and endemism. Regional endemics occur across multiple formations without inhabiting the intervening landscape matrix. We investigated whether the occurrence on BIF terrestrial islands has led to genetic differentiation among the eight known populations of the regional endemic, Banksia arborea. Genetic structure was assessed using three chloroplast DNA sequence markers and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed with statistical parsimony and Bayesian methods. Dates of haplotype divergence were estimated using the time to most recent common ancestor of B. arborea and Banksia purdieana, as well as a conservative angiosperm chloroplast (cp)DNA mutation rate. Population genetic diversity and structure was assessed amongst and within populations by genotyping 24 geographically clustered individuals from each BIF and three subpopulations within the Die Hardy Range BIF. Indirect gene flow estimates were determined using a method based on the frequency of private alleles. Banksia arborea showed low genetic diversity in (cp)DNA and a complex structural pattern, with genetic differentiation of some BIF populations and an absence of differentiation amongst others, reflecting either retention of ancestral polymorphism across northern BIF populations or more recent connectivity of these populations. There was little evidence of pollen dispersal both between BIFs and within the large BIF known as Die Hardy Range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBanksia 3aalleles 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplasts 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apollen flow 3aspecies diversity 3aAustralia1 aByrne, Margaret1 aCoates, David1 aRoberts, J.

A total of 432 serum samples were collected from goats from 54 flocks and tested for the presence of antibodies against mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae (mccp) using monoclonal antibody-based competitive enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay. Sero-prevalence recorded for Turkana West was 63.9 %, Kajiado Central was 48.6 %, while Pokot East was 29.2 % which was statistically significant (χ2 = 34.997; P = 0.000) in the study sites. The results of this study confirmed that CCPP is widespread and endemic in the pastoral production systems studied in the Rift Valley region. The results confirmed that regions sharing international boundaries are at a higher risk of CCPP hence the need for a unified cross-border approach to disease control measures in the border areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma capricolum 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acontagious caprine pleuropneumonia 3acontrol methods 3across-sectional studies 3adisease control 3aflocks 3agoats 3apastoralism 3aproduction technology 3arisk 3aseroprevalence 3aKenya1 aOmbui, Jackson Nyarongi1 aKiara, Henry Kimathi1 aBinepal, Yatinder Singh1 aGitonga, Eric1 aWesonga, Hezron Okwako0 tTropical animal health and production.g2016 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.151-155dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-015-0934-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245016900178506011700347506007600464520016000540592002800700506003700728650001200765650001300777650005000790650001300840650001300853650001200866700002000878700001500898700002100913700001700934700001800951700002400969773009800993856008701091961001301178852000901191655001201200IND60777411120221207095817.0220523e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077741112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2022.1988092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowland, Raymond R.R.10aEffect of the host genotype at a Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) resistance marker on evolution of the modified-live PRRS vaccine virus in pigs  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome; Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; PRRS; Whole genome sequencing; Quasispecies; WUR allele  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3agenotype 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aresearch 3avaccines 3aviruses1 aDoerksen, Tyler1 aLu, Andrea1 aSheahan, Maureen1 aLunney, Joan1 aDekkers, Jack1 aPalinski, Rachel M.0 tVirus research.g2022 July 15, v. 316 p.198809-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2022.1988093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008000169300002000249520101300269592002801282650001801310650001301328650002301341650001201364773013001376856008201506852000901588655001201597IND60565690620221119032853.0170327e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056569062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b067742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIannuzzi, Marcella10aAr Implantation at the hBN/Rh(111) Nanomesh by ab Initio Molecular Dynamics  ap. 22198-22207.  aThe controlled intercalation of selected species underneath graphene or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on a substrate opens new ways for the functionalization and the tuning of properties of these systems. In this work, the case of hBN on rhodium exposed to a low-energy Ar-ion beam [Cun et al., Nano Lett. 2013, 13, 2098–2103] is further considered theoretically. With the help of ab initio molecular dynamics, the structural rearrangements induced by the interaction between the impacting Ar ion and the substrate are investigated. It is shown that the ion can be intercalated and trapped between the metal and hBN by breaking some BN bonds and penetrating the overlayer. The resulting defective structure relaxes quickly, while Ar moves to a stable site where a protrusion appears on top of the characteristic super honeycomb lattice of the nanomesh. The presented results provide a first atomistic description of the complex processes leading to the formation of the, so-called, boron nitride nanotents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 3arhodium0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Sept. 24, v. 119, no. 38 p.22198-22207dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b067743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014000160300001600300520140900316592002801725650000901753650001201762650001001774650001801784650002201802650002401824650001301848650002701861650001401888650002001902650003501922651001901957700002301976700002001999700001402019700002502033773018202058856007302240852000902313655001202322IND60125934220221117234637.0150428e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593422DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHusemann, Martin10aEffects of population size and isolation on the genetic structure of the East African mountain white‐eye Zosterops poliogaster (Aves)  ap. 828-836.  aHabitat size, quality and isolation determine the genetic structure and diversity of populations and may influence their evolutionary potential and vulnerability to stochastic events. Small and isolated populations are subject to strong genetic drift and can lose much of their genetic diversity due to stochastic fixation and loss of alleles. The mountain white‐eye Zosterops poliogaster, a cloud forest bird species, is exclusively found in the high mountains of East Africa. We analysed 13 polymorphic microsatellites for 213 individuals of this species that were sampled at different points in time in three mountain massifs differing in habitat size, isolation and habitat degradation. We analysed the genetic differentiation among mountain populations and estimated the effective population sizes. Our results indicate three mountain‐specific genetic clusters. Time cohorts did not show genetic divergences, suggesting that populations are large enough to prevent strong drift effects. Effective population sizes were higher in larger and geographically interconnected habitat patches. Our findings underline the relevance of ecological barriers even for mobile species and show the importance of investigating different estimators of population size, including both approaches based on single and multiple time‐points of sampling, for the inference of the demographic status of a population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAves 3aalleles 3abirds 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amountains 3apopulation size 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aEastern Africa1 aCousseau, Laurence1 aBorghesio, Luca1 aLens, Luc1 aHabel, Jan Christian0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 Apr., v. 114, no. 4 p.828-836dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245011000211300001100321506007600332520163300408592002802041506003702069650001902106650001602125650001502141650001302156650002802169650001902197650001502216650002002231650002202251650001402273650001202287650001902299650001802318650002302336651001302359700002402372700003002396700002602426773012702452856008102579852000902660655001202669IND60550191520221207125734.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055019152DNAL7 a10.1186/s13006-016-0084-72doi7 aPMC50135772pmcid7 a276060002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoomro, JamilAhmed10aEmployers’ perspective of workplace breastfeeding support in Karachi, Pakistan: a cross-sectional study  ap. 24.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is considered to be an important measure to achieve optimum health outcomes for children, women’s return to work has frequently been found to be a main contributor to the early discontinuation of breastfeeding. The aim of the study is to assess workplace breastfeeding support provided to working mothers in Pakistan. METHOD: A workplace based cross-sectional survey was conducted from April through December 2014. Employers from a representative sample of 297 workplaces were interviewed on pre-tested and structured questionnaire. The response rate was 93.7 %. Prevalence of workplace breastfeeding facilities were assessed in the light of World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) guidelines. RESULTS: Among non-physical facilities, all workplaces offered 3 months paid maternity leave, 45 % of the sites were offering task adjustment to mothers during lactation period. Only 15 % of the sites were offering breastfeeding breaks to working mothers. Physical facilities that include a breastfeeding corner, refrigerator for storing breast milk, breast milk pump and nursery for childcare were provided in less than 7 % of the sites. Multinational organizations provided better support compared to national organizations. CONCLUSION: Support for continuation of breastfeeding by working women at workplaces is inadequate; hence, women discontinue breastfeeding earlier than planned. Policies need to be developed and enforced, employers and employees need to be educated and supportive environment needs to be created to encourage and facilitate breastfeeding friendly worksite environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3achild care 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3aemployed women 3aguidelines 3ahuman resources 3aissues and policy 3alactation 3amothers 3aquestionnaires 3arefrigerators 3aworking conditions 3aPakistan1 aShaikh, ZeeshanNoor1 aSaheer, TennegedaraBuhary1 aBijarani, SuhailAhmed0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2016 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.24-24dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-016-0084-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245020500168300002000373520144200393592002801835650001601863650002601879650002301905650001001928650001001938650001301948650000901961650002501970650001601995650001202011651001102023651001602034651002502050700002302075700002002098700002502118700002002143700001802163700002302181700002302204700001902227700002102246700002202267700002202289700002502311773012702336856008102463852000902544655001202553IND60551560320170605000000.0161019e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b035152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Silva, Amila O.10aPerfluoroalkylphosphinic Acids in Northern Pike (Esox lucius), Double-Crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), and Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Relation to Other Perfluoroalkyl Acids  ap. 10903-10913.  aPerfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPIAs) are perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) that are used for their surfactant properties in a variety of applications, resulting in their presence in environmental waters; however, they have not been widely studied in biota. A survey of PFPIAs was conducted in fish, dolphins, and birds from various locations in North America. Northern pike (Esox lucius) were collected at two locations in 2011 near Montréal Island in the St. Lawrence River, Canada, double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were collected from bird colonies in the Great Lakes in 2010–2012, and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from Sarasota Bay, FL and Charleston Harbor, SC were sampled in 2004–2009. PFPIAs had a detection frequency of 100% in all animals. This is the first report of PFPIAs in fish, dolphin, and bird plasma. Total PFPIA levels (mean ± standard deviation, 1.87 ± 2.17 ng/g wet weight (ww), range of 0.112–15.3 ng/g ww) were 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than those of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCA) and perfluoroalkanesulfonates (PFSA) in the same samples. The predominant congeners were 6:8 PFPIA (cormorants and pike) and 6:6 PFPIA (dolphins). Total PFPIAs in cormorants from Hamilton Harbour (5.02 ± 2.80 ng/g ww) were statistically higher than in other areas and taxonomic groups. The ubiquity of PFPIAs warrants further research on sources and effects of these unique compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEsox lucius 3aPhalacrocorax auritus 3aTursiops truncatus 3aacids 3abirds 3adolphins 3apike 3astatistical analysis 3asurfactants 3asurveys 3aCanada 3aGreat Lakes 3aSaint Lawrence River1 aSpencer, Christine1 aHo, Ki Chung

Most of the species that breed and migrate in Western Siberia are of Eastern origin and mostly fly for wintering to South-East Asia. Among these species in our samples, Phylloscopus proregulus was a carrier of both TBEV and Bartonella spp.; Luscinia calliope were infected with both TBEV and Borrelia, while Tarsiger cyanurus were infected with WNV.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMigratory birds 0aSpread 0aTick-borne infections1 aKorobitsyn, I.G.1 aTyutenkov, O.Y.1 aGashkov, S.I.1 aKononova, Y.V.1 aMoskvitin, S.S.1 aRomanenko, V.N.1 aMikryukova, T.P.1 aProtopopova, E.V.1 aKartashov, M.Y.1 aChausov, E.V.1 aKonovalova, S.N.1 aTupota, N.L.1 aSementsova, A.O.1 aTernovoy, V.A.1 aLoktev, V.B.0 tAchievements in the Life Sciences.g2014 Oct., v. 8 p.118-120dElsevier B.V.x2078-15207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2015.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245013100164300002000295520160400315592002801919650002401947650002101971650001101992650001402003650002302017650002502040650001102065650001802076650003402094700002402128700002202152773012702174856008102301852000902382655001202391IND60551560420221120095009.0161019e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b035222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jian Lin10aStimulation and Inhibition of Anaerobic Digestion by Nickel and Cobalt: A Rapid Assessment Using the Resazurin Reduction Assay  ap. 11154-11163.  aStimulation of anaerobic digestion by essential trace metals is beneficial from a practical point of view to enhance the biodegradability and degradation rate of wastes. Hence, a quick method to determine which metal species, and at what concentration, can optimize anaerobic digestion is of great interest to both researchers and operators. In this present study, we investigated the effect of nickel(II), cobalt(II), and their mixture, on the anaerobic digestion of synthetic municipal wastewater. Using a volumetric method, that is, measuring methane production over time, revealed that anaerobic digestion was stimulated by the addition of 5 mg L–¹ nickel(II), and cobalt(II), and their mixture in day(s). However, using a novel resazurin reduction assay, and based on its change in rate over time, we evaluated both inhibition at 250 mg L–¹ nickel(II) and cobalt(II), and also the stimulatory effect of 5 mg L–¹ nickel(II), and cobalt(II), and their mixture, in just 6 h. By investigating the dynamic distribution of these metals in the liquid phase of the anaerobic system and kinetics of resazurin reduction by nickel spiked anaerobic sludge, the concentration of nickel(II) on anaerobic digestion performance was profiled. Three critical concentrations were determined; stimulation starting (around 1 mg L–¹), stimulation ending (around 100 mg L–¹) and stimulation maximizing (around 10 mg L–¹). Hence, we propose that the resazurin reduction assay is a novel and quick protocol for studying the stimulation of anaerobic bioprocesses by bioavailable essential trace metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3acobalt 3adigestion 3amethane production 3amunicipal wastewater 3anickel 3arapid methods 3astandard operating procedures1 aSteele, Terry W.

To gain more information on this adaptation, 32 dairy goats in mid lactation belonging to Majorera and Palmera breeds were subjected to milk stasis of 10, 14, 24 (the normal routine), 28 and 32h; and milk volumes, milk composition, concentrations of Na+ and K+ in milk and blood plasma and plasma lactose were measured at each interval. The major findings were: i. Milk stasis did not induce changes in milk fat and milk protein secretion rates. In contrast, the extension of the interval between milkings was associated with a decrease of milk lactose secretion rate, ii. Comparison of the relative changes of Na+ and K+ in milk with blood and plasma lactose content indicates that the tight junction (TJ) permeability to lactose was much higher than to monovalent cations. It was concluded that an important element in the adaptation of Canarian dairy goats to extended milking intervals may be related to maintenance TJ resistant to paracellular leakage, particularly to passage of monovalent ions. Thus, the present study increases the understanding on adaptation of small ruminant to extended milking interval, which has been related so far to their high cistern storage capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood plasma 3acations 3adairy goats 3adairy protein 3agoat breeds 3alactation 3alactose 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk secretion 3amilking frequency 3apermeability 3apotassium 3aprotein secretion 3asodium 3atight junctions 0aDairy goat 0aExtended milking 0aMilk stasis 0aTight junction1 aCastro, N.1 aSuárez-Trujillo, A.1 aArgüello, A.1 aCapote, J.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2016 Apr., v. 137 p.85-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005200153245015600205520181300361592002802174650001502202650002002217650002402237650001202261650002502273650002802298650001102326650001602337650001902353650002102372650001602393650002502409650001602434653000802450653001802458653002702476653002102503700005402524773012302578856008802701852000902789655001202798IND60777411320221119181321.0220614e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077741132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.1090072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9917-488110aHyperspectral indices developed from the low order fractional derivative spectra can capture leaf dry matter content across a variety of species better  aLeaf mass per area (LMA) is an important indicator of plant functioning and photosynthetic capacity and is critical for understanding plant physiology and ecosystem function. Despite detailed and continuous spectral information offered in hyperspectral reflectance, LMA remains a difficult leaf characteristic to be retrieved due to its complex constituents and overlapping absorptions with leaf water. Traditional derivative analysis is commonly used to extract the absorption band positions and to resolve overlapping spectral features, but most cases are only limited to an integral derivative that ignores the asymptotic information between spectral curves. Recent advances in fractional-order derivative (FOD) based analyses, however, have shown their advantages in eliminating background noise as well as in extracting effective information from spectral information. We have thus investigated the potentials of using the fractional derivative indices to retrieve LMA based on a composite dataset consisting of 842 leaf samples from various species. The results demonstrated that the 0.3-order FOD indices provided the highest accuracies to trace LMA and, meanwhile, had the least sensitivity to random noise. Among the ten different index types examined in this study, the SR(1320, 1715) calculated from the 0.3-order derivative spectra had the best performance with an R² of 0.79. Furthermore, the band around 1715 nm was confirmed to be the wavelength with the highest relative absorption of LMA, while the band around 1320 nm was the non-absorbing wavelength for LMA, which could be applied as a base to describe the effects of other leaf constituents. The results of this study revealed the potential of low-order FOD indices to capture LMA and we foresee their wide applications in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adata collection 3aecological function 3aforests 3aleaf characteristics 3aleaf dry matter content 3aleaves 3ameteorology 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant physiology 3areflectance 3aspecific leaf weight 3awavelengths 0aLMA 0aHyperspectral 0aFractional derivatives 0aVegetation index1 aWang, Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5483-02430 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2022 July 15, v. 322 p.109007-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.1090073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245017200213300001000385506007600395520188700471592002802358506003702386650003002423650001902453650001602472650002402488650001502512650002802527650002702555650001202582650002102594650001302615650001102628650001202639650001502651650002402666650001202690650001302702651001302715700002702728700002202755700002002777700001902797700002702816700001702843773012502860856008102985852000903066655001203075IND60550191720221207125732.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055019172DNAL7 a10.1186/s13006-016-0064-y2doi7 aPMC47973312pmcid7 a269979712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiben, MisganLegesse10aFactors associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices among mothers in dubti town, afar regional state, northeast Ethiopia: a community based cross-sectional study  ap. 4.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is recommended internationally. This study aimed to investigate exclusive breastfeeding practices and associated factors among mothers of infants aged less than 6 months. METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted on mother-infant pairs in Dubti town in May, 2015. In this study, exclusive breastfeeding was defined as an infant’s breast milk consumption without supplementation of any type of food or drink, except for vitamins, minerals and necessary medications in the 24 h preceding the survey. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed to identify the factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices. Variables with a p-value < 0.05 in the multivariable model were identified as predictors of exclusive breastfeeding practices. RESULTS: Exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months was practiced by 81.1 % (95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 77.0, 85.0 %) of mothers of infants aged less than 6 months. The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding for infants less than 6 months was 3 months. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h after birth (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 5.46; 95 % CI 1.93, 15.41), age of infants of less than 2 months (AOR 7.03; 95 % CI 2.16, 22.88), being a housewife (AOR 4.81; 95 % CI 2.30, 10.06) and mothers who received postnatal counseling (AOR 3.88; 95 % CI 1.88, 7.99) were positive predictors of exclusive breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months using 24-h recall method was lower than the World Health Organization recommendation. Therefore, interventions could focus on educating mothers the importance of timely initiation of breastfeeding and postnatal care in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3aconfidence interval 3acounseling 3across-sectional studies 3adescriptive statistics 3ainfants 3amilk consumption 3aminerals 3amodels 3amothers 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3avitamins 3aEthiopia1 aGemechu, YohannesBacha1 aAdugnew, Mulugeta1 aAsrade, Adugnaw1 aAdamie, Belete1 aGebremedin, Ehitemelak1 aMelak, Yibel0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2016 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.4-4dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-016-0064-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245019600169300001400365520125300379592002801632650002101660650001501681650001901696650002901715650002401744650002001768650001001788650001101798650001901809650002101828650001001849650002401859650001001883700002101893700002201914700002601936700001901962700002101981700002002002773009002022856008102112852000902193655001202202IND60080113020221120100855.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008011302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2091-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHögberg, Mona N.14aThe return of an experimentally N-saturated boreal forest to an N-limited state: observations on the soil microbial community structure, biotic N retention capacity and gross N mineralisation  ap. 45-60.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: To find out how N-saturated forests can return to an N-limited state, we examined the recovery of biotic N sinks under decreasing N supply. METHODS: . We studied a 40-year-old experiment in Pinus sylvestris forest, with control plots, N0, three N treatments, N1-N3, of which N3 was stopped after 20 years, allowing observation of recovery. RESULTS: In N3, the N concentration in foliage was still slightly elevated, but the N uptake capacity of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots in N3 was no longer lower than in N0. Per area the amount of a biomarker for fungi, here mainly attributed ECM, was higher in N3 and N0 than in N1 and N2. Retention of labeled¹⁵NH₄⁺by the soil was greater in the control (99 %) and N3 (86 %), than in N1 (45 %) and N2 (29 %); we ascribe these differences to biotic retention because cation exchange capacity did not vary. Gross N mineralisation and retention of N correlated, negatively and positively, respectively, with abundance of ECM fungal biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: . The results suggest a key role for ECM fungi in regulating the N cycle. We propose, in accordance with plant C allocation theory, that recovery is driven by increased tree below-ground C allocation to ECM roots and fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3abiomarkers 3aboreal forests 3acation exchange capacity 3acommunity structure 3aectomycorrhizae 3afungi 3aleaves 3amineralization 3anitrogen content 3aroots 3asoil microorganisms 3atrees1 aBlaško, Róbert1 aBach, Lisbet Holm1 aHasselquist, Niles J.1 aEgnell, Gustaf1 aNäsholm, Torgny1 aHögberg, Peter0 tPlant and soil.g2014 Aug., v. 381, no. 1-2 p.45-60dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2091-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018100170300001600351520173900367592002802106650002402134650002202158650001402180650001802194650001802212650001402230650001802244650001102262650001402273650001802287650000902305651001302314700001802327700002602345773012202371856008102493852000902574655001202583IND60555694320221119091144.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055569432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-016-0976-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesfaye, Mehari A.10aAlternative silvicultural stand density management options for Chilimo dry afro-montane mixed natural uneven-aged forest using species proportion in Central Highlands, Ethiopia  ap. 827-838.  aChilimo forest is one of the few remnants of dry afro-montane mixed uneven-aged natural forest located in Central Highlands of Ethiopia. Also it has been during the last century one of the most exploited and disturbed forest in the country. Stand density management diagram (SDMD) is a stand-level model that graphically illustrates the relationships between wood yield, density and mortality throughout all stages of stand development. SDMD is a useful tool for designing, displaying and evaluating alternative density management regimes for both even-aged and uneven-aged forest stands. However, information in this regard and other silvicultural management operations are lacking for most Ethiopian forests in general and Chilimo dry afro-montane forest in particular. The purpose of the study is to develop a SDMD model for the existing mixed natural forest using appropriate species proportion for Juniperus procera and Podocarpus falcatus. Two linear equations were simultaneously fitted to relate quadratic mean diameter with stand density and dominant height and relate it to total stand volume with quadratic mean diameter, stand density and dominant height. Moreover, dominant height and quadratic mean diameter were found to be the best endogenous variables for SDMD for Chilimo forest. The relationship between stand density, dominant height, quadratic mean diameter and stand volume is represented in the SDMD graph. Formulating SDMD using species proportion is better than treating each species independently. This SDMD is the first diagram model developed for mixed forest in Africa, and it can serve sustainable management of Chilimo dry afro-montane forest in particular and other dry afro-montane forests in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrocarpus falcatus 3aJuniperus procera 3aequations 3aforest damage 3aforest stands 3ahighlands 3amixed forests 3amodels 3amortality 3astand density 3awood 3aEthiopia1 aBravo, Felipe1 aBravo-Oviedo, Andrés0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2016 Oct., v. 135, no. 5 p.827-838dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1612-46697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-016-0976-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010500170300001600275500001500291520099000306592002801296650001901324650001801343650001501361650002201376650002601398650001301424650002401437650000901461650003101470650001901501650001901520650001601539650001001555650001601565650001101581650000901592653001501601653002001616653002801636653001301664700001701677700001501694700001901709773011601728856008601844852000901930655001201939IND60551855620221122225957.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiquan14aThe ferritin gene in ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda: Cloning, expression and function  ap. 320-325.  a2019-12-06  aFerritin, a primary iron storage protein, plays an important role in iron homeostasis. In this study, a ferritin cDNA (EcFer) with a 516bp open reading frame (ORF) was obtained from Exopalaemon carinicauda (Holthuis) which encodes a 171 amino acid protein. At the 5-terminal untranslated region (5′-UTR), there is a complete iron-responsive element (IRE). EcFer mRNA was mainly expressed in the hepatopancreas and its expression was significantly up-regulated at 12, 24, and 48h after the shrimp was exposed to CuSO4 and CdCl2. The transcript of EcFer was found to be extremely less or even absent at the gastrula and zoea stage. From the egg protozoea stage, the expression of EcFer was significantly up-regulated compared to that of the gastrula stage. In addition, EcFer was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and the purified rEcFer by size chromatography could uptake iron. These results suggest that EcFer plays important roles in the iron involved metabolism in shrimp.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper sulfate 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3acomplementary DNA 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aferritin 3aopen reading frames 3airon 3agene expression regulation 3achromatography 3ahepatopancreas 3aamino acids 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ashrimp 3aeggs 0aMetal ions 0aPichia pastoris 0aExopalaemon carinicauda 0aFerritin1 aGui, Tianshu1 aWang, Jing1 aXiang, Jianhai0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.320-325dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011600166300002000282520128700302592002801589650002401617650001201641650001701653650001001670650002101680650002301701650001301724700002401737700002401761700001801785700001801803700002801821773013001849856008201979852000902061655001202070IND60565690920221119032732.0170327e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056569092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b068942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafiei, Mahnaz10aConversion of n-Type CuTCNQ into p-Type Nitrogen-Doped CuO and the Implication for Room-Temperature Gas Sensing  ap. 22208-22216.  aSensors to detect toxic and harmful gases are usually based on metal oxides that are operated at elevated temperature. However, enabling gas detection at room temperature (RT) is a significant ongoing challenge. Here, we address this issue by demonstrating that microrods of semiconducting CuTCNQ (TCNQ = 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) with nanostructured features can be employed as conductometric gas sensors operating at 50 °C for detection of oxidizing and reducing gases such as NO₂ and NH₃. The sensor is evaluated at RT and up to 200 °C. It was found that CuTCNQ is transformed into a N-doped CuO material with p-type conductivity when annealed at the maximum temperature. This is the first time that such a transformation, from a semiconducting charge transfer material into a N-doped metal oxide, is detected. It is shown here that both the surface chemistry and the type of majority charge carrier within the sensing layer are critically important for the type of response toward oxidizing and reducing gases. A detailed physical description of the NO₂ and NH₃ sensing mechanism at CuTCNQ and N-doped CuO is provided to explain the differences in the response. For the N-doped CuO sensor, detection limits of 1 ppm for NO₂ and 10 ppm for NH₃ are achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aammonia 3acupric oxide 3agases 3anitrogen dioxide 3aphysical chemistry 3atoxicity1 aHoshyargar, Faegheh1 aLipton-Duffin, Josh1 aPiloto, Carlo1 aMotta, Nunzio1 aO’Mullane, Anthony P.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Sept. 24, v. 119, no. 38 p.22208-22216dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b068943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011200161300001600273500001500289520215900304592002802463650001602491650002702507650001202534650001002546650001102556650002102567650001402588650001702602650001402619650001502633650002002648650001602668650001902684650001102703650001202714650001902726650001202745650002002757651001802777653001802795700002302813700002202836773018102858856007303039852000903112655001203121IND60125934520221117234547.0150428e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593452DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Charles F.10aMale mating success in a North American pitviper: influence of body size, testosterone, and spatial metrics  ap. 185-194.  a2019-12-04  aMales with enhanced traits relative to conspecifics often show increased mating and reproductive success and thus have a fitness advantage. The opportunity or potential for sexual selection is predicted to occur under these conditions. Here, we investigated proximate determinants of mating success in male copperhead snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix), a medium‐sized pitviper of North America. Specifically, we investigated the relationships of body size (snout‐vent length, body mass), body condition index, spatial metrics (total distance moved, home range size), and plasma testosterone concentration on mating success in males. The single mating season lasts from August through September. We compared a set of candidate linear mixed models and selected the best‐fitting one using the adjusted Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). The AICc‐selected model (model 2), with testosterone, body condition index, and home range size as predictor variables, showed that male mating success was positively correlated with testosterone. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the relationship of testosterone and individual mating success in any snake species. A parallel study conducted on male fitness in A. contortrix of the same population used microsatellite markers to assign parentage of fathers (known mothers). Unlike our study, they found that snout‐vent length was positively correlated with reproductive success and that males were experiencing greater sexual selection. This relationship has been detected under natural conditions in other species of snakes. Although behavioural data are important in any mating system analysis, they should not stand alone to infer parentage, relationships or selection metrics (e.g. Bateman gradients). Long‐term sperm storage by females, female cryptic choice, and other factors contribute to the complexity of mating success of males. Accordingly, we thus conclude that estimates of reproductive success and fitness in cryptic species, such as copperheads and other snakes, require robust molecular methods to draw accurate conclusions regarding proximate and evolutionary responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aAgkistrodon contortrix 3amothers 3amales 3amodels 3asexual selection 3aparentage 3atestosterone 3abody size 3ahome range 3abreeding season 3aspermatozoa 3amating systems 3asnakes 3afathers 3abody condition 3afemales 3agenetic markers 3aNorth America 0amating season1 aSchuett, Gordon W.1 aAmarello, Melissa0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 May, v. 115, no. 1 p.185-194dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245006900166500001900235520199700254592002802251650002102279650001102300650001502311650002402326650001502350650001902365650001402384650001502398650002502413650001802438650001302456650002302469650002002492650002202512650005202534650001002586650001802596650001402614650001002628653002202638653001302660653001102673700005202684773011302736856008802849852000902937655001202946IND60710818120221119075628.0210212e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071081812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2020.1065622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Y.10aOxytocin receptor expression in stallion testes and epididymides  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEndocrine, paracrine, and autocrine factors orchestrate the development and physiology of the stallion reproductive system. Oxytocin (OXT) is one of the critical endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine factors for the male reproductive system. Previous studies have investigated OXT receptor (OXTR) expression in testes and epididymides, including humans, marmosets, macaques, swine, and sheep. This study aimed to explore (1) OXTR localization in the testes and epididymides and (2) the seasonal modification of OXTR expression in the testes. Adult stallion testis and epididymis samples were prepared using routine castration procedures. Reverse-transcription PCR was performed to detect the presence of OXTR messenger RNA (mRNA) in the testes. Western blot procedure was performed to confirm the cross-reactivity of OXTR antibody to horse OXTR. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect OXTR protein expression in the testes and epididymides. Oxytocin receptor mRNA was detected in the stallion testes. The OXTR protein band was observed at 55 kDa. Interestingly, the relative intensity of the OXTR protein band varied between nonbreeding and breeding season. The OXTR protein level in the testes collected during the breeding season was higher than that during the nonbreeding season. Oxytocin receptor localization was observed in the cytoplasm of Type A spermatogonia and spermatid. Oxytocin receptor protein expression was also observed in the cytoplasmic area of Leydig cells and the membrane of the seminiferous tubules. The cytoplasm of principal and basal cells in the caput, corpus, and cauda was also immunolabeled with OXTR antibody. In conclusion, based on the expression of OXTR in tissues of testes and epididymides, OXT–OXTR system may be a critical factor for stallion testicular and epididymal function. In addition, according to the seasonal alteration of intensity, the OXT–OXTR system may be associated with seasonal changes in the reproductive system in stallions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aautocrine signaling 3acastration 3across reaction 3acytoplasm 3aepididymis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3aoxytocin 3aoxytocin receptors 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3aspermatogonia 3astallions 3aswine 0aOxytocin receptor 0aStallion 0aTestis1 aYoon, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9112-17960 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2021 Jan., v. 74 p.106562-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl34945x0739-72407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2020.1065623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03804naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245008300173300001300256520206800269592002802337650001602365650001802381650001302399650001602412650002502428650002602453650002902479650001202508650002302520650002002543650001102563650001702574650001002591650001502601650002002616650001502636650001502651650001402666650001702680650002002697650001002717650001902727650001502746650001402761650002002775650001202795650001602807650001302823651001402836653002602850653001702876653001702893653001602910653002002926700001502946773010602961856009003067852000903157655001203166IND60526406020221119071149.0190405e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052640602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWindsor, P.A.10aCaseous lymphadenitis: Present and near forgotten from persistent vaccination?  ap. 6-10.  aOvine caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is a serious disease of the global sheep industry, mainly causing losses from abattoir condemnations and in some countries, compromised productivity. However in Australia, CLA is now of minimal concern on-farm with cases reported rarely, although the disease remains an important food quality issue for abattoirs. There is evidence from longitudinal abattoir surveillance that CLA prevalence has been declining, from estimates of 26% in 1995–5.2% in 2009. Change management factors relevant to reduced prevalence and producer concerns for CLA in Australia were examined, including drivers and motivation for change, resistance to change, knowledge management, farming systems dimensions and leadership. Although extension programs addressing disease risk factors, such associations of CLA with dipping for external parasite control and frequency of close confinement, may be of relevance to improved disease risk management by producers, improved CLA control on many Australian sheep farms is considered largely attributable to the introduction of vaccination programs for CLA in 1983, with inclusion of CLA antigen within clostridial vaccines (‘6 in 1′ vaccine). This innovation enabled routine annual CLA vaccination to occur in an increasing proportion of the national flock, despite several surveys that have shown that producer knowledge of CLA is low. However, promoting the persistent use of ‘combination' vaccination to continue suppression of CLA infection and improved biosecurity to reduce re-introduction of disease, plus targeting properties that are not using vaccination, remains a challenge for animal health authorities. As CLA in Australia is now primarily an issue for the sheep meat processing sector, efforts to improve feedback to producers suffering carcass condemnations at slaughter should be encouraged. Persistent vaccination for CLA improves the health and welfare of sheep and this strategy deserve wider recognition in all sheep and goat production countries where vaccine usage is sporadic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aanimal health 3aantigens 3abiosecurity 3acarcass condemnation 3acaseous lymphadenitis 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adipping 3aextension programs 3afarming systems 3aflocks 3afood quality 3agoats 3aleadership 3ameat processing 3amonitoring 3amotivation 3aparasites 3arisk factors 3arisk management 3asheep 3asheep industry 3asheep meat 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aAustralia 0aCaseous lymphadenitis 0aCheesy gland 0aSheep health 0aVaccination 0aDisease control1 aBush, R.D.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2016 Sept., v. 142 p.6-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245014300158300002000301520128500321592002801606650002301634650002101657650001201678650001601690650001901706650001901725650002301744650002501767700001401792700001601806700001801822700001801840700001401858700001701872773012701889856008102016852000902097655001202106IND60551560720221122010945.0161019e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b035832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan Tú,10aDynamics of Humic Acid and Its Interaction with Uranyl in the Presence of Hydrophobic Surface Implicated by Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 11121-11128.  aThis work targeted a molecular level of understanding on the dynamics of humic acid (HA) and its interaction with uranyl in the presence of hydrophobic surface mimicked by a carbon nanotube (CNT), which also represents a potential intruder in the environment accompanying with the development of nanotechnology. In aqueous phase, uranyl and HA were observed to build close contact spontaneously, driven by electrostatic interaction, leading to a more compact conformation of HA. The presence of CNT unfolds HA via π–π interactions with the aromatic rings of HA without significant perturbation on the interaction strength between HA and uranyl. These results show that the hydrophilic uranyl and the hydrophobic CNT influence the folding behavior of HA in distinct manners, which represents two fundamental mechanisms that the folding behavior of HA may be modulated in the environment, that is, uranyl enhances the folding of HA via electrostatic interactions, whereas CNT impedes its spontaneous folding via van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The work also provides molecular level of evidence on the transformation of a hydrophobic surface into a hydrophilic one via noncovalent functionalization by HA, which in turn affects the migration of HA and the cations it binds to.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon nanotubes 3acations 3ahumic acids 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular dynamics 3avan der Waals forces1 aWang, Hui1 aLiao, Jiali1 aYang, Yuanyou1 aChai, Zhifang1 aLiu, Ning1 aWang, Dongqi0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Oct. 18, v. 50, no. 20 p.11121-11128dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b035833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245009500215300001600310506007600326520077000402592002801172506003701200650001801237650001301255650002401268650001801292650002701310650002301337650001501360650002001375650000901395650001801404650001401422650002001436650001001456651001001466700003701476700001701513700003201530700003101562700002401593700002501617773011701642856008101759852000901840655001201849IND60478668720221207140903.0160113e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047866872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-015-0949-62doi7 aPMC47106552pmcid7 a265814362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Lian Francesca10aPrevalence of Taenia solium cysticercosis in pigs entering the food chain in western Kenya  ap. 233-238.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThree hundred forty-three pigs slaughtered and marketed in western Kenya were subjected to lingual examination and HP10 Ag-ELISA for the serological detection of Taenia solium antigen.

Our phylogenetic results, including eight of the ten sub‐species currently recognized, support the monophyly of C. familiaris with respect to its Indo‐Asian sister species C. hodgsoni. C. familiaris comprises two lineages that diverged during the mid‐Pleistocene (c. 1 Myr): one palaeoendemic lineage has an allopatric range nowadays restricted to the Corsica island and the Caucasus region whereas the second one, more recent and widespread, is distributed over most of Eurasia and in northern China. The most likely scenario that may explain such a pattern is a double colonization of the western Palaearctic from the eastern range of the species. During the middle Pleistocene period, a first lineage expanded its range up into Europe but did not persist through glacial cycles except in Corsica and the Caucasus region. Later, during the upper Pleistocene, a second lineage began to diversify around 0.09 Myr, spreading towards the western Palaearctic from a unique refuge likely located in the eastern Palaearctic [correction added on 6 March 2015 after first online publication: 0.9 Myr amended to 0.09 Myr]. Apart from C. f. corsa, our results do not suggest any distinct evolutionary history for other sub‐species previously described on morphological grounds in Europe. Our study highlights the important conservation value of the Corsican treecreeper and emphasizes the major role of mature pine forests in the evolution of endemic bird taxa in Corsica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconiferous forests 3aPasseriformes 3amonophyly 3agenetic variation 3aintrons 3abirds 3aEurasia 3aEurope 3aCorsica 0agenes1 aThibault, Jean‐Claude1 aFournier, Jérôme1 aOlioso, Georges1 aRakovic, Marko1 aTellini Florenzano, Guido1 aFuchs, Jérôme0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 May, v. 115, no. 1 p.134-153dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245020000153300001800353520162100371592002801992650002402020650002102044650001702065650001702082650001002099650001502109650001902124650001102143650002002154650001602174650003102190650001902221650002302240650001602263650002602279650001402305650002102319700001702340700001702357700001602374700001402390700001702404700001602421700001902437700002402456773014202480856007402622852000902696655001202705IND60642775820221120045944.0190508e20170728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064277582DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb01600j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHai, Luo10aFacile fabrication of a resveratrol loaded phospholipid@reduced graphene oxide nanoassembly for targeted and near-infrared laser-triggered chemo/photothermal synergistic therapy of cancer in vivo  ap. 5783-5792.  aResveratrol (Res) has emerged as an extremely promising natural molecule due to its vast therapeutic prospects. However, the potential of the drug is immensely hindered by several limiting factors including poor water solubility, limited chemical stability and high metabolization. Herein we report a facile synthesis of a Res-loaded folate-terminated PEG-phospholipid coated reduced graphene oxide nanoassembly (FA-PEG-Lip@rGO/Res) by simply sonicating Res and rGO in FA-PEG linked liposome (FA-PEG-liposome) suspensions. The as-obtained FA-PEG-Lip@rGO/Res exhibits a nanoscale size (148 ± 7 nm), a negative surface potential (−23.6 mV), an excellent drug loading (69.5 ± 4.3%), a high drug entrapment efficiency (86.9 ± 5.6%), good monodispersity and controlled release. Additionally, the nanoassembly can protect Res from UV-light induced instability. Owing to the folate mediated targeted delivery, the robust FA-PEG-Lip@rGO/Res can deliver loaded Res to human MCF-7 breast cancer cells with high specificity and excellent efficiency. The cell toxicity viability shows that unloaded FA-PEG-Lip@rGO has no cytotoxicity, confirming its suitability as a drug vehicle. Furthermore, a systematic in vivo study shows that, under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, FA-PEG-Lip@rGO/Res exhibits highly efficient combined chemotherapy and photothermal therapy to eradicate xenografted tumor with a single dose intratumoral (i.t.) injection. Thus, a facile, stable, biocompatible, and highly-effective Res delivery system has been developed, which may greatly advance the application of Res in biomedical research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3abreast neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3afolic acid 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3airradiation 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneoplasm cells 3aphotothermotherapy 3aresveratrol 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviability 3awater solubility1 aHe, Dinggeng1 aHe, Xiaoxiao1 aWang, Kemin1 aYang, Xue1 aLiu, Jinquan1 aCheng, Hong1 aHuang, Xiaoqin1 aShangguan, Jingfang0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 July 28, v. 5, no. 29 p.5783-5792dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb01600j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018300166300001600349520175100365592002802116650001702144650001902161650001402180650001202194650001602206650001602222650002302238650002402261650002102285650002102306650002302327650001402350650001502364651001002379700001802389700001802407700001602425700001902441700001602460700001702476773009202493856008102585852000902666655001202675IND60080113320221120084622.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008011332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2106-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chuansheng10aInfluence of interactions between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity on soil respiration and on the temperature sensitivity in a subtropical montane forest in SW China  ap. 215-224.  aAIMS: The aims were to identify the effects of interactions between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity on soil respiration and on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in a subtropical forest in SW China. METHODS: Four treatments were established: control (CK), litter removal (NL), trenching (NR) and trenching together with litter removal (NRNL). Soil CO₂efflux, soil temperature, and soil water content were measured once a month over two years. Soil respiration was divided into four components: the decomposition of basic soil organic matter (SOM), litter respiration, root respiration, and the interaction effect between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity. A two-factor regression equation was used to correct the value of soil CO₂efflux. RESULTS: We found a significant effect of the interaction between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity (RINT) on total soil respiration, and RINTexhibited significant seasonal variation, accounting for 26 and 31 % of total soil respiration in the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. However, we found no significant interaction effect on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. The temperature sensitivity was significantly increased by trenching compared with the control, but was unchanged by litter removal. CONCLUSIONS: Though the interaction between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity had no effects on temperature sensitivity, it had a significant positive effect on soil respiration. Our results not only showed strong influence of rhizosphere activity on temperature sensitivity, but provided a viable way to identify the contribution of SOM to soil respiration, which could help researchers gain insights on the carbon cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3aequations 3aforests 3aresearchers 3arhizosphere 3aseasonal variation 3asoil organic matter 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3atrenching 3awet season 3aChina1 aZhang, Yiping1 aXu, Xingliang1 aSha, Liqing1 aYou, Guangyong1 aLiu, Yuhong1 aXie, Youneng0 tPlant and soil.g2014 Aug., v. 381, no. 1-2 p.215-224dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2106-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001900182245016300201300001500364500002400379500002400403500001500427520071100442650001301153650003001166650001801196650001301214650002301227650002801250650002001278650001601298650002201314650001101336650001601347650001301363650001201376650002101388650001301409650003401422650000901456650005701465650005501522650003701577650007401614653002801688700002101716700001901737700002901756700002301785700002401808773011501832852000901947856008501956930003302041945002502074946001302099655001202112IND4435825120221116141839.0100423e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443582512DNAL7 a204084062pmid7 a10.1637/8928-051909-Reg.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aMazija, Hrvoje10aImmunogenicity and Safety of Queensland V4 and Ulster 2C Strains of Newcastle Disease Virus Given to Maternally Immune, Newly Hatched Chickens by Nebulization  ap. 99-103.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-06  aCommercial chickens with a high level of maternal antibodies for Newcastle disease were vaccinated when newly hatched with Queensland V4 or Ulster 2C Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains by nebulization.

Queensland V4 produced higher titers than Ulster 2C and provided better protection to challenge. 3achickens 3aintranasal administration 3alive vaccines 3aaerosols 3astrain differences 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aimmune response 3avaccination 3amaternal immunity 3achicks 3aatomization 2aAerosols 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aChickens 2aImmunity, Maternally-Acquired 2aMale 2aNewcastle Diseaseximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aNewcastle disease virusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 2aViral Vaccinesxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsximmunology. 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aČajavec, Stanko1 aErgotić, Neda1 aCiglar-Grozdanić, Irena1 aGottstein, Željko1 aRagland, William L.0 tAvian diseases.g2010 Mar., v. 54, no. 1 p.99-103dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8928-051909-Reg.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle02377naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100001900178245009500197300001600292520075900308592002801067650002001095650001301115650001601128650002601144650001601170650001201186650004601198650005801244650005401302650001101356650004201367650005501409650004001464650005401504650003801558650001701596700002501613700002201638700002601660773009601686856009301782990002301875852000901898655001201907IND60088893020221118075237.0141102e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008889302DNAL7 a219302732pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieghs, Veerle10aNASH and atherosclerosis are two aspects of a shared disease: Central role for macrophages  ap. 287-293.  aMacrophage infiltration into the atherosclerotic lesion is known to play a central role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. In contrast, the role of macrophages during the etiology of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been considered to be merely a late consequence of steatosis. However, recent insights suggest that macrophage activation and infiltration is also an early initiating event in NASH and thereby point to the shared etiology of atherosclerosis and NASH. In this review, we put forward the hypothesis that NASH and atherosclerosis are actually two aspects of a shared disease, involving the local presence of activated macrophages. We will review the current data supporting the shared mechanisms and also discuss the implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3aetiology 3afatty liver 3amacrophage activation 3amacrophages 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aAtherosclerosisxdrug therapyximmunologyxpathology. 2aFatty Liverxdrug therapyximmunologyxpathology. 2aHumans 2aHypolipidemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aInflammationxdrug therapyximmunologyxpathology. 2aMacrophage Activationxdrug effects 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsximmunologyxpathology. 2aNon-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 2aRisk Factors1 aRensen, Patrick C.N.1 aHofker, Marten H.1 aShiri-Sverdlov, Ronit0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Feb., v. 220, no. 2 p.287-293dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.08.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245012800168300002000296520171600316592002802032650002002060650002702080650001802107650001602125650001202141650001102153650001402164650001402178650001302192650002102205700002702226700002102253773012702274856008102401852000902482655001202491IND60551561020221121235734.0161019e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b040332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostello, David M.10aNickel Partitioning and Toxicity in Sediment during Aging: Variation in Toxicity Related to Stability of Metal Partitioning  ap. 11337-11345.  aMetals in sediment can be complexed by minerals, partition between solid and aqueous phases, and cause toxicity at high concentrations. We studied how the oxidation of surface sediment that occurs during aging alters the partitioning and toxicity of Ni. Two sediments (Burntwood and Raisin) were amended with Ni, equilibrated, incubated in a flow-through flume, and examined for sediment physicochemistry and toxicity to Hyalella azteca (7 day growth). Through time, the sediment surface (5 mm) was oxidized, acid-volatile sulfide concentrations declined in Raisin sediment, and amorphous Fe oxides increased. Porewater Ni concentrations declined through time but total Ni concentrations in sediment were unchanged, suggesting changes in Ni partitioning through time. Both sediments elicited a toxic dose–response by H. azteca early in the aging process; but only Burntwood, for which Ni was primarily partitioned to Fe oxide minerals, exhibited a consistent dose–response during aging. Low total Ni concentrations (20 mg kg–¹) in Raisin sediment reduced H. azteca growth at initiation, but all Ni treatments (up to 3000 mg kg–¹) exhibited similar growth after 12 days of aging. The dynamic toxicity observed in Raisin sediment was likely due to the instability of NiS in surface sediments early in the aging process. These data suggest that short-term toxicity assays with homogenized Ni-amended sediment (i.e., standard sediment toxicity tests) may be accurate for sediments where Ni speciation is dominated by oxidized ligands; however, under high-AVS and high-Fe conditions, calculated toxicity thresholds may be overly conservative (here by >100-fold) with respect to natural sediment conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyalella azteca 3aacid volatile sulfides 3adose response 3airon oxides 3aligands 3anickel 3aoxidation 3asediments 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing1 aHammerschmidt, Chad R.1 aBurton, G.

Mild preparation process without harsh chemicals is aimed at improving insulin bio-efficiency in in vivo model. The nanoparticles showed an average particle size of 100–200nm in dynamic light scattering (DLS), with almost spherical or sub-spherical shape and ∼85% of insulin encapsulation. Again, retention of almost entire amount of encapsulated insulin in simulated gastric buffer followed by its sustained release in simulated intestinal condition proved its pH sensitivity in in vitro release studies. Significant hypoglycemic effects with improved insulin-relative bioavailability (∼8.11%) in in vivo model revealed the efficacy of these core-shell nanoparticles of CS/ALG as an oral insulin carrier. No systemic toxicity was found after its peroral treatment, suggesting these core-shell nanoparticles as a promising device for potential oral insulin delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achitosan 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3aglycemic effect 3ainsulin 3alight scattering 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3atoxicity 0aChitosan/alginate pH-sensitive nanoparticles 0aOral insulin delivery 0aBioavailability1 aChakraborty, Souma1 aBhattacharya, Sourav1 aMishra, Roshnara1 aKundu, P.P.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.640-648dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100002900159245008400188300001600272520110400288592002801392650001401420650001101434650001701445650000901462650001201471650001901483650003101502650001701533650000901550700001701559700002701576700001601603700001801619773011701637856007401754852000901828655001201837IND60081325820221118233456.0140830e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008132582DNAL7 a247793642pmid7 a10.1111/jsap.122262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouradian‐Darby, A.

A four‐year‐old spayed female dachshund with lumbar pain was imaged via magnetic resonance. A tubular, space‐occupying, contrast‐enhancing lesion was noted in the right intervertebral foramen at L6 to L7. This was presumed to represent focal enlargement of the right sixth lumbar spinal nerve. A right‐sided haemilaminectomy was performed at L6 to L7 and material that grossly resembled extruded nucleus pulposus was removed. The right L6 dorsal root ganglion, dorsal nerve root and proximal spinal nerve were severely enlarged and a partial thickness biopsy was collected from the dorsal root ganglion. Results of histopathological examination of the submitted tissue samples were consistent with extruded disc material and lymphocytic ganglioneuritis. To the author's knowledge, this is the first published report of lymphocytic ganglioneuritis secondary to intervertebral disc disease in a dog.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDachshund 3abiopsy 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aganglia 3ahistopathology 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3anerve tissue 3apain1 aYoung, B.

This project is aimed at answering the questions: How, when and under what environmental conditions were so marginal environments permanently colonized during the Middle Stone Age? With over 1500 Later Stone Age, 90 Middle Stone Age and 50 Early Stone Age sites in Namaqualand, evidence of occupation from this southern extension of the Namib Desert has potential to inform on how people used economic, technological and social strategies to adapt to the stress of this environment. In order to address these questions, the shelter was recently excavated in order to establish a chronological, palaeoenvironmental, and archaeological record for the region. Following a biogeographic model to interpret the faunal remains from the bottommost layers Brian and Genevieve, the results reflect evidence for an arid to semi-arid and therefore hard environment: the subsistence strategy is broad for the region and consists of arid adapted species found on the landscape today. Non-local yellow silcrete suggests the potential for higher levels of mobility than found in later layers. The presence of gypsum and Trigonephrus sp. land snails suggests an arid environment that may have been slightly more humid than today. Future research will include increasing the sample size through continued excavation, while a rigorous radiometric dating program and geomorphology study will hopefully more precisely identify the time frame of this occupation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3adry environmental conditions 3ageomorphology 3agypsum 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apeople 3aradiometry 3asnails 3aSouth Africa1 aStewart, Brian A.0 tQuaternary international.g2012 Aug. 23, v. 270 p.30-39dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.04.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011800174520125300292592002801545650001501573650001701588650001501605650001101620650001101631650001901642650001401661650003301675650001101708650000901719653001301728653002401741653001201765653001301777653001501790700002301805700002401828700005701852700002701909700002401936700002101960700002301981700001702004773009002021856008502111852000902196655001202205IND60782788320221119171244.0221004e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078278832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1247242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRůžičková, Jana10aOrganic compounds in the char deposits characterising the combustion of unauthorised fuels in residential boilers  aThe paper aims to find a way of simply identifying the addition of unauthorised waste (plastics) in residential boilers burning wood as the main fuel. The burning of plastics leaves a trace in char deposits, which are otherwise made up mostly of lignin breakdown products. Identification of combusted plastics in char deposits is made possible by determining unique organic compounds formed during the pyrolysis phase of combustion by pyrolysis gas chromatography. At temperatures above 800 °C, the amount of charring product from the incineration of PET is 19.5 wt%, while for PP, it is 5 wt%, and LDPE with HDPE 2.1 wt%. Combustion of polypropylene with wood has been verified by the presence of the compounds 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, 2-methyl-1-pentene, and 2,4,6-trimethyl-1-nonene. The thermal degradation of PE has been demonstrated by the presence of triplets of alkanes, alkenes, and alkadienes. Combustion of PET in domestic waste can be demonstrated by the presence of benzoic acid and its esters, benzoate compounds, and terephthalic acid. In summarising, sampling char in boilers and analysing samples for markers of plastics incineration could be used as a method for identification of unauthorised waste combustion by authorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkadienes 3abenzoic acid 3acombustion 3aenergy 3alignin 3apolypropylenes 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis gas chromatography 3awastes 3awood 0aPy-GC/MS 0aResidential boilers 0aBiomass 0aPlastics 0aCombustion1 aRaclavská, Helena1 aJuchelková, Dagmar1 aKucbel, Marek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7074-10531 aRaclavský, Konstantin1 aŠvédová, Barbora1 aŠafář, Michal1 aPfeifer, Christoph1 aHrbek, Jitka0 tEnergy.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 257 p.124724-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1247243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245010000161300001600261500002000277520123700297592002801534596005901562650001401621650001301635650001401648650002001662650000901682650001701691650002201708650002401730650002001754700001401774700001301788700001401801700001501815700001501830700001401845700001301859773010901872856008001981852000902061655001202070IND60790295420221119025545.0220824e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029542DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRan, Shujun10aFluoride resistance capacity in mammalian cells involves complex global gene expression changes  ap. 968-980.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFluorine is a bone‐seeking element ubiquitously present in the environment and widely used in many oral hygiene products. In humans, excessive intake of fluoride may cause dental and skeletal fluorosis. However, endemic fluorosis does not appear to develop in a proportion of individuals exposed to the same levels of fluoride. The mechanisms by which mammalian cells resist fluoride are still unclear. In this study, we developed strains of mouse L‐929 cells resistant to different levels of fluoride. High‐throughput RNA‐sequencing analyses of the fluoride‐resistant L‐929 cells indicated that massive changes in global gene expression occurred, compared with the wild‐type L‐929 cells. The main biological processes and functions changed were associated with the extracellular region and matrix, response to stress, receptor binding, and signal transduction. This indicated that high doses of fluoride not only exerted stress on L‐929 cells but also induced functional pathways that helped them adapt to the presence of fluoride or to expel it. These data should prove useful in identifying cellular processes or transporters/channels that play central roles in adaptation to or expulsion of fluoride in humans.  aPublisher supplied data  a81100753cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3afluorides 3afluorine 3afluorosis 3agene expression 3amice 3aoral hygiene 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3astress response1 aSun, Ning1 aLiu, Yun1 aZhang, Wu1 aLi, Yiming1 aWei, Limin1 aWang, Jia1 aLiu, Bin0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 July, v. 7, no. 7 p.968-980dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001400293500001900307520158500326592002801911650001701939650002201956650002001978650001801998650001402016650001302030650002102043650002102064650000902085650002402094650001002118650001402128650001802142651001102160700001802171700002602189700002602215773008302241856008102324852000902405655001202414IND50071748220221118030106.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007174822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-013-2753-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoriano, Diana10aEffects of burial and storage on germination and seed reserves of 18 tree species in a tropical deciduous forest in Mexico  ap. 33-44.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe changes in germination and seed reserve composition that occur while seeds are stored in the laboratory or buried in the soil are important for understanding the potential and ecological longevity of seeds as well as seed-bank dynamics. Both germination and seed-bank dynamics depend on water availability. We studied 18 tree species, including those with permeable or impermeable seeds, from a tropical deciduous forest in Mexico. We measured seed germination in a growth chamber after (1) dispersal, (2) laboratory storage, (3) seed burial at two field sites and directly in the field, and (4) two rainy seasons. Lipids, nitrogen, and nonstructural carbohydrates were quantified after dispersal and after laboratory or field storage. Sixteen species were viable after three periods of laboratory storage (~3 years). Eleven species were viable after two burial periods in the field (~2 years). Nitrogen concentration decreased after storage and burial in 11 species. Species lipid concentration had a negative relationship with species water content at dispersal and after one burial period, whereas nonstructural carbohydrates showed the opposite trend. Potential and ecological longevities were similar in impermeable seeds. Most of the species studied can form persistent seed banks consisting mainly of species with impermeable seeds that can remain in the soil without degrading their viability. Germination in the field is staggered following natural precipitation pulses as a strategy to stagger seedling recruitment, which may insure against unfavorable conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburied seeds 3adeciduous forests 3agrowth chambers 3alipid content 3alongevity 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aseed germination 3asoil 3aspecies recruitment 3atrees 3aviability 3awater content 3aMexico1 aHuante, Pilar1 aGamboa-deBuen, Alicia1 aOrozco Segovia, Alma,0 tOecologia.g2014 Jan., v. 174, no. 1 p.33-44dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2753-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245011800161300001800279500002000297520129000317592002801607596007401635596006801709596003301777596004801810596005501858596003401913650002801947650002101975650002201996650002202018650002402040650002502064700001902089700002002108700001602128773011102144856008002255852000902335655001202344IND60790295520221119025456.0220824e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029552DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Geunho10amvp – an open‐source preprocessor for cleaning duplicate records and missing values in mass spectrometry data  ap. 1051-1059.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMass spectrometry (MS) data are used to analyze biological phenomena based on chemical species. However, these data often contain unexpected duplicate records and missing values due to technical or biological factors. These ‘dirty data’ problems increase the difficulty of performing MS analyses because they lead to performance degradation when statistical or machine‐learning tests are applied to the data. Thus, we have developed missing values preprocessor (mvp), an open‐source software for preprocessing data that might include duplicate records and missing values. mvp uses the property of MS data in which identical chemical species present the same or similar values for key identifiers, such as the mass‐to‐charge ratio and intensity signal, and forms cliques via graph theory to process dirty data. We evaluated the validity of the mvp process via quantitative and qualitative analyses and compared the results from a statistical test that analyzed the original and mvp‐applied data. This analysis showed that using mvp reduces problems associated with duplicate records and missing values. We also examined the effects of using unprocessed data in statistical tests and examined the improved statistical test results obtained with data preprocessed using mvp.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF‐2014M3A9C4066449cMinistry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning  a2013M3A9C4078145cMinistry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning  cNational Research Foundation  cNational Research Foundation of Korea Grant  aNRF‐2015R1C1A1A01051578cKorea Government (MSIP)  cGIST Research Institute (GRI) 3aartificial intelligence 3achemical species 3acomputer software 3amass spectrometry 3amathematical theory 3astatistical analysis1 aLee, Hyun Beom1 aJung, Byung Hwa1 aNam, Hojung0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 July, v. 7, no. 7 p.1051-1059dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245008300182500002200265520155600287592002801843650002501871650001801896650002501914650001301939650001401952650001601966650002301982650002002005650001702025650001102042650001402053650002102067650001802088650001202106650003202118651001002150653002102160653002102181653001902202653002002221653001702241653001602258653001802274700002102292700002902313773012402342856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60741225020221119135129.0210619e20210602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074122502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaidu, Maradana Tarakeswara10aMeasuring ecological status and tree species diversity in Eastern Ghats, India  aPre-press version  aThe present study assessed the ecological status and tree diversity of Visakhapatnam forest area, part of Eastern Ghats, India, using systematic and standard sampling techniques. Tree species composition, similarity, diversity, species richness, structure of trees and disturbance levels in deciduous forests based on census of all trees with diameter at breast height ≥ 15 cm were studied. A systematic sampling protocol was adopted and twelve belt transects (5 × 1000 m), a total of 6 ha plots were laid for the vegetation survey. In all the plots, a total of 2999 individuals (mean density 500 ha⁻¹) covering 151 tree species pertaining to 106 genera and 46 families were measured. The data revealed that the forest has a moderate value for the tree species diversity index (H′) which is varied from 3.26 to 4.12. Species richness varied from 38 to 79 species ha⁻¹ and stand density from 328 to 718 individuals ha⁻¹ with an average basal area of 14.7 m²ha⁻¹. Xylia xylocarpa, Lannea coromandelica, Anogeissus latifolia and Wrightia tinctoria were the predominant plant taxa in the study area. Highest species richness recorded from Euphorbiaceae with 12 species immediately followed by Moraceae, Rubiaceae and Verbenaceae (9 species each). The species-area curve did not reach an asymptote in all the plots. The present study can provide baseline information for the effective management and restoration of forest tree species with conservation significance emphasized in highly disturbed and human impacted forest stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnogeissus latifolia 3aEuphorbiaceae 3aLannea coromandelica 3aMoraceae 3aRubiaceae 3aVerbenaceae 3aWrightia tinctoria 3aXylia xylocarpa 3aforest trees 3ahumans 3aprotocols 3aspecies richness 3astand density 3asurveys 3atree and stand measurements 3aIndia 0aSpecies richness 0aSimilarity index 0aTree abundance 0aTropical forest 0aConservation 0aDisturbance 0aEastern Ghats1 aSuthari, Sateesh1 aYadav, P.

These filters may end up in soil and water since the Wastewater Treatment Plants may not successfully remove them. Among them, benzophenones are known to act as endocrine disruptors. However, most of the studies are directed towards vertebrates and aquatic invertebrates, while there is a lack of information on the molecular mechanisms affected by these compounds on soil dwelling invertebrates. Here, we study the impact of direct acute (48 h) contact of 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OHBP) at two sublethal concentrations (0.02 and 0.2 mg/mL) on gene expression of the earthworm Eisenia fetida. Investigated genes were involved in endocrine pathways, stress response, detoxification mechanisms, genotoxicity, energy metabolism and epigenetics. Three of them were identified for the first time in earthworms. Our results suggest that exposure to 4-OHBP affected endocrine pathways, causing an increase in the Ecdysone receptor gene (EcR) expression. Moreover, the UV filter induced changes in the CuZn superoxide dismutase gene (CuZn SOD), indicating an effect in the stress response. Finally, significant changes were detected for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) expression, indicating that energy metabolism is influenced by the 4-OHBP and highlighting the risks of using GAPDH as an internal reference for Real Time PCR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3aUV filters 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abenzophenones 3aearthworms 3aecdysone receptor 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenergy metabolism 3aepigenetics 3afilters 3afood packaging 3agenes 3agenotoxicity 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asoil 3astress response 3asunscreens 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avertebrates 3awastewater treatment 0aXenobiotics 0aAnnelids 0a4-Hydroxybenzophenone 0aEndocrine disruptor 0aBiomarkers1 aMuñiz-González, A.B.1 aTrigo, D.1 aCasquero, S.1 aMartínez Guitarte, J.L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 676 p.97-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.2383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245013400208520130900342592002801651650001301679650002301692650001101715650001501726650001201741650001801753650001101771650001101782650001501793650002101808653001801829653001701847653002101864653001801885653001601903700006601919700002101985700002102006773009002027856008502117852000902202655001202211IND60782788520221119171603.0221004e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078278852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1247262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRostami, Leila1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2915-087312aA 3D CFD model of novel flow channel designs based on the serpentine and the parallel design for performance enhancement of PEMFC  aThe flow field design is one of the crucial factors that directly affects on the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell performance. To increase mass transfer, water management, and cell performance, a novel design inspired by serpentine and parallel topologies is proposed. The principal criteria of this design are focused on pressure drop reduction and a more uniform distribution of the reactants via the flow fields. To achieve these objectives, 3D PEMFC models are analyzed using the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) technique for the novel (called V-Ribbed) and common flow fields. The results showed that the pressure and the velocity distributions are more uniform in the V-Ribbed design compared with the other cases. More oxygen penetration at the cathode electrode surface is seen when liquid water within V-Ribbed channels is reduced. This causes to improve the electro chemical reaction rate, current density, and cell efficiency. It is found that using V-Ribbed channels increased the average current flux density on the cathode side about 41.5% and 21.88% compared to serpentine and parallel channels, respectively. Furthermore, the results of the polarization curve showed an enhancement of 2.19% and 2.5% in V-Ribbed design compared to serpentine and parallel channels, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3achemical reactions 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aserpentine 3awater management 0aPEM fuel Cell 0aCFD modeling 0aWater management 0aPressure drop 0aPerformance1 aHaghshenasfard, Masoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2286-821X1 aSadeghi, Morteza1 aZhiani, Mohammad0 tEnergy.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 258 p.124726-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1247263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245013800177500001900315520183900334592002802173650001402201650001502215650001802230650002802248650001402276650001102290650001402301650002202315650000902337650001502346650002102361650001302382650002502395650001202420650001302432653000802445653001702453653001902470653002302489700002202512700002002534700002002554700001902574700002102593700002202614700001802636700002602654700002102680700002202701700001902723700002602742700002202768700001702790700002002807773009302827856009102920852000903011655001203020IND60713294420221119172220.0210212e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071329442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvirskis, Darren12aA non-opioid analgesic implant for sustained post-operative intraperitoneal delivery of lidocaine, characterized using an ovine model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAppropriate management of post-operative pain is an ongoing challenge in surgical practice. At present, systemic opioid administration is routinely used for analgesia in the post-operative setting. However, due to significant adverse effects and potential for misuse, there is a perceived need for the development of alternative, opioid-sparing treatment modalities. Continuous infusion of local anesthetic into the peritoneum after major abdominal surgery reduces pain and opioid consumption, and enhances recovery from surgery. Here we describe a non-opioid, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl-acetate) intraperitoneal implant for the sustained delivery of local anesthetic following major abdominal surgery. A radio-opaque core had the required mechanical strength to facilitate placement and removal procedures. This core was enclosed by an outer shell containing an evenly dispersed local anesthetic, lidocaine. Sustained release of lidocaine was observed in an ovine model over days and the movement modelled between peritoneal fluid and circulating plasma. While desirably high levels of lidocaine were achieved in the peritoneal space these were several orders of magnitude higher than blood levels, which remained well below toxic levels. A pharmacokinetic model is presented that incorporates in vitro release data to describe lidocaine concentrations in both peritoneal and plasma compartments, predicting similar release to that suggested by lidocaine concentrations remaining in the device after 3 and 7 days in situ. Histological analysis revealed similar inflammatory responses following implantation of the co-extruded implant and a commercially used silicone drain after three days. This non-opioid analgesic implant provides sustained release of lidocaine in an ovine model and is suitable for moving onto first in human trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesics 3aanimal models 3abiocompatible materials 3ahistology 3ahumans 3alidocaine 3alocal anesthetics 3apain 3aperitoneum 3apharmacokinetics 3asilicone 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurgery 3atoxicity 0aEVA 0aCo-extrusion 0aOpioid-sparing 0aControlled release1 aProcter, Georgina1 aSharma, Manisha1 aBhusal, Prabhat1 aDravid, Anusha1 aMacFater, Wiremu1 aBarazanchi, Ahmed1 aBennet, Laura1 aChandramouli, Kaushik1 aSreebhavan, Sree1 aAgarwal, Priyanka1 aAmirapu, Satya1 aHannam, Jacqueline A.1 aAndrews, Gavin P.1 aHill, Andrew1 aJones, David S.0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Dec., v. 263 p.120409-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009500174300001400269520096200283592002801245650002401273650002001297650001201317650001401329650001401343651001201357651001901369773009101388856008401479852000901563655001201572IND60085977020221120215029.0141101e20120831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008597702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2012.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aField, Michael Hugh14aThe first British record of Actinidia faveolata C.Reid and E.M.Reid (Actinidiaceae family)  ap. 65-69.  aArchaeological artefact-bearing Pleistocene fluvial sediments, which form part of the Cromer Forest-bed Formation, below the modern beach just south-east of Happisburgh, Norfolk, UK (Happisburgh Site 1), yielded a diverse plant macrofossil assemblage that included a seed fragment of Actinidia faveolata C.Reid and E.M.Reid – an extinct relative of the modern Kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa (A.Chev.) C.F.Liang and A.R.Ferguson, Actinidiaceae family). This is the first record of this taxon in the British Isles. Previously, this extinct species has been found in Upper Oligocene sediments from West Siberia and from Miocene, Pliocene and Early Pleistocene sediments in Europe. The stratigraphical and palaeoenvironmental setting of this find is briefly considered followed by a detailed description of the fossil with a comparison of specimens from the type area.

The best-fit model for the traits was the one step heteroscedastic hierarchical reaction norm model. Heritability was close to zero in the worst environments and increased as the environments improved (from 0.06 to 0.12 for AFC and from 0.01 to 0.03 for CI). The correlations between the intercept and the slope of the reaction norms for CI and AFC were from medium to high magnitude (0.75 ± 0.10 and 0.90 ± 0.04, respectively), indicating that animals with higher average breeding values had the greatest responses to the improvement of environmental conditions. The variation in heritability indicates different response to selection according to the environment in which the animals of the population are evaluated. The G × E was evident in bulls with more female offspring. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that selection for AFC in medium- and high-level environments leads to higher genetic gains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3abreeding value 3abulls 3acalving 3acalving interval 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3agenetic improvement 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aheritability 3aheteroskedasticity 3amodels 3aprogeny 3areproductive traits 3aselection response 3aBrazil1 aMalhado, Carlos Henrique Mendes1 aFilho, Raimundo Martins1 aFlores Cardoso, Fernando,1 aCarneiro, Paulo Luiz Souza0 tTropical animal health and production.g2016 Oct., v. 48, no. 7 p.1401-1407dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-016-1105-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245008100173500001900254520108200273592002801355650002601383650002801409650002601437650001801463650001801481650002101499650002201520650002301542653001601565653003001581653001901611653001701630653001701647700001501664700001601679700002001695700001801715700001801733700001801751700001801769700001801787773009301805856009101898852000901989655001201998IND60713294520221119172400.0201111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071329452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dongdong10aProgress and perspective of microneedle system for anti-cancer drug delivery  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTransdermal drug delivery exhibited encouraging prospects, especially through superficial drug administration routes. However, only a few limited lipophilic drug molecules could cross the skin barrier, those are with low molecular weight and rational Log P value. Microneedles (MNs) can overcome these limitations to deliver numerous drugs into the dermal layer by piercing the outermost skin layer of the body. In the case of superficial cancer treatments, topical drug administration faces severely low transfer efficiency, and systemic treatments are always associated with side effects and premature drug degradation. MN-based systems have achieved excellent technical capabilities and been tested for pre-clinical chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. In this review, we will focus on the features, progress, and opportunities of MNs in the anticancer drug delivery system. Then, we will discuss the strategies and advantages in these works and summarize challenges, perspectives, and translational potential for future applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiocompatible materials 3adrug delivery systems 3aimmunotherapy 3alipophilicity 3amolecular weight 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotothermotherapy 0aMicroneedle 0aTransdermal drug delivery 0aCancer therapy 0aPhototherapy 0aGene therapy1 aHu, Doudou1 aXu, Hongxia1 aPatra, Hirak K.1 aLiu, Xiangrui1 aZhou, Zhuxian1 aTang, Jianbin1 aSlater, Nigel1 aShen, Youqing0 tBiomaterials.g2021 Jan., v. 264 p.120410-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245005500162300001600217520083500233592002801068650002201096650002201118650002201140650001501162650001201177650001601189773008801205856008001293852000901373655001201382IND60081326220140830000000.0140830s1977    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008132622DNAL7 a10.1002/star.197702912042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzejtli, J.10aInteraction of Hydrochloric Acid with Cyclodextrin  ap. 410-413.  aThe first order rate constant for the hydrochloric acid catalyzed hydrolysis of β‐cyclodextrin increases during the reaction, because the α‐1,14‐bonds present in the macrocycle and in linear dextrins (formed by opening of the macrocycles) are split at different rates. The activation energy for hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of maltose is 30,5 kcal/mole, while the opening of the cyclodextrin macroring is characterized with a value of 34,2 kcal/mole. At lower temperatures and higher HCl concentrations a rather stable crystalline HCl‐cyclodextrin complex is formed with good yield. This complex contains 1,8 molecules of HCl per cyclodextrin unit. After storage at room temperature for one year it still retains 1 mole of HCl.

We analysed a sediment record from the pro-glacial Lake Gitara of this glacier by X-ray fluorescent technique with synchrotron radiation (equipment of Multiple Access Centre SSTRC within the framework of State Contract 16.552.11.7044) at 1 mm scan resolution. The depth–age model of the core was constructed by ²¹⁰Pb and ¹³⁷Cs activity using the constant rate of supply model. The intensity of the glacier fluctuation for the last 160 years was calculated from the ratio of terrigenous elements supplied into Lake Gitara with meltwater. We defined five (c. 1880, 1905, 1918, 1950 and from 1968 to the present) significant periods of increased glacier flow for the last 160 years. The periods centred on 1905 and 1918 were probably characterised by the advance of the glacier, while its retreat was recorded in c. 1880, 1950 and from 1968 to the present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aequipment 3alakes 3amodels 3asediments 3awatersheds 3aLake Baikal 3aSiberia 0aglacier fluctuation 0aProglacial lake 0aEast Siberia1 aTrunova, V.A.1 aZvereva, V.V.1 aMaksimovskaya, V.V.1 aMelgunov, M.S.0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 69, no. 5 p.806-815dRoutledgex1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2012.712787  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010700166300001600273500001900289520166000308592002801968650001101996650001802007650000902025650001302034650001002047650001102057650001502068650001402083650001202097650001902109651001202128700002602140700002602166773008502192856004802277852000902325655001202334IND50071748620221118030125.0140109e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007174862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-013-2757-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLocke, Sean A.10aVulnerability and diet breadth predict larval and adult parasite diversity in fish of the Bothnian Bay  ap. 253-262.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecent studies of aquatic food webs show that parasite diversity is concentrated in nodes that likely favour transmission. Various aspects of parasite diversity have been observed to be correlated with the trophic level, size, diet breadth, and vulnerability to predation of hosts. However, no study has attempted to distinguish among all four correlates, which may have differential importance for trophically transmitted parasites occurring as larvae or adults. We searched for factors that best predict the diversity of larval and adult endoparasites in 4105 fish in 25 species studied over a three-year period in the Bothnian Bay, Finland. Local predator–prey relationships were determined from stomach contents, parasites, and published data in 8,229 fish in 31 species and in seals and piscivorous birds. Fish that consumed more species of prey had more diverse trophically transmitted adult parasites. Larval parasite diversity increased with the diversity of both prey and predators, but increases in predator diversity had a greater effect. Prey diversity was more strongly associated with the diversity of adult parasites than with that of larvae. The proportion of parasite species present as larvae in a host species was correlated with the diversity of its predators. There was a notable lack of association with the diversity of any parasite guild and fish length, trophic level, or trophic category. Thus, diversity is associated with different nodal properties in larval and adult parasites, and association strengths also differ, strongly reflecting the life cycles of parasites and the food chains they follow to complete transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aendoparasites 3afish 3aforaging 3ahosts 3alarvae 3apiscivores 3apredation 3astomach 3atrophic levels 3aFinland1 aMarcogliese, David J.1 aTellervo Valtonen, E.0 tOecologia.g2014 Jan., v. 174, no. 1 p.253-262dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2757-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007300170300001800243520172900261592002801990650001602018650001802034650000902052650001102061650001702072650001002089650001602099650002802115650001502143650001402158650002202172650000902194650001202203700002902215700002702244700002302271700002402294700002302318700002402341700002602365700002802391700002402419700002402443700002102467773011902488856008102607852000902688655001202697IND60555812220221119043918.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055581222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-016-1090-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilho, Antônio E.10aIntake and ingestive behavior in lambs fed low-digestibility forages  ap. 1315-1321.  aIngestive behavior of lambs fed diets consisting of fresh sugarcane with urea, bagasse treated with calcium oxide, and urea ammoniated sugarcane bagasse supplemented with concentrate mixture in 50:50 ratio were evaluated. For this, 34 wethers Santa Inês in their growing phase, with an average age of 3.0 ± 0.6 months and a mean initial live weight of 17.8± 5.2 kg were used. The animals were distributed in a completely randomized design and subjected to visual observation periods of 5 days, for 24 h a day, during the experimental period. Dry matter (DM) intake and intake efficiency of DM were higher (P < 0.05) for animals receiving fresh sugarcane with urea. The animals which were fed with bagasse treated with calcium oxide had higher (P < 0.05) consumption of neutral detergent fiber, longer feeding and chewing time (P < 0.05), and shorter (P < 0.05) idling time. The time spent on chewing the ruminal bolus did not differ from one diet to the other (P > 0.05). Grams of dry matter per ruminated bolus were similar among animals fed with fresh sugarcane and ammoniated bagasse (P > 0.05) but lower (P < 0.05) in animals fed with bagasse treated with calcium oxide. Rumination efficiency values, in grams of dry matter per hour, and grams of neutral detergent fiber per hour for all three diets were similar (P > 0.05) to those found for feeding efficiency. The number of feeding and rumination periods was not affected (P > 0.05) by diet. Based on the intake and ingestive behavior responses, the fresh sugarcane with urea compared to bagasse treated with calcium oxide and ammoniated bagasse was found to be the better alternative feed for use in lamb diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acalcium oxide 3adiet 3aforage 3alamb feeding 3alambs 3amastication 3aneutral detergent fiber 3arumination 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3aurea 3awethers1 aCarvalho, Gleidson G.

In the monosubstituted derivatives 70–80% of the hydroxyethyl groups is attached to the C2 atom. The ratio of C3 to C6 monohydroxyethylated products changes from 2 to 0.2 when increasing the MS from 0.03 to 1.9. At high MS (around 2) the disubstituted products consist for about 50% of 2‐hydroxyethoxyethyl derivative, which indicates a strong preference for the consecutive reaction of the newly formed hydroxyl group of 2 hydroxyethyl‐anhydroglucose. The distribution of mono‐ and polysubstituted products is in agreement with a model of consecutive reactions with average relative rate constants for mono‐, di‐ and higher substitution of 1.30, 1.05 and 0.85 respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary gas chromatography 3ahydrolysates 3amodels 3astarch1 aMourits, J.

This study aims to examine 0–14 days lagged effects of moderate and severe floods on diarrhea in Anhui Province, one heavily flood-prone area in China.Daily diarrheal cases from January 1, 2013 to August 31, 2017 in 16 cities of Anhui were extracted from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Meteorological data were obtained, and moderate or severe floods were identified according to Comprehensive Study Group of Major Natural Disasters of the State Science and Technology Commission in China. The quasi-Poisson generalized linear models were applied to evaluate effects of floods on daily diarrheal cases in each city with 0–14 days lag, and we divided post-flood periods into week 1 and week 2, further conducted provincial-level meta-analysis.Immediate effects of floods on diarrheal diseases were observed within 7 days, and at provincial level moderate floods had a RR of 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02–1.09) and severe floods RR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01–1.08) controlling for population size, temperature and relative humidity etc., but less effects appeared in the second week. Impacts of flooding on diarrheal diseases varied among cities. Moderate floods in week 1 had a RR of 1.51 (95% CI: 1.29–1.78) in Bozhou, and severe floods had a RR = 1.31 (95% CI: 1.05–1.64) in Chuzhou. The severe floods may have higher RR in week 1 compared with moderate floods in Anqing (1.10 vs 1.06), Chuzhou (1.31 vs 1.07) and Luan (1.18 vs 1.00).Both moderate and severe floods can significantly increase diarrheal risks in one week with regionally varied effects, and severe floods may lead higher risks. The findings have implications for preparing emergent interventions in hazard periods to reduce health risks of floods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adiarrhea 3adisasters 3adisease surveillance 3afloods 3alinear models 3ameteorological data 3anotifiable disease 3apopulation size 3arelative humidity 3arisk 3atemperature 3aChina 0aFloods 0aLagged effects 0aSevere level 0aHealth risks 0aInfectious diarrhea 0aQuasi-Poisson generalized linear model1 aHou, Sai1 aSu, Bin1 aMiao, Kaichao1 aZhang, Na1 aLiao, Wenmin1 aZhong, Shuang1 aWang, Zhe1 aYang, Lianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6201-43181 aHuang, Cunrui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9139-83540 tScience of the total environment.g2019 July 20, v. 675 p.420-428dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.2483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245008300182300001800265520151300283592002801796650001301824650001101837650001101848650001401859650000801873650000901881650001301890650001401903700003601917700003501953700004201988700003102030700002702061700003002088773011902118856008102237852000902318655001202327IND60555812320221119043820.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055581232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-016-1102-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, João Paulo Pacheco10aEnergy and protein requirements of young Holstein calves in tropical condition  ap. 1387-1394.  aOur objective was to estimate the energy and protein requirements of Holstein young calves up to 87 days old. Forty-two Holstein calves aged 4 days were used. From these, ten were randomly selected and slaughtered to compose the baseline slaughter (BS) group. The remaining calves were randomly assigned to eight treatments in a 4 × 2 factorial using a completely randomized design. The treatments were 2, 4, 6, and 8 kg/day of milk (297 g/kg CP; 319 g/kg of fat) fed twice daily, and then harvested at 59 or 87 days of age. Calves were fed a starter (193 g/kg CP; 133 g/kg NDF) ad libitum in all treatments. The calves slaughtered at 87 days of age had milk replaced by Coast-cross (Cynodoon sp.) hay (125 g/kg CP; 728 g/kg NDF). The net requirement of energy for maintenance (NEₘ) was 0.36 MJ/kg EBWG, with efficiency of utilization of energy for maintenance (k ₘ) of 59.4 %. The equation obtained to estimate the net requirement of energy for gain (NEg; MJ/d) was 4.40 × EBW⁰.⁰⁹⁹, with the efficiency of utilization of energy for gain (k g) equal to 46.5 %. The observed requirements of net and metabolizable protein for maintenance (NPₘ and MPₘ) were 3.67 and 3.88 g/kg BW⁰.⁷⁵, respectively. The efficiency of use of metabolizable protein for maintenance (k ₚₘ) was 94.6 %. The predicted requirements were higher than those observed in the literature, and this study demonstrated that the requirements of newborn calves are higher than the recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acalves 3aenergy 3aequations 3ahay 3amilk 3aneonates 3aslaughter1 aLima, Jessika Carolina Moutinho1 aCastro, Marcelo Messias Duarte1 aFilho, Sebastião de Campos Valadares1 aCampos, Mariana Magalhães1 aChizzotti, Mário Luiz1 aMarcondes, Marcos Inácio0 tTropical animal health and production.g2016 Oct., v. 48, no. 7 p.1387-1394dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-016-1102-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007700166300001600243520056100259592002800820650001800848650001200866650001300878650003100891650001300922650001100935700001700946773008800963856008001051852000901131655001201140IND60081326520140830000000.0140830s1977    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008132652DNAL7 a10.1002/star.197702912072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKearsley, M.

In this study we show that overnight fasting (15 h) promotes a shift in the liver mitochondrial bioenergetic profile, with a reduction in ADP-stimulated and maximal respiration, lower membrane potentials and lower resistance to Ca²⁺-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. Short term fasting (4 h) promoted similar changes, suggesting that this is a physiological shift in mitochondrial function associated with fasting, but not torpor. Our results suggest that the widely adopted liver mitochondrial isolation technique using fasted animals should be reconsidered, and also uncover physiological changes in bioenergetic function associated to nutritional status.  aPublisher supplied data 3afasting 3aisolation techniques 3aliver 3amitochondria 3anutritional status 3apermeability 3aprotocols 3aresting periods 3arodents 0aCRC 0aER 0aMCU 0aRCR 0aCS 0aMitochondria 0aLiver 0aFasting 0aCoupling 0aPermeability transition1 aAmigo, Ignacio1 aLuévano-Martínez, Luis Alberto1 aKowaltowski, Alicia J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 1860, no. 2 p.129-135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245010900172300001800281500002000299520088400319592002801203596002801231596002501259650002801284650001101312650002501323650002501348650001301373650002201386650002401408700002701432700002201459700002301481700002101504700002201525700002601547700002501573700002001598773011101618856008001729852000901809655001201818IND60790296220221119064902.0220824e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029622DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPleshakova, Tatyana O.10aHighly sensitive protein detection by biospecific AFM‐based fishing with pulsed electrical stimulation  ap. 1186-1195.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe report here the highly sensitive detection of protein in solution at concentrations from 10–¹⁵ to 10–¹⁸ m using the combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and mass spectrometry. Biospecific detection of biotinylated bovine serum albumin was carried out by fishing out the protein onto the surface of AFM chips with immobilized avidin, which determined the specificity of the analysis. Electrical stimulation was applied to enhance the fishing efficiency. A high sensitivity of detection was achieved by application of nanosecond electric pulses to highly oriented pyrolytic graphite placed under the AFM chip. A peristaltic pump‐based flow system, which is widely used in routine bioanalytical assays, was employed throughout the analysis.

These risk, discourses, and practices occur at multiple scales that are embedded within one another and draw their significance from cross-scalar connections; from global estimates of ocean density and emission scenarios, local design criteria for flood management, networks of tidal gauges, and individual and collective experiences of loss and change. Thus social actors responding to the complex physical challenges posed by climate change across space and time must deal with an inherent politics of building shared understanding and agreeing on (or not) desirable courses of action. These dynamics produce ‘scalar politics,’ i.e. strategies for defining and managing perceived risks at specific scales, resulting in more or less equitable and effective responses to the uneven consequences of SLR. To highlight the scalar politics of knowledge systems in adaptation planning, we present findings from two case studies of the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Florida, USA. Drawing on our findings, we propose the concept ‘scalar knowledge politics of risk.’ As knowledge claims flow between global, regional, and local decision-making spaces, we identify five scales at which knowledge systems experience friction: 1) construction of the global climate; 2) regional downscaling of climate impacts; 3) local definition of risks; 4) transformation of on-the-ground social-ecological-technical systems and infrastructures; and, 5) evaluation of interventions. Through our case study investigation of the scalar politics of SLR adaptation, we hope to help illuminate and inform strategies to overcome long-standing barriers to effective and inclusive urban adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adecision making 3aflood control 3afriction 3agauges 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3apolitics 3arisk perception 3asea level 3aspace and time 3aFlorida 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aKnowledge systems 0aClimate adaptation 0aRisk 0aPlanning 0aPolitics of scale1 aDenton, Ashlie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5591-65131 aMarissa Matsler, A.1 aGrabowski, Zbigniew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1698-63081 aMayhugh, Wendy0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2019 Sept., v. 99 p.105-114dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2019.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01182naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245010100171300001600272520030700288592002800595650004500623650000900668650001400677700001600691700001800707773011300725856005700838852000900895655001200904IND50074104320221119202117.0140319e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007410432DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.1990.tb04131.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRose, A.S.10aEvidence against dormacy in the bacterial fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida  ap. 105-107.  aResutlts indicate that A. salmonicida does not enter an unculturable dormant state.

However, the best therapeutic schedule and related mechanism on CCRA were still uncertain. Studies on blood enrichment and anti-tumor effects of combined Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD), Fe and rhEPO based on CCRA and gut microbiota modulation were conducted in this paper. Here, CCRA model was successfully induced by subcutaneous inoculation of CT-26 and i.p. oxaliplatin, rhEPO + DBD high dosage + Fe (EDF) and rhEPO + DBD high dosage (ED) groups had the best blood enrichment effect. Attractively, EDF group also showed antitumor activity. The sequencing results of gut microbiota showed that compared to P group, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and opportunistic pathogen (Odoribacter) in ED and EDF groups were decreased. Interestingly, EDF also decreased the relative abundances of cancer-related bacteria (Helicobacter, Lactococcus, Alloprevotella) and imbalance-inducing bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella and Parabacteroides) and increased the relative abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria (Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014), however, ED showed the opposite effects to EDF, this might be the reason of the smaller tumor volume in EDF group. Our findings proposed the best treatment combination of DBD, rhEPO and Fe in CCRA and provided theoretical basis and literature reference for CCRA-induced intestinal flora disorder and the regulatory mechanism of EDF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter 3aLachnospiraceae 3aLactococcus 3aanemia 3aantineoplastic activity 3ablood 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amodels 3aopportunistic pathogens 3atherapeutics 0aDanggui Buxue Decoction 0aCancer-related anemia 0aGut microbiota modulation 0aFe 0arhEPO1 aZHU, Zhen-Hua1 aYUE, Shi-Jun1 aTANG, Yu-Ping1 aCHEN, Yan-Yan1 aPU, Zong-Jin1 aTAO, Hui-Juan1 aZHOU, Gui-Sheng1 aDuan, Jin'ao,0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2021 June, v. 19, no. 6 p.422-431dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(21)60041-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245014600160300001800306500002000324520100000344592002801344596008201372596004701454596005101501596006501552596007601617596003401693596006301727650001701790650001701807650002001824650001201844650001301856650002801869700002101897700001501918700002201933773011101955856008002066852000902146655001202155IND60790296620221119064911.0220824e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029662DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ko On10aDimerization facilitates the conformational transitions for bacterial phosphotransferase enzyme I autophosphorylation in an allosteric manner  ap. 1208-1216.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe bacterial phosphotransferase system is central to sugar uptake and phosphorylation. Enzyme I (EI), the first enzyme of the system, autophosphorylates as a dimer using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), but it is not clearly understood how dimerization activates the enzyme activity. Here, we show that EI dimerization is important for proper conformational transitions and the domain association required for the autophosphorylation. EI(G356S) with reduced dimerization affinity and lower autophosphorylation activity revealed that significantly hindered conformational transitions are required for the phosphoryl transfer reaction. The G356S mutation does not change the binding affinity for PEP, but perturbs the domain association accompanying large interdomain motions that bring the active site His189 close to PEP. The interface for the domain association is separate from the dimerization interface, demonstrating that dimerization can prime the conformational change in an allosteric manner.  aPublisher supplied data  cCooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development  aPJ011112cRural Development Administration  cNew & Renewable Energy Core Technology Program  cKorea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning  a20143030090940cMinistry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea  cKorea Basic Science Institute  cNational Center for Inter‐University Research Facilities 3aactive sites 3adimerization 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3amutation 3aprotein phosphorylation1 aYun, Young‐Joo1 aKim, Iktae1 aSuh, Jeong‐Yong0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Aug., v. 7, no. 8 p.1208-1216dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013200174300001600306520145200322592002801774650002201802650001001824650001101834650001301845650001401858650002401872650001301896650001101909650001401920650001201934650001501946651001001961653002101971653001401992653001402006653002202020653001902042653000902061700002302070700002702093773011202120856008502232852000902317655001202326IND60637410820221122223852.0200305e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063741082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2019.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz López, Bruno10aLiving on the edge: Overlap between a marine predator’s habitat use and fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic waters (NW Spain)  ap. 115-123.  aThe impact of commercial fisheries on marine top predators is currently the focus of considerable international concern. In spite of the recognition of the competition between fisheries and marine predators for the same resources, few comprehensive assessments of the level of overlap between marine predators and fisheries have been conducted. Data from 273 daily boat surveys over a period of 4 years along the northwestern coast of Spain were used to assess the environmental, topographic, and anthropogenic correlates of habitat use and relative density of short-beaked common dolphins. Moreover, the degree of vulnerability of this marine top predator to coastal fisheries was assessed by identifying the type of fisheries associated with the presence of common dolphins. Our results reported that common dolphin presents a fine-scale pattern of habitat use, with an unequal use of available habitat and varying relative abundance, which was mostly related to the variation in environmental, topographic, and anthropogenic variables. The high occurrence of common dolphins in zones characterized by a high bottom trawl fishing pressure was indirectly linked to the susceptibility of these marine predators to fishing activities. These findings can be used as a relevant indicator of the degree of vulnerability of common dolphins to human pressure providing comprehensive information on which to base conservation and management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphinus delphis 3aboats 3acoasts 3adolphins 3afisheries 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3apredators 3asurveys 3atopography 3aSpain 0aMarine predators 0aFisheries 0aCetaceans 0aDelphinus delphis 0aAtlantic Ocean 0aGAMs1 aMethion, Séverine1 aGiralt Paradell, Oriol0 tProgress in oceanography.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 175 p.115-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04015naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009900161300001600260520175500276592002802031650002502059650001402084650001202098650001902110650002802129650001302157650001302170650003102183650001002214650001502224650003002239650000902269650001102278650001902289653000802308653001902316653000902335653003602344653000702380653001302387653001002400653004502410653001002455653004302465653000702508653002002515653000802535653003402543653000802577653001502585653000902600653003002609653001202639653004902651653000802700653001602708653000902724653002602733653001202759653004202771653001102813653004002824653001802864653000902882653001302891653002402904700001702928700001302945700001402958773014602972856008203118852000903200655001203209IND60622536720221120062126.0181127e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062253672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Lei10aLeukocytic toll-like receptor 2 knockout protects against diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction  ap. 668-673.  aDiabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by the deterioration of the myocardial function. Emerging evidences have indicated that leukocytic toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) played an important role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our study aimed to investigate whether TLR2 knockout (KO) exerted a cardioprotective effect in vivo. The establishment of diabetes model was set up in mice via intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Results demonstrated that blocking of TLR2 significantly suppressed the enhanced left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD) and the reduced the heart rate in diabetic cardiomyopathy mice. The decreased resting cell length, PS, TPS and + dL/dt while increased TR90 and - dL/dt caused by diabetic cardiomyopathy were remarkably inhibited by TLR2 KO. Besides that, the alleviated ΔFFI (360/380), decreased SERCA2a and p-NFATc3 expressions, extended Ca2+ decay time and elevated Calcineurin A induced by diabetic cardiomyopathy were vastly repressed by TLR2 KO in cardiocytes. Moreover, TLR2 gene silence could ameliorate oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, evidences were the up-regulated superoxide generation and Bax/Bcl-2 expression while restrained GSH/GSSG ratio caused by diabetic cardiomyopathy were tremendously repressed in TLR2 KO mice. Furthermore, blocking of TLR2 remarkably attenuated the augmented fibrosis areas of heart tissues in mice with diabetic cardiomyopathy. The result of the enhanced α-SMA and collagenⅠ caused by diabetic cardiomyopathy were suppressed in heart tissues of TLR2 KO mice further validate it. All in all, our study demonstrated that diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction could be attenuated by TLR2 KO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acardiomyopathy 3acardioprotective effect 3adiabetes 3afibrosis 3agene expression regulation 3aheart 3aheart rate 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amice 3amodels 3astreptozotocin 0aSTZ 0aStreptozotocin 0aTLR2 0aLeukocytic toll-like receptor 2 0aKO 0aKnockout 0aLVEDD 0aLeft ventricular end-diastolic dimension 0aLVESD 0aLeft ventricular end systolic diameter 0aPS 0aPeak shortening 0aFFI 0aFura-2 fluorescence intensity 0aTPS 0aTime-to-PS 0aTR90 0aTime-to-90% relengthening 0a±dL/dt 0aMaximal velocity of shortening/relengthening 0aGSH 0aGlutathione 0aGSSG 0aGlutathione disulfide 0aSERCA2a 0aSarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase 2a 0aNFATc3 0aNuclear factor of activated T-cells 0aCytoplasmic 3 0aTLR2 0aDiabetes 0aCardiac dysfunction1 aHu, Houxiang1 aLei, Yan1 aFeng, Jie0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 506, no. 3 p.668-673dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03901naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245013900186300001600325520167800341592002802019650001402047650001102061650002002072650002102092650001802113650001302131650002002144650001702164650001702181650001702198650002402215650001402239650001002253650002002263650005402283650002102337650001102358650003202369650005502401650001102456650005002467650005402517650000902571650001602580650005402596650002802650650002002678700002002698700001602718700001702734700001402751700002002765700001502785700001702800700001702817700001602834700001702850700001602867700001402883700001902897700001602916700002002932773012202952856008403074852000903158655001203167IND60083789220221116200309.0141101e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008378922DNAL7 a221189582pmid7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2011.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrante, E.10aEpicardial fat thickness significantly decreases after short-term growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy in adults with GH deficiency  ap. 459-465.  aBACKGROUND AND AIM: Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) is characterized by increased visceral fat accumulation. Echocardiographic epicardial fat thickness is a new marker of visceral adiposity. Aim of the present study was to evaluate whether epicardial fat thickness can significantly change and therefore serve as a marker of visceral fat reduction after short-term rhGH replacement therapy in patients with adult-onset GHD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Echocardiographic epicardial fat thickness was measured in 18 patients (10 M, 8 F, age 48 ± 11.8 yrs, BMI 29 ± 5.9 kg/m²) with adult-onset GHD, at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of rhGH therapy and in 18 healthy matched controls, at baseline. Echocardiographic epicardial fat thickness, conventional anthropometric and metabolic parameters, body fat percentage and quality of life were also evaluated. Epicardial fat thickness in adult GHD patients was higher than in controls (9.8 ± 2.8 vs 8 ± 3 mm, p < 0.05). Epicardial fat thickness significantly decreased after 6-months of rhGH replacement therapy (from 9.8 ± 2.8 to 7.0 ± 2.3 mm, P < 0.01, i.e. −29% from baseline). After 12 months of rhGH replacement therapy, epicardial fat thickness showed a further significant decrease (from 7.0 ± 2.3 to 5.9 ± 3.1 mm, P < 0.01, i.e. −40% from baseline). No significant changes in BMI or waist circumference after 6 or 12 months of rhGH therapy were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic epicardial fat thickness may represent a valuable and easy marker of visceral fat and visceral fat changes during rhGH replacement treatment in patients with adult-onset growth hormone deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aadults 3abody mass index 3aechocardiography 3afat thickness 3apatients 3aquality of life 3asomatotropin 3atherapeutics 3avisceral fat 3awaist circumference 2aAdiposity 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aDwarfism, Pituitaryxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aEchocardiography 2aFemale 2aHormone Replacement Therapy 2aHuman Growth Hormonexdeficiencyxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixtherapeutic use 2aIntra-Abdominal Fatxmetabolismxultrasonography. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdrug therapyxetiologyxultrasonography. 2aPericardiumxmetabolism 2aQuality of Life1 aMalavazos, A.E.1 aGiavoli, C.1 aErmetici, F.1 aComan, C.1 aBergamaschi, S.1 aProfka, E.1 aBriganti, S.1 aRonchi, C.L.1 aPasseri, E.1 aCorbetta, S.1 aLania, A.G.1 aSpada, A.1 aIacobellis, G.1 aAmbrosi, B.1 aBeck-Peccoz, P.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2013 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.459-465dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2011.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012400156300001800280500002000298520104300318592002801361650002101389650001901410650001701429650003801446650001101484650001801495650003001513650002201543650002501565650001601590700001601606700001201622700001801634773012701652856007301779852000901852655001201861IND60588116520221122102449.0180103e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058811652DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.221492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Qulong14aThe Nrf2‐ARE pathway is associated with Schisandrin b attenuating benzo(a)pyrene‐Induced HTR cells damages in vitro  ap. 1439-1449.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs is ubiquitous in the environmental sources, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) has been reported to induce reprotoxicity in previous studies. Toxicity to trophoblast cells may be one key factor, but evidences were absent. We speculated that BaP can induce cytotoxicity in human trophoblast HTR‐8/SVneo (HTR) cells, and Schisandrin B (Sch B) as a potential protector can inhibit the cytotoxicity. MTS assay identified that BaP induced HTR cells death while Sch B played a cytoprotective role. And after Nrf2 interference, the ability of Sch B‐induced cytoprotection was declined. Furthermore, PCR, western blot, ELISA, and SOD assays were found that Sch B significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2, HO1, NQO1, and SOD in the Nrf2‐ARE pathway, and the extents of increase were declined after Nrf2 interference. These results demonstrated that the Nrf2‐ARE pathway plays an important role in Sch B attenuating BaP‐induced HTR cells damages in vitro. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, recent results show presence of significant biases in the uncertainty models which support these decisions. Some important questions which are addressed in this study are i) whether there are simpler and more robust approaches to forecasting than what is the practice in this industry today, ii) whether forecasts can be calibrated for bias, and iii) what the consequences are for valuation of investments in new oil fields. In this study, 71 oil fields on the Norwegian continental shelf with production start between 1995 and 2020 are analyzed. Three robust bias reduction methods are proposed: a pure reference class forecast and two calibration models for the field operators' own forecasts. These show that expected production early in the field lifetime must be shifted down and that the uncertainty range must be expanded. The results are also consistent across field sizes and over time. The findings in this study demonstrate the need to draw on results in behavioral economics to improve uncertainty quantification - reference class forecasting is an inexpensive and powerful way to avoid cognitive biases. An important conclusion is also that the discounted revenue stream from new oil fields is far more uncertain and has a lower expected value than companies lay to ground.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalibration 3acognition 3acontinental shelf 3aenergy 3aindustry 3aoil fields 3aoils 3auncertainty 0aProduction forecasting 0aDebiasing methods 0aDecision analysis 0aReference class forecasting 0aProject valuation 0aNCS 0aNPD 0aRCF 0aPDO 0aRNB 0aFID 0aCRPS1 aBratvold, Reidar B.0 tEnergy.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 258 p.124744-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1247443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245017100165300001400336520149900350592002801849650001401877650002001891650001801911650001701929650001701946650001501963650001601978650001601994650002502010650001602035653002902051653001502080653001402095653001602109653001502125700001702140700003502157700002502192700002302217700002402240773012802264856008402392852000902476655001202485IND60646258120221119144120.0190624e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064625812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2019.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoohi, Reza10aUltrasound-assisted bleaching: Mathematical and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulation of ultrasound parameters on microbubble formation and cavitation structures  ap. 66-79.  aThe implementation of ultrasound-assisted bleaching (UAB) is gaining interest in commercial oil refining, as an alternative to the current bleaching procedure (BP), because this technique has several advantages compared to the conventional BP. The mathematical and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the influence of ultrasound power, frequency and temperature for predicting microbubble formation and heat transfer in the ultrasonic treatment of soybean oil was assessed in order to optimize the UAB process. The fluctuation frequency and wave speed showed opposite effects on system response to the imposed pressure pulse. As the bubble radius shrinks to zero (after bubble explosion), its internal pressure increases, showing a maximum pressure of 136, 180 and 188 kPa for fluid temperatures of 35, 50 and 65 °C, respectively. On the other hand, as the pressure applied was increased from 1.5 to 2.5 bar, the collapse radius increased more than 10 times for f = 25 kHz. In addition to the magnitude of the applied pressure, the oscillation frequency and temperature had a minor effect on the collapse radius. In general, the temperature showed a direct influence on bubble growth for an oscillation frequency of 55 kHz, although it was also observed that the bubble collapse radius tended to maximize at mid-range temperatures (around 50 °C). Finally, increasing the magnitude of cavitation pressure resulted in the enhancement of the collapse temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3ableaching 3afluid mechanics 3aheat transfer 3amicrobubbles 3aoil refining 3aprediction 3asoybean oil 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aComputational simulation 0aUltrasound 0aBleaching 0aSoybean oil 0aCavitation1 aAbedi, Elahe1 aHashemi, Seyed Mohammad Bagher1 aMarszałek, Krystian1 aLorenzo, José M.,1 aBarba, Francisco J.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2019 July, v. 55 p.66-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2019.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013500170300001600305520107200321592002801393650001701421650000901438650001001447650001701457651001101474773009801485856008401583852000901667655001201676IND60085978420221122130318.0141101e20120912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008597842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2012.02.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSano, Katsuhiro10aFunctional variability in the Magdalenian of north-western Europe: A lithic microwear analysis of the Gönnersdorf K-II assemblage  ap. 264-274.  aThe great amounts of finds comprising lithic artefacts, faunal remains, figurative arts and architectural remains from Gönnersdorf suggest this site was repeatedly occupied as a base camp over a period of many years. This study examines activities performed at Gönnersdorf K-II based on traceological analysis. The intensive, diverse usewear traces observed on the lithic assemblage indicate that a series of activities including hunting, butchery, processing of carcass remains, and stone-working was conducted at Gönnersdorf. This result contrasts with scarcity of usewear traces on flint artefacts at Eyserheide and also with the evidence of the specific function as a hunting camp at Bois Laiterie cave, which are both reconstructed on the basis of traceological investigations. Thus, this study shows completely different aspects of Magdalenian sites represented by traces on the lithic assemblages. The functional variability reflects a glimpse of the complementary site functions within the Magdalenian settlement-subsistence system in north-western Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropology 3aarts 3afauna 3apaleontology 3aEurope0 tQuaternary international.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 272-273 p.264-274dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.02.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008400170300001400254500001900268520141600287592002801703650002301731650002501754650002501779650001801804650000901822650001101831650001701842650001401859650001101873650001901884650001501903650001101918650002001929650001301949650001101962700002101973700002201994700002902016700002102045773008302066856004802149852000902197655001202206IND50071749620221118030147.0140109e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007174962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-013-2771-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrick, Winifred F.10aSeasonal reliance on nectar by an insectivorous bat revealed by stable isotopes  ap. 55-65.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany animals have seasonally plastic diets to take advantage of seasonally abundant plant resources, such as fruit or nectar. Switches from insectivorous diets that are protein rich to fruits or nectar that are carbohydrate rich present physiological challenges, but are routinely done by insectivorous songbirds during migration. In contrast, insectivorous bat species are not known to switch diets to consume fruit or nectar. Here, we use carbon stable isotope ratios to establish the first known case of a temperate bat species consuming substantial quantities of nectar during spring. We show that pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) switch from a diet indistinguishable from that of sympatric insectivorous bat species in winter (when no cactus nectar is present) to a diet intermediate between those of insectivorous bats and nectarivorous bats during the spring bloom of a bat-adapted cactus species. Combined with previous results that established that pallid bats are effective pollinators of the cardon cactus (Pachycereus pringlei), our results suggest that the interaction between pallid bats and cardon cacti represents the first-known plant-pollinator mutualism between a plant and a temperate bat. Diet plasticity in pallid bats raises questions about the degree of physiological adaptations of insectivorous bats for incorporation of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as nectar or fruit, into the diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntrozous pallidus 3aPachycereus pringlei 3acacti and succulents 3acarbohydrates 3adiet 3afruits 3ainsectivores 3amutualism 3anectar 3anectar feeding 3aplasticity 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3asympatry 3awinter1 aShipley, J.

The plants (Panicum maximum, Zea mays, Centrosema spp. and Pueraria spp.) were grown in weathered polluted soil samples in microcosms for 10 weeks. Residual crude oil in soil was quantified colorimetrically, while the ecotoxicity of the vegetated and control soil samples were evaluated using earthworms’ percentage survival and crop seeds’ germination bioassays. It was observed that planting of 1% (w/w) polluted soil samples reduced crude oil in the rhizosphere soils of P. maximum and Centrosema spp. by 71.6 ± 1.4 and 55.3 ± 4.3%, respectively. These are in contrast with 37.5 ± 2.5% reduction in non-vegetated control soil samples. The ecotoxicity assays indicated that planting also effected reduction of crude oils’ toxicity positively. There were 100, 40 ± 28.3 and 50 ± 21.1% survival of test earthworms, respectively, after 24 h in 1% w/w polluted soil samples phytoremediated with P. maximum, Centrosema spp. and Pueraria spp. as against 0% survival in non-vegetated control samples. The observed sensitivity of the test organisms to chemical stress bodes well for providing rapid information on effectiveness of remediation programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aCentrosema 3agermination 3apolluted soils 3aecotoxicology 3arhizosphere 3aseeds 3atropical soils 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3abioassays 3aoils 3aphytoremediation 3aplanting 3asoil sampling 3aearthworms 3atoxicity 3aPueraria 3agreenhouses 0aEcotoxicity 0aPlanting 0aContaminant concentration 0aBioindication 0aEarthworm 0aPanicum maximum0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 69, no. 6 p.921-933dRoutledgex1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2012.732809  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245011700176500001900293520132700312592002801639650002801667650002801695650002301723650002601746650001001772650001601782650000901798650001301807650001901820650001301839650001401852650002201866650002401888653001701912653002301929653002801952653002001980653001902000653002702019700001902046700001602065700001702081700001702098700001702115700001702132700002002149700001802169700001302187700002002200700001802220700001502238700001402253700001902267700002602286700001602312700002002328700002202348700001602370700001802386700001402404700001202418773009302430856009102523852000902614655001202623IND60713295720221119172335.0201111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071329572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Chenghua10aΠ electron-stabilized polymeric micelles potentiate docetaxel therapy in advanced-stage gastrointestinal cancer  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGastrointestinal (GI) cancers are among the most lethal malignancies. The treatment of advanced-stage GI cancer involves standard chemotherapeutic drugs, such as docetaxel, as well as targeted therapeutics and immunomodulatory agents, all of which are only moderately effective. We here show that Π electron-stabilized polymeric micelles based on PEG-b-p(HPMAm-Bz) can be loaded highly efficiently with docetaxel (loading capacity up to 23 wt%) and potentiate chemotherapy responses in multiple advanced-stage GI cancer mouse models. Complete cures and full tumor regression were achieved upon intravenously administering micellar docetaxel in subcutaneous gastric cancer cell line-derived xenografts (CDX), as well as in CDX models with intraperitoneal and lung metastases. Nanoformulated docetaxel also outperformed conventional docetaxel in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, doubling the extent of tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, micellar docetaxel modulated the tumor immune microenvironment in CDX and PDX tumors, increasing the ratio between M1-and M2-like macrophages, and toxicologically, it was found to be very well-tolerated. These findings demonstrate that Π electron-stabilized polymeric micelles loaded with docetaxel hold significant potential for the treatment of advanced-stage GI cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3agastrointestinal system 3agrowth retardation 3aintravenous injection 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicelles 3aneoplasm cells 3apolymers 3aremission 3astomach neoplasms 3axenotransplantation 0aNanomedicine 0aPolymeric micelles 0aGastrointestinal cancer 0aTumor targeting 0aTaxane therapy 0aTumor microenvironment1 aBai, Xiangyang1 aQi, Cuiling1 aSun, Qingxue1 aHan, Xiaoyan1 aLan, Tianyun1 aZhang, Haibo1 aZheng, Xiaoming1 aLiang, Rongpu1 aJiao, Ju1 aZheng, Zongheng1 aFang, Jiafeng1 aLei, Purun1 aWang, Yan1 aMöckel, Diana1 aMetselaar, Josbert M.1 aStorm, Gert1 aHennink, Wim E.1 aKiessling, Fabian1 aWei, Hongbo1 aLammers, Twan1 aShi, Yang1 aWei, Bo0 tBiomaterials.g2021 Jan., v. 266 p.120432-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1204323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245021200168300001400380520152100394592002801915650001501943650002001958650001401978650001601992650001202008650001102020650001102031650001402042650001902056650001302075650002802088650001902116650001102135650002602146650000902172650001402181650001402195650001302209650001102222650002602233650001502259650000902274700002002283700001802303700002302321700002102344773008802365856008102453852000902534655001202543IND60119304420221120072236.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011930442DNAL7 a10.1007/s13228-014-0036-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellmann, Susann10aFucoidan from Cladosiphon okamuranus Tokida Added to Food Has No Adverse Effect on Availability for Absorption of Divalent Minerals in the Dynamic Multicompartmental Model of the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract  ap. 19-25.  aThis study aimed to investigate whether the addition of fucoidan (Yakult Fucoidan) prepared from Cladosiphon okamuranus Tokida to food affects the availability of divalent minerals for intestinal absorption. After coadministration with a test meal into a dynamic multicompartmental model of the upper gastrointestinal tract (TIM-1), the availability for intestinal absorption (bioaccessibility) of minerals was evaluated. Fucoidan (0.033 and 0.1 g, corresponding to approximately 1.7 and 5.0 mg/kg body weight (BW) in humans) or two alginates (Cargill Algogelᵀᴹand Satialgineᵀᴹ, 3.0 g, corresponding to approximately 150 mg/kg BW in humans) suspended in 200 g water and added to 100 g test meal did not significantly decrease the bioaccessibility of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, and cobalt in comparison to the test meal without these gelling agents, except for calcium by 3.0 g Satialgine (p < 0.05). Positive control experiments with an unrealistically high dosage of fucoidan (3.0 g) significantly decreased the bioaccessibility of calcium, iron, zinc, and manganese and significantly enhanced the bioaccessibility of copper and cobalt (p < 0.05). It is concluded that the oral intake of the tested fucoidan at standard and high dosages in food has no adverse effect on divalent mineral absorption. Based on TIM-1 validation studies with minerals and metals in comparison to human studies, it is expected that these results may be extrapolated to the human situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadverse effects 3aalginates 3abody weight 3acalcium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adigestion 3aedible seaweed 3afucoidan 3agastrointestinal system 3agelling agents 3ahumans 3aintestinal absorption 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aminerals 3amodels 3anutrient availability 3atest meals 3azinc1 aMiyazaki, Kouji1 aChonan, Osamu1 aIshikawa, Fumiyasu1 aHavenaar, Robert0 tFood digestion.g2014 Dec., v. 5, no. 1-3 p.19-25dSpringer-Verlagx1869-19787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13228-014-0036-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001400292520162300306592002801929650002601957650001301983650002301996650001302019650001502032650001002047650001702057650002102074650002002095650001502115650001902130650001902149653002402168653003202192653002602224653002402250700001902274700002002293700002802313700002002341773010002361856008202461852000902543655001202552IND60749948920221118230759.0211123e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074994892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2021.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDallai, Romano14aThe sperm structure and the spermiogenesis of the drugstore beetle Stegobium paniceum (L.) (Coleoptera-Ptinidae-Anobinae)  ap. 12-22.  aWe describe in this paper the morphology of the male reproductive system, the spermiogenesis and the sperm ultrastructure of the drugstore beetle S. paniceum (L) (Coleoptera, Ptinidae). The male reproductive apparatus has a pair of long testes with six follicles, filled with cysts, each containing 128 germ cells. The sperm is about 480 μm long and is endowed of an apical spiral cylindrical acrosome, 1.7 μm long. The nucleus, 25 μm long, is also cylindrical at maturity. During spermiogenesis the nuclear envelope gives rise to two ovoid membranous structures flanking the nucleus for its whole length. The centriole adjunct material is configurated as concentric electron-dense rings. The flagellar components have a helical array; the axoneme has the typical 9 + 9+2 pattern for most of its length, but in the posterior flagellar region it modifies greatly its ultrastructure and is embedded in an electron-dense material. The two accessory bodies have a crescent-moon shape in the mature sperm, but at the beginning of spermiogenesis they are small structures lateral to the axoneme, later assuming a crescent-moon structure. A flattened cistern located between the axoneme and the plasma membrane is present in the early spermatids, but soon it fuses with the plasma membrane. Two symmetrical, largely crystallized mitochondrial derivatives are present for most of the flagellar length. S. paniceum and Lasioderma serricorne share several sperm structures. Ultrastructural results and molecular data confirm a close relationship between these two species and support their positioning within Ptinidae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasioderma serricorne 3aPtinidae 3aStegobium paniceum 3aacrosome 3acentrioles 3amales 3amitochondria 3anuclear membrane 3aplasma membrane 3aspermatids 3aspermiogenesis 3aultrastructure 0aInsect reproduction 0aBeetle sperm ultrastructure 0aInsect spermiogenesis 0aElectron microscopy1 aMercati, David1 aCucini, Claudio1 aFanciulli, Pietro Paolo1 aLupetti, Pietro0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2021 Nov., v. 295 p.12-22dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2021.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024003500159040001800194100002600212245006200238300001600300506007600316520105600392592002801448506003701476650001501513650001301528650001501541650002601556650001301582650001401595650001501609700001701624700002801641773008601669856008101755852000901836655001201845IND60081783220221207121048.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008178322DNAL7 a249813362pmid7 aPMC4169997 [Available on 10/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1007/s00412-014-0474-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTapia-Alveal, Claudia10aFunctional interplay between cohesin and Smc5/6 complexes  ap. 437-445.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChromosomes are subjected to massive reengineering as they are replicated, transcribed, repaired, condensed, and segregated into daughter cells. Among the engineers are three large protein complexes collectively known as the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes: cohesin, condensin, and Smc5/6. As their names suggest, cohesin controls sister chromatid cohesion, condensin controls chromosome condensation, and while precise functions for Smc5/6 have remained somewhat elusive, most reports have focused on the control of recombinational DNA repair. Here, we focus on cohesin and Smc5/6 function. It is becoming increasingly clear that the functional repertoires of these complexes are greater than sister chromatid cohesion and recombination. These SMC complexes are emerging as interrelated and cooperating factors that control chromosome dynamics throughout interphase. However, they also release their embrace of sister chromatids to enable their segregation at anaphase, resetting the dynamic cycle of SMC-chromosome interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA repair 3aanaphase 3achromatids 3achromosome morphology 3acohesion 3aengineers 3ainterphase1 aLin, Su-Jiun1 aO’Connell, Matthew J.0 tChromosoma.g2014 Oct., v. 123, no. 5 p.437-445dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-014-0474-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245012900165300002000294500001500314520150600329592002801835650001901863650002901882650002801911650001601939650001401955650001101969650001101980650001701991650003202008650001602040650001802056650002602074650001702100653001702117700002002134700002102154773012702175856008102302852000902383655001202392IND60551558220170613000000.0161019e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055155822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b028682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeresche, Frank10aProbing the Photosensitizing and Inhibitory Effects of Dissolved Organic Matter by Using N,N-dimethyl-4-cyanoaniline (DMABN)  ap. 10997-11007.  a2019-12-06  aDissolved organic matter (DOM) can act as a photosensitizer and an inhibitor in the phototransformation of several nitrogen-containing organic contaminants in surface waters. The present study was performed to select a probe molecule that is suitable to measure these antagonistic properties of DOM. Out of nine studied nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds, 4-cyanoaniline, N,N-dimethyl-4-cyanoaniline (DMABN), sotalol (a β-blocker) and sulfadiazine (a sulfonamide antibiotic) exhibited a marked photosensitized transformation that could be substantially inhibited by addition of phenol as a model antioxidant. The photosensitized transformation of DMABN, the selected probe compound, was characterized in detail under UV-A and visible irradiation (λ > 320 nm) to avoid direct phototransformation. Low reactivity of DMABN with singlet oxygen was found (second-order rate constant <2 × 10⁷ M–¹ s–¹). Typically at least 85% of the reactivity of DMABN could be inhibited by DOM or the model antioxidant phenol. The photosensitized transformation of DMABN mainly proceeded (>72%) through demethylation yielding N-methyl-4-cyanoaniline and formaldehyde as primary products. In solutions of standard DOM extracts and their mixtures the phototransformation rate constant of DMABN was shown to vary nonlinearly with the DOM concentration. Model equations describing the dependence of such rate constants on DOM and model antioxidant concentrations were successfully used to fit experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3asinglet oxygen 3adissolved organic matter 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aantibiotics 3aequations 3amodels 3aphenol 3asulfadiazine 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3airradiation 3asurface water 3aultraviolet radiation 3aformaldehyde 0aantioxidants1 avon Gunten, Urs1 aCanonica, Silvio0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Oct. 18, v. 50, no. 20 p.10997-11007dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b028683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007200169300001800241520091100259592002801170650002001198650000901218650002301227650002901250650001901279650001901298650000901317650000901326650001301335650002201348650001101370650001701381653001401398653001501412653001901427653001701446653001701463653002001480700001501500700001701515773012101532856008401653852000901737655001201746IND60122701520221121234722.0150325e20141117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012270152DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9200512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgaini, Zainab10aEsterified sago waste for engine oil removal in aqueous environment  ap. 2761-2766.  aAgro-waste from the bark of Metroxylon sagu (sago) was studied as a low cost and effective oil sorbent in dry and aqueous environments.

In this work the photodegradation of ethanol, used as a model VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) molecule, was investigated, comparing the efficiency of both commercial nano- and micro- sized TiO₂ samples. In all cases the same degradation pathway was observed, namely, a consecutive first-order reaction with acetaldehyde as an intermediate product and CO₂ and water as the final products. All photocatalysts were characterized by means of XRD, TEM, IR, BET and XPS analysis. A kinetic model was also developed considering the collected experimental data and a regression of both adsorption and kinetic constants was made using MATLAB software. The optimized parameters were used for simulating the experimental data using an ode15s algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetaldehyde 3aadsorption 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acomputer software 3acost effectiveness 3aethanol 3aintermediate product 3akinetics 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apowders 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avolatile organic compounds1 aPirola, Carlo1 aGalli, Federico1 aStucchi, Marta1 aMorandi, Sara1 aCerrato, Giuseppina1 aCapucci, Valentino0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 17, v. 5, no. 66 p.53419-53425dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05385d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007400169300001800243520159000261592002801851650003301879650001201912650001601924650002901940650003901969650002402008650001302032650001102045653002102056653001202077653000902089653001702098653001202115653001302127700002202140700002202162700001702184700001802201700001702219773010602236856008402342852000902426655001202435IND60122701620221121234747.0150325e20141117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012270162DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9204212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanders, Linda10aImpact of seeding on the start-up of one-stage deammonification MBBRs  ap. 2767-2773.  aTreating nitrogen-rich reject water from anaerobically digested sludge with deammonification has become a very beneficial side stream process. One common technique is the one-stage moving bed bioreactors (MBBRs), which in comparison with the other deammonification techniques can be started up without seeding anammox bacteria. This study investigated the impact of biofilm seeding on the start-up of one-stage deammonification MBBRs. Two lab-scale reactors were run in parallel with partial nitritation for 56 days until 11% of the carrier area in one reactor was replaced with fully developed deammonification biofilm to work as the seeding material. The seeded reactor started nitrogen reduction immediately up to a plateau of 1.3 g N m ⁻² d ⁻¹; after another 54 days on day 110, the reduction significantly increased. At the same time, the non-seeded reactor also started to reduce nitrogen due to deammonification. The development was followed with both nitrogen analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. On day 134, the biofilm in both reactors contained>90% anammox bacteria and reached maximum nitrogen removal rates of 7.5 and 5.6 g N m ⁻² d ⁻¹ in the seeded and non-seeded reactor, respectively. Over 80% of the inorganic nitrogen was reduced. In conclusion, the seeding did not contribute to a shorter start-up time or the achieved anammox enrichment, although it did contribute to a partial, immediate nitrogen reduction. The boundary conditions are the most important factors for a successful start-up in a deammonification MBBR system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3aenvironmental technology 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrogen 3asludge 0adeammonification 0aanammox 0aMBBR 0areject water 0aseeding 0astart-up1 aAreskoug, Therese1 aSchneider, Yvonne1 aLing, Daniel1 aPunzi, Marisa1 aBeier, Maike0 tEnvironmental technology.g2014 Nov. 17, v. 35, no. 22 p.2767-2773dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.9204213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03880naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245018300156520256600339592002802905650003102933650001502964650002302979650001403002650002203016650001303038650001703051650002803068650001803096651001003114700001603124700002003140700001903160700001703179700002003196700002103216700002003237773012903257856007503386852000903461655001203470IND60782483120221120160054.0220708e20220626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078248312DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141330752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zemin 10aDetection of Standing Dead Trees after Pine Wilt Disease Outbreak with Airborne Remote Sensing Imagery by Multi-Scale Spatial Attention Deep Learning and Gaussian Kernel Approach  aThe continuous and extensive pinewood nematode disease has seriously threatened the sustainable development of forestry in China. At present, many studies have used high-resolution remote sensing images combined with a deep semantic segmentation algorithm to identify standing dead trees in the red attack period. However, due to the complex background, closely distributed detection scenes, and unbalanced training samples, it is difficult to detect standing dead trees (SDTs) in a variety of complex scenes by using conventional segmentation models. In order to further solve the above problems and improve the recognition accuracy, we proposed a new detection method called multi-scale spatial supervision convolutional network (MSSCN) to identify SDTs in a wide range of complex scenes based on airborne remote sensing imagery. In the method, a Gaussian kernel approach was used to generate a confidence map from SDTs marked as points for training samples, and a multi-scale spatial attention block was added into fully convolutional neural networks to reduce the loss of spatial information. Further, an augmentation strategy called copy–pasting was used to overcome the lack of efficient samples in this research area. Validation at four different forest areas belonging to two forest types and two diseased outbreak intensities showed that (1) the copy–pasting method helps to augment training samples and can improve the detecting accuracy with a suitable oversampling rate, and the best oversampling rate should be carefully determined by the input training samples and image data. (2) Based on the two-dimensional spatial Gaussian kernel distribution function and the multi-scale spatial attention structure, the MSSCN model can effectively find the dead tree extent in a confidence map, and by following this with maximum location searching we can easily locate the individual dead trees. The averaged precision, recall, and F1-score across different forest types and disease-outbreak-intensity areas can achieve 0.94, 0.84, and 0.89, respectively, which is the best performance among FCN8s and U-Net. (3) In terms of forest type and outbreak intensity, the MSSCN performs best in pure pine forest type and low-outbreak-intensity areas. Compared with FCN8s and U-Net, the MSSCN can achieve the best recall accuracy in all forest types and outbreak-intensity areas. Meanwhile, the precision metric is also maintained at a high level, which means that the proposed method provides a trade-off between the precision and recall in detection accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aalgorithms 3aconiferous forests 3adead wood 3adisease outbreaks 3aforestry 3aspatial data 3asustainable development 3avascular wilt 3aChina1 aHu, Wenjie 1 aPeng, Shoulian 1 aLim, Jonathan,1 aZhang, Jian 1 aZhou, Jingjing 1 aWang, Pengcheng 1 aDian, Yuanyong 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 26, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141330753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011300168300001600281520105800297592002801355650002401383650002501407650002501432650001501457650002001472650001901492650001201511650000901523650002001532653000801552653001001560653000801570653000801578653001201586653000701598653000901605653000801614653000801622653000801630653000701638653000901645653001001654653000801664653000801672653002001680653001901700653002001719653001401739653001901753653002101772700001801793700001401811700001701825700001601842700001701858700001701875700001701892700001601909773011601925856008602041852000902127655001202136IND60551853220221121061225.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Haiping10aRecognization of receptors on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells bound with Pholiota nameko polysaccharides  ap. 649-657.  aThree major active polysaccharides isolated from Pholiota nameko (PNPS), including PNPS-1, PNPS-2 and PNPS-3, had been proved to inhibit the maturation of the murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). This paper recognized the affinity bind between PNPS and the five receptors (TLR2, TLR4, CD14, Dectin-1 and Mannose receptor) on BMDCs, using the bio-layer interferometry (BLI)-based biosensor technology developed by ForteBio on Octet RED system (Fortebio, Inc.). From the primary binding experiment, the gradient binding experiment and the inhibition binding experiment between the receptor proteins and PNPS, combined with the binding experiment between PNPS and the BMDCs membranes, we found that PNPS-1, PNPS-2 and PNPS-3 presented strong affinity bind with both TLR2 and Dectin-1 on BMDCs, only PNPS-3 with Mannose receptor. These data confirmed that PNPS could interact with TLR2, Dectin-1 and Mannose receptor that were very important for the affinity bind of these receptors and PNPS, which triggered the further stimulation on BMDCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPholiota microspora 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aToll-like receptor 4 3abiosensors 3adendritic cells 3ainterferometry 3amannose 3amice 3apolysaccharides 0aBLI 0aBMDCs 0aDCs 0aEDC 0aimBMDCs 0aKD 0akdis 0akon 0aLPS 0aMES 0aMR 0aPNPS 0aPAMPs 0aSPR 0aTLR 0aPholiota Nameko 0aPolysaccharide 0aDendritic cells 0aReceptors 0aRecogniazation 0aImmunomodulation1 aTao, Yongqing1 aZhao, Pei1 aBan, Xiaopan1 aZhi, Dexian1 aLi, Guoliang1 aWang, Fenlin1 aYang, Xiaoli1 aHuai, Lihua0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.649-657dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03572naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013300172300001600305500001900321520184600340592002802186650002502214650002202239650001502261650001102276650002002287650002102307650001502328650001902343650001402362650001102376650001702387650002102404650001002425650001802435650001502453650002602468650001402494650001302508650001402521650001102535653003502546653001502581653001702596653002102613653001802634700001902652700001302671700006002684773017002744856008302914852000902997655001203006IND60710815820221119075549.0210603e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071081582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2020.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzyk, Steven Brady10aAssociation of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs and zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, within the littoral zone of Lake Winnipeg  ap. 567-582.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhile nutrient loading has affected all levels of Lake Winnipeg’s ecology, its greatest influence has likely been on the microbial community. In addition to eutrophication, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have recently invaded the ecosystem and threaten food web dynamics. Their filter-feeding predation and association with bacteria, specifically phototrophs, was investigated. A sampling trip to Lake Winnipeg in October 2017, focused on the isolation, enumeration, and identification of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs in littoral water, sediment, and tissues of mussels. Gimli, Patricia, and Grand beaches, separated by >15 km across the South Basin, had similar bacterial counts when cultivated on rich organic, BG-11, purple non-sulphur, and K₂TeO₃-supplemented media. Culture-based enumeration on rich organic medium revealed 1.74% of heterotrophs from littoral waters were aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, and represented 13.98% within sediments. In contrast, 0.48, 1.15, and 0.16% of cultured heterotrophs were aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs within zebra mussel gill, gut, and gonadal tissues, respectively. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S V4 rDNA maintained similar trends in respective bivalve organs, where 0.22, 1.13, and 0.20% of total 16S genes belonged to these phototrophs. Several Sphingomonadaceae isolates were recovered from gut tissues, all with filamentous morphology large enough for predation. Bioaccumulation of metals was also studied in D. polymorpha. All tested associated aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs were capable of resisting the metalloid oxide tellurite. The consistent distribution of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs within microbial communities across Lake Winnipeg, and their predominance in the gut tissues of zebra mussels suggested bacterial consumption by this invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aSphingomonadaceae 3aautotrophs 3abasins 3abioaccumulation 3adigestive system 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3afood webs 3agonads 3aheterotrophs 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3ametalloids 3amicrobial communities 3apredation 3aresearch 3asediments 3azebras 0aAerobic anoxygenic phototrophs 0aMicrobiome 0aZebra mussel 0aMetalloid oxides 0aLake Winnipeg1 aWiens, Kaitlyn1 aMa, Xiao1 aYurkov, Vladimir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9046-03710 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2021 June, v. 47, no. 3 p.567-582dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Great Lakes ResearchwJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2020.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013800162300001400300520137100314592002801685650002501713650001601738650002401754650002701778650001001805650002201815650001401837650002301851650001001874650002401884650002401908650001801932650001301950650002101963700001901984773011502003856008102118852000902199655001202208IND60478666320221118125942.0160113e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047866632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-015-0922-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiani, Ali10aEffects of live weight at slaughter on fatty acid composition of Longissimus dorsi and Biceps femoris muscles of indigenous Lori goat  ap. 67-73.  aThis study aimed to determine fatty acid (FA) composition of Longissimus dorsi (LD) and Biceps femoris (BF) muscles of an Iranian indigenous goat (Lori goat) at two live weights at slaughter (LWS). Twenty male Lori goats (5 to 8 months) raised in nomadic system were slaughtered either at LWS less than 20 kg (light) or LWS more than 30 kg (heavy). Carcass dressing and FA composition of intramuscular fat of LD and BF muscles as well as cholesterol content of LD muscle were determined. Heavy goats had higher dressing percentage than light ones (42.7vs.39.3 %, P < 0.01). The predominant n-6 FA were C18:2, and C20:4 while C22:5, C20:5, C18:3, C20:3, and C22:6 were the n-3 FA detected. Polyunsaturated and saturated FA contributed 22 % and 36 % of the total FA in both muscles, respectively. Palmitic acid (C16:0) of LD was higher in heavy compared to the light goats (P < 0.05). BF muscle had higher α-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) as percentage than LD muscle (P < 0.05). The ratio of n-6/n-3 FA and polyunsaturated/saturated FA were 3.8 and 0.6, respectively. Cholesterol content of LD muscle of light and heavy goats were 71.2 ± 16 and 59.5 ± 14 mg per 100 g fresh meat respectively. In conclusion, desirable PUFA/SFA (0.6) and n-3/n-6 ratio (3.8) found in indigenous Lori goat propose healthy source of lean meat for the consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3acholesterol 3adressing percentage 3afatty acid composition 3agoats 3aintramuscular fat 3alean meat 3alongissimus muscle 3amales 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apalmitic acid 3araw meat 3aslaughter weight1 aFallah, Rozbeh0 tTropical animal health and production.g2016 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.67-73dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-015-0922-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04325naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245003800207300001100245506007600256520286700332592002803199506003703227650002603264650002303290650002503313650003003338650001103368650001403379650001703393650001403410650001203424650002603436650001103462650003003473650001403503650002403517650001403541650001303555650001103568650001503579650001103594651001103605773011303616856008103729852000903810655001203819IND60550189820221207113944.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055018982DNAL7 a10.1186/s13002-016-0112-02doi7 aPMC50135932pmcid7 a276005302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlm, Torbjørn10aFern rhizomes as fodder in Norway  ap. 37.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Although ferns are often known under collective names in Norway, e.g. blom, a substantial number of vernacular names for individual fern species are known, in particular for useful or poisonous taxa. In the past, the rhizomes (Norwegian: moldfôr) of selected species were collected for fodder. Only scattered records of such use are available from southern Norway, and the tradition’s core area is found in the two North Norwegian counties of Nordland and Troms, in accordance with the longer winters encountered in the north, frequently leading to fodder shortage in early spring. The tradition extends northeastwards into Finnmark, but is less well documented there. Although numerous sources mention the use of fern rhizomes for fodder, the fern species hiding behind the tradition are incompletely known. This paper aims at reviewing available data in terms of identifyng the species used for fodder, the history and geographical distribution of such use, and other relevant traditions, e.g. the timing and mode of collection, and the way the rhizomes were used. METHODS: The study is based on data extracted from a variety of archival and literature sources; the latter retrived from my database of more than 7500 publications providing information on plant names and plant uses in Norway. RESULTS: More than 200 individual records mention the use of fern rhizomes for fodder in Norway. Only a fraction of these, typically made by botanist recording data on plant uses, provides information on the identity of the species used. Based on these, Dryopteris filix-mas and Matteuccia struthiopteris stand out as the most important species serving as sources of fern rhizomes for fodder. Locally, Dryopteris expansa was the preferred species, and this taxon may to some extent be overlooked in the records so far available. With a few exceptions, Norwegian folk tradition singles out Athyrium filix-femina as a harmful and poisonous species, causing livestock to go blind and lame, but whether this is true or not, remains unknown; the symptoms are in fact documented elsewhere as a consequence of poisoning due to Dryopteris filix-mas. In coastal north Norway, fern rhizomes were regularly collected for fodder, both in late autumn and early spring, and used to remedy a recurrent shortage of fodder in late winter and spring. Locally, the tradition of collecting fern rhizomes lived on until the 1940’s or 1950’s. Although mainly a tradition of the ethnic Norwegians, it had also been adopted by the farmers belonging to the Finnish and Sámi ethnic minorities. CONCLUSION: Fern rhizomes have a long tradition as an additional fodder for livestock in Norway. Preferred species were Matteuccia struthiopteris and Dryopteris filix-mas, locally also Dryopteris expansa. Athyrium filix-femina was considered to be poisonous, and usually avoided.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAthyrium filix-femina 3aDryopteris expansa 3aDryopteris filix-mas 3aMatteuccia struthiopteris 3aautumn 3abotanists 3acommon names 3adatabases 3afarmers 3aferns and fern allies 3aforage 3ageographical distribution 3alivestock 3aminorities (people) 3apoisoning 3arhizomes 3aspring 3atraditions 3awinter 3aNorway0 tJournal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine.g2016 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.37-37dBioMed Centralx1746-42697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13002-016-0112-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010700159300001600266520149100282592002801773650001501801650001201816650003001828650002201858650001201880650001201892650001501904650001901919650002001938650001601958650001201974650001401986700002102000700003102021700002002052700002202072700001902094700002102113700002002134773018202154856007302336852000902409655001202418IND60125932220221117234625.0150428e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593222DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenedek, Klára10aChemotype of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) determines aphid genotype and its associated predator system  ap. 709-719.  aField assessments and genetic analyses on tansy aphid, Metopeurum fuscoviride Stroyan were made aiming to investigate whether a specialist aphid species and its associated predator density differ between chemotypes of the plant host, tansy, and whether the essential oil composition of the plant host determines the genetic differences observed between colonies of M. fuscoviride inhabiting these different chemotypes. Tansy plants were defined after volatile extractions as Camphor Pure and Borneol Pure, respectively, with hybrid chemotypes defined as Camphor Hybrid, Borneol Hybrid, and Thujone Hybrid, respectively. Ladybird beetles, Coccinella septempunctata (L.), clearly dominated Pure Camphor plants, whereas significantly higher numbers of the nursery web spider, Pisaura mirabilis (Clerck), were detected on Borneol Pure and Borneol Hybrid plants. Genetic analyses using five polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed that higher genetic similarity existed between M. fuscoviride aphids from Borneol Pure and Borneol Hybrid plants and between Camphor Pure and Camphor Hybrid plants, respectively, whereas a lower level of genetic similarity was seen between these aphids from Thujone Hybrid plants. Accordingly, it is possible that host plant‐adapted species can create much context‐dependency in the nature and strength of predation effects, which may in turn alter costs and benefits of host plant chemical differentiations, or even the prey genotype variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aAraneae 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3aTanacetum vulgare 3aborneol 3acamphor 3achemotypes 3aessential oils 3agenetic markers 3ahost plants 3ahybrids 3apredation1 aBálint, János,1 aSalamon, Rozália Veronika1 aKovács, Erika,1 aÁbrahám, Beáta1 aFazakas, Csaba1 aLoxdale, Hugh D.1 aBalog, Adalbert0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 Mar., v. 114, no. 3 p.709-719dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245010000162300002000262520112600282592002801408650001601436650001501452650002301467650001401490650002301504650002801527650002201555650002301577650001001600650001601610650001901626650000901645650002601654650001601680700002501696700002601721700003401747773013001781856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60565688920221120225128.0170327e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056568892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b057882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeeva, Mani10aInteractions and Inhibition Effect of Urea-Derived Mannich Bases on a Mild Steel Surface in HCl  ap. 22025-22043.  aCost-effective new Mannich bases 1-(pyridin-4-yl(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl)urea (UPyP), 1-(morpholino(pyridin-4-yl)methyl)urea (UMP), and 1-(piperidin-1-yl(pyridin-4-yl)methyl)urea (UPP) were synthesized, characterized, and examined as corrosion inhibitors for the corrosion of a mild steel surface in 1.0 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution using weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The X-ray structures of UMP and UPP are reported. The inhibition efficiency increases with increasing inhibitor concentration and decreases with increasing solution temperature. Potentiodynamic polarization measurements showed that all inhibitors are mixed type. The values of thermodynamic and activation parameters were calculated and discussed. Adsorption of inhibitors on the mild steel surface in the presence of HCl follows Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm. The relationship between molecular structure and their inhibition efficiencies has been studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadsorption 3achemical structure 3acorrosion 3acost effectiveness 3adielectric spectroscopy 3ahydrochloric acid 3asorption isotherms 3asteel 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3aurea 3auridine monophosphate 3aweight loss1 aPrabhu, G.

Recently, the coupling of UC nanocrystals with metal nanoparticles (NPs) has been developed as a valuable strategy to enhance their luminescence. Herein, we present a facile method to fabricate mesostructured Y₂O₃:Er UC microspheres using mesoporous silica spheres as a hard template, and then integrate Y₂O₃:Er UC microspheres with Au NPs for constructing Y₂O₃:Er@Au hybrid composites, in which a multilayer polyelectrolyte serves as spacer. We further demonstrate the multicolour UC emissions are enhanced after adsorbing Au NPs and this enhancement can be at least partly attributed to surface plasmon-coupled emission, which can increase the radiative decay rate and emission efficiency. It is anticipated that these hybrid nanostructures may provide a platform for widely exploring applications in bioimaging, bioassays and detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3aelectrolytes 3aemissions 3agold 3aluminescence 3amicroparticles 3ananocrystals 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anear infrared radiation 3aphotochemical reactions 3aporous media 3asilica1 aZhu, Yihua1 aYang, Xiaoling1 aFan, Kaicai1 aShen, Jianhua1 aLi, Chunzhong0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 2, no. 28 p.10592-10597dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21345a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012100166300001800287520126600305592002801571650002801599650001801627650001601645650004401661650002001705650002901725650001001754650001401764650002201778650001301800650001301813650001801826650001101844653002001855653005201875653001901927653002801946653002401974700002101998700002002019773010602039856008402145852000902229655001202238IND60122702020221122004607.0150325e20141117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012270202DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9221272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilic, Arzu10aKinetics of autotrophic denitrification process and the impact of sulphur/limestone ratio on the process performance  ap. 2796-2804.  aKinetics of sulphur–limestone autotrophic denitrification process in batch assays and the impact of sulphur/limestone ratio on the process performance in long-term operated packed-bed bioreactors were evaluated. The specific nitrate and nitrite reduction rates increased almost linearly with the increasing initial nitrate and nitrite concentrations, respectively. The process performance was evaluated in three parallel packed-bed bioreactors filled with different sulphur/limestone ratios (1:1, 2:1 and 3:1, v/v). Performances of the bioreactors were studied under varying nitrate loadings and hydraulic retention times (3–12 h). The maximum nitrate reduction rate of 0.66 g L ⁻¹ d ⁻¹ was observed at the loading rate of in the reactor with sulphur/limestone ratio of 3:1. Throughout the study, nitrite concentrations remained quite low (i.e. below 0.5 mg L ⁻¹ . The reactor performance increased in the order of sulphur/limestone ratio of 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16S rRNA genes showed quite stable communities in the reactors with the presence of Methylo virgulaligni, Sulfurimonas autotrophica, Sulfurovum lithotrophicum, Thiobacillus aquaesulis and Sulfurimonas autotrophica related species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThiobacillus aquaesulis 3abatch systems 3abioreactors 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental technology 3agenes 3alimestone 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aribosomal RNA 3asulfur 0adenitrification 0asulphur–limestone autotrophic denitrification 0adrinking water 0asulphur/limestone ratio 0amicrobial community1 aSahinkaya, Erkan1 aÇınar, Özer,0 tEnvironmental technology.g2014 Nov. 17, v. 35, no. 22 p.2796-2804dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.9221273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245006800177300001600245520168900261592002801950650001701978650002201995650001302017650001102030650003502041650001902076650001702095653002702112653002602139653002402165653003302189653003702222653002202259700002202281700002102303700001702324773010202341856008702443852000902530655001202539IND60545624120221120074944.0160902e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054562412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollier, Zachary A.10aStakeholder engagement in dredged material management decisions  ap. 248-256.  aDredging and disposal issues often become controversial with local stakeholders because of their competing interests. These interests tend to manifest themselves in stakeholders holding onto entrenched positions, and deadlock can result without a methodology to move the stakeholder group past the status quo. However, these situations can be represented as multi-stakeholder, multi-criteria decision problems. In this paper, we describe a case study in which multi-criteria decision analysis was implemented in a multi-stakeholder setting in order to generate recommendations on dredged material placement for Long Island Sound's Dredged Material Management Plan. A working-group of representatives from various stakeholder organizations was formed and consulted to help prioritize sediment placement sites for each dredging center in the region by collaboratively building a multi-criteria decision model. The resulting model framed the problem as several alternatives, criteria, sub-criteria, and metrics relevant to stakeholder interests in the Long Island Sound region. An elicitation of values, represented as criteria weights, was then conducted. Results show that in general, stakeholders tended to agree that all criteria were at least somewhat important, and on average there was strong agreement on the order of preferences among the diverse groups of stakeholders. By developing the decision model iteratively with stakeholders as a group and soliciting their preferences, the process sought to increase stakeholder involvement at the front-end of the prioritization process and lead to increased knowledge and consensus regarding the importance of site-specific criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adredged materials 3adredging 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aprioritization 3astakeholders 0aStakeholder engagement 0aGroup decision making 0aSediment management 0aCollaborative model building 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis 0aLong Island Sound1 aBates, Matthew E.1 aWood, Matthew D.1 aLinkov, Igor0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 496 p.248-256dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04262naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100002100178245009100199300001600290520176200306592002802068650002302096650002502119650002002144650002402164650002902188650002602217650001402243650001302257650000902270650004002279650001002319650001702329650002502346650003002371650003202401650003402433650002302467650002202490650002502512650002802537650002002565650004202585650003802627650001102665650001102676650007302687650000902760650002502769650004802794650002402842650001802866650003002884650002002914650001702934650006802951651002603019700002703045700003103072700001703103700001903120700001903139700002503158700002703183700002403210700002503234773009603259856009303355990002303448852000903471655001203480IND60088891020221118074742.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008889102DNAL7 a220562152pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavo, Anthula E.10aQualitative characteristics of HDL in young patients of an acute myocardial infarction  ap. 257-264.  aAIM: Recently, the concept that high density lipoprotein (HDL) quality is an important parameter for atheroprotection is gaining ground, though little data exists so far to support it. In an attempt to identify measurable qualitative parameters of HDL associated with increased risk for premature myocardial infarction (MI), we studied the structural characteristics of HDL from patients who survived an MI at a young age (≤35 years). METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 20 MI patients and 20 healthy control subjects. HDL of patients had reduced apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apolipoprotein M, and paraoxonase 1 levels and significantly elevated apolipoprotein C-III (apoCIII) levels (all p<0.05). Specifically, the HDL apoA-I/apoC-III ratio was 0.24±0.01 in patients versus 4.88±0.90 in controls (p<0.001). These structural alterations correlated with increased oxidation potential of HDL of the MI group compared to controls (2.5-fold, p=0.026). Electron microscopy showed no significant difference in average HDL particle diameter between the two groups though a significant difference existed in HDL diameter distribution, suggesting the presence of different HDL subpopulations in MI and control subjects. Indeed, non-denaturing two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that MI patients had reduced pre-β1α, pre-β1b and α₂, and elevated α₁, α₃, and pre-α₄ HDL. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in the HDL apoA-I/apoC-III ratio, changes in the HDL subpopulation distribution and an increase in HDL oxidation potential correlated with the development of MI in young patients. The possibility that such changes may serve as markers for the early identification of young individuals at high risk for an acute coronary event should be further explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3aapolipoprotein C-III 3aatherosclerosis 3aelectron microscopy 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3amyocardial infarction 3aoxidation 3apatients 3arisk 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aAdult 2aAge of Onset 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aApolipoprotein A-Ixblood 2aApolipoprotein C-IIIxblood 2aAryldialkylphosphatasexblood 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aEarly Diagnosis 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipoproteins, HDLxbloodxchemistryxclassificationxultrastructure. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMyocardial Infarctionxbloodxepidemiology. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aParticle Size 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 0aGreecexepidemiology.1 aRallidis, Loukianos S.1 aSakellaropoulos, George C.1 aLehr, Stefan1 aHartwig, Sonja1 aEckel, Juergen1 aBozatzi, Polyxeni I.1 aAnastasiou-Nana, Maria1 aTsikrika, Panagiota1 aKypreos, Kyriakos E.0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Jan., v. 220, no. 1 p.257-264dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.10.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03987naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245018200184520208600366592002802452650001902480650002202499650000902521650001002530650000902540650001802549650001902567650002402586650000902610650001202619650001202631650002402643650001302667651001102680653002402691653002302715653001802738653001402756700003002770700002702800700003502827700003902862700004102901700003102942700003602973700002803009700003503037700003503072700003003107700003403137700002603171773011503197856008803312852000903400655001203409IND60777409220221119183343.0220606e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077740922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.1056712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenaforte, Klauber Menezes14aThe association between non-permanence of dogs in households and non-compliance with the principles of responsible animal guardianship: A survey in a medium-sized city in Brazil  aThe permanence of a dog in a household is relevant in terms of public health and animal welfare because it implies that the animal is receiving better care and is unlikely to be abandoned. We have performed a survey in a medium-sized city in southeastern Brazil in order to identify predictors associated with the non-permanence of dogs in households as determined one year after the first visit. During the first of two visits to randomly selected domiciles, guardians were asked to complete a structured questionnaire regarding the traits and history of each dog in the household, features of the domicile, characteristics of the guardian and adherence to the principles of responsible companion animal guardianship (RCAG). A second visit to each domicile was performed one year later in order to establish in loco whether the dog still resided in the domicile and, where appropriate, to apply a further questionnaire concerning the fate of the missing animal. The total sample population comprised 513 dogs, of which 98 (19.1%) were verified as no longer resident in the domicile on the occasion of the second visit. Of the absent dogs, 59 had died as a result of fights with stray animals, traffic accidents, diseases or old age, 13 had been sent to alternative addresses, 8 had been donated to third parties and 7 had escaped from the domicile. The fates of the remaining 11 animals were not divulged by the guardians. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the risk of non-permanence was significantly higher (p < 0.05) among male dogs, those that were infested with ticks, had free access to the streets or resided in domiciles near a wooded area, but was significantly lower among wormed and neutered dogs. The adoption of RCAG principles is associated with the permanence of dogs in households and, consequently, in reduction of the stray population, animal well-being and prevention of zoonoses. On this basis, it is important to raise awareness about the concepts of RCAG and to strengthen accountability of guardians that do not take proper care of their animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccountability 3aanimal well-being 3adogs 3amales 3apets 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asurveys 3atraffic 3aveterinary medicine 3azoonoses 3aBrazil 0aResponsible custody 0aAnimal abandonment 0aDomestic dogs 0aLongevity1 ade Melo, Saulo Nascimento1 aMachado, Raíssa Cotta1 aSoares, Paulo Henrique Araújo1 aGonçalves, Claudia Maria de Souza1 aRibeiro, Renata Aparecida Nascimento1 aCamargos, Naiara Jorgelina1 aSchmidt, Ina Beatriz de Freitas1 aSantos, Ingrid Morselli1 aTrindade, Clara Lemos Carneiro1 aCunha, Anna Karolyna Rodrigues1 ade Aquino, Vanessa Vilela1 aHorta, Marco Aurélio Pereira1 aBelo, Vinícius Silva0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2022 July, v. 204 p.105671-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.1056713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011000163300001800273520167100291592002801962650002001990650001102010650001302021650001502034650001902049650002902068650001102097650001002108650001102118650001602129651001002145653000802155653002902163653001802192653004502210653001602255700001302271700001702284700001202301773010602313856008402419852000902503655001202512IND60122702120221122031551.0150325e20141117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012270212DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9235152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yang14aThe primary evaluation and characterization of obsolete DDT pesticide from a precalciner of a cement kiln  ap. 2805-2812.  a1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bi(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) pesticide that has been extensively used in agriculture in China in the last century, and even now, has been banned from all purposes. The disposal of obsolete DDT pesticide has been an urgent task for the Chinese government. In order to evaluate the feasibility of co-processing DDT in the current new style dry-process rotary kiln with a precalciner as the feeding point, the destruction efficiency (DE) of DDTs (including p,p ′-DDT, o,p ′-DDT, p,p ′-DDE and p,p ′-DDD), proportion of DDTs in the combustion residue and exhaust gas, and the release of chlorine were studied under different operating conditions of temperature, oxygen content and gas retention time in the laboratory. The DE of DDTs exceeded 99% when the temperature was over 800 °C with enough oxygen. As the temperature increased from 600 °C to 1200 °C, the proportion of p,p ′-DDD increased and p,p ′-DDT decreased but still the main effective component remained in the combustion residue. In the exhaust gas, the most dominant phenomenon was the rapid increase in p,p ′-DDE concentration as the temperature increased. The release of chlorine reached a peak between 800 °C and 900 °C. It was found that the oxygen content had a positive correlation with the process of dechlorination. The proportion of p,p ′-DDE increased as the oxygen content was increased in the exhaust gas. The gas retention time had almost no influenced on the DE of DDTs, but affected the degradation extent of DDTs in the gas phase. These experiments showed that co-processing of obsolete DDT pesticide in cement kiln precalciners is feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3acement 3achlorine 3acombustion 3adechlorination 3aenvironmental technology 3aethane 3agases 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3aChina 0aDDT 0adisposal characteristics 0aco-processing 0anew style dry-process rotary kiln system 0aprecalciner1 aWang, Qi1 aHuang, Qifei1 aHe, Jie0 tEnvironmental technology.g2014 Nov. 17, v. 35, no. 22 p.2805-2812dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.9235153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245010000167520138000267592002801647650001501675650001901690650001501709650002501724651001201749700002601761700002701787773012901814856007501943852000902018655001202027IND60782483720221120144000.0220708e20220627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078248372DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141330802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamborrino, Cristiano 10aSentinel-2 Satellite Image Time-Series Land Cover Classification with Bernstein Copula Approach  aA variety of remote sensing applications call for automatic optical classification of satellite images. Recently, satellite missions, such as Sentinel-2, allow us to capture images in real-time of the Earth’s scenario. The classification of this large amount of data requires increasingly precise and fast methods, which must take into account not only the spectral features dependence of each individual image but also that of the temporal ones. Copulas are an excellent statistical tool, able to model joint distributions between even random variables. In this paper, we propose a new approach for Satellite Image Time-Series (SITS) land cover classification, which combines the matrix factorization to reduce the dimensionality of the data and the use of copulas distribution to model the dependencies. We will show how the use of particular copulas can improve the accuracy of classification compared to the latest methodologies used for the classification task, such as those using Neural Networks. Experiments were conducted at a study site located on Reunion Island, using Sentinel-2 SITS data. Results are compared to those achieved by several approaches commonly used to address SITS-based land cover mapping and show that the use of copulas, in combination with the matrix factorization, achieved the highest classification yield compared to competing approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3aReunion1 aInterdonato, Roberto 1 aTeisseire, Maguelonne 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 27, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141330803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007700158300001600235500002000251520165600271592002801927596008201955596007902037596003802116596005002154596005602204650002302260650001502283650002402298650001802322650001002340650001802350650002202368650002602390650003202416650002602448650001502474650002402489650001702513650001802530650001302548650003702561700001702598700005502615773012402670856007302794852000902867655001202876IND60614879720221121223033.0181002e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061487972DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.124402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, A. E.10aCrop rotation in no‐till soils modifies the soil fatty acids signature  ap. 427-436.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnalysis of whole‐soil fatty acids (WSFA) was used to characterize no‐till productive agricultural soils associated with different crop rotation managements on the Argentinean pampas, over two sampling seasons. Crop rotation (CR) treatment was compared with soybean monocropping (MC). Soils from nearby natural environments (NE) were used as reference treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the soil lipid signature and seek putative markers of agricultural management. NE sites had greater concentration of total WSFA than agricultural sites, but no differences between CR and MC were identified. NE sites were characterized by straight chain and mono‐unsaturated fatty acids, such as 16:1ω5c, an established biomarker for arbuscular mycorrhiza. Comparing lipid profiles using multivariate methods allowed a comprehensive comparison among treatments. The CR and NE soil samples were more alike than those of MC, with several fatty acids in common. CR soils were associated with mixed, branched and hydroxylated fatty acids. MC profiles appeared to be enriched by 16:010Me and 18:1ω7c fatty acids, which could be potential treatment markers. Thus, use of the WSFA approach to study soil lipid signature appeared to be a sensitive method to characterize soil health and soil use and management. However, some of the fatty acids do not come from living cells but from soil organic matter, which sets a limitation on interpretation in terms of the microbial community but expands the biological origin of the soil lipid signature to any biological matter, alive or death, which is a constitutive part of the soil under study.  aPublisher supplied data  aPAE 36976‐PID 53cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica  aPME 2006‐1730cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica  aPIP2012‐11220110100031cCONICET  aPUNQ 0395/07cUniversidad Nacional de Quilmes  aPUNQ EXPTE 1411/15cUniversidad Nacional de Quilmes 3aagricultural soils 3abiomarkers 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3adeath 3ahydroxylation 3alipid composition 3amicrobial communities 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3amultivariate analysis 3ano-tillage 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3asoybeans 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aRavnskov, S.1 aWall, L.

DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center Veterans Affairs Hospital St. Louis, MO. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=705) were screened for cognitive dysfunction in 2003 using the SLUMS exam and MMSE, and mortality and institutionalization up to 7.5-years later were evaluated as outcome measures. MEASUREMENT: The associations between outcome measures and MMSE and SLUMS exam total scores, and cognitive status were examined using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional-hazards regression. RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-three charts were reviewed, 176/533(33%) patients had died and 31/526 (6%) were institutionalized during 7.5-year follow-up period. All subjects were male with a mean age of 75 years and most had high school education or greater (71%). MMSE dementia, SLUMS dementia (ps<.001) and MCI (p<.05) groups had significantly lower survival rates than normal cognition group in the Kaplan-Meier curves. Scores classified as dementia on SLUMS (HR=2.4, 95% CI 1.6â3.7; p <.001) or MMSE (HR=2.3, 95% CI 1.5â3.6; p <.001) both predicted mortality and, also, institutionalization (SLUMS: HR=3.5, 95% CI 1.3â9.1; p <.01; MMSE: HR=3.8, 95% CI 1.6â9.0; p <.001) after adjustment for covariates. Unadjusted SLUMS exam MCI predicted morality (HR=1.5, 95% CI 1.1â2.2; p <.019) but not institutionalization. CONCLUSION: The SLUMS exam and MMSE both predict mortality and institutionalization for male patients screened as positive for dementia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical examination 3acognition 3adementia 3ahealth status 3alongitudinal studies 3amales 3amental health 3apatients 3ascreening 3asecondary education 3asurvival rate 3aveterans 3aMissouri1 aMalmstrom, T.

In this work, a novel blind-side rotor is designed to assemble with the stator of a laboratory-scale inline high-shear mixer equipped with an annular cylinder inside the mixing chamber (bRS HSM). The effects of operating parameters, structural parameters on the average droplet size, DSD, and span are experimentally investigated and compared with those of commercially used toothed-type rotor-stator assembly. In addition, computational fluid dynamics calculations are performed to investigate the influences on the flow field of the fluid within the HSM. The results show that the structure of the bRS HSM not only generates an optimal span but also reduces the energy consumption of the mixer, which is more advantageous for production of emulsions with narrower DSD. In the bRS HSM, Sauter mean diameter (d₃₂) and span decrease with increasing rotor speed but decreasing flow rate of the continuous phase, while span decreases and then increases with increasing volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Meanwhile, the effect of structural parameters on span is nonmonotonic. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) model is used to perform the correlation of d₃₂ and span, providing an estimation method to optimize the operating and structural parameters of the inline HSM in the emulsification process.  aPublisher supplied data  a21776179cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22090034cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU20A20151cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2020AA0040cMajor Science and Technology Project of Xinjiang Bingtuandhttps://doi.org/NA  a2020ZD002cShihezi Citydhttps://doi.org/NA  aCYZC202108cHaihe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformationsdhttps://doi.org/NA 3adroplet size 3aemulsifying 3aenergy 3afluid mechanics 3aneural networks 3aprocess design1 aZhao, Shuchun1 aGuo, Junheng1 aLi, Wei1 aZhang, Jinli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5805-38240 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Mar. 24, v. 61, no. 13 p.4722-4737dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c049723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245015900200500002000359520190800379592002802287650001702315650001002332650001302342650001302355650002302368650001302391650001402404650002002418650001102438651001902449651002802468651001202496651001902508700006002527700002402587700001802611700002302629700005902652700005702711773013302768856007302901852000902974655001202983IND60602082020221122073005.0180709e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060208202DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.017692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProcházka, Petr,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9385-454710aAcross a migratory divide: divergent migration directions and non‐breeding grounds of Eurasian reed warblers revealed by geolocators and stable isotopes  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMigratory divides represent narrow zones of overlap between parapatric populations with distinct migration directions and, consequently, expected divergent non‐breeding distributions. The composition of the mixed population at a migratory divide and the corresponding non‐breeding ranges remain, however, unknown for many Palaearctic‐African migrants. Here, we used light‐level geolocation to track migration direction and non‐breeding grounds of Eurasian reed warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus from three breeding populations across the species’ migratory divide. Moreover, by using feathers grown at non‐breeding grounds, we quantified stable isotope composition for individuals with known southwestern (SW) and southeastern (SE) migration directions. On a larger sample per population, we then assessed the proportions of SW‐ and SE‐migrating phenotypes in each of the three populations. All tracked reed warblers from Germany and two thirds of the birds tagged from the Czech population headed initially SW. Nevertheless, about one third of the birds from the Czech site migrated towards SE. No tracking data have been obtained for the Bulgarian population. The initial migration direction determined by geolocators was a strong predictor of the non‐breeding region, with SW migrants staying in west Africa and SE migrants in central Africa. Feather δ³⁴S and δ¹⁵N values confirmed the predominance of SW migrants in the German population, the co‐occurrence of SW and SE migrants in the Czech population, and indicated a high (72%) proportion of SE migrants in the Bulgarian population. Thus, the combined approach of geolocator tracking and stable isotopic assignments provided clear evidence for the existence of a migratory divide in the southeast of central Europe and predicted non‐breeding range in central and central‐eastern Africa for the eastern population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocephalus 3abirds 3abreeding 3afeathers 3amigratory behavior 3anitrogen 3aphenotype 3astable isotopes 3asulfur 3aCentral Africa 3aCentral European region 3aGermany 3aWestern Africa1 aBrlík, Vojtěch1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7902-81231 aYohannes, Elizabeth1 aMeister, Bert1 aAuerswald, Jürgen1 aIlieva, Mihaela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1020-31621 aHahn, Steffen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4924-495X0 tJournal of avian biology.g2018 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.ejav-012516-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3949829x0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.017693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245007600163300001800239520098500257592002801242596009801270596009801368596010201466596011801568596012601686650001401812650002301826650002201849650001901871650001801890650001801908650001001926650001101936650001901947650001701966700005801983700001602041700001202057700005502069773017102124856008102295852000902376655001202385IND60772663220221119083811.0220407e20220329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077266322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c050092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Xinhui10aHierarchical Pd@PC-COFs as Efficient Catalysts for Phenol Hydrogenation  ap. 4534-4545.  aOne-step hydrogenation of phenol is a green approach to produce cyclohexanone, an important intermediate for the synthesis of nylon. The design and fabrication of high-performance catalysts still present a great challenge. Herein, a series of triazinyl covalent organic frameworks (PC-COFs) were prepared by adjusting the synthesis time using a solvothermal method, and then, Pd@PC-COF catalysts were fabricated by anchoring Pd. Controlling the synthesis time can lead to the fabrication of PC-COFs with high crystallinity, large specific surface area, abundant mesopores, and rich N element, increasing the Pd content with higher Pd(0) proportion and enhancing the mass transfer, thereby improving the catalytic performance of Pd@PC-COFs for phenol hydrogenation. The as-fabricated catalyst has good reusability during the reaction cycles of phenol hydrogenation. This work develops an efficient approach to fabricate high-performance Pd-based catalysts for phenol hydrogenation.  aPublisher supplied data  a21921006cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22178165cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBK20211262cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608  aZK201902cState Key Laboratory of Materials- Oriented Chemical Engineeringdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100011398  aNAcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutionsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012246 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3acyclohexanones 3ahydrogenation 3amass transfer 3anylon 3aphenol 3aprocess design 3asurface area1 aZhang, Jiuxuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5670-02551 aJiang, Hong1 aDu, Yan1 aChen, Rizhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4298-483X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Mar. 29, v. 61, no. 13 p.4534-4545dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c050093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011100204300001100315520170500326592002802031650002202059650001302081650002502094650001802119650002702137650000902164650002502173650001502198700002102213700002502234700002802259700001502287700001802302773010902320856008202429852000902511655001202520IND60712436420221118013632.0210303e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071243642DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-020-1180-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhagya, H.

There is a large scope for increasing the oil yield by selecting elite planting material for breeding programme in germplasm evaluation, characterization and utilization. In the present study, a diverse range of 150 oil palm genotypes were characterized using 12 quantitative variables with 54 genomic microsatellite markers. A wide variation was observed in the morphological traits among indigenous populations. Highly significant and positive correlations were observed between vegetative dry matter (VDM) and total dry matter (TDM) (0.862), and height and height increment (0.838). The first two principal component analyses explained 67.7% of total variation among morphological traits. The genotypes IC0610001-59 (Pune-2) and IC0610001-60 (Pune-2) were found highly promising based on less height increment, more TDM with high yield. For the mapping study, general linear model (GLM) approach, quantitative-trait loci (QTL) for annual height increment, number of bunches, bunch yield and bunch index were linked to simple-sequence repeat (SSR) loci mEgCIR3649 with phenotypic variance of 15.08, 10.43, 11.74, 15.39. TDM and VDM were linked to mEgCIR0192 (27.34 and 24.19%), mEgCIR3684 (16.84 and 18.30%), SPSC00163 (18.8 and 15.39%) and mEgCIR0555 (16.47 and 18.81%), with at a significant threshold (P) level of ≤0.001 and by mixed linear model (MLM) approach. TDM was linked to mEgCIR0555 with phenotypic variance of 20.72%, bunch yield and bunch index were linked to mEgCIR2813 at phenotypic variance of 17.11% and 12.88%, respectively, at a significant threshold (P) level of ≤0.01.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3agenomics 3agermplasm evaluation 3alinear models 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoils 3aphenotypic variation 3avegetables1 aKalyana Babu, B.1 aGangadharappa, P.

The recovery of lithium from salt lake brine via solvent extraction is considered a promising technique. In this study, the solvent extraction process in the tributyl phosphate (TBP)–FeCl₃/brine system was investigated. The order of metal ions competitively combining with TBP–FeCl₃ was Li⁺ > Na⁺ > K⁺ > Mg²⁺, and the compositions of main cationic extraction complexes were Li(TBP)₂(H₂O)₂⁺, Na(TBP)₂(H₂O)₄⁺, K(TBP)₂(H₂O)₄⁺, and Mg(TBP)₂(H₂O)₄²⁺, respectively. The energy decomposition analysis showed that the electrostatics was the major interaction between the metal ions and the solvent (TBP and water). Compared with water, TBP bound more competitively with the metal ions. The calculated species distribution results showed that the ferric ion reacted with the chloride ion to form FeCl₂⁺, FeCl₃, and FeCl₄– in high Cl– concentration brine. Co-extractant FeCl₃ was found to exist in the organic phase in the form of FeCl₄– upon comparing the experimental and simulated spectra. Furthermore, the length of the Fe–Cl bond increased and the charge on the iron element was distracted when the FeClₙ³–ⁿ complexes coordinated with the water molecules. This indicated that FeCl₄– was more stable in the TBP solvent environment and it can be extracted from the aqueous phase. The results help us understand the extraction mechanism in essence and develop a high-efficiency extraction solvent for industrial lithium recovery.  aPublisher supplied data  a22078101cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a19CG34cShanghai Education Development Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003024  a19CG34cShanghai Municipal Education Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003395 3aenergy 3ageographical distribution 3alithium 3aphosphates 3aprocess design 3asalt lakes 3asolvents1 aChen, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9944-57281 aYu, Jianguo0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Mar. 29, v. 61, no. 13 p.4672-4682dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c050723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245023100208500001900439520209900458592002802557650001802585650002402603650000902627650001702636650001402653650001302667650000902680650001402689650001102703650001302714651001302727653002902740653001802769653001102787653004102798700001802839700002102857700005702878700002902935700002802964700001802992700005803010700006003068773010403128856008503232852000903317655001203326IND60712979020221119205449.0210415e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071297902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1102992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroffen, Thimo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3094-930010aPreliminary study on the distribution of metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including perfluoroalkylated acids (PFAS), in the aquatic environment near Morogoro, Tanzania, and the potential health risks for humans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMetals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including perfluoroalkylated acids (PFAS), are chemicals with a bioaccumulative potential that are detected in wildlife around the world. Although multiple studies reported the pollution of the aquatic environment with these chemicals, only limited data is present on the environmental pollution of Tanzania's aquatic environment and the possible risks for human health through consumption of contaminated fish or invertebrates. In the present study, we examined the distribution of metals and POPs in fish, invertebrates, sediment and water, collected at two different years at multiple important water reservoirs for domestic and industrial purposes, in the aquatic environment near Morogoro, Tanzania. Furthermore, we assessed the possible risks for human health through consumption of contaminated fish and shrimp.Metal concentrations in the water, sediment, invertebrates and fish appeared to increase in sites downstream from Morogoro city, likely caused by the presence of the city as pollution source. Significant differences in accumulated concentrations of metals and POPs were observed between species, which was hypothesized to be caused by dietary differences. Concentrations of multiple metals exceeded water and sediment quality guidelines values. Only Cu (2.8–17 μg/L) and Zn (<LOQ – 151 μg/L) in water exceeded chronic and acute effect values. Furthermore, PFOS, PBDE and HCB concentrations exceeded biota quality standard values, suggesting an ecological risk caused by these metals and POPs in the aquatic environment around Morogoro.Our results suggest that potential health effects through consumption of contaminated shrimp, and to minor extent fish, are expected. The daily consumption of these proteins (0.016–0.027 kg/capita/day) in Tanzania is similar or higher than the tolerable maximum consumption of shrimp for Cu (<0.02 kg/capita/day), Co (<0.02 kg/capita/day) and PFOS (<0.01 kg/capita/day). The outcome of this study could be used in future studies on metals and POPs in African aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute effects 3aaquatic environment 3afish 3ahuman health 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3asediments 3ashrimp 3awildlife 3aTanzania 0aPerfluoroalkylated acids 0aInvertebrates 0aMetals 0aPersistent organic pollutants (POPs)1 aRijnders, Jet1 avan Doorn, Loïc1 aJorissen, Cas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7972-50441 aDe Borger, Seppe Mortier1 aLuttikhuis, Dorien Oude1 ade Deyn, Lara1 aCovaci, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0527-11361 aBervoets, Lieven1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1285-59920 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Jan., v. 192 p.110299-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1102993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013900197500002000336520163900356592002801995650001002023650001202033650001302045650001402058650001102072650001902083650001202102650001602114650001602130650001902146650002202165650001102187650001002198650001602208651001702224700002002241700001602261773013202277856007302409852000902482655001202491IND60602082220221122101806.0180709e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060208222DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.015262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoetzee, Anina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1646-557X10aUrban nectarivorous bird communities in Cape Town, South Africa, are structured by ecological generalisation and resource distribution  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiological communities are increasingly faced with novel urban habitats and their response may depend on a combination of biological and habitat traits. The response of pollinator species to urban habitats are of particular importance because all species involved in the pollination mutualism may be affected. Nectarivorous bird communities worldwide show varying tolerances to urban areas, but studies from Africa are lacking. We investigated nectarivorous bird communities in a medium‐sized South African city and asked which biological and garden traits best predict the community assembly of specialist and opportunistic nectarivorous birds. Information was collected on garden traits and the frequency of nine nectarivorous bird species for 193 gardens by means of a questionnaire. Information on biological traits of birds was obtained from published literature. Habitat generalism and tree nesting were identified as the most important biological traits influencing bird occurrence in gardens. A greater diversity of indigenous bird‐pollinated plants and the presence of sugar water feeders increased the numbers of nectar specialist birds and species richness of nectarivorous birds. While bird baths increased the species richness of nectar specialist birds, opportunistic birds’ urban adjustment was further facilitated by large vegetated areas in gardens and limited by the distance to the nearest natural habitat. In conclusion, though some biological traits and dispersal barriers seem to limit urban adjustment, a combination of natural and artificial nectar resource provisioning could facilitate this adjustment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3agardens 3ahabitats 3amutualism 3anectar 3anectar feeding 3anesting 3apollination 3apollinators 3aquestionnaires 3aspecies diversity 3asugars 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aSouth Africa1 aBarnard, Phoebe1 aPauw, Anton0 tJournal of avian biology.g2018 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.ejav-01526-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3949829x0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.015263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166300001100265520150600276592002801782650001801810650001201828650001401840650002201854650001501876650003201891650002701923650002201950650001501972650002201987650002002009650001002029650002402039651001202063700001702075700002402092700001702116700002202133700001602155773012102171856008102292852000902373655001202382IND60574049320221122093031.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057404932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-017-1077-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonka, Johanna10aDetermining the subspecies composition of bean goose harvests in Finland using genetic methods  ap. 19.  aManagement of harvested species is of great importance in order to maintain a sustainable population. Genetics is, however, largely neglected in management plans. Here, we analysed the genetics of the bean goose (Anser fabalis) in order to aid conservation actions for the commonly hunted but declining subspecies, the taiga bean goose (A. f. fabalis). We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellites to determine the subspecies composition of the Finnish bean goose harvest, as the hunting bag is thought to comprise two subspecies, the taiga bean goose and the tundra bean goose (A. f. rossicus). The latter subspecies has a more stable or even increasing population size. Other eastern subspecies (A. f. serrirostris, A. f. middendorffii) could additionally be part of the Finnish hunting bag. We estimated genetic diversity, genetic structure and sex-biased gene flow of the different subspecies. Most of the harvested bean geese belonged to the taiga bean goose, whereas most of the tundra bean goose harvest was found to be geographically restricted to south-eastern Finland. The mtDNA data supported strong genetic structure, while microsatellites showed much weaker structuring. This is probably due to the extreme female philopatry of the species. The taiga bean goose had lowered genetic diversity compared to other subspecies, warranting management actions. We also detected A. f. serrirostris mtDNA haplotypes and evidence of interspecific hybridization with two other Anser species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnser fabalis 3afemales 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainterspecific hybridization 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphilopatry 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3ataiga 3awildlife management 3aFinland1 aKvist, Laura1 aHeikkinen, Marja E.1 aHelle, Pekka1 aSearle, Jeremy B.1 aAspi, Jouni0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2017 Feb., v. 63, no. 1 p.19-19dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-017-1077-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011600164520127900280592002801559650002301587650003401610650000901644650002601653650001701679650001701696650001101713650001801724650002401742650002001766650000901786650001701795650000901812650001901821650001301840651001001853653002301863653001901886653001901905653002201924653001801946700001701964700002601981700001602007700001802023700001702041773011402058856008602172852000902258655001202267IND60697845920221119032450.0220426e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069784592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1230952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jifu10aAssessment of heavy metal(loid)s contamination risk and grain nutritional quality in organic waste-amended soil  aStudies that evaluate the human health risk of heavy metal(loid)s pollution have not been widely performed for organic waste-amended soils on the Loess Plateau of China. With this respect, we conducted a 3-year field trial to estimate the heavy metal(loid)s contamination of soil and maize, the resultant nutritional quality of maize grains and the health risk under treatments of conventional fertilizer (CF), traditional Chinese medicine residue (TCMR) and sheep manure (SM). We found that protein, amino acids and lysine in maize grains were increased by 12.3, 11.3 and 5.88 % under TCMR treatments relative to SM application, respectively. Meanwhile, this treatment reduced the levels of Cr, Pb, Cd, As and Hg in soil and maize grains. All fertilization regimens resulted in greater health risks for children, with HI values ranging from 1.06 to 1.52 and CR levels for Cr and As being ﹥1.0 × 10⁻⁴, especially higher in SM treatments. This presented the beneficial effect of TCMR than SM. The further investigated of toxic metal(loid)s level in SM and its application risks, based on meta-analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, indicated Cd, Hg and Pb were the most cautionary heavy metal(loid)s and contamination risk were greater on the southwest regions of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aOriental traditional medicine 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3alysine 3ameta-analysis 3amineral fertilizers 3anutritive value 3arisk 3asheep manure 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aToxic metal(loid)s 0aSoil pollution 0aOrganic wastes 0aHuman health risk 0aLoess plateau1 aChen, Yiping1 aAntoniadis, Vasileios1 aWang, Kaibo1 aHuang, Yizong1 aTian, Hanwen0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 399 p.123095-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1230953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245016100160500001400321520231100335592002802646650001302674650000802687650001302695650001002708650002102718650002102739650002102760650002702781650001602808700002302824700001602847700001502863700001302878700002102891773012002912856007503032852000903107655001203116IND60729164420221120194146.0210228e20210131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916442DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110203542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wanying 10aEffects of Airspeed on the Respiratory Rate, Rectal Temperature, and Immunity Parameters of Dairy Calves Housed Individually in an Axial-Fan-Ventilated Barn  aNAL-light  aAt many modern dairy farms, calves raised in barns are kept in individual stalls separated by solid partitions, which act as barriers. Ventilation fans blowing air perpendicular to these stalls only provide the optimal airflow to the first few calves, while those further away receive a slower airflow. To ascertain whatever effects different airflow speeds may have on the health of animals kept in stalls located at increasing distances from ventilation fans, we divided a select group of 43 Holstein dairy calves into six subgroups based on age, and each subgroup was subjected to either a specified high-speed or low-speed airflow as follows: (1) Six 3-day-olds received high-speed airflow (D3-HA); (2) Six 3-day-olds received low-speed airflow (D3-LA); (3) Eight 19 (±3)-day-olds received high-speed airflow (D19-HA); (4) Eight 19 (± 3)-day-olds received low-speed airflow (D19-LA); (5) Eight 29 (±3)-day-olds received high-speed airflow (D29-HA); and (6) Seven 29 (±3)-day-olds received medium-speed airflow (D29-MA). These trials show that the rectal temperatures and respiratory rates of D19-LA (39.37 °C; 72.90 breaths/min) were significantly higher than those of D19-HA (39.14 °C; 61.57 breaths/min) (p ≤ 0.05), and those of D29-MA (39.40 °C; 75.52 breaths/min) were significantly higher than those of D29-HA (39.20 °C; 68.41 breaths/min) (p ≤ 0.05). At 33 (±3) days of age, those calves receiving high-speed airflow (p ≤ 0.05) registered significantly higher immunoglobulins A and M than calves receiving low-speed flow. Those calves subjected to a high-speed airflow also registered significantly lower tumor necrosis factor levels than those receiving low-speed flow (p ≤ 0.05). Among the 29 to 43-day-old calves, no significant differences in immunity parameters were found to exist between groups D29-HA and D29-MA. On the basis of these findings, we were able to conclude that in the warm season, when the calves were less than 0.5 months old, low-speed (0.17–0.18 m/s) airflows had no significant effect on calves; when the calves were 1 month old, low-speed airflow (0.20–0.21 m/s) may impair the immune functions; when the calves were 1 to 1.5 months old, the airflow velocity higher than 0.9 m/s can meet the needs of the calf without a negative impact on the calf.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aair 3aair flow 3abarns 3abody temperature 3aimmunoglobulin A 3arespiratory rate 3atumor necrosis factors 3awarm season1 aChoi, Christopher 1 aLi, Dapeng 1 aYan, Geqi 1 aLi, Hao 1 aShi, Zhengxiang 0 tAnimals.g2021 Jan. 31, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110203543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013000166300001100296520153700307592002801844596010201872596005901974596005902033596012802092650001102220650001002231650001502241650001102256650001702267650001902284650001802303650001802321650001802339650003702357650003002394650001002424700001702434700001902451700001602470700001302486700001602499700001702515700005402532700001302586700001802599773010902617856008202726852000902808655001202817IND60712436620221118013629.0210303e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071243662DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-020-1175-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kaisheng10aMHC-DRB1 exon 2 polymorphism and its association with mycoplasma ovipneumonia resistance or susceptibility genotypes in sheep  ap. 22.  aMajor histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphisms are associated with animal and human diseases. However, only a few studies have reported an association between MHC polymorphisms and mycoplasma ovipneumonia (MO). In the present study, three resistance/susceptibility genotypes associated with MO were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping, assessing the clinical and pathological features, and examining the immune factors. The current results showed that MvaI bb and HaeIII ee were dominant genotypes in the susceptible Hu population, while MO-resistant populations, Dorper and D × H hybrids, were dominated by the MvaI cc and HaeIII dd genotypes, suggesting that MvaI cc and HaeIII dd genotypes might be associated with the trait of MO resistance. Further, the clinical symptoms and pathological morphology in the susceptibility group infected with MO were more severe than those in the resistant groups infected similarly. The data on the changes in the immune factor responses were utilized to deduce the molecular mechanism underlying the MO resistance/susceptibility. The results showed that the susceptible genotypes promote the inflammatory responses by inducing a high expression of TNFα, IFNγ, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-1β, while the resistant genotypes inhibit the inflammatory response by increasing the expression of IL-2 and IL-10 significantly. This finding would provide the theoretical guidance for propagating sheep breeds that are highly resistant to MO.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0502601cNational Key Research and Development Program of China in the 13th Five-year Plan  a31160443cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41671041cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016BC001cMiddle-aged Scientific and Technological Innovation Leading Talent of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps 3aDorper 3aexons 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asheep1 aLiu, Xianxia1 aLi, Qiongqiong1 aWan, Kexing1 aGao, Rui1 aHan, Guohua1 aLi, Chaochen1 aXu, Mengsi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7176-10991 aJia, Bin1 aShen, Xiaoyun0 tJournal of genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 99, no. 1 p.22-22dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-020-1175-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008200164300001100246520206300257592002802320596005902348596006502407650002502472650001602497650002102513650002202534650001902556650001302575650001602588650000902604650002402613650001002637650002202647650001202669650001302681650002102694650002602715650001402741650002202755650001902777650001302796700001402809700001402823700005502837773010902892856008203001852000903083655001203092IND60712436720221118013703.0210303e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071243672DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-020-1184-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Mingyue10aEvolutionary divergence of function and expression of laccase genes in plants  ap. 23.  aLaccases (LACs) are versatile enzymes that catalyze oxidation of a wide range of substrates, thereby functioning in regulation of plant developmental processes and stress responses. However, with a few exceptions, the function of most LACs remains unclear in plants. In this study, we newly identified 4, 12, 22, 26, 27, 28 and 49 LAC genes for Physcomitrella patens, Amborella trichopoda, Zea mays, Ricinus communis, Vitis vinifera, Triticum aestivum and Glycine max, on the basis of exhaustive homologous sequence searches. In these plants, LACs differ greatly in sequence length and physical properties, such as molecular weight and theoretical isoelectric point (pI), but majority of them contain a signal peptide at their N-terminus. The originality of LACs could be traced back to as early as the emergence of moss. Plant LACs are clearly divided into seven distinct classes, where six ancient LACs should be present prior to the divergence of gymnosperms and angiosperms. Functional divergence analysis reveal that functional differentiation should occur among different groups of LACs because of altered selective constraints working on some critical amino acid sites (CAASs) within conserved laccase domains during evolution. Soybean and maize LACs have significantly different exon frequency (6.08 vs 4.82), and they are unevenly distributed and tend to form gene clusters on some chromosomes. Further analysis shows that the expansion of LAC gene family would be due to extensive tandem and chromosomal segmental duplications in the two plant species. Interestingly, ~81.6% and 36.4% of soybean and maize LACs are potential targets of miRNAs, such as miR397a/b, miR408d, or miR528a/b etc. Both soybean and maize LACs are tissue-specifically and developmental-specifically expressed, and are in response to different external abiotic and biotic stressors. These results suggest a diversity of functions of plant LAC genes, which will broaden our understanding and lay solid foundation for further investigating their biological functions in plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31972959cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLZ19B070001cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province 3aAmborella trichopoda 3aGlycine max 3aRicinus communis 3aTriticum aestivum 3aVitis vinifera 3aZea mays 3aamino acids 3acorn 3adivergent evolution 3aexons 3aisoelectric point 3alaccase 3amicroRNA 3amolecular weight 3amosses and liverworts 3aoxidation 3asequence homology 3asignal peptide 3asoybeans1 aDong, Hui1 aWang, Mei1 aLiu, Qingpo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6249-57960 tJournal of genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 99, no. 1 p.23-23dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-020-1184-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002700124024003400151040001800185100005500203245009500258300001600353500002000369506002800389506003000417520096700447592002801414596004501442596006201487506003701549650002501586650001801611650002101629650002201650650001101672650001001683650001001693650002001703650002101723650004301744650001401787650003401801650002001835650002401855700001401879700001501893700001701908700001801925700001901943700002201962773013501984856007302119903002202192852000902214655001202223IND60602082520221207051711.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060208252DNAL7 a10.1111/jph.127112chorus7 a10.1111/jph.127112doi7 a10.1111/jph.127112chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, Justin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2096-845X12aA novel receptor‐like kinase involved in fungal pathogen defence in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 506-515.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aPlants are under constant attack from a variety of disease‐causing organisms. Lacking an adaptive immune system, plants repel pathogen attack via an array of pathogen recognition machinery. Receptor‐like kinases (RLKs) are involved in the recognition of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate resistance pathways against broad classes of pathogens. We have identified powdery mildew‐resistant kinase 1, an Arabidopsis gene encoding an RLK that is highly induced by chitin at early time points and localizes to the plasma membrane. Knockout mutants in pmrk1 are more susceptible to both Golovinomyces cichoracearum and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. Our data show that PMRK1 is essential in early stages of defence against fungi and provide evidence that PMRK1 may be unique to chitin‐induced signalling pathways.

The gene phhY contained an open reading frame of 2130 bp encoding a polypeptide of 709 amino acid residues. From its sequence analysis, it is a member of a family of flavin-containing aromatic hydroxylases and shares 41% amino acid identity with phenol hydroxylase from Trichosporon cutaneum. The recombinant phenol hydroxylase exists as a homotetramer structure with a native molecular mass of 320 kDa. Recombinant phenol hydroxylase was insensitive to pH treatment; its optimum pH was at 7.6. The optimum temperature for the enzyme was 30 °C, and its activity was rapidly lost at temperatures above 60 °C. Under the optimal conditions with phenol as substrate, the Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ of recombinant phenol hydroxylase were 0.21 mmol·L–¹ and 0.077 μmol·L–¹·min⁻¹, respectively. This is the first paper presenting the cloning and expression in E.coli of the phenol hydroxylase gene from C. tropicalis and the characterization of the recombinant phenol hydroxylase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida tropicalis 3aTrichosporon cutaneum 3aamino acids 3agenes 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3apH 3aphenol 3apolypeptides 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 0aCandida tropicalis JH8 0acloning and expression 0aenzymatic properties 0aphenol hydroxylase gene1 aYang, Sheng1 aXie, Zhixiong1 aCheng, Li0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2014 July 28, v. 60, no. 9 p.585-591dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44722x0008-41667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2014-04173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245011200209500001900321520164600340592002801986650001802014650001802032650001102050650001902061650000902080650002602089650001102115650001902126650002702145650000902172650001702181650001502198650001402213650001802227650001702245650001302262650001202275650001902287650001602306653001602322700002902338700006402367773010402431856008502535852000902620655001202629IND60712979320221119205128.0210415e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071297932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1103042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiltunen, Minna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0003-300010aInteracting effects of simulated eutrophication, temperature increase, and microplastic exposure on Daphnia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of multiple stressors are difficult to separate in field studies, and their interactions may be hard to predict if studied in isolation. We studied the effects of decreasing food quality (increase in cyanobacteria from 5 to 95% simulating eutrophication), temperature increase (by 3 °C), and microplastic exposure (1% of the diet) on survival, size, reproduction, and fatty acid composition of the model freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna. We found that food quality was the major driver of Daphnia responses. When the amount of cyanobacteria increased from 5 to 95% of the diet, there was a drastic decrease in Daphnia survival (from 81 ± 15% to 24 ± 21%), juvenile size (from 1.8 ± 0.2 mm to 1.0 ± 0.1 mm), adult size (from 2.7 ± 0.1 mm to 1.1 ± 0.1 mm), and reproduction (from 13 ± 5 neonates per surviving adult to 0), but the decrease was not always linear. This was most likely due to lower availability of lipids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and sterols from the diet. Microplastic exposure did not affect Daphnia survival, size, or reproduction. Food quality had an interactive effect with temperature on fatty acid content of Daphnia. Total fatty acid content of Daphnia was almost 2-fold higher at 20 °C than at 23 °C when fed 50% cyanobacteria. This may have implications for higher trophic level consumers, such as fish, that depend on zooplankton for energy and essential lipids. Our findings suggest that as proportions of cyanobacteria increase, in tandem with water temperatures due to climate change, fish may encounter fewer and smaller Daphnia with lower lipid and EPA content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aDaphnia magna 3aadults 3aclimate change 3adiet 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenergy 3aeutrophication 3afatty acid composition 3afish 3afood quality 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3amicroplastics 3areproduction 3aresearch 3asterols 3atrophic levels 3azooplankton 0aFatty acids1 aVehniäinen, Eeva-Riikka1 aKukkonen, Jussi V.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3449-68280 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Jan., v. 192 p.110304-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1103043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009400170300001400264520106100278592002801339650002801367650002901395650003401424650001401458650001701472650002101489650000901510650001101519650001301530650001501543650001601558650002001574650001301594650000901607650002201616650001101638700001801649700001701667700002001684700001501704700001801719773008801737856008101825852000901906655001201915IND60574049620221122093015.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057404962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-016-9765-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovacs, Gabriella,10aIn search of secondary plants to enhance the efficiency of cabbage seed weevil management  ap. 29-38.  aThe infestation rate and parasitoid communities of Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were assessed on seven spring sown brassicaceous plant species to find potential secondary plants that might help increase the parasitism rates of this serious oilseed pest. Over the three-year study, the average infestation rate of pods by C. obstrictus remained below 10 % for each plant species. Despite the low pest abundance, C. obstrictus was parasitized by hymenopteran parasitoids on all plant species, except on Eruca vesicaria subsp. sativa ((Mill.) Thell.). Parasitism rates were remarkably high: between 33.7 and 70.8 % on average and peaked at 94.7 % on Raphanus sativus (L.) var. oleiformis (Pers.). Not only was the parasitism rate high on R. sativus, but it also had a different parasitoid species composition consisting mainly of egg parasitoids (Mymaridae), while on the other plant species larval parasitoids (Pteromalidae) dominated. These findings are important for planning new sustainable pest management approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeutorhynchus assimilis 3aCeutorhynchus obstrictus 3aEruca vesicaria subsp. sativa 3aMymaridae 3aPteromalidae 3aRaphanus sativus 3aeggs 3alarvae 3aoilseeds 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apest management 3aplanning 3apods 3aspecies diversity 3aspring1 aKaasik, Riina1 aKaart, Tanel1 aMetspalu, Luule1 aLuik, Anne1 aVeromann, Eve0 tBioControl.g2017 Feb., v. 62, no. 1 p.29-38dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-016-9765-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245012200203300001600325500002000341520098800361592002801349650001101377650002301388650002101411650002201432650002701454650001101481650001501492650004701507650001401554651001501568651000901583773013501592856007301727852000901800655001201809IND60602082720221122073045.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060208272DNAL7 a10.1111/jph.127202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasr Esfahani, Mehdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6753-147X10aGenetic and virulence variation in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae causing root and basal rot of common onion in Iran  ap. 572-580.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRoot and basal rot of common onion (Allium cepae L.) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae is one of the most important diseases causing tremendous losses in onion‐growing areas worldwide. In this study, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), intersimple sequence repeats (ISSR) and virulence studies were conducted to analyse 26 F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae isolates obtained from the main onion‐growing regions of Iran, including Fars, Azerbaijan and Isfahan states. Cluster analysis using UPGMA method for both RAPD and ISSR markers revealed no clear grouping of the isolates obtained from different geographical regions, and the isolates were observed to derive probably from the same clonal lineage. Pathogenicity test indicated that all F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae isolates were pathogenic on onion; however, virulence variability was observed among the isolates. The grouping based on virulence variability was not correlated with the results of RAPD and ISSR analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium 3aFusarium oxysporum 3acluster analysis 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aonions 3aplant rots 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3avirulence 3aAzerbaijan 3aIran0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2018 Aug., v. 166, no. 7-8 p.572-580dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000109x0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.127203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04289naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013700197300001600334500002000350520179000370592002802160596007002188596008502258596003902343596005402382596010102436596007202537650002602609650002202635650001902657650002002676650001502696650001502711650001602726650001802742650001102760650001902771650001402790650000902804650001702813650001102830650001102841650001102852650002302863650001402886650002102900650001502921700002202936700001502958700002002973700002102993700002203014700001503036700002903051700001503080700001403095700001403109700001603123700002003139700002303159700001703182700001503199700001703214700001803231700001803249700001803267700001603285773012403301856007303425852000903498655001203507IND60614880320221119135803.0181002e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061488032DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.124372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmetanová, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9576-166X10aTemporal variability and time compression of sediment yield in small Mediterranean catchments: impacts for land and water management  ap. 388-403.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncreased soil erosion, pressure on agricultural land, and climate change highlight the need for new management methods to mitigate soil loss. Management strategies should utilize comparable data sets of long‐term soil erosion monitoring across multiple environments. Adaptive soil erosion management in regions with intense precipitation requires an understanding of inter‐annual variability in sediment yield (SY) at regional scales. Here, a novel approach is proposed for analysing regional SY. We aimed to (i) investigate factors controlling inter‐ and intra‐annual SY, (ii) combine seasonality and time compression analyses to explore SY variability and (iii) discuss management implications for different Mediterranean environments. Continuous SY measurements totalling 104 years for eight small catchments were used to describe SY variability, which ranged from 0 to 271 t/ha/year and 0 to 116 t/ha/month. Maximum SY occurs in spring to summer for catchments with oceanic climates, while semi‐arid or dry summer climates experience SY minimums. We identified three time compression patterns at each time scale. Time compression was most intense for catchments with minimum SY in spring to summer. Low time compression was linked to very high soil loss, low run‐off and sediment production thresholds, and high connectivity. Reforestation, grassland and terracing changed SY magnitudes and time compression, but failed to reduce SY for large storm events. Periods with a high probability of high SY were identified using a combination of intra‐annual SY variability, seasonality analysis, and time compression analysis. Focusing management practices on monthly flow events, which account for the majority of SY, will optimise returns in Mediterranean catchments.  aPublisher supplied data  a618127cMISTRALS/Sicmed R_Osmed Project (CNRS, INRA, IRD, IRSTEA)  aPCIN‐2017‐061/AEIcMISTRALS/Sicmed R_Osmed Project (CNRS, INRA, IRD, IRSTEA)  a618127cARIMNet2 (ERA‐NET) MASCC  aPCIN‐2017‐061/AEIcARIMNet2 (ERA‐NET) MASCC  a267196cSmetanová received Marie‐Curie FP7 COFUND People Programme AgreenSkills’ fellowship  aSFRH/BPD/87571/2012cEuropean Social Fund and Portuguese Government 3aMediterranean climate 3aagricultural land 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3agrasslands 3amonitoring 3aprobability 3areforestation 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3aspring 3astorms 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3aterracing 3awater management 3awatersheds1 aLe Bissonnais, Y.1 aRaclot, D.1 aPedro Nunes, J.1 aLicciardello, F.1 aLe Bouteiller, C.1 aLatron, J.1 aRodríguez Caballero, E.1 aMathys, N.1 aKlotz, S.1 aMekki, I.1 aGallart, F.1 aSolé Benet, A.1 aPérez Gallego, N.1 aAndrieux, P.1 aMoussa, R.1 aPlanchon, O.1 aSantos, J.

Experimental and in situ approaches  ap. 20-30.  aDespite recent efforts to manage them more efficiently, estuaries are natural sinks for a wide range of metal contaminants, many of which accumulate at potentially toxic concentrations for fish populations, posing a threat to recruitment and stocks. While analysis of metal concentrations in soft tissue and water samples calls for continuous and long-term sampling operations, the use of otoliths to study metal pollution may be one way of providing a historical record of pollutant exposure. In this study, we examine the potential use of otoliths as natural tracers of metal contamination. A “cocktail” of different metals (Cd, Pb and Ni) was used to test bio-accumulation in otoliths and tissue (liver, kidney, muscle and gills) extracted from juvenile flounder (Platichthys flesus). Assessment took place under controlled conditions over a three month period, with water exposure concentrations increasing every 3weeks. The concentrations used were natural (T1), X5 (T2), X10 (T3), and null (T4). Chemical analyses were carried out using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer ICP-OES and atomic absorption spectrometer AAS for water and tissue, while otolith microchemistry analyses were performed using a femtosecond laser ablation-high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (fsLA-ICP-MS-HR). Significant differences between control and exposed individuals, as well as an increase in metal concentrations according to exposure level, were observed in all tissues except in muscle tissue. Significant increases in Pb were also detected in contaminated fish otoliths compared with control specimens, with the highest concentrations occurring in T3. Cartographies of Pb distribution in otoliths of both control and contaminated fish only showed high concentrations of Pb at the edge of contaminated fish otoliths, indicating an accumulation of metal during the experiment. Although the relationships between exposure level and Pb concentration in otoliths were complex, the concentrations were correlated with those in the water. Analysis of flounder specimens collected from 2007 to 2014 in the Gironde estuary (SW France) showed interannual variability in Pb concentrations, with higher values for fish otoliths from 2007 to 2010 than those from 2012 to 2014. This trend indicated a decrease in Pb in the Gironde estuary over the last decade, which is consistent with the results of other surveys on bivalves. Our study demonstrates that it is possible to use otolith microchemistry as a tool in assessing and retracing long-term metal pollution in estuarine systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aPlatichthys flesus 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3achemical analysis 3aestuaries 3aflounder 3agills 3ajuveniles 3akidneys 3alead 3aliver 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3anickel 3aotoliths 3apollutants 3aspectrometers 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3atracer techniques 3aFrance 0aFlatfish 0aTrace metals 0aOtolith microchemistry 0aExperiment 0aGironde estuary1 aEchard, Aurélie1 aPécheyran, Christophe1 aBaudrimont, Magalie1 aLobry, Jérémy1 aDaverat, Françoise0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 July 01, v. 557-558 p.20-30dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007700165300001400242520154600256592002801802650002801830650002101858650002301879650002001902650001901922650001301941650001301954650002801967650002001995650002902015650001502044650002202059650001402081650001502095650001102110650001502121650001102136700002102147700001802168700001802186773010702204856008402311852000902395655001202404IND60480665320221119073801.0160129e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048066532DNAL7 a10.3318/BIOE.2009.109.1.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParr, Sharon10aVegetation analysis of upland burren grasslands of conservation interest  ap. 11-33.  a<p>This study addresses the classification of grassland and heath communities found within the Burren uplands of Co. Clare and identifies threats to their integrity. Quadrats were taken on a range of sites, focusing on semi-natural, upland grassland and heath of conservation interest. Before analysis, the data set was divided into a heath group and a grassland group based on cover of dwarf shrubs. The data were analysed using TWINSPAN and canonical correspondence analysis. Within the grassland group, two main associations were found: the <i>Sesleria caerulea</i>–<i>Breutelia chrysocoma</i> association of lownutrient, calcareous, species-rich grasslands, and the <i>Dactylis glomerata</i>–<i>Holcus lanatus</i> association of more-mesotrophic grasslands. Within each group three sub-associations were identified. The heaths also fell into two main groups: one dominated by <i>Dryas octopetala</i>, and the other by <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>. The <i>Dryas</i> heath association formed three sub-associations, while the <i>Calluna</i> heaths formed three distinct associations, including associations of rare alpine heaths with <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> and <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>. From direct ordination, significant environmental and management factors, such as altitude, soil depth and grazing pressure, were identified. Trends within the data set suggest a gradual increase in agriculturally favoured species with increased summer grazing. Abandoned and less-grazed areas are threatened by scrub and bracken encroachment.</p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctostaphylos uva-ursi 3aCalluna vulgaris 3aDactylis glomerata 3aEmpetrum nigrum 3aHolcus lanatus 3aSesleria 3aaltitude 3acorrespondence analysis 3adata collection 3aenvironmental management 3agrasslands 3agrazing intensity 3ahighlands 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asoil depth 3asummer1 aO'Donovan, Grace1 aWard, Stephen1 aFinn, John A.0 tBiology and environment.g2009 Jan. 1, v. 109, no. 1 p.11-33dThe Royal Irish Academyx0791-79457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3318%2FBIOE.2009.109.1.113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245015100159500001400310520211400324592002802438650001002466650001602476650002502492650001702517650002302534650002002557650001602577650001302593650001302606650002002619650001602639650002702655650002302682650002102705650001002726650001502736650001402751650001202765650001402777650001002791650001002801650002002811650001302831650001102844650002502855700001902880700001802899700001702917700001702934700001602951700001702967700001702984700001903001773012003020856007503140852000903215655001203224IND60729164920221123031905.0210228e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916492DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110203592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Dongxu 10aEffects of Diet Supplemented with Excess Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Disodium on Growth Performance, Blood Parameters and Redox Status in Weaned Pigs  aNAL-light  aThe research was implemented to assess the safety of feeding excess of pyrroloquinoline quinone disodium (PQQ·Na₂) to 108 Duroc × Landrace × Large White weaned pigs (BW = 8.38 ± 0.47 kg). Pigs were weaned at 28 d and randomly distributed to one of three diets with six replicates and six pigs per replicate (three males and three females). Pigs in the control group were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet (without growth promoter) while the two experimental diets were supplied with 7.5 and 75.0 mg/kg PQQ·Na₂, respectively. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion (F:G), diarrhea incidence, hematology, serum biochemistry, organ index and general health were determined. Diets supplementation with 7.5 mg/kg PQQ·Na₂ in weaned pigs could increase ADG during the entire experimental period (p < 0.05). And there was a tendency to decrease F:G (p = 0.063). The F:G of weaned pigs fed 7.5 and 75.0 mg/kg PQQ·Na₂ supplemented diets was decreased by 9.83% and 8.67%, respectively, compared to the control group. Moreover, pigs had reduced diarrhea incidence (p < 0.01) when supplemented with PQQ·Na₂. No differences were observed between pigs supplemented with 0.0, 7.5 and 75.0 mg/kg PQQ·Na₂ diets on hematological and serum biochemical parameters as well as histological assessment of heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. At day 14, pigs had increased activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (p < 0.05), catalase (CAT) (p < 0.05) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) (p < 0.05), and the serum concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was decreased (p < 0.01) with PQQ·Na₂ supplementation. At day 28, pigs had increased activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) (p < 0.01), GSH-Px (p < 0.01), CAT (p < 0.05) and T-AOC (p < 0.01), and serum concentration of MDA was lower (p < 0.01) with PQQ·Na₂ supplementation. In conclusion, PQQ·Na₂ can improve weaned pigs growth performance and serum antioxidant status. Meanwhile high PQQ·Na₂ inclusion of 75.0 mg/kg does not appear to result in harmful effects on growth performance of pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood chemistry 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3adiarrhea 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3agrowth promotion 3aheart 3ahematology 3ahistology 3akidneys 3alandraces 3aliver 3alungs 3amalondialdehyde 3aquinones 3aspleen 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aHuang, Caiyun 1 aWang, Wenhui 1 aWang, Zijie 1 aShi, Chenyu 1 aYin, Xindi 1 aSun, Linlin 1 aGao, Youjun 1 aWang, Fenglai 0 tAnimals.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110203593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013000157300001800287500002000305520144500325592002801770650001401798650002501812650001401837650001301851650002101864650001401885650001401899650001501913650001401928650001801942650001601960650002601976650001902002650004402021651001002065700005502075700001602130700001802146700001702164700001502181700001302196700001602209700001702225700001502242700001202257700001602269700001302285773014802298856007402446852000902520655001202529IND60588364020221117081634.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058836402DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.85662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Pengliang10aMetabolomic analysis reveals the composition differences in 13 Chinese tea cultivars of different manufacturing suitabilities  ap. 1153-1161.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Green tea and black tea are manufactured using appropriate tea cultivars in China. However, the metabolite differences relating to the manufacturing suitability of tea cultivars are unclear. In the present study, we performed a non‐targeted metabolomic analysis on 13 Chinese tea cultivars using ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole‐time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry to investigate comprehensively the metabolite differences between cultivars suitable for manufacturing green tea (GT cultivars) and cultivars suitable for manufacturing both green tea and black tea (G&BT cultivars). RESULTS: Multivariate statistical analysis and cluster analysis divided the 13 cultivars into two groups, namely GT cultivars and G&BT cultivars, which correlated with their manufacturing suitability. The GT cultivars contained higher levels of flavonoid glycosides, whereas the G&BT cultivars contained higher levels of catechins, dimeric catechins, phenolic acids and alkaloids. CONCLUSION: Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the flavonoid pathway inclined toward the synthesis of flavonoid glycosides in GT cultivars, whereas it inclined toward the synthesis of catechins and phenolic acids in G&BT cultivars. The results of the present study will be helpful for discriminating the manufacturing suitability of tea cultivars and investigating their breeding. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3abiochemical pathways 3ablack tea 3abreeding 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3aflavanols 3aglycosides 3agreen tea 3amanufacturing 3ametabolites 3amultivariate analysis 3aphenolic acids 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aChina1 aDai, Weidong1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9593-138X1 aLu, Meiling1 aXie, Dongchao1 aTan, Junfeng1 aYang, Chen1 aZhu, Yin1 aLv, Haipeng1 aPeng, Qunhua1 aZhang, Yue1 aGuo, Li1 aNi, Dejiang1 aLin, Zhi0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 98, no. 3 p.1153-1161dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.85663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245010600156300001800262520111800280650002501398650001701423650002501440650001401465650002601479650001401505650002101519650001701540650002801557650002301585650002601608650002101634650001701655650001101672700003301683773016201716856004001878852000901918655001201927IND4535021120221120064612.0151113e20140625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453502112DNAL7 a10.1021/jf500769x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhatou, Ikram10aNutritional and Nutraceutical Quality of Strawberries in Relation to Harvest Time and Crop Conditions  ap. 5749-5760.  aThree strawberry varieties cultivated in soilless systems were studied for their content of primary and secondary metabolites in relation to harvest time and crop conditions. The three varieties were chosen based on their sensitivity level to environmental stress: Palomar (very sensitive), Festival (sensitive), and Camarosa (resistant). Throughout the campaign, three samplings were performed: December (extra-early production), January, and March (early production). Differences among cultivars and harvest times were observed based on the contents of sugars, organic acids, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant capacity. The higher levels for total anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols were found in Camarosa and Festival strawberries, both in the January harvest. The Palomar variety showed higher total sugar/total organic acids ratio in the March harvest. The influence of cultivation practices and environmental conditions was assessed by nested ANOVA and PLS-DA. Differences in the sugar and phenolic content were observed depending upon variety and coverage type. TEAC was most influenced by the substrate type. 3aanalysis of variance 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3aflavanols 3afunctional foods 3aharvest date 3aorganic acids and salts 3aphenolic compounds 3asecondary metabolites 3asoilless culture 3astrawberries 3asugars1 aFernandez-Recamales, Angeles0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 June 25, v. 62, no. 25 p.5749-5760dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf500769x  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010400172300001600276520141600292592002801708650001301736650001001749650001201759650001901771650001501790650001401805650001201819650001401831650001101845650001601856651001201872700001601884700002101900700001601921773010901937856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60480665520221119073846.0160129e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048066552DNAL7 a10.3318/BIOE.2009.109.2.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarroll, Elizabeth10aIrish phenological observations from the early 20th century reveal a strong response to temperature  ap. 115-122.  a<p>Phenology, the study of the timing of recurring life cycle events, has gained global scientific recognition in recent years as it demonstrates how ecosystems are responding to climate change. However, in Ireland the systematic recording of phenological events has not been traditionally undertaken. Here we present some recently rediscovered historic phenological records, abstracted from the <i>Irish Naturalists' Journal</i> for the period 1927–1947 (with a gap from 1940 to 1945) and analyse them with respect to temperature data, sourced from Dr Tim Mitchell's Tyndall Centre webpage. We find that in many cases in Ireland spring phenological events, such as first flowering, first leafing and first observations of insects, show an earlier trend in response to increasing spring temperatures over the study period. In addition, we compare spring migrant bird arrival dates from the <i>Irish Naturalists' Journal</i> records with those abstracted from various published and unpublished bird records from the eastern region of Ireland for the period 1969–1999. We demonstrate that five out of the seven species analysed were recorded earlier in the more recent time period, and three of these were significantly earlier. These results illustrate the value of historic phenological data records for investigating and comparing past and present climate influences on species developmental behaviour.</p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abirds 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aflowering 3ainsects 3aphenology 3aspring 3atemperature 3aIreland1 aSparks, Tim1 aDonnelly, Alison1 aCooney, Tom0 tBiology and environment.g2009 Jan. 1, v. 109, no. 2 p.115-122dThe Royal Irish Academyx0791-79457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3318%2FBIOE.2009.109.2.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245013800212300001600350500001400366520124900380592002801629650001201657650001501669650000701684650001401691650002301705650001301728650002201741653002601763653001901789653002501808653002601833653002401859653001801883700005701901700001901958700001701977700006001994773015102054856008602205852000902291655001202300IND60722706420221118155011.0210301e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072270642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClements, Jeff C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5140-575110aAnimal size and sea water temperature, but not pH, influence a repeatable startle response behaviour in a wide-ranging marine mollusc  ap. 191-205.  aNAL-light  aStartle response behaviours are important in predator avoidance and escape for a wide array of animals. For many marine invertebrates, however, startle response behaviours are understudied, and the effects of global change stressors on these responses are unknown. We exposed two size classes of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis×trossulus) to different combinations of temperature (15 and 19°C) and pH (8.2 and 7.5pHT) for 3 months and subsequently measured individual time to open following a tactile predator cue (i.e. startle response time) over a series of four consecutive trials. Time to open was highly repeatable in the short term and decreased linearly across the four trials. Individuals from the larger size class had a shorter time to open than their smaller-sized counterparts. High temperature increased time to open compared to low temperature, while pH had no effect. These results suggest that bivalve time to open is repeatable, related to relative vulnerability to predation and affected by temperature. Given that increased closure times impact feeding and respiration, the effect of temperature on closure duration may play a role in the sensitivity to ocean warming in this species and contribute to ecosystem level effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus 3aecosystems 3apH 3apredation 3apredator avoidance 3aseawater 3awater temperature 0aantipredator response 0acarbon dioxide 0aenvironmental stress 0aglobal change biology 0aocean acidification 0aocean warming1 aRamesh, Kirti1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7889-67221 aNysveen, Jacob1 aduPont, Sam,1 aJutfelt, Fredrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9838-39910 tAnimal behaviour.g2021 Mar., v. 173 p.191-205dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245012600207500001900333520161900352592002801971650002401999650001402023650001602037650002302053650001002076650001002086650001602096650001802112650001502130650001502145650001802160650001702178650002102195650002802216653001402244653001502258653001402273653002002287700005602307700002402363700002402387700001602411700006402427773010802491856008502599852000902684655001202693IND60697846620221119032710.0200824e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069784662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1091412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarretón, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6509-910X10aEvaluation of different dosages of doxycycline during the adulticide treatment of heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) in dogs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia plays an important role in the pathogenesis and inflammatory immune response to heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) infection in dogs. Doxycycline is used to reduce Wolbachia from all life stages of heartworm to avoid large releases of the bacteria during the death of the worms. However, the dose and duration currently recommended have been extrapolated from the treatment of other rickettsial infections. Therefore, the aim was to study the dynamics of Wolbachia IgG antibodies in heartworm-infected dogs under adulticide treatment using different dosages of doxycycline. Forty-nine heartworm-infected dogs were recruited. On day 0 (diagnosis), monthly ivermectin (6 μg/kg) was prescribed, as well as daily doxycycline for 30 days, at 10 mg/kg/12 h (n = 13), 5 mg/kg/12 h (n = 19), and 10 mg/kg/24 h (n = 17). Dogs underwent adulticide treatment and blood samples were collected on days 0, 30, 90, and 120. All dogs had antibodies against recombinant Wolbachia surface protein (rWSP), confirming the important role of the bacteria in heartworm. No significant differences were found in anti-rWSP response by presence/absence of microfilariae, or by parasite burden on day 0. In all treated groups, the anti-rWSP antibody response was not significantly different between days 0 and 30 but was significantly lower between days 0 and 120 (p < 0.05). The results of the present study suggest that the administration of a lower dose than currently recommended is sufficient to achieve a significant reduction of Wolbachia in dogs infected by D. immitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDirofilaria immitis 3aWolbachia 3aadulticides 3aantibody formation 3ablood 3adeath 3adoxycycline 3aendosymbionts 3aheartworms 3aivermectin 3amicrofilariae 3apathogenesis 3asurface proteins 3aveterinary parasitology 0aHeartworm 0aAdulticide 0aTreatment 0aImmune response1 aMorchón, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2699-14821 aFalcón-Cordón, Y.1 aFalcón-Cordón, S.1 aMatos, J.I.1 aMontoya-Alonso, J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2683-75920 tVeterinary parasitology.g2020 July, v. 283 p.109141-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1091413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007900168520192600247592002802173650000802201650001802209650002602227650001602253650000902269650002502278650000902303650001702312650001102329650001602340650001302356650001102369650001102380650001602391650001102407651001002418653001702428653001802445653001802463653003002481653004002511700001802551700001802569700001602587700001802603700001502621700001302636773010402649856008502753852000902838655001202847IND60712979820221119205440.0211206e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071297982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1103182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sixuan10aInfluence of air pollution on human comfort in five typical Chinese cities  aIt is known that air pollution is harmful to creatures, though until now most of the human thermal comfort indices that existed were calculated only with meteorological conditions. Therefore, a new index - meteorology and environment comfort (MEC) - was given out in this paper that considers both meteorology and air pollution conditions and presents the comprehensive and synergistic effects of meteorological and air pollution. The meteorology and air pollution data were used to establish the influence function of the five air pollutants (PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, O₃, NO₂, and SO₂) according to Fechner's law; then, we calculated the somatosensory temperature (ST, a class of human thermal comfort indices) and MEC values of five typical cities (Beijing, Xining, Nanjing, Kunming, and Guangzhou). The results showed average improvements of five cities on MEC as a new comprehensive human comfort index to new ST. In spring, the MEC comfort proportion fell by 29.25%. Besides, the extreme heat discomfort ratio in Nanjing and Kunming has increased over 20%. In summer, the comfort proportion fell 12.54%; the extreme heat discomfort proportion of Beijing increased 37.86% and Kunming increased 24.09%. Air pollution significantly raised discomfort stress in Beijing. In fall, the comfort proportion fell by 20.87%; and the extreme heat discomfort of Nanjing increased 23.67% caused by poor air quality. About winter, the comfort ratio decreased 12.72%, and the cold discomfort proportion of Nanjing increased 30.30%, signifying awful air quality in winter. Air pollution levels significantly affect the comfort levels in all seasons, which is more evident with good weather patterns. MEC can offer early warnings of extreme weather events and provide a basis for the better prevention and control of air pollution to protect human health basing on the predictions of meteorological and environmental impact factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair pollution control 3aair quality 3acold 3aenvironmental impact 3aheat 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ameteorology 3aresearch 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aChina 0aHuman health 0aHuman comfort 0aAir pollution 0aSomatosensory temperature 0aMeteorology and environment comfort1 aWang, Bingyun1 aWang, Shigong1 aHu, Wendong1 aWen, Xiaohang1 aShao, Ping1 aFan, Jin0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Apr., v. 195 p.110318-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1103183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011800165300001500283520140600298592002801704650002401732650002601756650001201782650001701794650002001811650001001831650001001841650001001851650001201861650001501873650001801888650001001906650001501916700001601931700001801947773010801965856008402073852000902157655001202166IND60480665820221119073756.0160129e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048066582DNAL7 a10.3318/BIOE.2009.109.2.952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheridan, H.10aBotanical rejuvenation of field margins and benefits for invertebrate fauna on a drystock farm in county longford  ap. 95-106.  a<p>This study investigates methods to rejuvenate the flora of previously degraded field margins on a pastoral farm in County Longford. We also assess the effects of individual treatments on the abundance of various orders of invertebrates recorded within the experimental plots. Field margin treatments were 1.5m-wide unfenced control margins, 1.5m-wide fenced margins or 3.5m-wide fenced margins. Nutrient inputs were excluded from all of the experimental plots. The botanical composition of the plots was examined on four occasions between 2002 and 2004 using permanent, nested quadrats. Emergence traps were used to measure invertebrate abundance within treatment plots and the main sward. Results indicated that 1) exclusion of nutrient inputs had a positive effect on plant species richness within the field margins; 2) plant species richness decreased with increased distance from the hedgerow; 3) herb species richness was greatest in the 1.5m closest to the hedgerow; 4) greater abundance of invertebrates occurred within the 3.5m-wide margins; 5) successful control of <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i> was achieved through spot treatment with the selective herbicide 'Asulox'; and 6) a combination of management techniques such as cutting and grazing is likely to enhance plant species richness and facilitate the structural diversity of vegetation that is necessary for many invertebrate taxa.</p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteridium aquilinum 3abotanical composition 3acutting 3aedge effects 3aemergence traps 3afarms 3afauna 3aflora 3agrazing 3aherbicides 3ainvertebrates 3asward 3avegetation1 aFinn, J.

Therefore this paper presents a combined experimental and numerical study into high speed rail vibrations for tracks on three types of support: a cutting, an embankment and an at grade section. Firstly, an experimental campaign is undertaken where vibrations and in-situ soil properties are measured at three Belgian rail sites. A finite element model is then developed to recreate the complex ground topology at each site. A validation is performed and it is found that although the at-grade and embankment cases show a correlation with the experimental results, the cutting case is more challenging to replicate. Despite this, each site is then analysed to determine the effect of earthworks profile on ground vibrations, with both the near and far fields being investigated. It is found that different earthwork profiles generate strongly differing ground-borne vibration characteristics, with the embankment profile generating lower vibration levels in comparison to the cutting and at-grade cases. Therefore it is concluded that it is important to consider earthwork profiles when undertaking vibration assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acutting 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3arailroads 3asoil properties 3atopology 3avibration 0aRailway ground vibrations 0aEnvironmental impact assessment 0aTrack embankment 0aCutting-excavation 0aHigh speed rail 0aEarthworks1 aConnolly, David P.1 aOlivier, Bryan1 aLaghrouche, Omar1 aCosta, Pedro Alves0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 July 01, v. 557-558 p.110-122dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013900154300001600293500002000309520129200329592002801621596006601649650002301715650001201738650001701750650003001767650001701797650001101814650002001825650000901845650001401854650002001868650001401888650002101902650001601923650000901939650002201948650001501970650002301985650002102008650001002029651001302039700001502052700001602067700001902083700001802102700001402120700001702134773012402151856007302275852000902348655001202357IND60614880620221119135910.0181002e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061488062DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.124312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeyret, M.14aThe transition from arable lands to rubber tree plantations in northern Thailand impacts weed assemblages and soil physical properties  ap. 404-417.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn South‐East Asia, rapid land use changes in recent decades have raised concerns for biodiversity and soil conservation. Weeds provide many ecosystemic services for soil protection and support biodiversity, and could mitigate the negative effects of intensification. We investigated the changes in weed assemblages and weed–soil interactions on a chronosequence from annual crops to mature rubber tree plantations. We sampled five fields for each of four land uses in mountainous northern Thailand (rainfed upland rice, maize, young rubber tree (RT) intercropped with maize, and mature RT). We characterized weed assemblages (abundance, richness) and soil properties (bulk density, water, carbon and nitrogen content). Rice had the most diverse and abundant weed assemblages. Weed assemblages differed between (i) rice, (ii) maize and young RT with maize and (iii) mature RT. Soil water content was the highest in mature RT. Other soil properties varied strongly within and among fields, and did not vary significantly among land uses. Water and nitrogen content increased overall with living soil cover but decreased with weed species richness in mature RT. Such interactions could provide a basis for sustainable weeding practices favourable to soil and biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐14‐CE03‐0012‐04cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aannuals 3aarable soils 3abiodiversity conservation 3abulk density 3acarbon 3achronosequences 3acorn 3ahighlands 3aland use change 3amountains 3anitrogen content 3aplantations 3arice 3asoil conservation 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspecies richness 3aweeds 3aThailand1 aRobain, H.1 ade Rouw, A.1 aSoulileuth, B.1 aTrisophon, K.1 aJumpa, K.1 aValentin, C.0 tSoil use and management.g2018 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.404-417dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl36284x0266-00327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.124313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006700166300001100233520154400244592002801788596007301816596007901889596007601968650000802044650001802052650001902070650002202089650001102111650002702122650002802149650002802177650001802205650001302223651001002236651001402246700002102260700001402281700001602295700001502311700001602326773010902342856008302451852000902534655001202543IND60712438020221118013728.0210303e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071243802DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-020-01199-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHAO, CHUFENG10aFirst report on DNA content of three species of Amorphophallus  ap. 36.  aThe Amorphophallus genus is a perennial herb which belongs to the family Araceae. There are more than 170 species in this genus, which is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. As a kind of food and medicine Amorphophallus has been used for more than 2000 years in China. Because of the high content of konjac glucomannan (KGM) and dietary fiber, it has attracted more attention worldwide. In this article, the DNA contents of A. konjac, A. albus and A. bulbifer in China, A. albus, A. paeoniifolius and A. muelleri in Indonesia were estimated by using flow cytometry. In the samples of China, the DNA contents were 12.95 ± 0.73 pg/2C in A. konjac, 10.51 ± 0.05 pg/2C in A. albus and 17.61 pg/2C in A. bulbifer, and for Indonesia, 14.16 ± 0.48 pg/2C in A. albus (flowering), 8.49 ± 0.2 pg/2C in A. paeoniifolius and 17.84 ± 1.46 pg/2C in A. muelleri were used. Interspecific variation was found significantly (P < 0.01), suggesting that DNA content might be a parameter that can be used to differentiate the species. Intraspecific variation has also been found significantly (P < 0.01), whether in the same region or between two regions. As far as we know, this is the first report on genome size estimation of the A. konjac, A. albus and A. muelleri using flow cytometry. Understanding the genome size of Amorphophallus species will help to sequence the genome and analyse the genetic diversity, evolutionary relationship and geographical variation pattern of Amorphophallus species.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2011BAD33B03cNational Science and Technology Supporting Program  aNo. 2042016kf1106cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aNo. 2012DBA11001cPhilanthropic Project of Scientific Research of Hubei 3aDNA 3adietary fiber 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ageographical variation 3ainterspecific variation 3aintraspecific variation 3akonjac mannan 3amedicine 3aChina 3aIndonesia1 aHARIJATI, NUNUNG1 aLIU, ERXI1 aJIN, SURONG1 aDIAO, YING1 aHU, ZHONGLI0 tJournal of genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 99, no. 1 p.36-36dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-020-01199-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03817naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001100143245011900154300001800273520215600291592002802447650001302475650002502488650001602513650002902529650001502558650002402573650001602597650002102613650001202634650001202646650001602658650000902674650002402683650002802707650001502735650002002750650002602770650001702796650001802813653002002831653001702851653002202868653001302890700001402903700001102917700001402928700001502942700001602957700001302973700001302986773015302999856007803152852000903230655001203239IND60531871520221116173109.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053187152DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-93072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPi, Y.10aEffectiveness of rubber seed oil and flaxseed oil to enhance the α-linolenic acid content in milk from dairy cows  ap. 5719-5730.  aThis experiment was conducted to investigate effect of rubber seed oil compared with flaxseed oil when fed alone or in combination on milk yield, milk composition, and α-linolenic acid (ALA) concentration in milk of dairy cows. Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments according to a completely randomized design. Cows were fed a basal diet (control; CON) or a basal diet supplemented with 4% rubber seed oil (RO), 4% flaxseed oil (FO), or 2% rubber seed oil plus 2% flaxseed oil (RFO) on a dry matter basis for 9 wk. Feed intake, milk protein percentage, and milk fat levels did not differ between the treatments. Cows fed the RO, FO, or RFO treatments had a higher milk yield than the CON group (up to 10.5% more), whereas milk fat percentages decreased. Compared with the CON, milk concentration of ALA was substantially higher in cows receiving RO or RFO, and was doubled in cows receiving FO. The ALA yield (g/d) increased by 31.0, 70.3, and 33.4% in milk from cows fed RO, FO, or RFO, respectively, compared with the CON. Both C18:1 trans-11 (vaccenic acid) and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 (conjugated linoleic acid; CLA) levels were higher in cows fed added flaxseed or rubber seed oil. The CLA yield (g/d) increased by 336, 492, and 484% in cows fed RO, FO, or RFO, respectively, compared with the CON. The increase in vaccenic acid, ALA, and CLA was greater in cows fed RFO than in cows fed RO alone. Compared with the CON, the milk fat from cows fed any of the dietary supplements had a higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids; conversely, the saturated fatty acids levels in milk fat were 30.5% lower. Insulin and growth hormones were not affected by dietary treatments; however, we noted an increase in both cholesterol and nonesterified fatty acids levels in the RO, FO, or RFO treatments. These results indicate that rubber seed oil and flaxseed oil will increase milk production and the concentration of functional fatty acids (ALA, vaccenic acid, and CLA) in milk fat while decreasing the content of saturated fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3acholesterol 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adairy cows 3adietary supplements 3afeed intake 3afree fatty acids 3ainsulin 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3amilk 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 3arubber seed oil 3asaturated fatty acids 3asomatotropin 3avaccenic acid 0arubber seed oil 0aflaxseed oil 0aα-linolenic acid 0amilk fat1 aGao, S.T.1 aMa, L.1 aZhu, Y.X.1 aWang, J.Q.1 aZhang, J.M.1 aXu, J.C.1 aBu, D.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 July, v. 99, no. 7 p.5719-5730dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-93073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008500163300001100248520144700259592002801706650001501734650001301749650002201762650003001784650001301814650002001827650002501847650003301872651002301905700002601928700001701954773010901971856008302080852000902163655001202172IND60712438220221118013712.0210303e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071243822DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-020-01192-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnjana, S.10aDeveloping ancestry informative marker panel for Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzees  ap. 39.  aChimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), with a dwindling population size, are distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. They are classified into two biogeographical clusters comprising of four subspecies: a western African cluster that includes P. t. verus and P. t. ellioti and a central/eastern African cluster that includes P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii. While the genetic distinctness of Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzees (P. t. ellioti) from western chimpanzees has been known for a while, the fine structures within P. t. ellioti population has remained under-studied. In this study, we developed the first ever ancestry informative marker (AIMs) panel that can detect the fine population structure within Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzees with high resolution. We compared four commonly used AIMs-determining strategies, namely Infocalc algorithm, Wright’s FST, smart principal component analysis (SmartPCA) and ADMIXTURE to first identify the best approach and then developed an AIMs panel of 435 SNPs employing the consensus of the four approaches (n = 129), with additional supplements from the best two approaches (Infocalc and ADMIXTURE). To the best of our knowledge, we have developed the first-ever AIMs panel for chimpanzees, which can greatly aid in their planned reintroduction to the natural habitat, maintaining their genetic integrity through planned captive breeding, and in tracking illegal trading across the globe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aancestry 3agenetic stability 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3aprincipal component analysis 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aSammeta, Sai Pradivya1 aDas, Ranajit0 tJournal of genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 99, no. 1 p.39-39dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-020-01192-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001900170245017800189300001800367520141900385592002801804650002301832650001101855650000901866650001401875650001401889650001101903650001001914650002001924650001001944650001101954650001401965650001501979650003501994650000902029650002902038650002602067650002702093650003802120650001702158650002402175650002402199650006902223651001302292651001302305700001802318700001702336700002502353700001902378700001702397700002602414773011302440856008702553852000902640655001202649IND4466865920221121051351.0141112e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446686592DNAL7 a218354382pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.06.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZemba, Stephen10aEmissions of metals and polychlorinated dibenzo(p)dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) from Portland cement manufacturing plants: Inter-kiln variability and dependence on fuel-types  ap. 4198-4205.  aEmissions from Portland cement manufacturing facilities may increase health risks in nearby populations and are thus subject to stringent regulations. Direct testing of pollutant concentrations in exhaust gases provides the best basis for assessing the extent of these risks. However, these tests (i) are often conducted under stressed, rather than typical, operating conditions, (ii) may be limited in number and duration, and (iii) may be influenced by specific fuel-types and attributes of individual kilns. We report here on the results of more than 150 emissions-tests conducted of two kilns at a Portland cement manufacturing plant in Portugal. The tests measured various regulated metals and polychlorinated dibenzo(p)dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs). Stack-gas concentrations of pollutants were found to be highly variable, with standard deviations on the order of mean values. Emission rates of many pollutants were higher when coal was used as the main kiln fuel (instead of petroleum coke). Use of various supplemental fuels, however, had little effect on stack emissions, and few statistically significant differences were observed when hazardous waste was included in the fuel mix. Significant differences in emissions for some pollutants were observed between the two kilns despite their similar designs and uses of similar fuels. All measured values were found to be within applicable regulatory limits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3acement 3acoal 3aemissions 3afactories 3afurans 3agases 3ahazardous waste 3akilns 3ametals 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3arisk 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aBenzofuransxanalysis 2aConstruction Materials 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFossil Fuels 2aIndustryxstandards 2aRegression Analysis 2aPolychlorinated Dibenzodioxinsxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 3aPortugal 0aPortugal1 aAmes, Michael1 aGreen, Laura1 aBotelho, Maria João1 aGossman, David1 aLinkov, Igor1 aPalma-Oliveira, Jose,0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 409, no. 20 p.4198-4205dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.06.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245017100164300001800335520127800353592002801631596011001659596012801769650002401897650002401921650001201945650001501957650001401972650002001986650002602006650001902032650001502051650002002066650001802086650004102104653002302145653001902168653002302187653001602210653001802226700001302244700001702257700001602274700005102290700005602341773014802397856008102545852000902626655001202635IND60772664420221119083655.0220407e20220328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077266442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c075132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haitang10aComprehensive Lipidomic Analysis of Three Edible Brown Seaweeds Based on Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry  ap. 4138-4151.  aA comprehensive lipidomic analysis was performed onto three edible brown seaweeds, namely Laminaria japonica, Undaria pinnatifida, and Scagassum natans, using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RPLC–Q-TOF-MS/MS). In total, 675 lipid molecules, including glycolipids (GLs), phospholipids, sphingolipids (SLs), betaine lipids, and glycerolipids, were identified and semiquantified. With the exception of the high content of diacylglycerols found in L. japonica (54.6% of total lipids), GLs were the dominant component in the three brown seaweeds (27.7–56.7% of total lipids), containing a high proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid. Interestingly, SLs represented by ceramide and hexosylceramide containing phytosphingosine and α-hydroxy fatty acid structures were detected in the three brown seaweeds. A large number of acylated GLs were identified and reported for the first time in these seaweeds, including acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and acylated digalactosyldiacylglycerol containing nonoxidized fatty acids. The bioactive lipids identified herein could be considered potential biomarkers for identifying these seaweeds, evaluating their nutritional value and further promoting their utilization.  aPublisher supplied data  a202012018cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  a2018YFD0901101cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855 3aSaccharina japonica 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3abetaine 3abiomarkers 3aceramides 3adiacylglycerols 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afood chemistry 3alipidomics 3anutritive value 3aphospholipids 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 0alipidomic analysis 0abrown seaweeds 0aRPLC−Q-TOF-MS/MS 0aglycolipids 0asphingolipids1 aYang, Lu1 aWang, Xincen1 aCong, Peixu1 aXu, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9321-95671 aXue, Changhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6976-29060 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 Mar. 28, v. 70, no. 13 p.4138-4151dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c075133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03853naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024003500126040001800161100001700179245015200196300001800348506002800366506005900394520203600453592002802489596004502517506003702562650002402599650001302623650001902636650000902655650001602664650001502680650000902695650001802704650002202722650002502744650001702769650001402786650001402800650001802814650000902832650002002841650002802861653002802889653002002917653001602937653001402953700001402967700001502981700001602996773015303012856007903165903002203244852000903266655001203275IND60531871720221207064004.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053187172DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-102222doi7 a10.3168/jds.2015-102222chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBender, R.W.10aEffects of partial replacement of corn and alfalfa silage with tall fescue hay on total-tract digestibility and lactation performance in dairy cows  ap. 5436-5444.  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Dairy Science Association License Information  aOur objective was to evaluate the effects of replacing either corn or alfalfa silage with tall fescue hay on total-tract neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility and lactation performance in dairy cows. Twenty-four primiparous (75±35 d in milk) and 40 multiparous (68±19 d in milk) Holstein cows were blocked by parity and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a pen equipped with 32 feeding gates to record intake by cow. Each gate was randomly assigned to 1 treatment group; thus, each cow had access to all 8 gates within the respective treatment and cow was the experimental unit. Treatments were formulated to replace either corn silage (CS) or alfalfa silage (AS) with tall fescue hay (TF) as follows (DM basis): 33% AS and 67% CS (control; 33AS67CS), 60% TF and 40% AS (60TF40AS), 60% TF and 40% CS (60TF40CS), and 33% TF and 67% CS (33TF67CS). The experiment was a 7-wk continuous lactation trial with a 2-wk covariate period. Milk production did not differ among treatments and averaged 40.4 kg/d. Fat yield and concentration and protein yield and concentration did not differ among treatments and averaged 1.58 kg/d, 3.94%, 1.28 kg/d, and 3.15%, respectively. Dry matter intake was greater for 33AS67CS (24.5 kg/d) compared with 60TF40CS (22.1 kg/d) and 33TF67CS (22.7 kg/d), and tended to be greater than 60TF40AS (23.2 kg/d). In vivo total-tract dry matter digestibility did not differ among treatments and averaged 66.2%. In vivo total-tract NDF digestibility was lower for 33AS67CS (37.8%) compared with 60TF40AS (44.4%) and 33TF67CS (45.3%), and similar to 60TF40CS (42.4%). In vivo total-tract NDF digestibility and an estimate of in situ total-tract NDF digestibility were similar between techniques across all treatment diets (42.3 vs. 42.6%, respectively). Inclusion of tall fescue grass hay increased the total-tract NDF digestibility of the diet and has the potential to replace corn silage and alfalfa silage and maintain milk production if economically feasible based on current market prices.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aHolstein 3aalfalfa silage 3acorn 3acorn silage 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3aeconomic feasibility 3agate-to-gate 3agrass hay 3alactation 3amarket prices 3amilk 3amilk production 3aneutral detergent fiber 0aneutral detergent fiber 0afiber digestion 0atall fescue 0adairy cow1 aLopes, F.1 aCook, D.E.1 aCombs, D.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 July, v. 99, no. 7 p.5436-5444dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-102223Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245011100201300001600312500002000328506007600348520139500424592002801819506003701847650001201884650002001896650001701916650001101933650001501944650001201959650001401971650002601985650002902011650001902040700001602059700001902075700002202094700002002116700002502136700005802161773011602219856007402335852000902409655001202418IND60588364520221207054444.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058836452DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.144972doi7 aPMC57633312pmcid7 a282776082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMot, Augustin C.10aReal‐time detection of N‐end rule‐mediated ubiquitination via fluorescently labeled substrate probes  ap. 613-624.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe N‐end rule pathway has emerged as a major system for regulating protein functions by controlling their turnover in medical, animal and plant sciences as well as agriculture. Although novel functions and enzymes of the pathway have been discovered, the ubiquitination mechanism and substrate specificity of N‐end rule pathway E3 ubiquitin ligases have remained elusive. Taking the first discovered bona fide plant N‐end rule E3 ligase PROTEOLYSIS1 (PRT1) as a model, we used a novel tool to molecularly characterize polyubiquitination live, in real time. We gained mechanistic insights into PRT1 substrate preference and activation by monitoring live ubiquitination using a fluorescent chemical probe coupled to artificial substrate reporters. Ubiquitination was measured by rapid in‐gel fluorescence scanning as well as in real time by fluorescence polarization. The enzymatic activity, substrate specificity, mechanisms and reaction optimization of PRT1‐mediated ubiquitination were investigated ad hoc instantaneously and with significantly reduced reagent consumption. We demonstrated that PRT1 is indeed an E3 ligase, which has been hypothesized for over two decades. These results demonstrate that PRT1 has the potential to be involved in polyubiquitination of various substrates and therefore pave the way to understanding recently discovered phenotypes of prt1 mutants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amutants 3aphenotype 3asubstrate specificity 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination1 aPrell, Erik1 aKlecker, Maria1 aNaumann, Christin1 aFaden, Frederik1 aWestermann, Bernhard1 aDissmeyer, Nico1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4156-37610 tnew phytologist.g2018 Jan., v. 217, no. 2 p.613-624dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.144973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006700168300001600235520091300251592002801164650000901192650002101201650001001222650001501232650002201247650001101269650002201280650001801302650001201320651001201332700001701344700001601361773010901377856008501486852000901571655001201580IND60480666420221119075749.0160129e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048066642DNAL7 a10.3318/BIOE.2009.109.3.1912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamp, W.

Examination of archival data proved uninformative. Details of species composition, distribution and density were fragmented and non-standard. No monitoring programme or strategic stock assessment existed, and information of the type required by the WFD was not available. This paper describes the research undertaken in Ireland since 2000 to deliver standardised WFD survey methods and protocols with which to create essential WFD-compliant data on fish communities in rivers, lakes and transitional waters. Three research projects, one in each surface water category, are discussed, as are initial developments towards fish-classification schemes, surveillance monitoring, and participation and advances in the intercalibration process.</p>  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3afish communities 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aresearch projects 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3asurface water 3asurveys 3aIreland1 aKelly, F.

In Taiwan, complex cultivars and long‐term infection by CTV result in more than 90% of infected citrus trees, but local strain identification and classification are still incomplete. Here, six CTV strains were categorized by grafting onto eight citrus cultivars and the pathological characteristics of the stem‐pitting mild strains were identified. After 6 months of inoculation, the pummelo stem‐pitting severe strain (CTV‐Pum/SP/T1) only caused severe symptoms in Wentan pummelo (WP) and the mild strain (CTV‐Pum/M/T5) was symptomless in every cultivar; the sweet orange (SO) stem‐pitting severe strain (CTV‐SwO/SP/T7) affected SO, WP and Ponkan mandarin (PM), and the mild strain (CTV‐SwO/M/T51) caused no symptoms in SO except for WP; the mandarin stem‐pitting severe strain (CTV‐Man/SP/T46) caused severe impacts in PM, WP and Eureka lemon, whereas the mild strain (CTV‐Man/M/T2) only caused severe stem‐pitting in WP. The full‐length sequencing of both pummelo stem‐pitting strains and phylogenetic analysis revealed that CTV‐Pum/SP/T1 and CTV‐Pum/M/T5 were related to the HA18‐9 and HA16‐5 strains from Hawaii, respectively. Moreover, recombination analysis revealed that TCT repeat sequences existed at open reading frame 1a in both the CTV‐Pum/SP/T1 and the T36 strains from the United States, indicating that the possible evolution relationship between two regions. Furthermore, improved universal and specific primer pairs were designed for more specific, sensitive detection to meet the needs for quarantine and early prevention. The understanding of strain pathogenicity and genomic analysis provided further characterization of each strain and enabled practical challenge inoculation against CTV disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3acultivars 3agenomics 3ahybridization probes 3alemons 3aopen reading frames 3aoranges 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3apummelos 3aquarantine 3atrees 3aHawaii 3aTaiwan1 aChen, Ying‐Hua1 aWu, Meng‐Ling1 aSu, Hong‐Ji1 aHung, Ting‐Hsuan0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2018 Aug., v. 166, no. 7-8 p.459-469dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000109x0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.127043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010600161300001600267500002000283520110100303592002801404596003901432650000801471650001301479650002201492650002001514650001401534650002701548650002201575650001501597650002801612650002201640650001501662650000901677650001401686650001801700650002301718700002301741700001801764700001501782700001501797700002101812700002501833773011501858856007301973852000902046655001202055IND60614881020221119135900.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061488102DNAL7 a10.1111/age.127072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeijser, S.

The data collection system ‘PETscan’ was developed to facilitate standardized registration of diagnoses in veterinary practice. In the development, we attempted to counter challenges known from other primary practice data systems. PETscan includes a comprehensive list of potential diagnoses and supports the veterinary professionals in the diagnostic process. Demographics, individual data and standardized diagnostic data are collected through practice management software in a central database for epidemiological analysis. A preliminary data analysis from PETscan showed specific health issues in four canine breeds. As a real‐time prospective monitoring tool, PETscan summaries can objectively assess the incidence of disorders in companion animal populations and can be used to prioritize disease–gene identification studies and evaluate the effects of breeding strategies, for example, after implementation of a new DNA test in the breeding strategy.  aPublisher supplied data  cDutch Ministry of Economic Affairs 3aDNA 3abreeding 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3ademographic statistics 3adisease incidence 3adog breeds 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic disorders 3amonitoring 3apets 3aphenotype 3aprofessionals 3aveterinary clinics1 aVernooij, J.

In this study, a recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum with an invasive effect was constructed, and it expressed the TA4-AMA1 protein of E. tenella. After oral immunization with recombinant L. plantarum, specific humoral and mucosal immune levels were measured by indirect ELISA, and the differentiation of T cells was analysed by flow cytometry. After challenge with sporulated oocysts, the body weight, oocyst shedding and cecum lesions of the chicken were evaluated. The results indicated that chickens immunized with recombinant invasive L. plantarum produced higher levels of specific antibodies in the serum than did the non-immunized controls, and the secretory IgA (sIgA) levels were increased in the intestinal washes compared to those of the controls (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry showed that recombinant invasive L. plantarum significantly stimulated T cell differentiation compared to the PBS group (P < 0.01, P < 0.001), and a higher proportion of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells were detected in peripheral blood. Moreover, the lesion scores and histopathological caecum sections showed that immunizing chickens with recombinant invasive L. plantarum can significantly relieve pathological damage in the cecum (P < 0.01), and the relative body weight gain was 89.64 %, which was higher than the 79.83 % gain in the chickens immunized with non-invasive L. plantarum. After the challenge, faeces from ten chickens in each group were collected between 4 and 7 days, and the oocysts per gram (OPG) was determined by the McMaster technique. The data indicated that oocysts in the faeces of chickens immunized with the recombinant invasive L. plantarum were significantly lower than those of the controls (P < 0.01). The results suggest that recombinant invasive L. plantarum effectively activated immune responses against E. tenella infection and can be used as a candidate vaccine against E. tenella infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria tenella 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3acecum 3acell differentiation 3acoccidiosis 3aeconomic development 3afeces 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3aindustry 3amucosal immunity 3aoocysts 3aoral vaccination 3avaccines 3aveterinary parasitology 0aRecombinant invasive Lactobacillus plantarum 0aOral vaccine 0aTA4 0aAMA11 aJiang, Yan-Long1 aLiu, Jing1 aGao, Xing1 aZhang, Zan1 aHuang, Hai-Bin1 aYang, Wen-Tao1 aShi, Chun-Wei1 aCao, Xin1 aYang, Gui-Lian1 aWang, Junfeng,0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2020 July, v. 283 p.109161-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1091613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015700159300001600316500002000332520148200352592002801834650001601862650001401878650001601892650002301908650001401931650001701945650001201962650002601974650001202000650002502012650001402037650001402051650001302065650001002078650002002088650002002108700001802128700002102146700002102167700001502188700005902203700002202262773011602284856007402400852000902474655001202483IND60588364720221117080945.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058836472DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.148522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Ai‐Xia10aIdentification of chalcone isomerase in the basal land plants reveals an ancient evolution of enzymatic cyclization activity for synthesis of flavonoids  ap. 909-924.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFlavonoids ubiquitously distribute to the terrestrial plants and chalcone isomerase (CHI)‐catalyzed intramolecular and stereospecific cyclization of chalcones is a committed step in the production of flavonoids. However, so far the bona fide CHIs are found only in vascular plants, and their origin and evolution remains elusive. We conducted transcriptomic and/or genomic sequence search, subsequent phylogenetic analysis, and detailed biochemical and genetic characterization to explore the potential existence of CHI proteins in the basal bryophyte liverwort species and the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii. We found that both liverwort and Selaginella species possess canonical CHI‐fold proteins that cluster with their corresponding higher plant counterparts. Among them, some members exhibited bona fide CHI activity, which catalyze stereospecific cyclization of both 6′‐hydroxychalcone and 6′‐deoxychalcone, yielding corresponding 5‐hydroxy and 5‐deoxyflavanones, resembling the typical type II CHIs currently known to be ‘specific’ for legume plants. Expressing those primitive bona fide CHIs in the Arabidopsis chi mutant restores the seed coat transparent testa phenotype and the accumulation of flavonoids. These findings, in contrast to our current understanding of the evolution of enzymatic CHIs, suggest that emergence of the bona fide type II CHIs is an ancient evolution event that occurred before the divergence of liverwort lineages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBryophyta 3aSelaginella 3achalcone isomerase 3achalcones 3aembryophytes 3alegumes 3amosses and liverworts 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3atesta 3atranscriptomics 3avascular plants1 aZhang, Xuebin1 aHan, Xiao‐Juan1 aZhang, Yu‐Ying1 aGao, Shuai1 aLiu, Chang‐Jun1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6189-87561 aLou, Hong‐Xiang0 tnew phytologist.g2018 Jan., v. 217, no. 2 p.909-924dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.148523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245010700181520199300288592002802281650001202309650000902321650001502330650001602345650001002361650001302371650001102384650000902395650002202404650003202426650001002458650001502468651001302483653002002496653004502516653002202561653001202583653001702595653001602612700002602628773009002654856008402744852000902828655001202837IND60766051920221120164410.0220614e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076605192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2022.1520182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPattarakulpisutti, Ponlawat14aThe role of fluvial landforms as a driver of vegetation variation on a floodplain in southern Thailand  aFloodplain vegetation is rare in southern Thailand due to the generally steep gradient through which major rivers flow and high pressure of land use. This study aims to increase the understanding of factors and processes that govern vegetation variation and diversity in a floodplain to provide information for conservation and management of this threatened and rare ecosystem. A total of 20 plots, each 625 m², were laid on three broad categories of fluvial landforms to collect data on the number of tree species (woody plants with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm), soil variables, flooding, history of land use and distance to the inner curve of the channel in Nong thung thong Non-Hunting Area, Thailand. Three 4 m² subplots were nested within each 625 m² plot to estimate shrub composition and coverage. The alpha and beta diversity of the tree species in each fluvial landform were calculated. The relationships between vegetation data and environmental factors were explored through transformation-based Redundancy Analysis (tb-RDA) and univariate analyses. Beta diversity between abandoned channel and ridge plots, and between ridge and shallow depression plots was higher than the dissimilarities within each fluvial landform, and the balanced variation in abundance contributed to the major part of the dissimilarities. These results indicate different tolerance ranges or competitive ability of species between these fluvial landforms. Results from the tb-RDA showed that tree species composition varied with fluvial landforms and soil calcium content. Median of flooding was associated with fluvial landforms. In addition, soil calcium content could be controlled by fluvial landform because clay and calcium were correlated, and both were associated with fluvial landforms. These results suggest that variation in fluvial landforms causes variation in flooding duration, edaphic factors, vegetation variation, and ultimately, the biodiversity in this floodplain.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aclay 3aecosystems 3afloodplains 3aflora 3aland use 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3avegetation 3aThailand 0aRiparian forest 0aTransformation-based redundancy analysis 0aVegetation survey 0aWetland 0aBiodiversity 0aFlood pulse1 aMitchell, Fraser J.G.0 tFlora.g2022 Mar., v. 288 p.152018-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2022.1520183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008300163300001600246520084900262592002801111650001601139650003301155650001501188650001101203650001501214650001401229653001701243653001801260653001501278653001601293700001601309700005401325700001601379700005901395700001901454700001601473773011101489856008101600852000901681655001201690IND60604448320221118032005.0180717e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060444832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArav, Reuma10aHigh-resolution documentation, 3-D modeling and analysis of “desert kites”  ap. 302-314.  aUsing terrestrial laser scanning technology we create high-resolution 3-D models of wild ungulates' archeological large-game drives (desert kites) and demonstrate how the collected data can be utilized to conduct spatial and architectural analyses.

The models are used to simulate how a kite was operated and especially how it appeared from the hunted animal's perspective. The models also serve as a useful tool for detecting macro and micro construction details, and as a platform for an array of intra- and inter-kite comparisons in different geographic landscapes.

Sometimes, organic inclusions are also found in pottery, either naturally occurring or artificially incorporated. This study discusses Iron Age pottery fabric, specifically focussing on organic inclusions, which have previously not been adequately investigated in Latvia. We experimentally tested firing temperatures to establish the temperature limit for preservation of organic matter in pottery and tested a variety of organic materials in different proportions for the purpose of comparison with archaeological pottery, in order to ascertain the possible content of the fabric used in the hand-built pottery of the Middle and Late Iron Age (5th–12th centuries) in present-day Latvia. Pollen and non-pollen palynomorph analysis was applied with the aim of assessing the possible origin and composition of the organic matter in the archaeological pottery fabrics.The results of this study demonstrate that the dark colouration produced by organic matter in the core of the experimental ceramic fabric is preserved up to a temperature 700 °C. Pottery firing experiments show that chaff and flax shives left medium-to coarse-grained inclusions in the structure, resembling the archaeological pottery. On the other hand, experimental samples with seeds did not correspond exactly to any of the known ancient wares. The presence of spores of coprophilous fungi Sporormiella and Apiosordaria suggests that the fabric of a small number of Iron Age pottery samples analysed in the present study could possibly contain animal dung.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporormiella 3aanimals 3aarchaeology 3aceramics 3achaff 3aclay 3acolor 3afabrics 3afeces 3aflax 3afungi 3aorganic matter 3apollen 3aseeds 3aspores 3atemperature 3aLatvia 0aHand-built pottery 0aPottery fabric 0aOrganic inclusions 0aExperimental archaeology 0aNon-pollen palynomorphs1 aStivrins, Normunds0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2015 May, v. 57 p.239-247dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2015.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015100172300001600323520142000339592002801759650001601787650001101803650002601814650001101840650002401851650001301875650000901888650001201897650001101909650001201920650001701932650002201949700002301971700002301994773014502017856008402162852000902246655001202255IND60123485620221118071604.0150325e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012348562DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2012.7547892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Theoren R.10aPassive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tracking versus Snorkeling: Quantification of Fright Bias and Comparison of Techniques in Habitat Use Studies  ap. 660-670.  aQuantitative assessment of day and night fright bias (i.e., flight response) of Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar parr during passive integrated transponder (PIT) tracking surveys was carried out during summer (water temperature, 18–22°C) and autumn (water temperature, <3°C). In addition, PIT-tracking and snorkeling survey methods were compared to assess whether the two methods result in similar habitat use data for Atlantic Salmon parr at the same study site. During summer fright bias surveys, 0–15% of parr displayed a flight response to PIT-tracking techniques in the riffle–run–pool habitat types commonly used by Atlantic Salmon parr; 24–25% displayed a flight response in relatively unused, shallow, calm water habitats. No flight responses were observed in autumn surveys with colder water temperatures in any habitat type. Larger numbers of salmon parr were observed using PIT tracking regardless of stream discharge. Furthermore, significant differences in habitat use frequency curves between these two methods were observed due largely to higher Atlantic Salmon parr abundances being detected by PIT tracking in shallow water depths at lower discharges and the ability to detect inactive salmon parr hiding within the substrate. PIT tracking was found to be a valid method for habitat assessment and provides more reliable habitat use data than traditional snorkeling methods in small streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aautumn 3abiological assessment 3aflight 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aparr 3astreams 3asummer 3asurveys 3atransponders 3awater temperature1 aLinnansaari, Tommi1 aCunjak, Richard A.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2013 May 1, v. 142, no. 3 p.660-670dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19703x1548-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.7547893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007700164500002200241506011700263506007600380520125700456592002801713506003701741650001901778650002001797650001001817650001301827650001401840650001501854650002901869653002001898653004001918653002001958653002301978653001002001700001502011700001802026700001602044700001402060700001202074773010702086856004802193852000902241655001202250IND60795599620221207081356.0221004e20220923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079559962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2022.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhiting10aDrSim: Similarity Learning for Transcriptional Phenotypic Drug Discovery  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscriptional phenotypic drug discovery has achieved great success, and various compound perturbation-based data resources, such as connectivity map (CMap) and library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS), have been presented. Computational strategies fully mining these resources for phenotypic drug discovery have been proposed. Among them, the fundamental issue is to define the proper similarity between transcriptional profiles. Traditionally, such similarity has been defined in an unsupervised way. However, due to the high dimensionality and the existence of high noise in high-throughput data, it lacks robustness with limited performance. To this end, we present DrSim, which is a learning-based framework that automatically infers similarity rather than that of manually designing. We evaluated DrSim on publicly available in vitro and in vivo datasets in drug annotation and repositioning. The results indicated that DrSim outperforms the existing methods. In conclusion, by learning transcriptional similarity, DrSim facilitates the broad utility of high-throughput transcriptional perturbation data for phenotypic drug discovery.

To test the relationship between Percolomonas and Heterolobosea, we analysed the primary structure of the actin and small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes of P. cosmopolitus as well as the predicted secondary structure of the SSU rRNA. Percolomonas shares common secondary structure patterns of the SSU rRNA with heterolobosean taxa, which, together with the results of actin gene analysis, confirms that it is closely related to Heterolobosea. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the sequences of the SSU rRNA gene suggest Percolomonas belongs to the family Vahlkampfiidae. The first Bayesian analysis of a large taxon sampling of heterolobosean SSU rRNA genes clarifies the phylogenetic relationships within this group.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHelix 17 0aHeterolobosea 0aphylogeny 0aSSU rRNA 0aV3 region1 aMYLNIKOV, ALEXANDRE P.1 aBERNEY, CEDRIC1 aFAHRNI, JOSE1 aPAWLOWSKI, JAN1 aALESHIN, VLADIMIR V.1 aPETROV, NIKOLAY B.0 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2004 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.575-581dSociety of Protozoologistsx1066-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1550-7408.2004.tb00294.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024002500113040001800138100002100156245010300177300001400280500002000294500001500314520208300329592002802412650002302440650001902463650001902482650002702501650001302528650002602541650002402567650002002591650002202611650003102633650002502664650002702689650002102716650001902737650002102756650002602777650002802803651001002831653002602841700002402867700002102891700002202912700002302934773009402957852000903051856011203060856007103172961001303243655001203256IND4379574420221121161159.0170626e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437957442DNAL7 a10113/283902hdl7 a10.1890/04-16962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGill, Richard A.10aPotential nitrogen constraints on soil carbon sequestration under low and elevated atmospheric co2  ap. 41-52.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-05  aThe interaction between nitrogen cycling and carbon sequestration is critical in predicting the consequences of anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO₂ (hereafter, Cₐ). The progressive N limitation (PNL) theory predicts that carbon sequestration in plants and soils with rising Cₐ may be constrained by the availability of nitrogen in many ecosystems. Here we report on the interaction between C and N dynamics during a four‐year field experiment in which an intact C₃/C₄ grassland was exposed to a gradient in Cₐ from 200 to 560 μmol/mol. There were strong species effects on decomposition dynamics, with C loss positively correlated and N mineralization negatively correlated with Cₐ for litter of the C₃ forb Solanum dimidiatum, whereas decomposition of litter from the C₄ grass Bothriochloa ischaemum was unresponsive to Cₐ. Both soil microbial biomass and soil respiration rates exhibited a nonlinear response to Cₐ, reaching a maximum at ∼440 μmol/mol Cₐ. We found a general movement of N out of soil organic matter and into aboveground plant biomass with increased Cₐ. Within soils we found evidence of C loss from recalcitrant soil C fractions with narrow C:N ratios to more labile soil fractions with broader C:N ratios, potentially due to decreases in N availability. The observed reallocation of N from soil to plants over the last three years of the experiment supports the PNL theory that reductions in N availability with rising Cₐ could initially be overcome by a transfer of N from low C:N ratio fractions to those with higher C:N ratios. Although the transfer of N allowed plant production to increase with increasing Cₐ, there was no net soil C sequestration at elevated Cₐ, presumably because relatively stable C is being decomposed to meet microbial and plant N requirements. Ultimately, if the C gained by increased plant production is rapidly lost through decomposition, the shift in N from older soil organic matter to rapidly decomposing plant tissue may limit net C sequestration with increased plant production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum dimidiatum 3acarbon dioxide 3amineralization 3aBothriochloa ischaemum 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3asoil organic matter 3anutrient uptake 3amicrobial biomass 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asoil respiration 3abiodegradation 3alosses from soil 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3anutrient use efficiency 3aTexas 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aAnderson, Laurel J.1 aPolley, H.

The secretome has distinct structural and post-translational characteristics, since folding in the ER occurs in an environment that is distinct in terms of its ionic composition, dynamics and requirements for quality control. The folding machinery in the ER therefore includes chaperones and folding enzymes that introduce, monitor and react to disulfide bonds, glycans, and fluctuations of luminal calcium. We describe the major chaperone networks in the lumen and discuss how they have distinct modes of operation that enable cells to accomplish highly efficient production of the secretome.

Our model also accounts for the fact that the pollen and nectar collected by bees on crops are limiting resources for both bee growth and honey production. We argue that diminishing returns to foraging by bees is a central constraint of the economic problem of beekeeping and that availability of forage plays an important role in determining the abundance of honey bees. Furthermore, we show how the behaviors of individual beekeepers are aggregated through markets for bees and characterize the response of the beekeeping industry to changes in honey prices, winter losses, and other factors. Our model sets the bases for an empirical approach to estimate the relative contributions of different biological and economic factors to changes in honey bee populations in the United States over the past 60 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aapiculture 3abeekeepers 3abioeconomics 3acrops 3aeconomic factors 3afood prices 3aforage 3aforaging 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3aindustry 3ainsect pollination 3amarkets 3amodels 3anectar 3apollen 3apollinating insects 3aUnited States1 aSumner, D.

In this study, the mitochondrial distribution pattern and activity during buffalo oocyte in vitro maturation, fertilization and preimplantation embryo development were revealed using a fluorescent dye and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Distribution of active mitochondria changed during buffalo oocyte in vitro maturation. Active mitochondria were transferred from the outer to inner and perinuclear cytoplasm as oocytes matured in vitro and aggregated around the pronuclei in the fertilized eggs. Active mitochondria were also observed in preimplantation embryos. In the two‐cell stage, they were distributed throughout the cytoplasm. From four‐cell to the spherical embryonic stages, active mitochondria translocated to the perinuclear and the periphery of the cytoplasm. These results confirm that mitochondria play an important role in oocyte and embryo. The distribution of active mitochondria might be a marked feature of buffalo oocyte maturation, fertilization and preimplantation embryo development in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffaloes 3acell viability 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adyes 3aembryogenesis 3amitochondria 3aoocytes 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloesxembryology 2aEmbryonic Developmentxphysiology 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aIn Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniquesxveterinary 2aMitochondriaxphysiology 2aOocytesxcytologyxphysiology.1 aHuang, Y1 aDuan, Y‐P1 aZhang, M1 aLu, Y‐Q1 aLu, K‐H0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2012 June, v. 47, no. 3 p.443-448dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01900.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009800171500002200269506010400291506007600395520127900471592002801750506003701778650001901815650002001834650001301854650001101867650003301878650001501911650001601926650001801942653002501960653002001985653003502005653004402040700002102084700002802105700002202133700002002155700002102175700002902196700002002225700002202245700001902267700002302286700001902309773010702328856004802435852000902483655001202492IND60795599820221207081034.0221004e20220926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079559982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2022.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeblanc, Sébastien10aNewfound Coding Potential of Transcripts Unveils Missing Members of Human Protein Communities  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent proteogenomic approaches have led to the discovery that regions of the transcriptome previously annotated as non-coding regions [i.e., untranslated regions (UTRs), open reading frames overlapping annotated coding sequences in a different reading frame, and non-coding RNAs] frequently encode proteins (termed alternative proteins). This suggests that previously identified protein–protein interaction networks are partially incomplete since alternative proteins are not present in conventional protein databases. Here we used the proteogenomic resource OpenProt and a combined spectrum- and peptide-centric analysis for the re-analysis of a high-throughput human network proteomics dataset thereby revealing the presence of 261 alternative proteins in the network. We found 19 genes encoding both an annotated (reference) and an alternative protein interacting with each other. Of the 117 alternative proteins encoded by pseudogenes, 38 are direct interactors of reference proteins encoded by their respective parental gene. Finally, we experimentally validate several interactions involving alternative proteins. These data improve the blueprints of the human protein–protein interaction network and suggest functional roles for hundreds of alternative proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteomics 3apseudogenes 3atranscriptome 0aAlternative proteins 0aProtein network 0aProtein–protein interactions 0aAffinity purification mass spectrometry1 aBrunet, Marie A.1 aJacques, Jean-François1 aLekehal, Amina M.1 aDuclos, Andrea,1 aTremblay, Alexia1 aBruggeman-Gascon, Alexis1 aSamandi, Sondos1 aBrunelle, Mylène1 aCohen, Alan A.1 aScott, Michelle S.1 aRoucou, Xavier0 tGenomics, proteomics & bioinformatics.g2022 Sept. 26, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12107x1672-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2022.09.008  aDNAL 7aarticle01610naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245012500173300001600298520056600314592002800880653001000908653001200918653001500930653001900945653001400964700002100978700001800999700002101017700002501038773012001063856009201183852000901275655001201284IND60127011420221116151649.0151108e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012701142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1550-7408.2004.tb00591.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIMAI, SOICHI10aFourteen Morphotypes of Entodinium ovumrajae (Ophryoscolecidae, Entodiniomorphida) Found in the Dromedary Camel of Egypt  ap. 594-597.  aDuring a survey of the ciliate protozoal composition of the stomach contents of nine dromedary camels of Egypt, fourteen morphotypes of Entodinium ovumrajae, which has been considered as a species peculiar to camels, were found in six camels.

Each camel had on average, about five morphotypes of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCamel 0aciliate 0adivergence 0arumen protozoa 0avariation1 aSHINNO, TAKANOBU1 aIKE, KAZUNORI1 aMORITA, TATSUSHI1 aSELIM, HATEM MOHAMED0 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2004 Nov., v. 51, no. 6 p.594-597dSociety of Protozoologistsx1066-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1550-7408.2004.tb00591.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002500150245008400175300001600259520120400275592002801479650002001507650001201527650002001539650001301559650001301572650001601585650002301601650001401624650001201638650001501650650001401665650002001679650001101699650002201710650001501732650001201747700001901759700002501778700001901803773010801822856008601930852000902016655001202025IND4458563420221122033540.0141110e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445856342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2011.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Krimpen, Marinus10aEffect of four processed animal proteins in the diet on behavior in laying hens  ap. 138-145.  aAn experiment was performed to investigate the effect of animal versus vegetable protein sources in the diet on the development of behavior in laying hens. A diet containing protein sources of only vegetable origin was compared with four diets, each containing one of four processed animal proteins (PAPs). Two PAPs (Daka-58 and Sonac-60) were classified as meat meals, whereas the remaining ones (Daka-40 and Sonac-50) were classified as meat and bone meals. The impact of a control diet (without PAP) versus four PAP diets (50g/kg CP of animal origin) on behavior was determined. All diets were isocaloric (AMEₙ=11.8MJ/kg) and isonitrogenous (dig. lysine=6.8g/kg). Hens were housed in 40 floor pens (12 hens/pen, 8 pens/treatment) from 20 to 40 weeks of age. Supplementation of PAPs did not generally reduce feather pecking behavior. Nevertheless, Daka-40 and Sonac-50 fed hens showed a delay in the development of feather damage and, simultaneously, an increase in litter condition, foraging and walking behavior, and floor pecks compared to hens fed Sonac-60. These shifts seemed to be partly related with the intake of digestible glycine, available phosphorus, calcium, potassium, and sodium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal proteins 3acalcium 3afeather pecking 3afeathers 3aforaging 3alaying hens 3ameat and bone meal 3ameat meal 3apecking 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprotein sources 3asodium 3avegetable protein 3avegetables 3awalking1 aVeldkamp, Teun1 aBinnendijk, Gisabeth1 ade Veer, Remco0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2011 July, v. 132, no. 3-4 p.138-145dElsevier B.V.x0168-15917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2011.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009200170300001800262520051400280592002800794650001500822650002500837650001900862650001800881650001200899650001300911700002100924700001700945700002400962700001800986700002101004773011801025856008201143990002301225852000901248655001201257IND60091118120221123014555.0141103e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009111812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsutsumi, Hiroshi10aGold nanoparticles conjugated with monosaccharide-modified peptide for lectin detection  ap. 6825-6827.  aGold nanoparticles (GNPs) conjugated with monosaccharide-modified peptides have been developed as optical probes for lectin detection.

In this work, the residual sugar components in l-lactic acid industrial fermentation broth with agricultural biomass-derived sugar were determined by means of high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). A feasible off-line sample clean-up procedure consisting of sodium oxalate extraction, ethanol extraction and ion-exchange column extraction was developed to remove calcium ions, proteins, anion acids and organic acids before analysis, and their removal efficiencies were 100, 98.74, 97.99 and 99.41%, respectively. Under the optimized analytical conditions, the seventeen sugars, including four monosaccharides, eight disaccharides and five oligosaccharides, have been completely separated in one experimental run on a Dionex Carbopac PA 200 column with sodium hydroxide and sodium acetate as eluents. The method was validated, with good linearity (R² > 0.99), high precision (RSDs < 5.47%), and sensitive detection limits (0.35–44.61 μg L⁻¹); recoveries were >86.95% for short chain carbohydrates (degree of polymerization, DP < 4), while recoveries ranged from 81.87 to 61.41% for DP4 to DP7. The method was successfully applied for analysis of the residual sugar in lactic acid broth with a salt content as high as 120 g L⁻¹ calcium lactate, using different kinds of starch (corn starch, corn flour and cassava starch) hydrolysates as carbon sources. Isomaltose (47.97–60.43%), sucrose (17.50–29.73%) and trehalose (3.05–7.51%) were the main components of residual sugar in these broths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange chromatography 3abroths 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acassava starch 3acorn flour 3acorn starch 3aculture media 3adetection limit 3aethanol 3ahydrolysates 3aion exchange 3aions 3aisomaltose 3alactic acid 3amonosaccharides 3aoxalates 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3asalt content 3ashelf life 3asodium 3asodium acetate 3asodium hydroxide 3astarch 3asucrose 3asugar content 3atrehalose1 aGuo, Yuanxin1 aZhuang, Yingping1 aWang, Yonghong0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Oct. 22, v. 7, no. 21 p.9076-9083dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay01703c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002000186245006300206300001600269506007600285520083300361592002801194506003701222650001201259650002701271650001301298650001001311650001301321650001301334650003701347650002001384650001401404650002601418650003101444650003101475650004401506650003601550650004501586650002401631700002001655700001501675773010401690856008101794852000901875655001201884IND4480299020221207121507.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448029902DNAL7 a217045512pmid7 aPMC31912422pmcid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2011.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTena, Guillaume10aProtein kinase signaling networks in plant innate immunity  ap. 519-529.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn plants and animals, innate immunity is triggered through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in response to microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) to provide the first line of inducible defense. Plant receptor protein kinases (RPKs) represent the main plasma membrane PRRs perceiving diverse MAMPs. RPKs also recognize secondary danger-inducible plant peptides and cell-wall signals. Both types of RPKs trigger rapid and convergent downstream signaling networks controlled by calcium-activated PKs and mitogen-activated PK (MAPK) cascades. These PK signaling networks serve specific and overlapping roles in controlling the activities and synthesis of a plethora of transcription factors (TFs), enzymes, hormones, peptides and antimicrobial chemicals, contributing to resistance against bacteria, oomycetes and fungi.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3afungi 3ahormones 3aimmunity 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aplasma membrane 3areceptors 3atranscription factors 2aPlant Diseasesximmunology 2aPlant Immunityxphysiology 2aPlant Proteinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxenzymologyximmunology. 2aProtein Kinasesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction1 aBoudsocq, Marie1 aSheen, Jen0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2011 Oct., v. 14, no. 5 p.519-529dElsevier Ltdx1369-52667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245014000216300001600356520137000372592002801742650001001770650001601780650001701796650001301813650001401826650001101840650001801851650001101869651002201880651002901902651001001931653001001941653001101951653001901962653002601981653000902007653001102016653001402027653001502041653001502056653001702071700003002088700007102118700002002189700006302209700003102272700003702303773011102340856008102451852000902532655001202541IND60604448820221118032039.0180717e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060444882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2015.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurillo-Barroso, Mercedes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2271-291X10aNew objects in old structures.

Not far off is the issue of the changing role of monuments in the making and maintaining of key cultural devices such as memory and identity. Addressing both these highly-debated issues from a science-based perspective, in this paper we look at an unusual case study set in southern Iberia and illustrate how these archaeological questions can benefit from robust materials-science approaches.We present the contextual, morphological and analytical study of an exceptional Early Iron Age hoard composed of a number of different (and mostly exotic) materials such as amber, quartz, silver and ceramic. This hoard, found under the fallen orthostat of a megalithic structure built at least 2000 years earlier, throws new light on long-distance exchange networks and the effect they could have had on the cultural identities and social relations of local Iberian Early Iron Age communities. Moreover, the archaeometric study reveals how diverse and distant the sources of these item are (Northern Europe to Eastern and Western Mediterranean raw materials, as well as local and eastern technologies), therefore raising questions concerning the social mechanisms used to establish change and resistance in contexts of colonial encounter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamber 3aarchaeology 3acase studies 3aceramics 3amonuments 3aquartz 3araw materials 3asilver 3aIberian Peninsula 3aNorthern European region 3aSpain 0aAmber 0aSilver 0aEarly Iron Age 0aMegalithic phenomenon 0aFTIR 0aICP-MS 0aSEM–EDS 0aProvenance 0aTechnology 0aColonisation1 aMartinón-Torres, Marcos,1 aGarcía Sanjuán, Leonardo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8404-92521 aWheatley, David1 aHunt Ortiz, Mark A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8783-69131 aForteza González, Matilde1 aHernández Arnedo, María Jesús0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2015 May, v. 57 p.322-334dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2015.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012800163300001600291520173500307592002802042650001602070650001702086650001602103650001402119650001102133650002002144650000902164650002602173650001302199650001802212650001802230650002402248650001102272650001302283650001302296651001402309651002802323651001902351651001402370653001002384653001602394653002202410653002302432653002002455700002702475700001902502700001902521773010002540856008102640852000902721655001202730IND60573130620180620000000.0180620e20170627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057313062DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2017-00732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKvach, Yuriy10aParasites as biological tags of divergence in Central European gudgeon populations (Actinopterygii: Cyprinidae: Gobioninae)  ap. 671-679.  aThe parasite communities of three gudgeon species (Gobio gobio, Romanogobio belingi and R. vladykovi) were studied in two widely-separated rivers in the Czech Republic (Central Europe), the Bílina River (North Sea drainage) and Velička River (Black Sea drainage). Of the 25 parasite taxa identified, 21 species parasitised G. gobio, 8 species R. belingi and 13 species R. vladykovi. Due to the absence of specialist parasites, differences in the parasite community were mainly determined by the ecological conditions prevalent at the locality, which resulted in an increased similarity between sympatric species rather than between allopatric populations of the same species, i.e. G. gobio. Discriminant analysis showed significant differences between the four gudgeon populations. Five parasite species had significant power to discriminate particular parasite communities: the autogenic ectoparasites Gyrodactylus gobiensis, G. markakulensis and Paradiplozoon homoion; the allogenic endoparasite Metorchis xanthosomus and the autogenic endoparasite Acanthocephalus anguillae. Only G. markakulensis occurred in both allopatric populations of G. gobio. Sympatric gudgeon populations were discriminated mainly by the presence of autogenic parasites, especially those with direct life cycles. Differences in parasite infection level between G. gobio and representatives of Romanogobio may reflect variance in diet and/or habitat use. Allopatric populations differed in the number of allogenic parasite species, which were more frequent in the Velička. Finally, the parasite community of R. belingi from the upper Elbe basin was characterised by a lack of gudgeon specific parasites, possibly supporting its non-indigenous status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGobio gobio 3aGyrodactylus 3aRomanogobio 3aallopatry 3abasins 3abiological tags 3adiet 3adiscriminant analysis 3adrainage 3aectoparasites 3aendoparasites 3ahabitat preferences 3arivers 3asympatry 3avariance 3aBlack Sea 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic 3aNorth Sea 0aGobio 0aRomanogobio 0asympatric species 0aparasite community 0abiological tags1 aOndračková, Markéta1 aBryjová, Anna1 aJurajda, Pavel0 tBiológia.g2017 June 27, v. 72, no. 6 p.671-679dDe GruyterwJournal:jnl34824x1336-95637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2017-00733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245017500167300001800342520148500360592002801845650001901873650002001892650001501912650004301927650001101970650001401981650001701995650001702012700002502029700002502054700003802079700003202117700002902149773012902178856007502307852000902382655001202391IND60657892520221119030929.0190823e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065789252DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay01709b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaia, Ana Luiza Chaves10aDevelopment and validation of high performance liquid chromatographic and derivative spectrophotometric methods for determination of gadodiamide in liposomal formulations  ap. 8315-8325.  aGadodiamide is a complex of gadolinium (Gd), whose structure presents two carboxylate groups of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) substituted by two amide groups (BMA). The use of liposomes as carriers of gadodiamide (Gd–DTPA–BMA) has shown great potential for cancer therapy. In this study, two methods using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) without derivatization and derivative spectrophotometry (DSUV) were developed and validated for determination of Gd–DTPA–BMA in liposomes. No interference was observed by using the HPLC method. Also, the third-order derivative has eliminated the interference from the lipid formulations. The methods have shown to be selective, precise, accurate, and linear in the range of 0.1–0.5 μmol mL⁻¹ for HPLC and 25–285 μmol mL⁻¹ for DSUV. The limits of quantification were 3.50 × 10⁻² μmol mL⁻¹ for HPLC and 18.33 μmol mL⁻¹ for DSUV, while the limits of detection were 2.02 × 10⁻² μmol mL⁻¹ and 12.42 μmol mL⁻¹ for HPLC and DSUV, respectively. Both methods were employed to determine the concentrations of Gd–DTPA–BMA entrapment in three liposomal formulations with different characteristics. No significant difference was found between the results obtained by the developed methods. HPLC and DSUV methods presented advantages over existing methodologies, such as simplicity, speed, low cost, and applicability to the characterization of liposomes containing Gd–DTPA–BMA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3agadolinium 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alipids 3aneoplasms 3aspectroscopy 3atherapeutics1 aFernandes, Christian1 aSilva, Taízia Dutra1 aPereira de Oliveira, Cynthia Nara1 aSilveira, Josianne Nicácio1 aRamaldes, Gilson Andrade0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Sept. 24, v. 7, no. 19 p.8315-8325dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay01709b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245016400211520172500375592002802100650002302128650001702151650001902168650002502187650001902212650002002231650001602251651001102267653003002278653002502308653002902333653001602362653002502378700005602403700002102459700001602480700005602496773011202552856008502664852000902749655001202758IND60766052520221120144552.0220531e20220405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076605252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1203102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathinam, Karthik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2767-931910aSurface grafting with diverse charged chemical groups mitigates calcium phosphate scaling on reverse osmosis membranes during municipal wastewater desalination  aCalcium phosphate scaling on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes during the desalination of municipal wastewater remains a major problem. This study modified RO membranes by graft polymerization using hydrophilic methacrylate monomers to reduce scaling and investigated the effects of surface charge and exposed functional groups on scaling during municipal wastewater desalination. Grafting was performed using negatively charged, neutral, positively charged, and mixed charge monomers. Testing the modified membranes during RO desalination of a solution simulating treated domestic wastewater effluents from the Shafdan wastewater reclamation plant in Israel revealed improved antiscaling performance by grafted membranes compared with the pristine (unmodified) membrane. In particular, membranes grafted using neutral and mixed charge monomers showed the best antiscaling tendencies: 25.6% and 27.6% decrease in flux, respectively, compared with a 59.1% decrease using the pristine membrane. These results, together with physico-chemical characterization, suggested that calcium phosphate precipitation and scaling on the grafted RO membranes are driven mainly by electrostatic and dipole–dipole interactions between charged chemical groups exposed on the membrane surface and ionic species in the test solution; these interactions are minimized in membranes grafted with neutral or mixed charge poly (methacrylate) groups, resulting in enhanced antiscaling performance. This study provides insight into the antiscaling mechanisms of hydrophilic poly (methacrylate) chains grafted on RO membranes, and thus can potentially aid efforts to mitigate calcium phosphate scaling during RO desalination of municipal wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium phosphates 3adesalination 3ahydrophilicity 3amunicipal wastewater 3apolymerization 3areverse osmosis 3awater reuse 3aIsrael 0aCalcium phosphate scaling 0aMunicipal wastewater 0aReverse osmosis membrane 0aAntiscaling 0aGraft polymerization1 aModi, Akshay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0885-68371 aSchwahn, Dietmar1 aOren, Yoram1 aKasher, Roni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6429-95530 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Apr. 05, v. 647 p.120310-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1203103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04700naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002100188245015600209300001100365506007600376520240900452592002802861596005102889506003702940650003402977650001503011650002703026650001903053650000903072650002503081650001603106650002903122650001603151650002603167650002503193650001703218650001603235650001303251650001803264650001503282650001803297650001003315650001503325650001903340650002403359650001103383650001203394650001303406650002303419650003703442650001303479650002503492650000903517650001303526650001403539650001303553650001603566650001803582650001503600651001003615700002903625700002803654700002003682700002003702773012903722856008203851852000903933655001203942IND60548506620221207050754.0220927e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054850662DNAL7 aPMC47288282pmcid7 a268176012pmid7 a10.1186/s12906-016-1014-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLagnika, Latifou10aAntimicrobial, antioxidant, toxicity and phytochemical assessment of extracts from Acmella uliginosa, a leafy-vegetable consumed in Bénin, West Africa  ap. 34.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Acmella uliginosa (Asteraceae) is a flowering plant whose leaves are consumed as a vegetable in Benin. They are also traditionally used as an antibiotic in the treatment of infectious diseases. To evaluate the therapeutic potential and toxicity effect of this leafy-vegetable, the antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant activities and, toxicity and phytochemical constituents were investigated. METHODS: Dichloromethane, methanol and aqueous extracts of Acmella uliginosa were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against six bacterial and six fungi strains. Antibacterial and antifungal activities were investigated by microdilution method and agar diffusion method respectively. Antioxidant activity was assessed using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl assay and phytochemical screening was carried out using standard procedures. Finally, oral acute toxicity at a dose of 2000 mg/kg was done according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guideline n° 423. RESULTS: The antibacterial activity was broad spectrum, inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 0.625 to 5 mg/ml. The antifungal evaluation show that all the extracts inhibited mycelial growth and sporulation of fungi with percentages of inhibition ranging from 9.39 to 75.67 % and 22.04 to 99.77 %, respectively. In DPPH radical scavenging assay, the effect on reducing free radicals increased in a dose dependent manner. The percentage of inhibition of DPPH ranged from 0.94 to 73.07 %. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of coumarin, flavonoid, naphtoquinone, anthracene derivative, saponin, lignan, triterpene and tannin. The dichloromethane and methanol extracts showed the best biological activities; they were also shown as the best extraction solvents of phytochemicals. In the acute toxicity evaluation, all animals were physically active and no deaths of rats were observed during the test. However, the aqueous extract promoted biochemical, hematological and histopathological alterations of treated rats at 2000 mg/kg body weight. CONCLUSION: A. uliginosa extracts contains antimicrobial, antioxidant agents and was not lethal for rats when ingested. However, according to the results obtained for biochemical, hematological, and histopathological analysis, caution is required regarding its consumption.  aPublisher supplied data  aF/5673-1cInternational Foundation for Science0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAsteraceae 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aacute toxicity 3aagar 3aalternative medicine 3aanthracenes 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abody weight 3acoumarin 3adose response 3aflavonoids 3afree radicals 3afungi 3aguidelines 3ahistopathology 3ainfectious diseases 3aleaves 3alignans 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amycelium 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3arats 3asaponins 3ascreening 3asolvents 3asporulation 3atriterpenoids 3avegetables 3aBenin1 aAmoussa, Abdou Madjid O.1 aAdjileye, Rafatou A.

Thus, batch and column experiments were performed to investigate hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] removal from solution and porous media using nanoscale zerovalent iron nanoparticles (NZVI) stabilized by sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Batch experiments indicated that the mass ratio of Fe/CMC = 1, the presence of 150–200 mg L⁻¹ CMC and lower ionic strength led to optimum Cr (VI) removal in aqueous solution. Column experiments demonstrated that Cr (VI) removal was enhanced with decreasing solution pH and increasing CMC-NZVI concentration. The presence of CMC can increase Cr (VI) removal by NZVI in both aqueous solution and porous media by complexation precipitation of Cr (VI) compounds and better dispersion of NZVI. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that an appropriate amount of CMC supported the redox reaction of Cr (VI) and NZVI. The removal of Cr (VI) through columns was 20.8% and 88.5% under no additional CMC and optimized CMC content, respectively. However, Cr (VI) removal decreased to 64.6% under excessive CMC content. The CMC modified NZVI nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, XPS and TEM techniques. These findings imply that CMC can be used as an effective stabilizer on NZVI which can in turn be applied for the efficient removal of Cr (VI) from industrial wastewater and groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achromium 3aenvironmental management 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3aindustrial wastewater 3aionic strength 3apH 3aredox reactions 3astabilizers 0aCarboxymethyl cellulose 0aIron nanoparticles 0aHexavalent chromium 0aTextural characterization 0aColumn and batch setup1 aGuo, Juntao1 aMuhammad, Yaseen1 aLi, Qingrui1 aLü, Zhiwei,1 aYun, Jinhu1 aLiang, Yan0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 276 p.111245-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245015700173300001600330520119000346592002801536650001201564650002401576650002501600650001301625650002501638650001201663650001401675650001101689650002201700650001101722651001201733653001201745653001501757653001101772653001101783653002501794700002301819700001801842700002201860773010001882856008101982852000902063655001202072IND60573130820180620000000.0180620e20170627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057313082DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2017-00752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzmatona-Túri, Tünde14aThe effect of grassland management on diversity and composition of ground-dwelling spider assemblages in the Mátra Landscape Protection Area of Hungary  ap. 642-651.  aThe main objective of this paper is to report the effect of shrub removal and mowing on the diversity and composition of ground-dwelling spider assemblages in Natura 2000 habitats of Mátra Mountains. We found significant effects of shrub removal and mowing on spider communities. Diversity decreased in the year following shrub removal but increased in the following years. Spider diversity in the final year decreased due to the lack of additional treatments. During our study the hay meadows were the most diverse habitats compared to control shrubs and treated shrubs. Treatments caused changes in community structure: the highest number of generalist species was observed in the treated shrubs, and the highest density of rare and protected species in the hay meadows. The high species turnover observed between hay meadows and control shrubs reflects the importance of grassland management. We conclude that shrub removal an effective grassland management action to increase spiders diversity in Natura 2000 habitats. Finally, treated shrubs require additional treatments such as mowing to ensure the spider communities inhabiting them are as diverse as those inhabiting meadows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3acommunity structure 3agrassland management 3ahabitats 3alandscape management 3ameadows 3amountains 3amowing 3aprotected species 3ashrubs 3aHungary 0aAraneae 0agrasslands 0ashrubs 0aEurope 0aNatura 2000 habitats1 aVona-Túri, Diána1 aMagos, Gábor1 aUrbán, László,0 tBiológia.g2017 June 27, v. 72, no. 6 p.642-651dDe GruyterwJournal:jnl34824x1336-95637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2017-00753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245007600174300001400250520204000264592002802304650002402332650001702356650001502373650001802388650001302406650001602419650002202435650001402457650002002471650001302491650002302504650002102527650001402548650001302562650001902575650001202594650002402606650000902630700002002639700002002659700002102679773011602700856008202816852000902898655001202907IND60563071420170926000000.0170211e20170112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056307142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b106252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharjee, Nicholus10aCatalytic Mechanism of Peptidoglycan Deacetylase: A Computational Study  ap. 89-99.  aBacterial peptidoglycan deacetylase enzymes are potentially important targets for the design of new drugs. In pathogenic bacteria, they modify cell-wall peptidoglycan by removing the acetyl group, which makes the bacteria more resistant to the host’s immune response and other forms of attack, such as degradation by lysozyme. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of reaction of acetyl removal from a model substrate, the N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylmuramic acid dimer, by peptidogylcan deacetylase from Helicobacter pylori. For this, we employed a range of computational approaches, including molecular docking, Poisson–Boltzmann electrostatic pKₐ calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and hybrid quantum chemical/molecular mechanical potential calculations, in conjunction with reaction-path-finding algorithms. The active site of this enzyme is in a region of highly negative electrostatic potential and contains a zinc dication with a bound water molecule. In the docked enzyme–substrate complex, our pKₐ calculations indicate that in the most stable protonation states of the active site the zinc-bound water molecule is in its hydroxide form and that the adjacent histidine residue, His247, is doubly protonated. In addition, there are one or two excess protons, with the neighboring aspartate residues, Asp12 and/or Asp199, being protonated. Overall, we find five classes of feasible reaction mechanisms, with the favored mechanism depending heavily on the protonation state of the active site. In the major one-excess-proton form, the mechanism with the lowest barrier (84 kJ mol–¹) involves an initial protonation of the substrate nitrogen, followed by nucleophilic attack of the zinc-bound hydroxide and rupture of the substrate’s carbon–nitrogen bond. However, in the minor two-excess-proton form, four mechanisms are almost equienergetic (83–86 kJ mol–¹), comprising both those that start with nitrogen protonation and those in which nucleophilic attack by hydroxide occurs first.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aactive sites 3aalgorithms 3aaspartic acid 3abacteria 3abound water 3aenzyme substrates 3ahistidine 3aimmune response 3alysozyme 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3anew drugs 3anitrogen 3apeptidoglycans 3aprotons 3areaction mechanisms 3azinc1 aFeliks, Mikolaj1 aShaik, Md Munan1 aField, Martin J.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 121, no. 1 p.89-99dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b106253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245009300177300001600270500002000286520118700306592002801493650001201521650002801533650001901561650002301580650001701603650001701620650002301637650002201660650002601682650001401708650001701722650001101739651001001750700002401760700001801784700002901802773011401831852000901945856008901954655001202043IND2327398720221118230257.0210417e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232739872DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00394.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreuzwieser, Jürgen10aElevated atmospheric CO2 causes seasonal changes in carbonyl emissions from Quercus ilex  ap. 327-333.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• The effect of elevated atmospheric CO₂ on the carbonyl emissions of leaves from two Mediterranean oak species (Quercus ilex and Q. pubescens) was analyzed under field conditions. • Physiological and meteorological parameters were determined in parallel with measurements of carbonyl emissions. Gas exchange was quantified in dynamic cuvettes combined with an infrared gas analyzer. • Acetaldehyde and acetone emissions from leaves of Q. ilex were enhanced by elevated CO₂ in the autumn (from 14–40 nmol m⁻² min⁻¹ and from 2–8 nmol m⁻² min⁻¹, respectively), but not in the summer. No significant effects were found for leaves of Q. pubescens. The effects of CO₂ on Q. ilex were mainly a result of decreased emissions by control trees under ambient CO₂ concentrations in the autumn; emissions from trees exposed to elevated CO₂ remained at a high level. • Elevated atmospheric CO₂ causes autumnal changes in carbonyl emissions from Quercus ilex. These effects suggest that the production of acetaldehyde and acetone depend on developmental factors. It is not yet clear whether the altered carbonyl emissions are a unique feature of Q. ilex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3ainterspecific variation 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonyl compounds 3agas exchange 3aacetaldehyde 3aseasonal variation 3aQuercus pubescens 3afield experimentation 3aemissions 3aQuercus ilex 3aleaves 3aItaly1 aCojocariu, Cristian1 aJüssen, Vera1 aRennenberg, H.q(Heinz),0 tnew phytologist.g2002 May, v. 154, no. 2 p.327-333dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00394.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02328naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011100168300001800279520108200297592002801379650001201407650001401419650001101433650002401444650001501468650004401483650001301527650001901540700001601559700002001575700002101595700001801616700001501634700002001649700001801669773011701687856008201804990002301886852000901909655001201918IND60091118620221123014457.0141103e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009111862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jin-Xiang10aSynthesis, characterization and potent DNA-cleaving activity of copper(II)-complexed berberine carboxylate  ap. 7056-7059.  a9-O-(4-carboxybenzyl)berberine (CBB) 1 was synthesized from the reaction of berberrubine with methyl 4-(bromomethyl)benzoate and subsequent hydrolysis. Its Cu(II) complex 2 was prepared from the reaction with Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O, and established as [Cu(CBB)₂](NO₃)₂·2H₂O by means of ¹H NMR, UV, IR, elemental analysis and TGA measurements. Agarose gel electrophoresis study on the cleavage of plasmid pBR322 DNA indicated that complex 2 was capable of efficiently cleaving DNA under physiological conditions, most probably via an oxidative mechanistic pathway involving the formation of singlet oxygen as the reactive species. Kinetic assay afforded the maximal first-order rate constant kₘₐₓ of 2.41h⁻¹ and Michaelis constant KM of 2.64mM, respectively, representing ca. 10⁸-fold acceleration in the cleavage. This catalytic efficacy is attributed to the Cu(II)-assisted formation of dimeric species, in which the two berberine subunits cooperatively bind to DNA, whereas the carboxylate-coordinated Cu(II) moiety functions as the cleavage-active center.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3aberberine 3acopper 3agel electrophoresis 3ahydrolysis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplasmids 3asinglet oxygen1 aLin, Wei-Er1 aChen, Ming-Zhen1 aZhou, Chun-Qiong1 aLin, Yan-Ling1 aChen, Ming1 aJiang, Zhi-Hong1 aChen, Wen-Hua0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 22, no. 23 p.7056-7059dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0873Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007700167300001600244520071400260592002800974650001301002650001001015650001501025650001401040650001701054651001501071700002001086700002201106700002401128700002201152700002601174773009401200852000901294856008101303655001201384IND4399865920221116234920.0160903e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439986592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9023-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Darren C.

There are currently over 640 described species of freshwater crayfishes with an average of 5–10 species still being described each year. Freshwater crayfishes can serve as keystone species in aquatic habitats, but a few species are also significantly invasive and can cause impressive damage to the fragile freshwater habitat. Crayfishes inhabit caves, burrows, streams, lakes and strong burrowers can even be found in terrestrial habitats where they have burrowed to the water table or where rainfall is sufficiently abundant to provide the needed moisture. The freshwater crayfishes, like the habitats in which they are encountered, are generally endangered to some degree and conservation efforts would do well to focus on them as key elements of the freshwater ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstacidae 3aCambaridae 3aParastacidae 3aaquatic habitat 3aburrows 3acaves 3acenter of diversity 3acrayfish 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3akeystone species 3alakes 3arain 3astreams 3awater table 3aAntarctic region 3aAppalachian region 3aAustralia1 aBuhay, Jennifer E.0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 Jan., v. 595, no. 1 p.295-301dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9120-33Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03079naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245009500213300001800308520174300326592002802069650002502097650001902122650002402141650002002165650002102185650003502206650000902241650001602250650002902266650002602295700001802321700002002339700002102359700002902380773013202409856008402541990002302625852000902648655001202657IND60090096820221120053117.0141110e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009009682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.06.0302doi7 aPMC38356152pmcid7 a238459882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZscheppang, Katja10aErbB4 is an upstream regulator of TTF-1 fetal mouse lung type II cell development in vitro  ap. 2690-2702.  aTTF-1 is an important transcription factor in lung development and lung disease and is essential for lung cell differentiation, specifically surfactant protein (Sftp) expression. The molecular mechanisms that drive the expression and transcriptional control of TTF-1 are not fully understood. In the fetal lung, ErbB4 functions as a transcriptional co-factor and regulates the timely onset of fetal Sftp expression. We speculate that ErbB4 is an upstream regulator of TTF-1 and regulates Sftpb expression via this pathway in alveolar type II cells. Neuregulin-induced ErbB4 and TTF-1 signaling interactions were studied by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. Overexpression of ErbB4 and TTF-1 was analyzed in its effect on cell viability, Sftpb expression, TTF-1 expression, and Sftpb and TTF-1 promoter activity. The effect of ErbB4 deletion and ErbB4 nuclear translocation on TTF-1 expression was studied in primary fetal type II epithelial cells, isolated from transgenic HER4ʰᵉᵃʳᵗ⁽⁻/⁻⁾ mice. ErbB4 ligand neuregulin induces ErbB4 and TTF-1 co-precipitation and nuclear colocalization. Combined ErbB4 and TTF-1 overexpression inhibits cell viability, while promoting Sftpb expression more than single overexpression of each protein. NRG stimulates TTF-1 expression in ErbB4-overexpressing epithelial cells, while this effect is absent in ErbB4-depleted cells. In primary fetal type II cells, ErbB4 nuclear translocation is critical for its regulation of TTF-1-induced Sftpb upregulation. TTF-1 overexpression did not overcome this important requirement. We conclude that ErbB4 is a critical upstream regulator of TTF-1 in type II epithelial cells and that this interaction is important for Sftpb regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell differentiation 3acell viability 3aconfocal microscopy 3acoprecipitation 3aepithelial cells 3agenetically modified organisms 3amice 3asurfactants 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aGiese, Ulrike1 aHoenzke, Stefan1 aWiegel, Dorothea1 aDammann, Christiane E.L.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

Inner bark and outer sapwood released > 40% more CO₂ at treetops than at bases. Trends were robust for CO₂ production on a core dry‐mass, volume, or total carbon basis. By contrast, CO₂ production on a nitrogen basis showed almost no significant variation. • This in vitro technique provided an effective index for relative differences in respiration within tree stems. Discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo measurements might be related to the gaseous environment in stems. The estimated within‐stem gradients in respiration were possibly determined by enzyme quantity and availability and could be useful in scaling to whole‐trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3agas production (biological) 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3astems 3ameasurement 3aspatial variation 3abark 3asapwood 3acarbon dioxide 3avolume 3acarbon 3anitrogen 3aOregon1 aGartner, Barbara L.1 aHarmon, Mark E.0 tnew phytologist.g2002 May, v. 154, no. 2 p.359-372dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00380.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02364naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014400163520118100307592002801488650001101516650002301527650001301550650001301563650001601576650001801592653001901610653002301629653003501652700001701687700005601704700001701760700001901777773011201796856008501908852000901993655001202002IND60766053120221120144444.0220307e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076605312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1203282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Rui10aUnderstanding the mechanism of nitrogen transport in the perfluorinated sulfonic-acid hydrated membranes via molecular dynamics simulations  aIn perfluorinated proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), the diffusion of inert nitrogen across the membranes can lead to its accumulation at the anode, which will lead to the failure of the cells. However, such a diffusion mechanism has not been clarified up to now. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the effect of water content and equivalent weight (EW) value on the diffusion of nitrogen molecules in perfluorinated sulfonic-acid (PFSA) hydrated membranes. It is found that the nitrogen molecules tend to distribute in the polymer phase and show the restricted regional motion at relatively low water content. However, with the increase of water content and the decrease of the EW value, the distribution and movement of nitrogen molecules show completely different behaviors. Nitrogen molecules are forced to migrate to the polymer/water interface and have a higher probability to diffuse along the water clusters. Meanwhile, the diffusion of nitrogen molecules is promoted and they show a jump-like motion. This study provides a fundamental and comprehensive understanding of nitrogen transport in PFSA hydrated membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3amolecular dynamics 3anitrogen 3apolymers 3aprobability 3awater content 0aPFSA membranes 0aNitrogen transport 0aMolecular dynamics simulations1 aLi, Shanlong1 aYu, Chunyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1175-83621 aWang, Yuling1 aZhou, Yongfeng0 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 648 p.120328-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1203283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010000171300001800271520100600289592002801295650001301323650001201336650000901348650001101357650001301368650003101381650003701412650002101449650001601470650001601486700002301502700002501525700001601550700001901566773011701585856008201702990002301784852000901807655001201816IND60091119020221123024131.0141103e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009111902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibata, Yoshihiro10aDesign, synthesis and evaluation of novel zwitterionic compounds as PPARα/γ dual agonists (1)  ap. 7075-7079.  aWe describe here the design, syntheses and structure–activity relationships (SAR) of novel zwitterionic compounds as non-thiazolidinedion (TZD) based peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) α/γ dual agonists. We commenced the medicinal research with compound 1 originated by Eli Lilly, which was reported to possess PPAR α/γ dual agonist activity. We incorporated an amine linker and optimized it on the nitrogen of the linker, thereby envisioning the enhancement of the PPAR α/γ dual agonist activity together with altering the physicochemical properties. As a result, we could generate compounds showing the PPAR α/γ dual activity, especially among which compound 22e had a franylmethyl group on the linker and 2,6-dimethyl phenyl ring at the carboxylic acid head group furnishing a highly potent dual agonist activity, together with a great glucose lowering effect. Moreover, it remedied the lipid profile, that is, triglyceride without body weight gain in the db/db mice model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aglucose 3amice 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3astructure-activity relationships 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain 3azwitterions1 aKagechika, Katsuji1 aYamaguchi, Mitsuhiro1 aKubo, Hideo1 aUsui, Hiroyuki0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 22, no. 23 p.7075-7079dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0923Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013300162300001800295520133300313592002801646650002001674650002601694650001301720650001801733650001801751650002201769650001801791650004601809650001501855650001401870650001601884650001801900650001001918650000901928650001501937651001301952651001101965700002401976700002202000700002102022700002302043700002102066700002302087773012702110856007402237852000902311655001202320IND60657893220221119030620.0190816e20151008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065789322DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay01725d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasciotti, Maíra10aWood chemotaxonomy via ESI-MS profiles of phytochemical markers: the challenging case of African versus Brazilian mahogany woods  ap. 8576-8583.  aThe harvesting of Brazilian mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) is a main cause of the Brazilian Amazon deforestation and has been therefore prohibited. African mahogany (Khaya ivorensis) was then introduced for Amazon reforestation and the commercialization of such wood is legal, thus creating a challenging problem for wood certification. Herein we report that a wood chemotaxonomic method based on distinct profiles of phytochemical markers is able to promptly characterize both the native and foreign mahogany species. This challenging task has been performed via a simple, fast and unambiguous methodology using direct electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of a simple methanolic extract of a tiny wood chip. Typical limonoids such as khivorin, khayanolide A and mexicanolide for African mahogany and phragmalin-type limonoids for the native Brazilian species, as well as distinct polyphenols such as catechin derivatives and cinchonain, form the characteristic phytochemical marker pools for both species. This rapid methodology could therefore be used to monitor legal and illegal mahogany tree harvesting, and hence to control Amazon deforestation. It could also be applied to create a wood certification program for African and Brazilian mahogany trees, as well as for wood certification in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKhaya ivorensis 3aSwietenia macrophylla 3acatechin 3acertification 3achemotaxonomy 3acommercialization 3adeforestation 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aharvesting 3alimonoids 3apolyphenols 3areforestation 3atrees 3awood 3awood chips 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aAlberici, Rosana M.1 aCabral, Elaine C.1 aCunha, Valnei S.1 aSilva, Paulo R.

Diet modification is popular among gout patients due to known associations of certain foods with gout flares. The interplay of the use of dietary supplements, diet modification, and ULT adherence in gout patients is not known. Despite the recent interest in diet and supplements, there are limited data on their use. Our objective was to assess ULT use and adherence and patient preference for non-pharmacological interventions by patients with gout, using a cross-sectional survey. METHODS: People who self-reported physician-diagnosed gout during their visit to a gout website (http://gouteducation.org) were invited to participate in a brief anonymous cross-sectional Internet survey between 08/11/2014 to 04/14/2015 about the management of their gout. The survey queried ULT prescription, ULT adherence, the use of non-pharmacological interventions (cherry extract, diet modification) and the likelihood of making a lifelong diet modification for gout management. RESULTS: A total of 499 respondents with a mean age 56.3 years were included; 74 % were males and 74 % were White. Of these, 57 % (285/499) participants were prescribed a ULT for gout, of whom 88 % (251/285) were currently taking ULT. Of those using ULT, 78 % (97/251) reported ULT adherence >80 %. Gender, race, and age were not significantly associated with the likelihood of receiving a ULT prescription or ULT adherence >80 %. Fifty-six percent of patients with gout preferred ULT as a lifelong treatment for gout, 24 % preferred cherry extract and 16 % preferred diet modification (4 % preferred none). Men had significantly lower odds of preferring ULT as the lifelong treatment choice for gout vs. other choices (p = 0.03). We found that 38.3 % participants were highly motivated to make a lifelong dietary modification to improve their gout (score of 9–10 on a 0–10 likelihood scale). Older age was significantly associated with high level of willingness to modify diet (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: We found that only 57 % of gout patients reported being prescribed ULT. 40 % of gout patients preferred non- pharmacological interventions such as cherry extract and diet modification for gout management. The latter finding requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo numbercDivision of Rheumatology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the resources and use of facilities at the Birmingham VA Medical Center, Alabama, USA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aalternative medicine 3acherries 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3afoods 3agout 3ahealth care workers 3amales 3amen 3apatients 3asurveys1 aShah, Nipam1 aEdwards, N.

(Dung Moss): Second Report from the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia  ap. 10-14.  aThe dung moss Splachnum ampullaceum is reported from a high elevation pitch pine —— spruce——sphagnum wetland in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia. The only previous collection was made in 1968. This collection is the first to be included in state herbaria. The two collections (made in 1968 and 2005) were found growing on soil (presumably humified dung) in the Allegheny Front region (Spruce Knob and Red Creek Plains, respectively) in the Monongahela National Forest. The distance between the two sites was only 35 km (and 37 years). The abundantly fruiting plants, with conspicuous red setae (6––7 cm long) and two-tone capsules (yellow above, purple and swollen below), were overgrown by Sphagnum, as is typical for this ephemeral moss. Spores from two capsules were introduced onto peat pellets sprinkled with composted cow manure. Protonemata covered the pellets in three weeks and developed into a dense tuft (1.2 cm high after six months in culture) of bright green shoots that showed primarily vertical growth. This appeared to mimic the two-stage process in nature whereby a dung moss claims a dung pat: establishment phase of spreading protonemata and subsequent vertical vegetative phase. S. ampullaceum is a circumboreal-montane species that tends to have a scattered distribution. It evidently favors cool, moist conditions that retard decay of the dung, thereby allowing time for sporophyte maturation and fly-mediated spore dispersal to fresh dung. The best approach for conservation of this staterare species is to preserve high-elevation wetland habitat, particularly Sphagnum-dominated wetlands in the Allegheny Front.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSplachnum 0adung moss 0aAllegheny Front 0aWest Virginia1 aByers, Elizabeth A.0 tEvansia.g2007 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.10-14dThe American Bryological and Lichenological Societyx0747-98597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1639%2F0747-9859-24.1.103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012500169500001900294520140400313592002801717650001101745650003001756650001501786650001101801650003401812650002901846650001801875650001101893650000701904650001501911650002101926650001501947653001901962653001401981653002601995653002002021700001702041700001702058700002202075700002102097700001702118700001502135700002202150773013202172856008602304852000902390655001202399IND60709423520221120170152.0201230e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070942352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Minh Hang10aPerformance of mediator-less double chamber microbial fuel cell-based biosensor for measuring biological chemical oxygen  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently, the microbial fuel cell-based biosensor has been considered as an attractive technology for measuring wastewater quality such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). In this study, a mediator-less double compartment MFC based biosensor utilizing carbon felt as an anode electrode and inoculated with mixed culture was developed to improve the real application of a rapid BOD detection. This study aims to: (i) establish the effect of the operating conditions (i.e., pH, external resistance, fuel feeding rate) on MFC performance; (ii) investigate the correlation between biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and signal output, and (iii) evaluate the operational stability of the biosensor. The presented result reveals that the maximum current and power production was obtained while 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM Phosphate buffer saline was used as a catholyte solution, neutral pH condition of media and fuel feeding rate at 0.3 mL min⁻¹. Notably, a wider range of BOD concentration up to 300 mg L ⁻¹ can be obtained with the voltage output (R² > 0.9901). Stable and steady power was produced by running MFC in 30 days when cells operated at 1000 Ω external resistance. Our research has some competition with the previous double chamber MFC in the upper limit of BOD detection. This results might help to increase the real application of MFC based BOD biosensor in real-time measurement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3aelectric potential difference 3aenvironmental management 3amixed culture 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphosphates 3apower generation 3awastewater 0aBioelectricity 0aBiosensor 0aWastewater management 0aNafion membrane1 aNgo, Huu Hao1 aGuo, Wenshan1 aChang, Soon Woong1 aNguyen, Dinh Duc1 aDeng, Lijuan1 aChen, Zhuo1 aNguyen, Tien Vinh0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 276 p.111279-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001600171245010400187300001600291520077100307592002801078650002201106650002201128650001201150650001201162650002301174650001701197650002001214650001101234650001801245650001001263650002101273650001101294650001901305650001401324650003401338650002701372650003201399650001201431650005101443650001701494650003401511650003001545650002301575650002601598653002201624653002201646653003001668653001701698653001501715700001601730700001601746700001701762700001401779700001601793700001601809773010601825856008701931852000902018655001202027IND50060580620221119145943.0190409e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006058062DNAL7 a232196882pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.10.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Peng10aStarch saccharification and fermentation of uncooked sweet potato roots for fuel ethanol production  ap. 835-838.  aAn energy-saving ethanol fermentation technology was developed using uncooked fresh sweet potato as raw material. A mutant strain of Aspergillus niger isolated from mildewed sweet potato was used to produce abundant raw starch saccharification enzymes for treating uncooked sweet potato storage roots. The viscosity of the fermentation paste of uncooked sweet potato roots was lower than that of the cooked roots. The ethanol fermentation was carried out by Zymomonas mobilis, and 14.4g of ethanol (87.2% of the theoretical yield) was produced from 100g of fresh sweet potato storage roots. Based on this method, an energy-saving, high efficient and environment-friendly technology can be developed for large-scale production of fuel ethanol from sweet potato roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aZymomonas mobilis 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afuel production 3apastes 3araw materials 3aroots 3asaccharification 3astarch 3asweet potatoes 3aviscosity 2aAspergillus nigerxmetabolism 2aBiofuelsxmicrobiology 2aCarbohydratesxbiosynthesis 2aCooking 2aEthanolxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aIpomoea batatasxmicrobiology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aZymomonasxmetabolism 0aAspergillus niger 0aZymomonas mobilis 0aFuel ethanol fermentation 0aSweet potato 0aRaw starch1 aChen, Caifa1 aShen, Yanhu1 aDing, Tielin1 aMa, Daifu1 aHua, Zichun1 aSun, Dongxu0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Jan., v. 128 p.835-838dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.10.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013200172500002200304506010400326506007600430520090400506592002801410506003701438650002301475650001801498650001001516650002201526650001701548650002801565653001501593653001701608653001101625653001401636653001901650653001401669700002201683700002001705700002001725700002301745700002201768700002001790773011001810856004801920852000901968655001201977IND60795600920221207143703.0221004e20221002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079560092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2022.1052772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisa Clodoveo, Maria10aTowards a New Food Labelling System for Sustainable Food Production and Healthy Responsible Consumption: The Med Index Cheklist  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBy 2024, the European Commission will examine a new sustainable labeling framework.

It has been found to indeed improve life quality of chemotherapy patients and extensive used in clinical conbined with chemotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer.The aim of this study was to investigate the preventive effect of the immunotoxicity of SJZD on mitomycin C (MMC) and the metabolic mechanism of action.NMR and MS-based metabolomics approaches were combined for monitoring MMC-induced immunotoxicity and the protective effect of SJZD. Body weight change and mortality, histopathological observations and relative viscera weight determinations of spleen and thymus, sternum micronucleus assay and hematological analysis were used to confirm the immunotoxicity and attenuation effects. An OPLS-DA approach was used to screen potential biomarkers of immunotoxicity and the MetaboAnalyst and KEGG PATHWAY Database were used to investigate the metabolic pathways.8 biomarkers in plasma samples, 19 in urine samples and 10 in spleen samples were identified as being primarily involved in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism. The most critical pathway was alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism.The variations in biomarkers revealed the preventive effect of the immunotoxicity of SJZD on MMC and significant for speculating the possible metabolic mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aamino acid metabolism 3aaspartic acid 3abiomarkers 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3adatabases 3adigestive system diseases 3adrug therapy 3aglutamic acid 3ahematologic tests 3ahistopathology 3aimmunity 3aimmunotoxicity 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolomics 3amicronucleus tests 3amitomycin 3amonitoring 3amortality 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apatients 3aprotective effect 3arats 3aspleen 3asternum 3athymus gland 3atraditional medicine 3aurine 0aSJZD 0aMMC 0aNMR 0aUPLC-MS 0aOPLS-DA 0aEDTA 0aMN 0aWBC 0aRBC 0aLYM 0aPLT 0aMNIMEs 0aTICs 0aLPC 0aCTX 0aginsenoside Rg2 (PubChem CID: 75412551) 0aginsenoside Re (PubChem CID: 441921) 0aatractylenolide I (PubChem CID: 5321018) 0aatractylenolide II (PubChem CID: 14448070) 0aatractylenolide III (PubChem CID: 155948) 0aporicoic acid B (PubChem CID: 5471852) 0a16-deoxyporicoic acid B (PubChem CID: 16736458) 0aliquiritigenin (PubChem CID: 114829) 0agancaonin I (PubChem CID: 480777) 0aSijunzi decoction 0aMitomycin C 0aMetabolomics 0aImmunotoxicity 0a1H NMR 0aMS1 aWu, Juan1 aWang, Cancan1 aZhang, Fang1 aWang, Yinan1 aWang, Miao1 aZhao, Min1 aZhao, Chunjie0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 210 p.179-191dElsevier B.V.x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010300163300001800266520134300284592002801627650002301655650002501678650001301703650001101716650002101727650001201748650002201760650002101782650001401803650000901817650001601826650002201842650001801864700001901882700002301901700002001924700001901944773009501963856008102058852000902139655001202148IND60520743420221119070103.0160601e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052074342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-015-2449-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoo, Eloise14aThe role of strigolactones during plant interactions with the pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum  ap. 1387-1396.  aMAIN CONCLUSION : Strigolactones (SLs) do not influence spore germination or hyphal growth of Fusarium oxysporum. Mutant studies revealed no role for SLs but a role for ethylene signalling in defence against this pathogen in pea. Strigolactones (SLs) play important roles both inside the plant as a hormone and outside the plant as a rhizosphere signal in interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and parasitic weeds. What is less well understood is any potential role SLs may play in interactions with disease causing microbes such as pathogenic fungi. In this paper we investigate the influence of SLs on the hemibiotrophic pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. pisi both directly via their effects on fungal growth and inside the plant through the use of a mutant deficient in SL. Given that various stereoisomers of synthetic and naturally occuring SLs can display different biological activities, we used (+)-GR24, (−)-GR24 and the naturally occurring SL, (+)-strigol, as well as a racemic mixture of 5-deoxystrigol. As a positive control, we examined the influence of a plant mutant with altered ethylene signalling, ein2, on disease development. We found no evidence that SLs influence spore germination or hyphal growth of Fusarium oxysporum and that, while ethylene signalling influences pea susceptibility to this pathogen, SLs do not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3abioactive properties 3aethylene 3ahyphae 3amicrobial growth 3amutants 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aparasitic plants 3apathogens 3apeas 3arhizosphere 3aspore germination 3astereoisomers1 aBlake, Sara N.1 aFisher, Brendan J.1 aSmith, Jason A.1 aReid, James B.0 tPlanta.g2016 June, v. 243, no. 6 p.1387-1396dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2449-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012800170300001100298500001400309520156600323592002801889650001501917650001601932650001001948650003001958650001401988650001202002650001302014650001602027650001202043650001602055650002002071650001302091650001602104650001502120650001102135650001202146650001602158650002502174650001402199650001502213650000702228700002502235700002002260773011202280856008202392852000902474655001202483IND60712433020221118013828.0210216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071243302DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-019-9986-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVadla, Raghavendra10aCellular environment controls the dynamics of histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in response to DNA damage in mammalian cells  ap. 19.  aNAL-light  aEpigenetic changes play a crucial role in sensing signals and responding to fluctuations in the extracellular environment. How the cellular micro-environment affects DNA damage response signalling in chromatin context is not extensively studied. Histone acetylation is dynamic and very sensitive to changes in the extracellular environment. Existing literature on H3 lysine 56 acetylation (H3K56ac) levels upon DNA damage in mammals presents a conflicting picture. The occurrence of both increased and decreased H3K56ac upon DNA damage in our experiments led us to investigate the role of the micro-environment on H3K56ac. Here, we show that the global levels of H3K56ac increase as cells grow from low density to high density while SIRT1 and SIRT6 expression decrease. Additionally, rising lactic acid levels increase H3K56ac. Our results show that cell density and accumulation of metabolites affect dynamics of H3K56ac in response to DNA damage. Upon DNA damage, H3K56ac increases in low density cells with low initial acetylation, while acetylation decreases in high cell density cells. These results highlight that H3K56ac levels upon DNA damage are dependent on the metabolites in the extracellular milieu which impact chromatin structure by regulating chromatin modifying enzymes. Accumulation of lactic acid at high cell density reflects conditions similar to the tumour micro-environment. As H3K56ac increases in tumours, lactic acid and low pH might alter H3K56ac in tumours, leading to deregulated gene expression, contributing to tumour progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aacetylation 3acells 3acellular microenvironment 3achromatin 3adensity 3adynamics 3aenvironment 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3ahistones 3alactic acid 3aliterature 3alysine 3amammals 3ametabolites 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3aoccurrence 3apH1 aChatterjee, Nirupama1 aHaldar, Devyani0 tJournal of biosciences.g2020 Dec., v. 45, no. 1 p.19-19dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-019-9986-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012800169300001600297520152400313592002801837650002101865650003001886650001401916650001601930650002401946650004401970650002902014650001502043650002602058650003902084650001202123650002102135650002302156650000902179650001302188650000902201650001102210650001802221650002202239650001502261651001002276653002002286653004302306653002902349653002702378700001802405700001502423700001702438700001402455700001502469700001602484700001502500773010202515856008702617852000902704655001202713IND60531538420221118002106.0170719e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053153842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.1992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Linlin10aSnowmelt-driven changes in dissolved organic matter and bacterioplankton communities in the Heilongjiang watershed of China  ap. 242-251.  aBacterioplankton plays a significant role in the circulation of materials and ecosystem function in the biosphere. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from dead plant material and surface soil leaches into water bodies when snow melts. In our study, water samples from nine sampling sites along the Heilongjiang watershed were collected in February and June 2014 during which period snowmelt occurred. The goal of this study was to characterize changes in DOM and bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) associated with snowmelt, the effects of DOM, environmental and geographical factors on the distribution of BCC and interactions of aquatic bacterioplankton populations with different sources of DOM in the Heilongjiang watershed. BCC was measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DOM was measured by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Bacterioplankton exhibited a distinct seasonal change in community composition due to snowmelt at all sampling points except for EG. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that BCC was more closely related to DOM (Components 1 and 4, dissolved organic carbon, biochemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll a) and environmental factors (water temperature and nitrate nitrogen) than geographical factors. Furthermore, DOM had a greater impact on BCC than environmental factors (29.80 vs. 15.90% of the variation). Overall, spring snowmelt played an important role in altering the quality and quantity of DOM and BCC in the Heilongjiang watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterioplankton 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiosphere 3achlorophyll 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adissolved organic carbon 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amelting 3anitrate nitrogen 3aseasonal variation 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asoil 3aspring 3asurface water 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aSpring snowmelt 0aBacterioplankton community composition 0aDissolved organic matter 0aHeilongjiang watershed1 aCui, Hongyang1 aWu, Junqiu1 aWang, Baijie1 aZhao, Yue1 aLi, Jiming1 aJia, Liming1 aWei, Zimin0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 June 15, v. 556 p.242-251dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.1993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001800153245006500171300001400236520100200250592002801252650001001280650001301290650001101303650001501314650001001329650002301339650001301362700002201375700002001397773009601417856005601513852000901569655001201578IND4441182120221121180147.0120727e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444118212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2010.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFragkou, I.A.10aDiagnostic investigation of cases of deaths of newborn lambs  ap. 41-44.  aNeonatal lamb mortality, caused either by disorders of non-infectious aetiology or by pathological conditions of microbial or parasitic aetiology, is defined as the death of newborn lambs during the first 28 days of their life. Neonatal lamb mortality reduces significantly the productivity of sheep flocks. A realistic target for neonatal lamb mortality rate in a well-managed flock should be 3%; the upper acceptable limit under any circumstances should be 5%. Effective control of the various disorders requires timely and accurate diagnosis of the cause of mortality. Initially, management practices in the flock should be evaluated, as they can affect neonatal mortality rate. Then, appropriate clinical and pathological examinations should be performed; the age at which lambs had died should be determined. The paper summarises the steps to be taken when investigating deaths of newborn lambs, as well as providing some guidelines regarding identification of potential causes of the deaths.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3aetiology 3aflocks 3aguidelines 3alambs 3aneonatal mortality 3aneonates1 aMavrogianni, V.S.1 aFthenakis, G.C.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2010 Aug., v. 92, no. 1-3 p.41-44dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2010.04.013  aDNAL 7aarticle04071naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245007800170300001600248520246600264592002802730650001302758650001302771650001702784650002602801650001202827650001102839650001902850650002402869650001102893650002302904650001302927650001002940650002102950650001302971650000802984650001202992650001703004650001303021650001803034650001303052650001403065650000903079650001703088650001703105650002103122650001103143650001203154650001103166651001203177700001903189700001703208773015603225852000903381856009103390655001203481IND4367351220221118231522.0190713e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436735122DNAL7 a10.1023/B:FRES.0000048473.11362.632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDörsch, P.10aOverwinter greenhouse gas fluxes in two contrasting agricultural habitats  ap. 117-133.  aMid-day field fluxes of nitrous oxide (N₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) were measured during late winter/early spring in an arable field and an adjacent fallow in southern Germany. On the arable field, 2 dm high ridges, drawn as seed-beds for potato, were exposed to mild, partly diurnal freezing–thawing. Substantially elevated N₂O emission rates (6–750 µg N₂O-N m–² h–¹) were observed throughout the investigation period which coincided with freezing–thawing events in the surface soil (0–5 cm). Soil temperatures in the densely vegetated fallow were more isothermal due to an insulating snow/ice cover, resulting in much lower N₂O emission rates (0–57 µg N₂O-N m–² h–¹). CH₄ uptake rates were low in both habitats during soil frost (+2 to −7.5 µg CH₄-C m–² h–¹) but increased markedly in the fallow after spring thaw. Our data suggest that N₂O emission peaks may occur recurrently throughout the winter when soils are subjected to diurnal surface thawing. We concluded that microclimatic conditions strongly control N₂O winter loss, thus overriding ecosystem-level differences in off-season nutrient cycling. To further characterize winter-time nutrient cycling and habitat functioning in our sites, we determined NO₃– and NH₄⁺ contents, fumigation-extractable carbon (Cₘᵢc) and nitrogen (Nₘᵢc) and enumerated protozoa and nematoda throughout the investigation period. Cₘᵢc and microbial C:N ratios in the fallow were higher in winter than during the rest of the year as indicated by a 2-year study, reflecting favorable conditions for microbial C assimilation at low temperatures in the absence of freeze–thaw perturbation. In the arable soil, Cₘᵢc contents were significantly reduced during soil freezing but recovered quickly upon warming of the soil. Dynamics of Cₘᵢc in the arable soil were paralleled by protozoan biomass and transient shifts in functional composition of the nematode community, indicating that microfaunal predation played an important role in nutrient cycling after freeze–thaw perturbation. Only minor microfaunal dynamics were observed in the climatically more stable fallow, essentially confirming the absence of perturbation at this site. Our findings provide strong evidence that overwinter N₂O formation is regulated by both the physical freeze–thaw susceptibility of the soil and the ecological functioning of the habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aProtozoa 3aarable soils 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aecological function 3afallow 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3afrost 3agreenhouse gases 3ahabitats 3aice 3amethane 3amicroclimate 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apotatoes 3apredation 3asnow 3asoil ecology 3asoil heating 3asoil temperature 3aspring 3athawing 3awinter 3aGermany1 aPalojärvi, A.1 aMommertz, S.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2004 Oct., v. 70, no. 2 p.117-133dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl55283x1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:FRES.0000048473.11362.633Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03556naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245012200210300001600332520198800348592002802336650002102364650002302385650001302408650002102421650001602442650002002458650001102478650001902489650001402508650001002522650001002532650002502542650001602567650001602583650001002599651001402609651002102623651001102644651001202655651001002667651001102677651001002688653001902698653001602717653001802733653002002751653001602771700001702787773010202804856008702906852000902993655001203002IND60531538520221118002117.0170719e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053153852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.2002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRayne, Sierra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9094-090910aRapidly changing climatic conditions for wine grape growing in the Okanagan Valley region of British Columbia, Canada  ap. 169-178.  aA statistical analysis was conducted on long-term climate records for sites bordering Okanagan Lake in the Okanagan Valley viticultural region of British Columbia, Canada. Average wine grape growing season temperatures are increasing rapidly in the area over the post-1980 period at rates upwards of 7.0±1.3°C/century. Similar increases in the average dormant season temperature are evident. These temperature changes are likely some of the most extreme observed among the world's wine producing areas during the past few decades. Growing degree day base 10°C (GDD10) has increased by nearly 50% at some locations since the 1970s, resulting in major impacts on the corresponding climate classification for viticulture. If current climate trends continue, the southern and central portions of the region will likely enter Winkler region II within the next few decades, placing them in the same category as well-established warmer wine regions from France, Spain, Italy, and Australia. The large dormant season temperature increases over the last several decades have resulted in the area no longer being a cold season outlier when compared to most other cool-climate viticultural areas. Based on average growing season temperatures, the southern end of Okanagan Lake has moved out of the cool-climate viticultural classification and into the intermediate zone, while the central and northern regions are now at the cool/intermediate viticulture interface, similar to the historical positions of the Rhine Valley in Germany, northern Oregon in the United States, and the Loire Valley, Burgundy-Cote, Burgundy-Beaujolais, and Champagne appelations of France. The corresponding suitable grape species for the area have evolved into warmer region varietals during this time frame, having substantial economic impacts on producers. Increased temperatures are also expected to bring greater threats from agricultural pests, notably Pierce's disease from the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPierce's disease 3aXylella fastidiosa 3abacteria 3aclimatic factors 3acold season 3aeconomic impact 3agrapes 3agrowing season 3aheat sums 3alakes 3apests 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3aviticulture 3awines 3aAustralia 3aBritish Columbia 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aOregon 3aSpain 0aClimate change 0aViticulture 0aGrape growing 0aWine production 0aAgriculture1 aForest, Kaya0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 June 15, v. 556 p.169-178dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.2003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04488naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245014100181300001600322520259500338592002802933650002602961650001402987650001403001650001103015650001603026650002503042650001803067650002403085650001303109650001103122650001903133650001403152650002203166650001203188650004303200650002503243650001503268650002603283650001203309650001303321650001603334650001303350650001903363650001103382650002703393650001403420650004803434650001603482650001103498653001603509653001303525653003103538653001903569700002603588700002003614773011803634856008903752852000903841655001203850IND60585446620221122021115.0190403e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058544662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2017.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, Ninfa Rangel12aA multienzyme NSP product solubilises and degrades NSP structures in canola and mediates protein solubilisation and degradation in vitro  ap. 244-252.  aTo conclusively assess the value enhancing effect of enzymes targeting antinutritional non–starch polysaccharides in a specific feed source, in depth understanding of the substrate is required, to use the right enzyme for the relevant polysaccharides. In the current study a commercial non-starch polysaccharide multienzyme product obtained by submerged fermentation of Aspergillus aculeatus was supplemented to canola non-starch polysaccharides. The enzyme effects studied included substrate viscosity reduction and solubilisation of non-starch polysaccharides and crude protein as well as peptide cleavage. Results were compared with the effects obtained by a monocomponent protease and a combination of protease and the multienzyme product. Viscosity reduction of solutions of xyloglucan and galactomannan solution clearly showed the presence of xyloglucanase and galactomannan activity in the product. On enzyme supplementation, there was an increase (P<0.05) in the solubilisation of rhamnose, fucose, arabinose, xylose, galactose and glucose non-starch polysaccharide residues. In a separate experiment using a different measuring system (HPLC) the product was also shown to solubilise galacturonic acid from canola meal. Highest concentrations of solubilised crude protein and peptides measured by combining the protease and the multienzyme product together.Antibodies (LM25, LM19 and LM 6) targeting different cell wall components were used in microscopy studies. Monoclonal antibody LM25, directed towards xyloglucan, bound abundantly to the intercellular spaces on the cytoplasmic side of the cell wall lining. On enzyme treatment with the multienzyme product the LM25 binding disappeared, indicating a reduction of xyloglucans as also was observed in a polysaccharide analysis of enzyme incubated canola meal.Monoclonal antibody LM19 recognizes de-esterified homogalacturonan epitopes in pectin also bound to the uronic acid residues in canola meal. The LM 19 signal was weak in samples treated only with buffer, but became stronger when the xyloglucan layer was removed by a purified experimental xyloglucanase.Monoclonal antibody LM6, directed towards arabinan, also became more visible in canola meal after the removal of the xyloglucan layer by the experimental xyloglucanase.Treatment with the commercial non starch polysaccharide multienzyme product resulted in degradation of arabinan and thereby also a disappearance of the LM6 signal. Both the pectin and the arabinan signal were visible mainly/only after removal of the xyloglucan layer in both the seed and the meal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus aculeatus 3aarabinans 3aarabinose 3acanola 3acanola meal 3acell wall components 3acrude protein 3aenzymatic treatment 3aepitopes 3afucose 3agalactomannans 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aintercellular spaces 3amicroscopy 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apectins 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3arhamnose 3asolubilization 3astarch 3asubmerged fermentation 3aviscosity 3axyloglucan-specific endo-beta-1,4-glucanase 3axyloglucans 3axylose 0aMultienzyme 0aProtease 0aNon-starch polysaccharides 0aSolubilisation1 aRavn, Jonas Laukonnen1 aPettersson, Dan0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2017 Dec., v. 234 p.244-252dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2017.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009100165500001900256520132400275592002801599650001301627650001501640650002301655650001301678650001601691650001501707650001401722700001901736700001901755700002501774773012201799856008001921852000902001655001202010IND60729162620221122164939.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916262DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110202872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorno, Matteo 10aAdaptive Ultrasound-Based Tractor Localization for Semi-Autonomous Vineyard Operations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAutonomous driving is greatly impacting intensive and precise agriculture. Matter-of-factly, the first commercial applications of autonomous driving were in autonomous navigation of agricultural tractors in open fields. As the technology improves, the possibility of using autonomous or semi-autonomous tractors in orchards and vineyards is becoming commercially profitable. These scenarios offer more challenges as the vehicle needs to position itself with respect to a more cluttered environment. This paper presents an adaptive localization system for (semi-) autonomous navigation of agricultural tractors in vineyards that is based on ultrasonic automotive sensors. The system estimates the distance from the left vineyard row and the incidence angle. The paper shows that a single tuning of the localization algorithm does not provide robust performance in all vegetation scenarios. We solve this issue by implementing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and by introducing an adaptive data selection stage that automatically adapts to the vegetation conditions and discards invalid measurements. An extensive experimental campaign validates the main features of the localization algorithm. In particular, we show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the distance is 16 cm, while the angular RMSE is 2.6 degrees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aalgorithms 3aangle of incidence 3atractors 3aultrasonics 3avegetation 3avineyards1 aFurioli, Sara 1 aCesana, Paolo 1 aSavaresi, Sergio M.,0 tAgronomy.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110202873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245013000162300001600292506002800308520154400336592002801880506003701908650002201945650001201967650002201979650001802001650001002019650001002029650002202039650001302061650001802074650000902092650001202101650001302113650002102126650001702147650001102164650002502175650000902200650001502209700002802224773013502252856008002387852000902467655001202476IND60785294420221207134634.0150830e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078529442DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha.43.1.98152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aADAK, Nafiye10aEffect of Planting Systems and Growing Media on Earliness, Yield and Quality of Strawberry Cultivation under Soilless Culture  ap. 204-209.  aResource is Open Access  a<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Garamond Premr Pro',serif; color: black">Soilless growing is becoming an attractive option because of the contamination of agricultural land due to the use of excessive fertilisers and insecticides to get higher productivity per unit area and the yield advantage with soilless culture getting more yield per unit area than the conventional growing.&nbsp; Effects of two planting systems and various growing media on earliness, yield and quality (colour L, C, h<sup>o</sup>, the rupture of calyx, firmness, total soluble solid, acidity and vitamin C) in strawberry<i> </i>(<i>Fragaria × ananassa </i>Duch.) cultivation under soilless culture was studied.

Results showed that fall planting system was favourable in terms of earliness but summer planting gave better results in terms of total yield. Moreover, the first harvest of summer planting was February, whereas the first harvest of the fall planting was in December. Early yield in the fall planting comprised 36.0% of the total yield. The Co and the Co+Vlc media were more favourable than other media with regard to yield, earliness and fruit quality. In addition vegetation period was found from January to May and it was observed that as the total soluble solids values increased in fruits, acidity and vitamin C values decreased.</span></p></body>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFragaria ananassa 3aacidity 3aagricultural land 3aascorbic acid 3acalyx 3acolor 3aearly development 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3apeat 3aperlite 3aplanting 3asoilless culture 3astrawberries 3asummer 3atotal soluble solids 3atuff 3avegetation1 aGübbük, H.q(Hamide),0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2015 Apr., v. 43, no. 1 p.204-209dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha.43.1.98153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04801naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012200169300001100291520182100302592002802123596005902151596005902210596005902269596008302328596008302411596006502494596006402559596006502623596006502688596006502753596006502818596006502883596009802948596004403046596004403090596004403134596004403178596004403222596004403266596007403310596004703384596004703431596007003478596007603548650001903624650001503643650001103658650001103669650002903680700001803709700001703727700001903744700002203763700002203785700002003807700001903827700001703846700001603863700001603879700001503895773010103910856008304011852000904094655001204103IND60772661720221119084938.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077266172DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-022-02654-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Connie L.10aCell type determination for cardiac differentiation occurs soon after seeding of human-induced pluripotent stem cells  ap. 90.  aBACKGROUND: Cardiac differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells consistently produces a mixed population of cardiomyocytes and non-cardiac cell types, even when using well-characterized protocols. We sought to determine whether different cell types might result from intrinsic differences in hiPS cells prior to the onset of differentiation. RESULTS: By associating individual differentiated cells that share a common hiPS cell precursor, we tested whether expression variability is predetermined from the hiPS cell state. In a single experiment, cells that shared a progenitor were more transcriptionally similar to each other than to other cells in the differentiated population. However, when the same hiPS cells were differentiated in parallel, we did not observe high transcriptional similarity across differentiations. Additionally, we found that substantial cell death occurs during differentiation in a manner that suggested all cells were equally likely to survive or die, suggesting that there is no intrinsic selection bias for cells descended from particular hiPS cell progenitors. We thus wondered how cells grow spatially during differentiation, so we labeled cells by expression of marker genes and found that cells expressing the same marker tended to occur in patches. Our results suggest that cell type determination across multiple cell types, once initiated, is maintained in a cell-autonomous manner for multiple divisions. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results show that while substantial heterogeneity exists in the initial hiPS cell population, it is not responsible for the variability observed in differentiated outcomes; instead, factors specifying the various cell types likely act during a window that begins shortly after the seeding of hiPS cells for differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data  aF30 HG010822cNational Human Genome Research Institute  aT32 HG000046cNational Human Genome Research Institute  aRM1 HG007743cNational Human Genome Research Institute  aT32 DK007780cNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  aU01 DK127405cNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  aT32 GM007170cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aT32 GM07229cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aT32 GM007170cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aT32 GM008216cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aR01 GM137425cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aR01 GM137425cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aR01 GM137425cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aF30 HD103378cEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  aF30 CA236129cNational Cancer Institute  aR01 CA238237cNational Cancer Institute  aR01 CA232256cNational Cancer Institute  aP30 CA016520cNational Cancer Institute  aP50 CA174523cNational Cancer Institute  aU01 CA227550cNational Cancer Institute  aF30 NS100595cNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  aUG3DK122644cNational Institutes of Health  aUM1DK126194cNational Institutes of Health  aU01TR001810cNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences  aEFMA19-33400cDivision of Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation 3acardiomyocytes 3acell death 3agenome 3asowing 3atranscription (genetics)1 aGoyal, Yogesh1 aJain, Naveen1 aWang, Qiaohong1 aTruitt, Rachel E.1 aCoté, Allison J.1 aEmert, Benjamin1 aMellis, Ian A.1 aKiani, Karun1 aYang, Wenli1 aJain, Rajan1 aRaj, Arjun0 tGenome biology.g2022 Dec., v. 23, no. 1 p.90-90dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02654-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016100165500001900326520126700345592002801612650001701640650002801657650001301685650002301698650001001721650001401731650001701745650001001762650001301772650001401785650001801799650001601817700002301833700003201856700001901888700002001907700002201927773012201949856008002071852000902151655001202160IND60729162720221122164956.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916272DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110202882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavara, Jorge 10aPotential for the Postharvest Biological Control of Phthorimaeaoperculella (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) by Blattisociustarsalis (Mesostigmata, Blattisociidae)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhthorimaea operculella is one of the most important pests causing damage to stored potatoes. In this work, the effect of temperature (at 10, 20 and 30 °C) on the predation of pest eggs by Blattisocius tarsalis was studied in the laboratory. In addition, the effect of three predatory release rates on two pest densities was studied under microcosm conditions. The results showed that B. tarsalis maintains its predatory capacity at low temperatures (10 °C), obtaining an efficiency of 49.66 ± 5.06% compared to the control. In turn, at 20 °C, a maximum efficacy of 78.17 ± 4.77% was achieved, very similar to that presented at 30 °C (75.57 ± 4.34%). Under microcosm conditions and at low pest density (10 eggs/container), the mortality due to the mite was 96.97 ± 3.03%, 81.82 ± 8.84%, and 84.85 ± 8.30%, respectively, for the three predatory release rates (5, 10 or 20 mites/container). At the high infestation level, the pest control ranged from 61.54 ± 9.21% to 92.31 ± 2.74%, depending on the predatory release rate. The results obtained show that B. tarsalis could be a relevant control agent against P. operculella under non-refrigerated potato storage conditions, as well as in the first stages of their storage under refrigerated conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesostigmata 3aPhthorimaea operculella 3aagronomy 3abiological control 3amites 3amortality 3apest control 3apests 3apotatoes 3apredation 3arefrigeration 3atemperature1 aPiedra-Buena, Ana 1 aHernandez-Suarez, Estrella 1 aGamez, Manuel 1 aCabello, Tomas 1 aGallego, Juan  R.0 tAgronomy.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110202883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001900159245005800178300001800236500000900254520171700263592002801980650002402008650001102032650000902043650001102052650001602063650002202079650001802101650001102119650001502130650001902145650002402164700001902188700002102207700002102228773015002249852000902399856009602408655001202504IND2061156120221119063256.0191125e199707  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206115612DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100040025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLascano, R.

Natural rainstorms also have both variable drop sizes and kinetic energy. Accurate studies of sediment transport and infiltration require realistic duplication of natural rain kinetic energy and intensities. Rain simulator designs must be capable of producing dynamic multiple intensities and corresponding multiple drop sizes to simulate variable kinetic energies. Many simulators are capable of producing rain with multiple and, in some cases, dynamic intensities, but a simulator that can vary both the intensity and kinetic energy is needed. Our objective was to design and build a rain simulator for field use that realistically duplicated natural rain storms. A computer-controlled solenoid-valve multiple nozzle type rain simulator was developed. The computer not only controls solenoid valve activation of the rain simulator during operation but also measures runoff and records rain application and runoff data to a log file for processing. The simulator has control software that controls and monitors all processes. The rain simulator is capable of uniformly applying water (coefficient of uniformity = 84–94%) with a dynamically changing intensity of up to 200 mm h⁻¹ and kinetic energies ranging from 15.0 to 23.5 J m⁻² mm⁻¹. Uniformity of application was achieved by oscillating the nozzles in two directions. Field operation of the simulator is enhanced by its portability. The measurement area is easily modified using in-line handrail connectors to change support frame dimensions, thus accommodating infiltration and chemical or sediment transport studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3arainfall simulators 3adesign 3arain 3astorms 3acontrollers 3acomputer software 3awater erosion 3arunoff 3amonitoring 3arain intensity 3acomputer techniques1 aVorheis, J.

Recently, Sulfammox was detected in wastewater treatments and was confirmed to occur in natural environments, especially in marine sediments. However, knowledge gaps in the mechanism of Sulfammox, functional bacteria, and their metabolic pathway, make it challenging to estimate its environmental significance and potential applications. This review provides an overview of recent advances in Sulfammox, including possible mechanisms, functional bacteria, and main influential factors, and discusses future challenges and opportunities. Future perspectives are outlined and discussed, such as exploration of microbial community structure and metabolic pathways, possible interactions with other microbes, environmental significance, and potential applications for nitrogen and sulfate removal, to inspire more researches on the Sulfammox process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abiochemical pathways 3acommunity structure 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aresearch 3asulfates 3asulfur 3awastewater 0aSulfammox 0aBiological nitrogen removal 0aNitrogen cycle 0aSulfur cycle 0aSulfate reduction1 aXie, Guo-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8143-38221 aXing, De-Feng1 aLiu, Bing-Feng1 aDing, Jie1 aCao, Guang-Li1 aRen, Nan-Qi0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Jan., v. 192 p.110282-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1102823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245016600184300001400350520090300364592002801267650001601295650001201311650001501323650001401338650001201352650002701364650001201391650001301403650002401416650000901440650001401449650001601463650000701479650001701486650002701503650001701530650002401547650002501571650003101596650001101627700002001638700001401658700001701672700002001689700001401709700001301723700001901736700002001755773008601775856008601861852000901947655001201956IND4466838920221118231653.0141110e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446683892DNAL7 a224452672pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qiang10aEffect of carbonate on anaerobic acidogenesis and fermentative hydrogen production from glucose using leachate as supplementary culture under alkaline conditions  ap. 37-43.  aCarbonate was added into a co-culture of glucose and fresh leachate under alkaline condition to enhance batched acidogenesis and fermentative hydrogen production simultaneously. Results indicated carbonate has positive effect on both H₂ production and acetic acid generation. The highest hydrogen yield (about 1.40mol/mol glucose) was obtained at [CO₃ ²⁻]=280mg/L with pH 8.0 and [CO₃ ²⁻]=560mg/L with pH 9. The dominant liquid metabolites were ethanol, acetic and butyric acid. The highest total volatile fatty acid yield (0.38g/g glucose) was achieved at [CO₃ ²⁻]=560mg/L with pH 9. In this case, the acetic acid yield reached 0.13g/g glucose. Verification tests using simulated wastewater as substrate were also carried out at pH 9. Results demonstrated calcium ions inhibit hydrogenogens activity while carbonate addition can alleviate the suppression effect caused by Ca²⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3acoculture 3aethanol 3afatty acid composition 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aions 3aleachates 3ametabolites 3apH 2aAnaerobiosis 2aCarbonatesxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aSewage1 aZhang, Xiao Lei1 aJun, Zhao1 aZhao, Ai Hua1 aChen, Shan Ping1 aLiu, Feng1 aTai, Jun1 aLiu, Jian Yong1 aQian, Guang Ren0 tBioresource technology.g2012 June, v. 113 p.37-43dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003000110040001800140100001700158245014400175300001600319520085700335650002601192650001201218650001901230650001401249650001601263650002201279650001201301650002301313650002801336650002801364653001201392653001401404700001601418700001501434773008801449852000901537856008001546939003301626946001301659655001201672IND8904397420221119133602.0890811e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890439742DNAL7 a27540952pmid7 a10.1093/jee/82.3.6872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDecker, T.N.10aAuditory thresholds in the American cockroach (Orthoptera: Blattidae): estimates using single-unit and compound-action potential recordings  ap. 687-691.  aRecent commercial suggestions that insect populations can be controlled through the use of ultrasound raises the question of whether or not certain insects have receptors that are sensitive to high-frequency sound. Single neural unit discharges and compound-action potentials were recorded from the ventral nerve cord in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana L., to constant rise time tone pulses from 100 to 40,000 hertz (Hz). Unit responses and compound-action potentials show that the cockroach is insensitive to sound above approximately 3,000 Hz. Data relating latency of the response to intensity of the stimulus suggest that the cockroach cercal system operates on the principle of energy envelope detection. Decreases in latency likely occur primarily as a result of increases in the rate of membrane depolarization in cercal dendrites. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3ahearing 3ainsect control 3areceptors 3aultrasonics 2aAction Potentials 2aAnimals 2aAuditory Threshold 2aCockroachesxphysiology 2aPeriplanetaxphysiology 0astimuli 0aresponses1 aJones, T.A.1 aGold, R.E.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1989 June, v. 82, no. 3 p.687-691x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/82.3.6873Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01871naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006000129300001800189520115900207650002901366650000801395650001801403650002501421700001601446773009001462852000901552939003301561946001101594655001201605IND9305039020221119133532.0930823e199306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930503902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, S.R.10aCoat protein of cauliflower mosaic virus binds to ssDNA  ap. 1141-1148.  aAlkali-denatured cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) virions incorporated ssDNA, added exogenously, into multimolecular complexes during dialysis against a neutral buffer. CaMV coat protein binding to tracer DNA, assessed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, was highly cooperative as judged by the absence of intermediate-sized complexes. The incorporation of labelled BglII fragments of a plasmid containing CaMV DNA into complexes was prevented by the presence of 0.16 g/l unlabelled calf thymus DNA. Lower concentrations of competitor DNA allowed binding of some BglII fragments although preventing the binding of others. The self-annealing poly(dl-dC) was much less efficient than calf thymus DNA in preventing the incorporation of fragments into complexes, suggesting a binding preference for ss- over dsDNA. In addition, dsDNA, minimally cross-linked to prevent strand separation, was bound only weakly. End-labelled ssDNA fragments in complexes were partially protected against DNase I. The nucleic acid-binding activity of CaMV coat protein may be responsible for the organization of replication complexes, the precursors to virion particles. 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aDNA 3acoat proteins 3aDNA-binding proteins1 aMelcher, U.0 tJournal of general virology.g1993 June, v. 74, no. pt.6 p.1141-1148x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02198naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001500140245017800155300001600333500001500349520097200364650002801336650001901364650001601383650001801399650000801417650002101425650001801446650001601464650001201480650002301492651001101515653001601526653000801542700001501550773008801565852000901653856008001662939003301742946001301775655001201788IND8904398620221119133726.0890814e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890439862DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/82.3.7622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoivin, G.10aInfectivity of two strains of Steinernema feltiae (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) in relation to temperature, age, and sex of carrot weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) adults  ap. 762-765.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of two strains of Steinernema feltiae Filipjev, DD 136 and Listronotus, on the survival and oviposition of carrot weevil, Listronotus oregonensis (Le Conte), adults of different ages and sexes were evaluated in the laboratory. The lethal time50 (LT50) obtained for overwintered adults was significantly higher than those obtained for adults 1, 13, and 60 d old. When no feeding or ovipositing took place, the females had a significantly shorter LT50 than the males. Although the availability of food decreased the LT50's of males and females, oviposition did not increase the susceptibility of females. The DD 136 strain performed better than the Listronotus strain when the carrot weevil adults did not feed or oviposit. Both nematode strains decreased the oviposition rate of infected females before their death. The LT50's for both strains decreased as temperature increased, but at 10 degrees C, DD 136 had an LT50 shorter than the Listronotus strain. 3aListronotus oregonensis 3ainsect control 3aoviposition 3aDaucus carota 3aage 3aSteinernematidae 3apathogenicity 3atemperature 3astrains 3abiological control 3aQuebec 0aListronotus 0asex1 aBelair, G.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1989 June, v. 82, no. 3 p.762-765x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/82.3.7623Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02233naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072001700140072001700157100001800174245013800192300001600330520095600346650002301302650002901325650001001354650002301364650001901387650001701406650001901423650002301442650001601465650000901481650002301490651001201513700002101525700001701546773008801563852000901651856008001660930003301740946001301773961001301786655001201799IND8904398920221119133811.0890815e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890439892DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/82.3.7822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

First capture means were 2213 hours (early season), 0108 hours (midseason), and 1726 hours (late season) (all times are given for Mountain Time). Similar relationships were observed in the time of peak and last capture means through the season except that they occurred later in the night. Temperature affected the time of capture; higher temperatures resulted in later captures and lower temperatures resulted in earlier captures. Regression models showed that the time of capture was predictable with the independent variables, time of sunset and temperature, accounting for 88 to 95% of the variation in time of capture. Maximum and minimum temperature thresholds for trap capture were 30.3 and 12.3 degrees C. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aPectinophora gossypiella 3amales 3ainsect attractants 3ainsect control 3ainsect traps 3asex pheromones 3asynthetic hormones 3atemperature 3awind 3aseasonal variation 3aArizona1 aHenneberry, T.J.1 aPopham, T.W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1989 June, v. 82, no. 3 p.782-787x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/82.3.7823Available from publisher's Web site  a20120210b20120302c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02984naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172100002200181245011100203300001400314500002400328520091600352650001001268650001801278650002201296650001101318650002301329650002801352650001401380650001901394650002301413650002301436650002001459650002301479650002701502650001801529650002001547650001201567650001901579650006701598650001801665650002201683650002401705650004001729650003301769650003401802653003101836653003501867700001901902700002201921700002301943700002501966700002101991700001602012773012302028852000902151856009302160930003302253945002502286946001102311655001202322IND4442255020221119133717.0100910e20100930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444225502DNAL7 a207053522pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2051 aAgnolucci, Monica10aSulphur dioxide affects culturability and volatile phenol production by Brettanomyces/Dekkera bruxellensis  ap. 76-80.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of different sulphur dioxide concentrations on culturability and viability of seven strains of Brettanomyces bruxellensis was tested in a synthetic wine medium (SWM) and a different response to molecular SO₂ among strains was detected. Sulphur dioxide induced a viable but non culturable (VBNC) state in all the strains. The greater percentage of VBNC cells were identified for five strains at molecular SO₂ concentrations of 0.2mg/L and for two strains at the concentration of 0.4mg/L. Vinyl phenols were detected in media containing VBNC or not viable B. bruxellensis, suggesting that its spoilage metabolism could be maintained during wine storage. Overall, this study indicates that SO₂ is a chemical stressor inducing VBNC state in B. bruxellensis grown in synthetic wine medium. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of SO₂ on the metabolism of this yeast in wine spoilage. 3awines 3afood spoilage 3afood microbiology 3ayeasts 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3aviability 3asulfur dioxide 3afood preservatives 3amodel food systems 3aSaccharomycetes 3astrain differences 3achemical concentration 3aculture media 3avinyl compounds 3aphenols 3aabiotic stress 2aBrettanomycesxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCulture Media 2aFood Microbiology 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aSulfur Dioxidexpharmacology 2aWinexanalysisxmicrobiology. 0aBrettanomyces bruxellensis 0aviable but nonculturable state1 aRea, Francesco1 aSbrana, Cristiana1 aCristani, Caterina1 aFracassetti, Daniela1 aTirelli, Antonio1 aNuti, Marco0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2010 Sept. 30, v. 143, no. 1-2 p.76-80dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.07.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02547naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245006800154300001800222500002300240500001500263520121800278650001901496650001801515650001301533650001801546650001401564650001101578650001701589650002401606650002101630650001501651651001201666653001601678653001601694653002601710653000901736653001501745653002201760700001601782700001701798773009701815852000901912856007501921930003301996945001302029946001102042655001202053IND2053765620221119133528.0961028e199606  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205376562DNAL7 a10.1139/x26-1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLieffers, V.J.10aAge structure and growth of understory white spruce under aspen  ap. 1002-1007.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aJuvenile white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) under an aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) overstory were studied in nine boreal mixedwood stands in west-central Alberta. In each stand, 50 understory white spruce were cut for stem analysis at ground level, 30, 70, 130 cm, and every 100 cm to tree height. In four stands, recruitment of these understory spruce occurred immediately after the disturbance, while in others the recruitment was delayed several decades. The period of recruitment was as short as 15-20 years or continued for decades, producing an uneven-aged understory. Trees initiated on rotten logs had a slightly lower initial annual diameter increment but did not differ in height growth compared with those initiated on normal forest floor. The annual height increment increased as the trees grew in height, presumably as they overtopped successive layers of shading vegetation. When seedlings were less than 30 cm tall they grew less than 10 cm per year, but attained growth rates of 30 cm per year or more when they were taller than 230 cm. Height growth rates for these understory trees were comparable to reported growth rates of white spruce of similar size and age from clearcut areas. 3aboreal forests 3amixed forests 3atree age 3aforest litter 3adead wood 3aheight 3aPicea glauca 3aPopulus tremuloides 3astand basal area 3aunderstory 3aAlberta 0arecruitment 0agrowth rate 0aplant characteristics 0alogs 0abasal area 0astand development1 aStadt, K.J.1 aNavratil, S.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1996 June, v. 26, no. 6 p.1002-1007x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-1103Available from publisher's Web site  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle05745naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100001900178245016200197300001500359500026900374500002400643500001500667520355800682650001304240650001904253650001504272650002104287650002004308650002504328650002904353650002304382650002804405650001404433650002204447650002504469650002704494650002204521650002504543650001804568650002604586650002204612651001604634653002404650653001604674653002504690653002304715653001504738653001604753700002004769700001404789700002104803773010204824852000904926856009104935930003305026945002505059946001105084655001205095IND4409574920221119131633.0080829e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440957492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL821 0aL7001 aMeiswinkel, R.14aThe Culicoides 'snapshot': A novel approach used to assess vector densities widely and rapidly during the 2006 outbreak of bluetongue (BT) in The Netherlands  ap. 98-118.  aIn the special issue: The 2006 bluetongue outbreak in North-West Europe: The outcome from the epidemiological investigation coordinated by the European food safety authority (EFSA) / edited by Sergio Potier Rodeia, Hubert Deluyker, Dirk Pfeiffer and Mo. D. Salman.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA novel method was developed and implemented during the recent outbreak of bluetongue (BT) in sheep and cattle in The Netherlands to obtain rapidly a 'snapshot' of Culicoides vector densities at the national level. The country was divided into 110 raster cells, each measuring 20kmx20km; within 106 of these cells, a farm was selected with a minimum of 10 cattle and sampled for Culicoides for one night only using the Onderstepoort-type blacklight trap. Prior to deployment of the light traps in the field, local veterinarians were trained in their use and in the preservation of captured Culicoides. The collections were despatched daily by courier to a field laboratory where the Culicoides were counted and identified. The 'snapshot' commenced on 12 September 2006 and was completed on 28 September coinciding with the 5-7 weeks of BT virus (BTV) activity in The Netherlands and when the number of weekly cases of disease was on the rise. Analysis of the 106 collections was completed on 5 October. The number of grid cells in which a taxon occurred is represented by the index 20² gFR (=20kmx20km grid Frequency Rate); this index essentially reflects the percentage of examined raster cells found to contain the potential vector in question. The 'snapshot' results can be summarised as follows: [round bullet, filled] A total of >35,000 Culicoides were captured (μ =333midges/light trap) representing 16 species; [round bullet, filled] Not a single specimen of C. imicola, the principal Afro-Asiatic vector of BTV in southern Europe, was captured; [round bullet, filled] The three European species of Culicoides implicated previously as potential vectors in the Mediterranean region and the Balkans also occur in The Netherlands; [round bullet, filled] The Obsoletus Complex (represented by both potential vectors Culicoides obsoletus and Culicoides scoticus) was the most prevalent taxon (20² gFR: 93.4%) followed by the Pulicaris Complex (76.4%); [round bullet, filled] The Pulicaris Complex comprised at least six species. One of these, Culicoides pulicaris sensu stricto (ss), a potential vector in southern Europe, had a low 20² gFR of 17.9% indicating it played no role in the transmission of BTV; [round bullet, filled] The next most prevalent taxa were Culicoides dewulfi (70.8%) and Culicoides chiopterus (67.0%) both of which breed in cattle dung. This close association with livestock raises their potential as vectors of BTV; [round bullet, filled] Culicoides achrayi, Culicoides circumscriptus, C. dewulfi, Culicoides halophilus, Culicoides lupicaris and Culicoides stigma are new species records for The Netherlands and demonstrates that the extant knowledge on the Culicoides fauna of northern Europe is incomplete; [round bullet, filled] Cooling trends in the weather induced a >50-fold decrease in overall Culicoides numbers but with subsequent warming these would rebound rapidly indicating that more intense cold is required before heightened mortalities are induced amongst adult biting midges. The northward advance of BT in Europe compels the competent authorities in affected and in neighbouring territories to acquire rapidly baseline information around which to plan sound vector surveillance and livestock movement strategies. The Culicoides 'snapshot' is a tool well suited to this purpose. It is stressed that a vector surveillance program must be built upon a firm taxonomic base because misidentifications will flaw the mapped seasonal and geographic distribution patterns upon which veterinary authorities depend. 3ataxonomy 3ainsect vectors 3abluetongue 3aBluetongue virus 3arisk assessment 3aCulicoides obsoletus 3aarthropod-borne diseases 3apopulation density 3aepidemiological studies 3alivestock 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease surveillance 3ageographical variation 3aemerging diseases 3adisease transmission 3arapid methods 3aenvironmental factors 3adisease incidence 3aNetherlands 0aCulicoides scoticus 0amethodology 0aCulicoides pulicaris 0aCulicoides dewulfi 0aCulicoides 0anew methods1 aGoffredo, Maria1 aLeijs, P.1 aConte, Annamaria0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 87, no. 1-2 p.98-118dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.06.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/10/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02656naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001400159245011000173300001800283500002400301500001500325520103700340650001601377650002701393650001901420650002101439650001301460650001601473650002401489650002001513650001501533650001301548650001801561650000701579650001301586650001101599650001701610650002101627650003501648653003301683653001501716653001301731653002001744653002101764700001601785700001501801773010601816852000901922856009001931930003302021945002502054946001102079655001202090IND4399759920221119133648.0080108e20080415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439975992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1041 aKao, T.H.10aExtraction yield of isoflavones from soybean cake as affected by solvent and supercritical carbon dioxide  ap. 1728-1736.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSoybean cake has been shown to be a rich source of isoflavone and can be produced during processing of soybean oil as byproduct. The objectives of this study were to compare the extraction yield of isoflavone from soybean cake by solvent and supercritical carbon dioxide, and study the conversion of isoflavone glucosides to the biologically active aglycone by employing β-glucosidase. Results showed that with supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, a maximum yield of malonylglucoside and glucoside was generated at 60 °C and 350 bar, while a high level of acetylglucoside and aglycone was produced at 80 °C and 350 bar. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction resulted in a lower yield of total isoflavone than solvent extraction, but the former was more applicable to extraction of acetylglucoside and aglycone, and the latter to malonylglucoside and glucoside. A peak level of aglycone was attained from conversion of isoflavone glucoside by β-glucosidase at 55 °C, pH 5, concentration 50 U/ml and incubation time of 2 h. 3atemperature 3achemical concentration 3acarbon dioxide 3aplant byproducts 3apressure 3aisoflavones 3aenzymatic treatment 3afood processing 3aglucosides 3asolvents 3aoilseed cakes 3apH 3aduration 3ayields 3asoybean meal 3abeta-glucosidase 3asupercritical fluid extraction 0asupercritical carbon dioxide 0aextraction 0aaglycone 0aacetylglucoside 0amalonylglucoside1 aChien, J.T.1 aChen, B.H.0 tFood chemistry.g2008 Apr. 15, v. 107, no. 4 p.1728-1736dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.10.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02442naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245011500157300001800272500002300290520123500313650002001548650002101568650001901589650001901608650001601627650001001643650002201653650002301675653001101698653002901709700002101738700001901759700001601778773009701794852000901891856007501900930003301975945001302008946001102021655001202032IND2055416120221119133812.0970214e199608  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205541612DNAL7 a10.1139/x26-1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConstable, J.V.H.10aClimatic change effects on the physiology and growth of Pinus ponderosa: expectations from simulation modeling  ap. 1315-1325.  aSummary in French.  aThe TREGRO model was used to simulate the growth response of mature Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws. to the interacting effects of changes in CO2 (+200 microliter/L), temperature (+4 degrees C), and O3 (0.5X, 1 X, and 2x ambient). Relative to simulated growth under the base-line climate in Corvallis, Oregon, elevated CO2 and temperature individually increased total-tree biomass gain by 29% and 13%, respectively, but when combined increased biomass gain by 49%. Ozone at all exposures reduced total-tree biomass gain by 1%, 19%, and 39%. respectively, as compared with simulated base-line conditions. Elevated CO2 increased photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance and partially offset growth reductions due to 2X O3. Elevated temperature, however, increased both photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and was less effective at mitigating growth reductions due to 2X O3. Growth at 2X O3 in elevated CO2 and temperature conditions had little effect on total-tree growth, but decreased fine-root growth by 61%. The simulated changes in stomatal conductance and fine-root biomass are expected to interact with the availability of soil resources to affect tree growth and possibly alter the distribution of Pinus ponderosa. 3aPinus ponderosa 3aplant physiology 3aclimate change 3acarbon dioxide 3atemperature 3aozone 3asimulation models 3abiomass production 0agrowth 0atrego (simulation model)1 aTaylor, G.E.

Paper presented at the conference "Rhizosphere: Perspectives and Challenges -- a tribute for Lorentz Hiltner" held September 2004, Munich, Germany.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMany epidemics of root diseases involving soil fungi depend on the interplay between fungal growth and the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the soil environment. Colonization or infection of a root occurs at fine scales with growth and movement of fungal mycelia through soil. However, epidemics are observed at coarser scales, and depend on a cascading spread through populations of roots. We briefly review conventional analyses of soil-borne epidemics and argue that these treat soil physical conditions at scales too coarse to be meaningful for interactions between soil, plants and fungi, and fail to consider the effect of soil physical conditions on the underlying epidemiological processes. Instead, we propose a conceptual epidemiological framework that integrates spatial scales and use this to review the effect of soil structure on the dynamics of soil-borne pathogenic fungi. Using the soil-borne fungal plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani as an example, we demonstrate that invasion of fungi into host populations is critically affected by environmental conditions operating at each of two scales: (i) at the microscopic scale ([mu]m [-] cm) the fungus preferentially explores certain pathways in soil, and small changes in soil physical conditions make the fungus switch from small, dense colonies to large, sparse and rapidly expanding ones; (ii) at the larger scale (cm [-] dm) a critical density of susceptible hosts is required, in excess of which fungi switch from non-invasive to invasive spread. Finally, we suggest that the approach will increase the applicability of research dealing with microscopic soil-plant-microbe interactions towards the solution of large-scale epidemiological problems. 3afungal diseases of plants 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3adisease transmission 3asoil structure 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amicrobial growth 3asoil-borne diseases 0asoil physics 0aepidemiology 0aliterature reviews 0asoil physical properties1 aGilligan, C.A.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2006 Feb., v. 57, no. 1 p.26-37dBlackwell Science Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00766.x3electronic resource  a20060517b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02457naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001400177245008700191300001800278500002400296500001500320520094600335650002401281650001101305650002301316650001701339650003101356650001701387650002401404650001701428650000901445650002101454650001601475650001601491650001001507650001501517653002301532653002501555653001301580700001701593700001401610700001701624773010601641852000901747856009001756930003301846945002501879946001101904655001201915IND4399758720221119133733.0080108e20080415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439975872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.09.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ501 0aX100 0aQ1111 aBosch, L.10aEffect of storage conditions on furosine formation in milk-cereal based baby foods  ap. 1681-1686.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of storage during 9 months at 25, 30 and 37 °C on furosine formation in three milk-cereal based baby foods was studied to evaluate development of the Maillard reaction. Furosine was measured by HPLC-UV. Immediately after the manufacturing process, furosine contents were 310-340 mg/100 g protein and at the 9th storage month were 426-603 mg/100 g protein. Storage time and temperature have a significant increase (p < 0.05) of furosine content during storage. Furosine contents were higher in sample containing honey than in those without honey. Interactions (p < 0.05) between storage time and temperature or type of sample were found. A predictive model equation of the evolution of furosine during storage explaining 80% of the variability in furosine content was obtained. The blockage of lysine through storage calculated using the furosine and total lysine provided values ranged from 9.5% to 18.1% for analysed baby foods. 3amathematical models 3alysine 3aready-to-eat foods 3ainfant foods 3aMaillard reaction products 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3amilk 3afood composition 3aingredients 3agrain foods 3ahoney 3aprediction 0astorage conditions 0achemical composition 0afurosine1 aAlegri'a, A.1 aFarre, R.1 aClemente, G.0 tFood chemistry.g2008 Apr. 15, v. 107, no. 4 p.1681-1686dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.09.0513Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03601naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002000167245018800187300001600375500002400391500001500415520160800430650001002038650001602048650002702064650002502091650002602116650001202142650001802154650003002172650001402202650001902216650002302235650001702258650001402275650002302289650001202312650002702324650002102351650001102372650001502383650002102398650001202419650002402431650001102455650001702466650001902483650003402502650004402536650002602580653001802606700001802624700001702642700001602659773009802675852000902773856008802782930003302870945002502903946001102928655001202939IND4442264920221119133809.0100910e20100920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226492DNAL7 a205418682pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourseyed, S.H.10aMetarhizium anisopliae (Ascomycota: Hypocreales): An effective alternative to chemical acaricides against different developmental stages of fowl tick Argas persicus (Acari: Argasidae)  ap. 305-310.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe fowl bloodsucking tick Argas persicus is of great medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions because of its role as vector of certain parasitic, bacterial and viral pathogens. A variety of acaricides are used for the control of tick infestation in poultry, resulting in environmental contamination and the development of resistance. In order to develop an alternative control method, the efficacy of three strains (V245, 685 and 715C) of entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae against different life stages of A. persicus including eggs, larvae, unfed and engorged adult females was evaluated under laboratory conditions. Five concentrations of different strains of M. anisopliae ranging from 10³ to 10⁷ conidia/ml were utilized. The effects of fungal strains on egg hatchability and larva and adult female mortality were significant and dose-dependent compared to the control groups (P <0.05). The mortality rates of larvae ranged from 92% to 100% for two different concentrations (10³ and 10⁴ conidia/ml) of M. anisopliae strains. Treated engorged females were more susceptible than the unfed females reaching mortality rate of 100% at the highest concentration (10⁷ conidia/ml) at 18 days post-inoculation. Among strains used in this study, V245 was the most virulent strain regarding the LC₅₀ values for adult females exposed to fungal conidia. The results demonstrate that the application of M. anisopliae as a biocontrol agent is a promising option in reducing the use of chemical acaricides, resulting in benefits to poultry and the environment. 3aticks 3aparasitoses 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3adevelopmental stages 3aacaricidal properties 3aconidia 3adose response 3abiological control agents 3avirulence 3aArgas persicus 3astrain differences 3atick control 3amortality 3abiological control 3apoultry 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3apoultry diseases 3adosage 3aacaricides 3achemical control 2aAnimals 2aArgasxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aInsecticides 2aLethal Dose 50 2aLife Cycle Stagesxphysiology 2aMetarhiziumxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aTick Controlxmethods 0aectoparasites1 aTavassoli, M.1 aBernousi, I.1 aMardani, K.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Sept. 20, v. 172, no. 3-4 p.305-310dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.05.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01975naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002600140245012300166300001600289520089200305650001701197650001901214650002901233650001401262650002701276650001901303650002601322650002101348653001701369700001601386773008801402852000901490856008001499939003301579946001301612655001201625IND8904400520221119133730.0890816e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890440052DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/82.3.8682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Frankenhuyzen, K.10aResidual toxicity of a high-potency formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis to spruce budworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)  ap. 868-872.  aFoliar persistence of an aqueous high-potency formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis (Thuricide 48LV) applied to a white spruce (Picea glauca Moench.) plantation at 2.4 liter/ha was assessed. Residual toxicity of treated foliage to spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens), larvae was less than 2 d despite high spray deposition on the target foliage. Experiments with potted balsam fir indicated that wash-off by rain was the primary cause for loss of residual toxicity, whereas inactivation by sunlight played a limited role. As little as 6 mm of rain caused a substantial loss of residual toxicity. We conclude that deposits of Thuricide 48LV (low viscosity) on white spruce and balsam fir (Abies balsamea L.) foliage are highly susceptible to wash-off by rain. A high concentration of active ingredient does not improve foliar persistence and a suitable sticker is required. 3aPicea glauca 3aAbies balsamea 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3amortality 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3ainsect control 3apesticide persistence 3aresidual effects 0aformulations1 aNystrom, C.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1989 June, v. 82, no. 3 p.868-872x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/82.3.8683Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03770naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100001600169245014600185300001400331500002400345500001500369520201500384650001102399650002202410650001902432650001702451650001302468650002502481650002302506650002002529650003602549650002402585650002502609650002802634650002002662650001302682650002102695650002502716650001502741650001602756650001102772653003402783700001702817700001502834700001802849700001602867700001902883773010902902852000903011856009103020930003303111945002503144946001103169655001203180IND4399761820221119133713.0080108e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439976182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aF6001 aVital, S.A.10aOpposing roles for superoxide and nitric oxide in the NaCl stress-induced upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activity in cotton callus tissue  ap. 60-68.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe roles of superoxide and NO in the NaCl-induced upregulation on antioxidant enzyme activity were investigated in NaCl-tolerant cotton calli. Both NaCl and paraquat treatments resulted in significant increases in superoxide production. The activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase, glutathione reductase (GR), and peroxidase also increased significantly within 2 h after applying the stress. Pre-treatment with the superoxide scavenger, N-acetyl l-cysteine (NAC), completely removed the superoxide and inhibited the upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activity in the tissue treated with either NaCl or paraquat. NaCl stress also resulted in a significant increase in the NO level. Experiments were also carried out to measure antioxidant enzyme activity in cotton calli exposed to NO, the NO producer sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) under different salt stress conditions. The direct addition of NO gas produced no change in the activities of catalase and GR and caused a significant decrease in APX activity when compared to the controls. When the calli was treated with SNP in the absence of NaCl stress, APX and GR activities decreased significantly and catalase activity was only slightly higher than the control. Treatment with SNP in the presence of NaCl stress resulted in a significant decrease in APX activity, and GR and APX activities were not significantly different from those observed in the NaCl treatment alone. In the presence of PTIO, the activities of all three enzymes increased in the presence or absence of NaCl stress. These results suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radicals may serve as signal transduction molecules to switch “on” the early NaCl-induced up-regulation of antioxidant enzyme activity, while NO may play a role in switching “off” the response after other mechanisms in the cascade of events responsible for NaCl tolerance have been activated. 3acotton 3aenzyme activation 3asalt tolerance 3anitric oxide 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3asignal transduction 3abiochemical pathways 3afree radical scavengers 3asodium chloride 3aparaquat 3asuperoxide anion 3aantioxidant activity 3aperoxidase 3asalt stress 3acallus 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH)1 aFowler, R.W.1 aVirgen, A.1 aGossett, D.R.1 aBanks, S.W.1 aRodríguez, J.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2008 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.60-68dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.07.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02510naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001900159245015600178300001800334500002400352500001500376520091200391650001301303650001801316650002301334650001801357650002701375650001901402650002101421650002601442650002101468650001301489650002101502650002201523650002301545650001401568650001301582653001901595653004201614653002301656700001901679700002001698773010601718852000901824856009001833930003301923945002501956946001101981655001201992IND4399759220221119133728.0080108e20080415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439975922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.09.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aDe Jager, L.S.10aComparison of headspace-SPME-GC-MS and LC-MS for the detection and quantification of coumarin, vanillin, and ethyl vanillin in vanilla extract products  ap. 1701-1709.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA headspace-solid phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) GC-MS method has been developed for the determination of coumarin, vanillin and ethyl vanillin in vanilla products.

A survey of 24 commercially available vanilla products was completed using both techniques. No coumarin was detected in any of the samples. Examination of the GC-MS chromatograms revealed the presence of 18 other flavor related compounds in the samples. The method validation and sample analysis data using HS-SPME-GC-MS were comparable to those obtained using the LC-MS method. Because the two methods are conceptually different from one another, both methods would not be subject to the same interferences.

Additional analyses confirmed that the results given by the ELISA method was in agreement with those of the gas chromatography (GC) method. 3afood analysis 3afood contamination 3acarbofuran 3agarlic 3asoybeans 3acabbage 3apesticide residues 3abamboo shoots 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahaptens 3afood composition 3alettuce 3aanalytical methods 3acarrots 3adetection 0awinter fragrant-flowered garlic 0agreen soybeans 0avegetables 0abamboo shoots (food)1 aJin, M.1 aGui, W.1 aGuo, Y.1 aJin, R.1 aWang, C.1 aLiang, C.1 aLiu, Y.1 aWang, S.0 tFood chemistry.g2008 Apr. 15, v. 107, no. 4 p.1737-1742dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.10.0353Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle04767naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100003900167245011900206300001600325500002400341500001500365520223900380650002602619650002502645650001902670650001002689650002402699650002302723650001802746650001202764650001902776650002002795650001902815650001402834650002502848650001202873650001802885650002202903650002702925650002302952650002602975650001203001650004303013650002603056650002103082650001103103650003703114650002403151650001103175650004503186650002703231650003303258650001003291650000903301650002303310650002303333650001003356650003303366650002203399650002203421650002103443651001103464653001503475700002503490700001903515700002603534700002303560700002603583700001403609700002603623773009803649852000903747856008803756930003303844945002503877946001103902655001203913IND4442264620221119133249.0100910e20100920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226462DNAL7 a206053362pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.04.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Ortíz-de-Montellano, C.10aEffect of a tropical tannin-rich plant Lysiloma latisiliquum on adult populations of Haemonchus contortus in sheep  ap. 283-290.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBioactive plants with anthelmintic (AH) properties represent a promising alternative solution to chemical treatments. The AH effect of several Mexican tannin-rich (TR) plants has been screened in vitro. The in vivo AH effect of one TR legume, Lysiloma latisiliquum (Tzalam) on nematode larval establishment was confirmed. The present trial aimed at evaluating the direct and indirect effects of L. latisiliquum fodder consumption on adult Haemonchus contortus. Twenty-two parasite-naïve hair sheep lambs were allocated to an infected group (I) (400 H. contortus L₃/kg BW on D0) and a non-infected group (NI). From D0 to D28 post infection (PI), all the lambs were fed a complete diet. On D28, the two groups were sub-divided into four groups. Two control (C) groups maintained on the original basal diet (CI: 6 infected lambs and CNI: 5 non-infected lambs). The two treatment groups (T) received L. latisiliquum fodder ad libitum up to D36 when lambs were humanely slaughtered (TI: 6 infected lambs and TNI: 5 non-infected lambs). From D28 to D36 PI, individual fodder consumption and nematode egg excretion were measured daily. At necropsy, abomasal contents were recovered to obtain worm burdens and measure the female worm length and fecundity. Histological samples were taken from the respective abomasums and small intestines to count mucosal inflammatory cells. An increased consumption of TR fodder was observed in the TI vs. the TNI group (P <0.01). Before L. latisiliquum distribution, faecal egg excretion was similar in TI and CI groups. From D29 PI the TI group showed lower faecal egg counts compared to CI group (P <0.02). Although no differences in worm burdens were observed, worms of the TI group were smaller and, according to their size, contained fewer eggs in utero than worms from the CI group (P <0.05). Only minor differences in mucosal inflammatory cells were observed between groups, indicating that the indirect effect was not evident. Thus, a short-term consumption of L. latisiliquum can modulate directly the biology of adult H. contortus affecting the worm size and female fecundity while the worm burdens were not affected. Infected animals ate more L. latisiliquum fodder than non-infected animals. 3aLysiloma latisiliquum 3abioactive properties 3aphytochemicals 3asheep 3anematode infections 3adisease prevention 3asheep feeding 3atropics 3aforage legumes 3acell physiology 3asheep diseases 3afecundity 3aHaemonchus contortus 3atannins 3aanthelmintics 3aintestinal mucosa 3abiochemical mechanisms 3abiological control 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxadministration & dosage 2aBody Sizexphysiology 2aDietxveterinary 2aEating 2aFabaceaexchemistryxphysiology. 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHaemonchiasisxdiet therapyxveterinary. 2aHaemonchusxphysiology 2aIntestinal Mucosaxpathology 2aLarva 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Count 2aPopulation Density 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdiet therapy 2aTanninsxanalysis 2aTreatment Outcome 2aTropical Climate 3aMexico 0ainhibitors1 aVargas-Magaña, J.J.1 aCanul-Ku, H.L.1 aMiranda-Soberanis, R.1 aCapetillo-Leal, C.1 aSandoval-Castro, C.A.1 aHoste, H.1 aTorres-Acosta, J.F.J.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Sept. 20, v. 172, no. 3-4 p.283-290dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.04.0403Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03300naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100001500169245005600184300001400240500002400254500001500278520157300293650001601866650001801882650001901900650002101919650001001940650002801950650001201978650002801990650002202018650001102040650002302051650001102074650003702085650003502122650002002157650001602177650001902193650002602212650001202238650001302250650001602263653002402279653001002303700001302313700001402326700002302340700001602363700001702379773010902396852000902505856009102514930003302605945002502638946001102663655001202674IND4399760720221119133255.0080108e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439976072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF8411 aTuna, A.L.10aSilicon improves salinity tolerance in wheat plants  ap. 10-16.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDurum wheat (Triticum durum cv. Gediz-75) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Izmir-85) were grown in a complete nutrient solution in a growth room to investigate effect of silicone supplied to the nutrient solution on plants grown at salt stress. The experiment was a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two levels of NaCl in nutrient solution, 0 and 100 mM, and two levels of silicone (Si) in nutrient solution, 0.25 and 0.50 mM, as Na2SiO3. The plants grown at 100 mM NaCl produced less dry matter and chlorophyll content than those without NaCl. Supplementary Si at both 0.25 and 0.5 mM ameliorated the negative effects of salinity on plant dry matter and chlorophyll content. Membrane permeability and proline content in leaves increased with addition of 100 mM NaCl and these increases were decreased with Si treatments. Sodium (Na) concentration in plant tissues increased in both leaves and roots of plants in the high NaCl treatment and Si treatments lowered significantly the concentrations of Na in both leaves and roots. Bread wheat was more tolerant to salinity than durum wheat. The accumulation of Na in roots indicates a possible mechanism whereby bread wheat copes with salinity in the rooting medium and/or may indicate the existence of an inhibition mechanism of Na transport to leaves. Concentrations of both Ca and K were lower in the plants grown at high NaCl than in those in the control treatment and these two element concentrations were increased by Si treatments in both shoots and roots but remained lower than control values in most cases. 3adurum wheat 3aion transport 3acell membranes 3aapplication rate 3aroots 3ainterspecific variation 3aproline 3adry matter accumulation 3aTriticum aestivum 3asodium 3anutrient solutions 3aleaves 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3asodium chloride 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3amembrane permeability 3asilicon 3asalinity 3achlorophyll 0aspecies differences 0awheat1 aKaya, C.1 aHiggs, D.1 aMurillo-Amador, B.1 aAydemir, S.1 aGirgin, A.R.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2008 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.10-16dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.06.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02837naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245027100126300001600397500001500413520155600428650001601984650001802000650002002018650003602038650002602074650001702100650001602117653001402133653002802147653001402175653003602189700001502225700001802240700001402258773010102272852000902373930003302382945001302415946001102428655001202439IND2042580020221119131603.0941013e199403  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204258002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaoka, N.10aInduced accessibility and enhanced inaccessibility at the cellular level in barley coleoptiles XIII. Significance of haustorium formation by the pathogen Erysiphe graminis for induced accessibility to the non-pathogen E. pisi as assessed by nutritional manipulations  ap. 217-225.  a2019-12-05  aErysiphe pisi, a non-pathogen of barley, never formed haustoria in fresh, healthy, barley coleoptile epidermal cells, even if cells were in constant contact with E. graminis germling structures, unless the attacked cell contained an haustorium of E. graminis. However, as reported in previous papers, where an haustorium of E. graminis was present in a cell, about 10-50% of E. pisi appressoria formed an haustorium in that cell depending on the timing of invasion by the latter fungus. To investigate the possible role of nutrient depletion in this induced accessibility to E. pisi, the nutritional status of host epidermal cells was manipulated in three ways: (a) tissues were inoculated with E. graminis at high infection densities so that almost all cells contained a haustorium; (b) all host cells adjacent to a cell containing a haustorium of E. graminis were killed by puncturing them with a microneedle: and (c) coleoptile tissues were starved for 6 days. In all three cases, development of secondary hyphae of E. graminis was fully or partially inhibited, unless exogenous glucose or sucrose was added, indicating that infected cells had insufficient sugar to support hyphal growth. In addition, treatments b and c induced accessibility to infection by E. pisi. In both cases, this accessibility was reversed by addition of 0.1 m glucose. These results indicate that accessibility of barley cells to E. pisi is induced by depletion of cell nutrients and that this occurs by prior infection of the cell and haustorium formation by E. graminis. 3acoleoptiles 3aErysiphe pisi 3aHordeum vulgare 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. hordei 3anutrient availability 3apathogenesis 3aappressoria 0ahaustoria 0aintracellular nutrients 0aepidermis 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei1 aToyoda, K.1 aKobayashi, I.1 aKunoh, H.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1994 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.217-225x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01858naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002000151245006100171300001600232500011900248520073500367650002101102650001701123650001301140650001701153650001401170650001801184650001401202650001201216650001501228700001601243700001601259700001601275773014201291856005401433852000901487655001201496IND4511306520221119131448.0150429s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451130652DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.585.582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, M.

A strong relationship was found between the mean shelf life score and the expected proportion of R. occidentalis and R. pileatus in a clone. Best shelf life (weighted mean of 1.1 fruit out of 10 discarded with rot) was found in material that had both R. pileatus and R. occidentalis in its ancestry.

Taken a vineyard at the Shiyang river basin of the Hexi corridor of Gansu Province as an example, this study evaluated the applicability of the Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) method in the arid desert region of northwest China, simulated the variation of vineyard ET by Penman-Monteith (P-M), Shuttle-Wallace (S-W) and Clumping (C) models in this region and compared the estimated ET by the three models with the measured ET by the BREB. Results indicated that the BREB could provide the accurate measurement of vineyard ET from the arid desert region when the Bowen ratio instrument with higher accuracy was correctly installed. Generally, the variation of the estimated ET from P-M, S-W and C models were similar to that of the measured ET by the BREB method. However, the P-M model overestimated the ET significantly; the estimated ET from the S-W and C models, especially from the C model was approximately equal to the measured ET by the BREB. After a rainfall, the performances of the S-W and C models were also good. Therefore, among the three models, the C model was the optimal model in simulating the vineyard ET in the arid region of northwest China. However, after a frost, the C model significantly overestimated the evapotranspiration because the canopy resistance did not fully reflect the dramatic decrease of grapevine transpiration. 3aarid zones 3adeserts 3aevapotranspiration 3asimulation models 3amodel validation 3aaccuracy 3aVitis vinifera 3agrapes 3airrigation water 3awater use efficiency 3aequations 3aspatial variation 3afrost 3aChina1 aKang, Shaozhong1 aLi, Fusheng1 aZhang, Lu0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2008 Sept. 3, v. 148, no. 10 p.1629-1640dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.05.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20081030b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/03  aOther US 7aarticle03133naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100001700178245006300195300001400258500002400272520156000296650001501856650002401871650002601895650002001921650001701941650001701958650002601975650001702001650002302018650001402041650002002055650001902075650002102094650001802115650002102133650002302154650002002177651001102197653001302208700001402221700001602235700001802251700002002269773010902289852000902398856009102407930003302498945002502531946001102556655001202567IND4399761320221119131430.0080108e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439976132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aJ1001 aTingey, D.T.10aDo mesocosms influence photosynthesis and soil respiration  ap. 36-44.  aIncludes references  aMesocosms, enclosed outdoor experimental systems, are commonly used in terrestrial ecology. They are frequently used to study the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on terrestrial ecosystem processes. Despite their advantages and frequent use it is important to verify, through explicit measures, that mesocosms reliably model the larger system. In this study, fully-coupled, soil-litter-plant mesocosms were constructed in Corvallis using native soil and litter, and planted with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco) seedlings. Needle photosynthesis and soil respiration were measured repeatedly over a 21-month period in mesocosms and compared to measurements made at two field sites (Toad Creek and Falls Creek) planted at the same density as the mesocosms. Under the temperature and soil moisture conditions, photosynthetic and soil respiration rates in the mesocosms were not significantly different than the rates at Toad Creek, where the soil and litter in the mesocosms were collected. In contrast, the soil at Falls Creek was different than the soil in the mesocosms and at Toad Creek and photosynthetic and soil respiration rates at Falls Creek were significantly different than at the other two sites. The lack of significant differences between rates measured in the mesocosms in Corvallis and at the Toad Creek field site indicate that the mesocosms did not cause significant artifacts in the data and that the results for these rates in the mesocosms can be extrapolated to field settings with comparable edaphic conditions. 3aecosystems 3aexperimental design 3aenvironmental science 3aphysical models 3aforest soils 3aplant litter 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aforest trees 3aforest plantations 3aseedlings 3aconifer needles 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil respiration 3astand density 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3aedaphic factors 3aOregon 0amesocosm1 aLee, E.H.1 aLewis, J.D.1 aJohnson, M.G.1 aRygiewicz, P.T.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2008 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.36-44dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.07.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02409naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001400135245007700149300001800226500002300244500001500267520132200282650001301604650001301617650001101630650001701641650001901658653002301677653001401700653002601714653001401740700001601754773011201770852000901882856007501891930003301966945001301999946001102012655001202023IND2054554120221119131531.0961219e199607  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205455412DNAL7 a10.1139/x26-1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, P.10aTime trends in genetic control over height and diameter in maritime pine  ap. 1209-1217.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aHeight and diameter of 257 twenty-year-old maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) trees, originating from a factorial mating design, were subdivided in annual height increments (AHI) and annual diameter increments (ADI). Cumulative and annual data of both traits were compared using two different genetic models. The two traits exhibited very different genetic expressions. For cumulative data, the heritability increased steadily with age for height and was very stable for diameter. For annual data, this evolution did not reveal any particular trend for AHI but appeared much more stable for ADI. Different effects seemed to be involved in the variation of annual increments: year and residual effects were 5 and 2.5 times more important for AHI than for ADI, respectively; in contrast, family and individual effects were 10 and 15 times more important for ADI than for AHI, respectively. Serial correlations calculated at the full-sib family mean level also showed different patterns: low values and rapid decrease of correlations for successive AHI, and high values and a linear decrease for successive ADI. As trees aged, the genetic expression of height growth appeared to be more unstable than for diameter growth. Interpretations about these expressions and their consequences for early selection are discussed. 3adiameter 3atree age 3aheight 3aheritability 3aPinus pinaster 0agenetic regulation 0astability 0aplant characteristics 0aincrement1 aDurel, C.E.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g1996 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.1209-1217wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-1353Available from publisher's Web site  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02903naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002400177245008900201300001600290500002400306500001500330520115500345650001701500650001601517650001501533650001601548650001901564650002601583650001601609650001401625650001701639650002601656650001501682650001901697650002601716650002701742650001701769650001801786650001701804650002001821650003601841650002301877653002301900653001601923700002201939700002101961700001701982700001901999773010302018852000902121856009002130930003302220945002502253946001102278655001202289IND4409577520221119131547.0080829e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440957752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aF600 0aX3801 aJansen, Marcel A.K.10aPlant stress and human health: Do human consumers benefit from UV-B acclimated crops  ap. 449-458.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlants are sessile organisms, and consequently cannot avoid exposure to stressful environmental conditions. Exposure to mild stress conditions can induce active acclimation responses, while more severe conditions cause metabolic disruptions. A common plant acclimation response to a variety of environmental stressors is the accumulation of antioxidants and secondary metabolites. For example, ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation impacts on the levels of a broad range of metabolites, including phenolic, terpenoid and alkaloid compounds. Our survey of the literature reveals that the levels of some of these metabolites increase following UV-B exposure, while those of others decrease, change transiently or are differently affected by low and high UV-doses. This includes several compounds that are pharmacologically active and/or nutritionally important. We conclude that the complex patterns of stress-induced changes in plant metabolites need to be studied in more detail to determine impacts on the nutritional and pharmacological characteristics of food products. Claims that UV-B acclimated plants have nutritional benefits are currently unproven. 3aphytosterols 3atocopherols 3apolyamines 3aacclimation 3aplant response 3aultraviolet radiation 3aglutathione 3aalkaloids 3ahuman health 3asecondary metabolites 3ametabolome 3aglucosinolates 3acyanogenic glycosides 3aphysiological response 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aplant stress 3anutritive value 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphenolic compounds 0aliterature reviews 0aisoprenoids1 aHectors, Kathleen1 aO'Brien, Nora M.1 aGuisez, Yves1 aPotters, Geert0 tPlant science.g2008 Oct., v. 175, no. 4 p.449-458dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.04.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20081125b20081206c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/11/25  aNon-US 7aarticle04558naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001900167245012500186300001500311500002400326500001500350520243100365650001002796650002502806650001602831650002002847650001502867650001502882650002002897650001102917650001402928650002502942650001502967650001802982650002703000650002103027650001803048650002103066650002303087650001803110650001703128650001503145650001203160650001103172650003403183650002203217650001103239650003103250650002503281650000903306650006003315650001603375653002303391700001503414700001603429700001603445700001603461700001903477700002103496700001603517700001703533773009603550852000903646856008803655930003303743945002503776946001103801655001203812IND4442263120221119131529.0100910e20101011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226312DNAL7 a206095192pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolleson, D.R.10aEffects of a lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) burden on performance and metabolic indicators in growing beef steers  ap. 99-106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe examined the response of selected animal performance, endocrine, immune, and metabolic factors from 13 steers (254±6.1kg) with and without a lone star (Amblyomma americanum) tick burden during progressive days of the tick feeding cycle. Steers were randomly assigned to either non-treated controls or treated with 300 adult pair of A. americanum per animal. Animals were weighed and blood sampled on days −7, 0, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 35 relative to tick treatment. Tick treatment did not affect (P <0.1) animal performance. Experimental day did (P <0.05) affect body weight gain and dry matter intake. Tick treatment did not affect (P <0.1) metabolic indicators. Experimental day affected (P <0.05) IGF1 and lactate, tended to affect cortisol (P <0.07), but did not affect (P <0.1) glucose concentrations. Tick treatment did not significantly (P <0.1) affect growth hormone receptor (GHR) mRNA in liver, but liver tissue from treated animals had numerically lower GHR mRNA than did tissue from control animals. Day had a significant (P <0.05) effect on liver GHR mRNA. There was a significant treatment by day interaction (P <0.05) for liver IGF1 gene expression, as IGF1 mRNA was reduced in tick-treated cattle versus control cattle on day 35. Overall, liver IGF1 gene expression was lower (P <0.05) in tick than in control animals while there was no effect (P >0.1) due to day. Within the tick-treated group, correlations were found between quantitative female tick feeding characteristics and host metabolic indicators. Feeding by adult female lone star ticks did cause acute stress in growing beef steers on a moderate plane of nutrition as indicated by some physiologic indicators. In particular there may be longer term effects on the somatotrophic axis in the liver which could affect subsequent (i.e. feedlot) performance. It is not known how these observed effects would be manifest under a lower plane of nutrition, as is common and may become more so within the current native range of A. americanum. Other acute effects due to tick feeding may have been masked by the effects of handling and invasive sampling. Non-invasive experimental procedures are called for in order to study the effects of a stressor such as arthropod infestation on grazing animals. Future research efforts will be aimed at non-invasively elucidating the effects of tick stress on grazing animals under various nutritional environments. 3aticks 3adevelopmental stages 3abeef cattle 3acattle diseases 3aparasitism 3abiomarkers 3aliveweight gain 3asteers 3afinishing 3aAmblyomma americanum 3ametabolism 3ahealth status 3aphysiological response 3aendocrine system 3aimmune system 3astress tolerance 3anutritional status 3aanimal stress 3atherapeutics 3aacaricides 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxparasitology 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aIxodidaexphysiology 2aMale 2aTick Infestationsxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aWeight Gain 0aanimal performance1 aTeel, P.D.1 aStuth, J.W.1 aStrey, O.F.1 aWelsh, T.H.1 aCarstens, G.E.1 aLongnecker, M.T.1 aBanik, K.K.1 aPrince, S.D.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Oct. 11, v. 173, no. 1-2 p.99-106dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02471naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001700167245008200184300001600266500002400282520111600306650002201422650001701444650001601461650002501477650002001502650002101522650001701543650001201560650002401572650002101596650000801617650002501625650002401650650001401674650002201688651001101710653001801721773008301739852000901822856008901831930003301920945002501953946001101978655001201989IND4399764220221119131609.0080108e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439976422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2006.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE720 0aX1001 aDurevall, D.10aDemand for coffee in Sweden: The role of prices, preferences and market power  ap. 566-584.  aIncludes references  aThere is a widespread belief that consumer coffee prices are high relative to bean prices and that lower consumer prices would lead to substantial increases in bean exports from Third-World countries. This issue is evaluated by analysing how retail prices, preferences and market power influence coffee demand in Sweden. A demand function is estimated for the period 1968-2002 and used, together with information on import prices of coffee beans, to simulate an oligopoly model. This approach gives estimates of the maximum average degree of market power and shows how coffee demand would react to reductions in marginal cost to its minimum level. The maximum level of market power is found to be low, but it generates large spreads between consumer and bean prices because the price elasticity has low absolute values. Moreover, the impact of a price decrease would be small because long-run coffee demand is dominated by changes in the population structure in combination with different preferences across age groups. Hence, a change to perfect competition would only have a negligible effect on bean imports. 3acoffee (beverage) 3acoffee beans 3afood prices 3aconsumer preferences 3aconsumer demand 3aretail marketing 3amarket power 3aimports 3ademand elasticities 3ademand functions 3aage 3apopulation structure 3apopulation dynamics 3aoligopoly 3asimulation models 3aSweden 0aretail prices0 tFood policy.g2007 , v. 32, no. 5-6 p.566-584dPergamon Pressx0306-91927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2006.11.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd5CTe2008/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02383naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245007000151300001800221500002300239520123300262650002301495650001801518650001301536650001901549650002301568650002801591650002301619651002001642653001601662653003001678653002001708700001901728773009701747852000901844856007501853930003301928945001301961946001101974655001201985IND2054553320221119131627.0961219e199607  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205455332DNAL7 a10.1139/x26-1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrack, C.L.12aA test of knowledge-based forest operations scheduling procedures  ap. 1193-1202.  aSummary in French.  aFive knowledge-based approaches (three search routines and two expert systems) to forest operations scheduling were compared with mathematical programming (linear programming and mixed integer programming) and simulation approaches for two plantation forests in New South Wales, Australia. Strategies produced using these approaches were compared on the basis of scores for timber volume flow, scenic beauty, stand health, and water quality. Timber flow scores were highest for the linear programming strategies, but some of the strategies produced by the knowledge-based approaches scored almost as high. The timber flow scores for the mixed integer programming strategies were exceeded by some of the knowledge-based strategies, because of the approximations required to achieve mixed integer programming solutions for larger problems. The knowledge-based approaches could produce higher scoring strategies for the other criteria than the mathematical programming or simulation approaches. The multiple strategies produced by two of the search procedures, and the goal hierarchy incorporated into the expert systems, allow the user to make explicit trade-offs among strategies in terms of performance for the various criteria. 3aforest plantations 3aPinus radiata 3aplanning 3aexpert systems 3aintensive forestry 3asilvicultural practices 3alinear programming 3aNew South Wales 0acomparisons 0amixed integer programming 0asearch routines1 aMarshall, P.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1996 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.1193-1202x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-1333Available from publisher's Web site  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle03315naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002200167245010400189300001400293500002400307500001500331520083500346650002001181650001701201650001001218650001901228650003101247650002101278650000801299650002401307650001301331650002501344650001501369650002001384650001801404650002101422650001301443650000901456650001901465650002301484650002501507650001801532650001201550650004401562650002601606650002401632650001101656650004701667650001001714650002901724650002401753650000901777650000901786650004501795650002301840650003501863650000901898650001701907653002701924653001901951653001501970700002801985700002902013700003502042700002302077700002702100700003002127700002502157700003002182773009502212852000902307856008802316930003302404945002502437946001102462655001202473IND4442263020221119131643.0100910e20101011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226302DNAL7 a206095262pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacedo, Iara T.F.10aAnthelmintic effect of Eucalyptus staigeriana essential oil against goat gastrointestinal nematodes  ap. 93-98.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of Eucalyptus staigeriana essential oil (EsEO).

Blood samples from free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on two ranches in LaSalle and Webb Counties were screened for B. bovis and other hemoparasites by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the piroplasm 18S rDNA. Serology was conducted on selected samples to detect antibody activity to B. bovis by the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). PCR revealed that 16% of the LaSalle County samples and 4% of the Webb County samples were positive for B. bovis. Five of the LaSalle County and the two Webb County B. bovis 18S rDNA amplicons were cloned and sequenced. The resulting clones shared 99% identity to B. bovis 18S rRNA gene sequences derived from cattle isolates. Weak seroreactivity to B. bovis was shown by the IFAT. The samples were also screened for additional hemoparasites of deer including Theileria cervi, Babesia odocoilei and other Babesia spp. A genotypically unique Theileria sp. was found, along with T. cervi and B. odocoilei. The finding of putative B. bovis in white-tailed deer necessitates further study to determine if deer may act as a transient host or even a reservoir of infection for B. bovis pathogenic to cattle. 3acattle diseases 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aribosomal DNA 3aTheileria 3arisk assessment 3awild animals 3ascreening 3amixed infection 3aepidemiological studies 3aBabesia bovis 3ababesiosis 3ahosts 3acattle 3apolymerase chain reaction 3awildlife diseases 3amolecular epidemiology 3afluorescent antibody technique 3adisease reservoirs 3aserodiagnosis 3adisease transmission 3adeer 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aBabesia bovisxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBabesiosisxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aDeer 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPrevalence 2aProtozoan Infections, Animalxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTheileriaxisolation & purification 3aTexas 0aTexas 0aBabesia 0aimmunofluorescent antibody test 0aTheileria cervi 0aBabesia odocoilei1 aCooper, Susan M.1 aHolman, Patricia J.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Sept. 20, v. 172, no. 3-4 p.214-220dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.05.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03616naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178072000900187100002500196245011700221300001800338500002400356500001500380520180900395650002202204650002402226650002102250650002302271650002602294650002202320650001202342650002502354650001402379650002402393650002202417650001802439650002902457650001502486650001602501650001902517650001402536651001102550653002702561653001802588700002502606700001802631700001702649700001602666700001402682773012302696852000902819856009102828930003302919945002502952946001302977655001202990IND4409576320221119131455.0080829e20080903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440957632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aP210 0aF600 0aX100 0aB2001 aTeixeira, A.H. de C.10aEnergy and water balance measurements for water productivity analysis in irrigated mango trees, Northeast Brazil  ap. 1524-1537.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCrop water parameters, including actual evapotranspiration, transpiration, soil evaporation, crop coefficients, evaporative fractions, aerodynamic resistances, surface resistances and percolation fluxes were estimated in a commercial mango orchard during two growing seasons in Northeast Brazil. The actual evapotranspiration (E a) was obtained by the eddy covariance (EC) technique, while for the reference evapotranspiration (E ₀); the FAO Penman-Monteith equation was applied. The energy balance closure showed a gap of 12%. For water productivity analysis the E a was then computed with the Bowen ratio determined from the eddy covariance fluxes. The mean accumulated E a for the two seasons was 1419mmyear⁻¹, which corresponded to a daily average rate of 3.7mmday⁻¹. The mean values of the crop coefficients based on evapotranspiration (K c) and based on transpiration (K cb) were 0.91 and 0.73, respectively. The single layer K c was fitted with a degree days function. Twenty percent of evapotranspiration originated from direct soil evaporation. The evaporative fraction was 0.83 on average. The average relative water supply was 1.1, revealing that, in general, irrigation water supply was in good harmony with the crop water requirements. The resulting evapotranspiration deficit was 73-95mm per season only. The mean aerodynamic resistance (r a) was 37sm⁻¹ and the bulk surface resistance (r s) was 135sm⁻¹. The mean unit yield was 45tonneha⁻¹ being equivalent to a crop water productivity of 3.2kgm⁻³ when based on E a with an economic counterpart of US$ 3.27m⁻³. The drawback of this highly productive use of water resources is an unavoidable percolation flux of approximately 300mm per growing season that is detrimental to the downstream environment and water users. 3asurface roughness 3amathematical models 3aMangifera indica 3aevapotranspiration 3aplant available water 3aeconomic analysis 3amangoes 3awater use efficiency 3aequations 3aventilation systems 3airrigated farming 3atranspiration 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3acrop yield 3aevaporation 3aenergy balance 3aheat sums 3aBrazil 0aeddy covariance method 0awater balance1 aBastiaanssen, W.G.M.1 aMoura, M.S.B.1 aSoares, J.M.1 aAhmad, M.D.1 aBos, M.G.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2008 Sept. 3, v. 148, no. 10 p.1524-1537dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.05.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20081030b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/03  aOther US 7aarticle03535naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001500167245013600182300001600318500002400334500001500358520108200373650002301455650002401478650001801502650002401520650001301544650002001557650001701577650001001594650001801604650001401622650002301636650002801659650000901687650001301696650000901709650003501718650001501753650001801768650001701786650002301803650002001826650003601846650001201882650002801894650004301922650000901965650005701974650005602031650003202087650003002119651001202149651002702161653001602188653003002204653003902234653001502273653003402288700002202322700002102344700001902365700001802384700002002402700002402422700001902446773009802465852000902563856008802572930003302660945002502693946001102718655001202729IND4442263620221119131534.0100910e20100920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226362DNAL7 a206274162pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdel, Amel10aCanine leishmaniasis in Algeria: True prevalence and diagnostic test characteristics in groups of dogs of different functional type  ap. 204-213.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA Bayesian approach was used to assess the prevalence of Canine leishmaniasis and evaluate three serological diagnostic tests: indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), direct agglutination test, and particle gel immuno-assay (PaGIA) for Canine leishmaniasis (CL) in Algiers. Four hundred and sixty-two dogs were involved in this study and divided in four groups according to their functional type: stray dogs, farm dogs, national guard dogs and pet dogs. The stray dog group showed the highest prevalence of leishmaniasis (11.7%), followed by the national guard dogs (9.7%) and the farm dogs (5.9%). IFAT was shown to be the most sensitive test in all groups. However, IFAT specificity was considerably lowered in the farm dog group: 65.2% versus 94.5% for the stray dogs. A considerable drop in PaGIA specificity was noted in the stray dogs group. The results of the current study demonstrate the variability of test characteristics in different situations and underline the danger of using standard values, without verifying their appropriateness for the specific purposes. 3aat-risk population 3aagglutination tests 3aleishmaniasis 3aLeishmania infantum 3avalidity 3aworking animals 3aimmunoassays 3afarms 3astray animals 3ascreening 3astatistical models 3aepidemiological studies 3adogs 3avariance 3apets 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahouseholds 3aserodiagnosis 3adog diseases 3adisease prevalence 3aBayesian theory 2aAgglutination Testsxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aDogs 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirectxveterinary 2aLeishmaniasisxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 3aAlgeria 0aAlgeriaxepidemiology. 0arisk groups 0adirect agglutination test 0aindirect fluorescent antibody test 0aguard dogs 0aparticle gel immunoassay test1 aSaegerman, Claude1 aSpeybroeck, Niko1 aPraet, Nicolas1 aVictor, Bjorn1 aDe Deken, Redgi1 aSoukehal, Abdelkrim1 aBerkvens, Dirk0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Sept. 20, v. 172, no. 3-4 p.204-213dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.05.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02872naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245013700154300001800291500002300309520165200332650001501984650002301999650001502022650001602037650002102053650002302074650001502097651001502112653001602127653001602143700001702159700001402176700001802190773011302208852000902321856007502330930003302405945001302438946001102451655001202462IND2057309920221119131607.0970527e199609  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205730992DNAL7 a10.1139/x26-1752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnekonda, T.S.10aSelection for biomass production based on respiration parameters in eucalypts: effects of origin and growth climates on growth rates  ap. 1556-1568.  aSummary in French.  aSeventeen Eucalyptus species and 30 rapid-growing Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees (referred to as plus trees), growing in a plantation were studied to examine relationships among measured plant growth and respiratory parameters, geographical origins, and growth climate. The respiratory parameters measured at two different temperatures by isothermal calorimetry were metabolic heat rate, rate of CO2 production, and the ratio of heat rate to CO2 rate. Metabolic heat rate was also measured as a continuous function of temperature by differential scanning calorimetry in the range of 10 to 40 degrees C. Tree growth was measured as rates of height and stem volume growth. The values of respiratory and growth variables of Eucalyptus species are significantly correlated with latitude and altitude of origin of their seed sources. The maximum metabolic heat rate, the temperature of the maximum heat rate, the temperature coefficients of metabolic rate, and the temperatures at which the slopes of Arrhenius plots change are all genetically determined parameters that vary both within and among species. Measurement of growth rate - respiration rate - temperature relationships guide understanding of why relative growth rates of Eucalyptus species and individual genotypes differ with climate, making it possible to identify genotypes best suited for rapid growth in different climates. The temperature dependence of respiration rates is an important factor determining relative growth rates of eucalypts in different climates. To achieve optimum biomass production the temperature dependence of individual plants must be matched to growth climate. 3aEucalyptus 3aforest plantations 3aprovenance 3atemperature 3aclimatic factors 3abiomass production 3aplus trees 3aCalifornia 0arespiration 0agrowth rate1 aHansen, L.D.1 aBacca, M.1 aCriddle, R.S.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g1996 Sept., v. 26, no. 9 p.1556-1568wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-1753Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02459naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002200161245010200183300001600285500001500301520120700316650001701523650001701540650001401557650001401571650002301585650002401608650002201632650002301654650002201677650001601699650002501715650002901740651001201769653001501781653002501796700001801821773008201839852000901921930003301930945002501963946001301988655001202001IND4423762720221119131632.0090727e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442376272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

All fountain grass cultivars except Rubrum Dwarf fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum) and Red Buttons fountain grass (Pennisetum messiacum) achieved flower ratings of 3 to 5 in both locations during the first growing season. During the second growing season, chinese fountain grass (Pennisetum alopecuroides), 'Cassian' chinese fountain grass (P. alopecuroides), 'Hameln' chinese fountain grass (P. alopecuroides), and 'Red Buttons' fountain grass flowered better in northern Florida, and green fountain grass (P. setaceum) and 'Rubrum Dwarf' fountain grass flowered better in southern Florida. Visual quality of chinese fountain grass and its cultivars generally declined in October without resuming growth through May. 'Little Bunny' chinese fountain grass (P. alopecuroides) and oriental pennisetum (Pennisetum orientale) declined dramatically during the first season and did not survive the 84-week study in northern or southern Florida. 'Rubrum' fountain grass (P. setaceum) and 'Rubrum Dwarf' fountain grass did not produce any seeds. 3aplant growth 3acrop quality 3aflowering 3acultivars 3aornamental grasses 3aPennisetum setaceum 3aseed productivity 3aseasonal variation 3agenetic variation 3alandscaping 3aPennisetum orientale 3aPennisetum alopecuroides 3aFlorida 0aPennisetum 0aPennisetum messiacum1 aKnox, Gary W.0 tHortTechnology.g2009 , v. 19, no. 2 p.471-476wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20090905b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/08/12  aOther US 7aarticle02585naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245008700151300001800238500002300256500001500279520138200294650001101676650002001687650001301707650001701720650001801737650001001755650002101765650001101786651001301797653001001810653001701820700002001837700002201857700001801879773011301897852000902010856007502019930003302094945001302127946001102140655001202151IND2057308620221119131650.0970527e199609  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205730862DNAL7 a10.1139/x26-1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyce, R.L.10aDirect canopy nitrogen uptake from 15N-labeled wet deposition by mature red spruce  ap. 1539-1547.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aWe applied 15N-labeled ammonium and nitrate to individual branches of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) to examine the importance of canopy N assimilation in the field. Levels of labeled N were highest in the youngest foliage and youngest twigs, and twig ammonium assimilation exceeded nitrate assimilation. Approximately 5% of the ammonium and 1% of the nitrate applied to each branch was assimilated; because of throughfall interactions with multiple branches, canopy assimilation rates are expected to be 3-6 times larger. Twig 15N levels exceeded foliar levels for the younger age-classes in the ammonium-labeled treatments, suggesting that twigs play an important role in ammonium assimilation. Comparisons of these results with data from trees that assimilated 15N through their roots showed that the pattern of canopy N assimilation differs from root assimilation, primarily by the assimilation of large amounts of N by twigs. Our results directly demonstrate for the first time that canopy assimilation is a pathway for uptake of N in these high-elevation trees. Canopy assimilation of atmospherically deposited N may represent 2-8% of the total N requirement for spruce in the high-elevation forest. While canopy N assimilation may thus reflect only a minor anthropogenic alteration of N acquisition in these forests, the long-term fate of this N needs to be determined. 3acanopy 3anutrient uptake 3abranches 3aPicea rubens 3aair pollution 3aroots 3aammonium nitrate 3aleaves 3aNew York 0astems 0aassimilation1 aFriedland, A.J.1 aChamberlain, C.P.1 aPoulson, S.R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g1996 Sept., v. 26, no. 9 p.1539-1547wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-1733Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02573naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002000140245018700160300001600347500001500363520129500378650001401673650003001687650001101717650002401728650003001752650002701782650002401809650002201833651001401855653001701869653003101886700001701917700001801934773008801952852000902040856008002049939003302129946001302162655001202175IND8905968220221119133721.0891101e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890596822DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/82.4.9892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubramanyam, B.10aOrganophosphate resistance in adults of red flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and sawtoothed grain beetle (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) infesting barley stored on farms in Minnesota  ap. 989-995.  a2019-12-04  aFour strains of adult red flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and six strains of adult sawtoothed grain beetles, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), infesting barley stored on farms in Minnesota were surveyed for resistance to malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, and chlorpyrifos-methyl. Adults were exposed to filter papers impregnated with each of the insecticides. Dose-response and discriminating-dose test procedures were used to evaluate pirimiphos-methyl and chlorpyrifos-methyl resistance. Dose-response and discriminating-dose tests indicated malathion resistance in all field strains of T. castaneum, but not in O. surinamensis field strains. T. castaneum strains did not show cross-resistance to pirimiphos-methyl or chlorpyrifos-methyl. All six O. surinamensis strains were susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl, but four strains showed reduced susceptibility (tolerance) to chlorpyrifos-methyl. The use of synergists in combination with malathion on T. castaneum strains and with chlorpyrifos-methyl on the four O. surinamensis strains indicated that carboxylesterase was involved in detoxifying malathion in resistant T. castaneum adults, whereas oxidases and esterases other than carboxylesterase were involved in detoxifying chlorpyrifos-methyl in tolerant O. surinamensis adults. 3amalathion 3aOryzaephilus surinamensis 3abarley 3aTribolium castaneum 3astored product protection 3ainsecticide resistance 3achlorpyrifos-methyl 3apirimiphos-methyl 3aMinnesota 0afarm storage 0aorganophosphorus compounds1 aHarein, P.K.1 aCutkomp, L.K.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1989 Aug., v. 82, no. 4 p.989-995x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/82.4.9893Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01809naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245003800133300001600171520100000187650001601187650001701203650000901220650001201229650001401241650001501255650001001270650001901280650001101299650002701310773007101337852000901408939003301417945000801450946001301458655001201471991564052160742620221119131717.0920506e19920321xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920015242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelberg, H.10aLow serum cholesterol and suicide  ap. 727-729.  aPrimary prevention trials which have shown that the lowering of serum cholesterol concentrations in middle-aged subjects by diet, drugs, or both leads to a decrease in coronary heart disease have also reported an increase in deaths due to suicide or violence. There has been no adequate explanation for this association. I have reviewed the relevant published work and describe a physiological mechanism that might account for this curious finding. One of the functions of serotonin in the central nervous system is the suppression of harmful behavioural impulses. When mouse brain synaptosomal membrane cholesterol is increased there is a pronounced increase in the number of serotonin receptors. Low membrane cholesterol decreases the number of serotonin receptors. Since membrane cholesterol exchanges freely with cholesterol in the surrounding medium, a lowered serum cholesterol concentration may contribute to a decrease in brain serotonin, with poorer suppression of aggressive behaviour. 3acholesterol 3ablood plasma 3adiet 3asuicide 3aserotonin 3aaggression 3adrugs 3achemoreceptors 3ahumans 3aanimal experimentation0 tLancet.g1992 Mar. 21, v. 339, no. 8795 p.727-729x0099-53557nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01499naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245013100131300001600262520046400278650000900742650002000751650002100771650001100792650001200803653001600815653002000831653001800851700001600869700001700885700001700902700001400919700001900933773008500952852001301037939003301050945000801083946001301091852000901104655001201113991564051980742620221119131829.0920505e199204  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920015222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFried, M.D.10aDecrease in gastric emptying time and episodes of regurgitation in children with spastic quadriplegia fed a whey-based formula  ap. 569-572.  aThe gastric emptying times associated with three whey-based formulas were significantly shorter than that associated with a casein-based formula in nine gastrostomy-fed patients with spastic quadriplegia (p <0.001).

In this study, we investigated the effects of a high-fat diet on a diabetic rat model, Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT), which develops diabetes due to decreased insulin production and secretion with age. We hypothesized that a high-fat diet would accelerate the induction of diabetes in this model. The SDT rats were divided into 2 groups, which were fed a high-fat diet or standard diet for 16 weeks. The group fed a high-fat diet developed obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia until 16 weeks of age. Before 16 weeks of age, hyperglycemia accompanied by hypoinsulinemia developed in the group on a standard diet, but serum glucose levels were comparable in both groups. After 16 weeks of age, the group on a standard diet showed an increase in serum glucose levels and a decrease in serum insulin levels. Unexpectedly, in the group on the high-fat diet, we observed a suppressed of the progression of hyperglycemia/hypoinsulinemia. Histopathological observation revealed more pancreatic beta cells in the group on the high-fat diet. This study suggests that feeding SDT rats a high-fat diet induces obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, but not hyperglycemia, until 16 weeks of age. Thereafter, age-dependent progress of hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia was delayed by a high-fat diet. The hyperfunction of pancreatic beta cells induced by a high-fat diet before the onset of hyperglycemia appears to suppress development of hyperglycemia/hypoinsulinemia. 3ahigh fat diet 3ahormone secretion 3adietary fat 3ahyperlipidemia 3ablood lipids 3ahistopathology 3aislets of Langerhans 3ablood glucose 3aglycolipids 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aanimal models 3aobesity 3ainsulin 3arats 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperinsulinemia 3aanimal age 3adisease course 2aAdipose Tissuexpathology 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Weight 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xpathologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aGlucagon-Like Peptide 1xblood 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aPancreasxpathology 2aProteinuriaxurine 2aRats 0ablood chemistry1 aOhta, Takeshi1 aSasase, Tomohiko1 aMorinaga, Hisayo1 aHata, Takahiro1 aMiyajima, Katsuhiro1 aKatusda, Yoshiaki1 aMasuyama, Taku1 aShinohara, Masami1 aKakutani, Makoto1 aMatsushita, Mutsuyoshi0 tNutrition research.g2010 July, v. 30, no. 7 p.483-491dElsevier Science Inc.x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2010.06.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20110404b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/02/01  aOther US 7aarticle02614naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002900176245019100205300001600396500002400412520080800436650001701244650002101261650002901282650002301311650004301334650001101377650001301388650001401401650001801415650001601433650001401449650003301463650005001496650004201546650001401588650002901602650002401631650001601655650003001671653005401701700002101755700003101776773009901807852000901906856008801915930003302003945002502036946001102061655001202072IND4409567820221119131627.0080829e20080912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440956782DNAL7 a186921912pmid7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aLuna Erreguerena, Pilar.10aGas chromatography and silver-ion high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of conjugated linoleic acid isomers in free fatty acid form using sulphuric acid in methanol as catalyst  ap. 110-113.  aIncludes references  aThis study used GC and silver-ion HPLC to examine the effects of temperature and time on methylation of individual and mixtures of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers in free fatty acid form using sulphuric acid as catalyst.

Best practice generally identifies that local seed are best, but how far does the local provenance extend? Using the DNA fingerprinting technique amplified fragment length polymorphism, we assessed genetic differentiation between potential seed source populations and the target population, Bold Park, a large and significant bushland remnant in Perth, Western Australia. For each of 15 species, analysis of molecular variance was used to partition genetic variation within and among populations. Genetic differentiation between Bold Park and potential seed source populations was assessed by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination, and statistically by Fisher's exact tests. The partitioning of variation among populations ([Phi][subscript ST]) varied from 0.66 for Santalum acuminatum to 0.04 for Mesomelaena pseudostygia. For eight of 15 species, Bold Park plants were completely or largely non-overlapping with other populations in ordinations, suggesting genetic differentiation and a narrow provenance. Five species showed overlap between Bold Park and some other, but not all, populations sampled, with geographically closest populations generally undifferentiated. Only two species, Acanthocarpus preissii and Mesomeleana pseudostygia, showed little genetic differentiation between Bold Park and all other populations, suggesting a regional genetic provenance. These species can be classified into three broad provenance classes - narrow, local and regional - to help guide decisions about appropriate seed-collection zones for the rehabilitation of urban bushland remnants. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aseeds 3aplant communities 3aurban areas 3aprovenance 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic variation 3aWestern Australia 0aplants1 aHood, Peter1 aAlacs, Erika A.1 aDixon, K.

However, previous studies identified different mechanisms that may compromise the sample's representativeness, such as volatilization and sorption. This issue is particularly important when dealing with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as in gasoline spills. Ethanol is common in modern fuels and so may be present in ground water contamination from fuel releases. The objective of this work was to evaluate the losses of VOCs in the presence of ethanol when using porous suction samplers. Laboratory experiments were performed using a ceramic porous suction sampler to sample test solution containing benzene, toluene, xylenes, trimethylbenzenes, naphthalene, and different volumetric fractions of ethanol. Significant losses were found up to 30% for ethylbenzene. Ethanol was found to affect the accuracy of the readings by two main mechanisms: first, negatively, by increasing the headspace in the sampling tube, and second, positively, increasing partition to the aqueous phase due to the cosolvent effect and therefore decreasing the mass loss by volatilization. As a consequence, the highest losses of VOCs were found at intermediate ethanol volume fractions: 10% and 20% (v/v). The losses can be anticipated by measuring the ratio of gas to water in the sampling line and then by applying simple partition models considering cosolvency by ethanol. The importance of adequate purging when using porous suction samplers was also shown. 3avolatile organic compounds 3asamplers 3aethanol 3aequipment design 3avadose zone 3aequipment performance 3abenzene 3agroundwater contamination 3atoluene 3axylene 3anaphthalene 3alaboratories1 aBarker, James F.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g2008 Summer, v. 28, no. 3 p.83-92dBlackwell Publishing Incx1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.2008.00207.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100826b20100903c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/07/28  aOther US 7aarticle03729naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137072000900155072000900164072000900173100001800182245005500200300001600255500002400271500001500295520213100310650002402441650001202465650002202477650001202499650001302511650001302524650002102537650002602558650001702584650001502601650001302616653001702629653002602646653002202672653003102694653001802725653001502743653003302758653002302791700001502814700001902829700001702848700001702865773009602882852000902978856009502987930003303082945002503115946001103140655001203151IND4399755620221119131807.0080108e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439975562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2007.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aX100 0aP1101 aSerrano, J.M.10aTractor energy requirements in disc harrow systems  ap. 286-296.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSoil-working operations in conventional farming systems involving the use of the tractor are some of the operations that incur the highest energy costs. The sustainability of such systems requires a strictly controlled management of resources leading to a significant reduction in crop-production costs derived from savings in fuel consumption. The configuration of the tractor-harrow combination, based on the measurement of the draught required under operational conditions, provides the manufacturers with a reliable indication of the recommended power required for each model of harrow produced. With this type of information farmers can take decisions regarding the selection of a suitable tractor-implement combination for their farms. As a consequence there is improved tractor-harrow productivity and field efficiency. This study centred on the validation of the mathematical models used to estimate the draught of disc harrows in medium-textured soils presented by ASABE. A 3-year research project was developed to study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. The field tests were performed under real working conditions, using more than 20 four-wheel-drive tractors and trailed disc harrows combinations, in different soil types. The tractors were instrumented and the measured parameters were as follows: forward speed, slip, engine speed, draught and fuel consumption per hour. The tractors were also submitted to dynamometer tests measuring PTO power and speed, and engine fuel consumption. The results led to the development of a quadratic equation, that corresponds to an adaptation of the linear model of ASABE, to estimate the draught of the disc harrows in undisturbed loamy soils, not only as a function of implement mass and soil type, but also as a function of speed, working depth and soil conditions. Under these conditions, a ratio of tractor power to implement width of 25-33 kW m-1 is suggested. The data also show the existence of a linear relationship between the fuel consumption per hectare and the specific draught, for the range of 4-9 kN m-1, valid for dry, undisturbed loamy soils. 3amathematical models 3aharrows 3apower requirement 3atillage 3atractors 3avelocity 3amodel validation 3aequipment performance 3asoil texture 3aloam soils 3adynamics 0adisc harrows 0amedium-textured soils 0aslip engine speed 0aenergy use and consumption 0aforward speed 0asoil types 0atractor performance monitors 0atillage implements1 aPeca, J.O.1 aSilva, J.M. da1 aPinheiro, A.1 aCarvalho, M.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2007 Nov., v. 98, no. 3 p.286-296dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2007.08.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03138naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100002200159245014200181300001800323500002400341500001500365520115200380650000901532650002201541650001201563650001301575650002101588650001701609650002701626650001801653650002501671650001101696650002701707650002301734650001901757650002101776650002101797650001001818651001001828653001801838653002601856653002101882653002701903653002701930653002301957653002801980653002302008653002302031653004202054653002402096653002002120700001102140700001202151700001402163700001302177773010602190852000902296856009002305930003302395945002502428946001102453655001202464IND4399755320221119131806.0080108e20080415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439975532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5021 aLu, Ponzy,d1942-10aFlavour differences of cooked longissimus muscle from Chinese indigenous pig breeds and hybrid pig breed (Duroc x Landrace x Large White)  ap. 1529-1537.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objectives of this study were to investigate the flavour quality and volatile aroma compounds of cooked longissimus muscle from five typical Chinese indigenous pig breeds: Lantang (LT), Dahuabai (HB), Laiwu (LW), Rongchang (RC), Tongcheng (TC) and typical hybrid pig breed Duroc x Landrace x Large White (DLW). The chemical compositions of the main meat flavour precursors of the longissimus muscle from all six breeds were also examined. Distinct differences in amino acid composition and fatty acid composition of longissimus muscle, between the breeds, were observed. Among all six breeds, LW and RC had the highest intramuscular fat content and the lowest crude protein content; DLW had the lowest longissimus muscle fat content and the highest crude protein content. One-way analysis of variance showed that 23 volatile compounds were significantly affected by breed. Sensory analysis indicated that cooked longissimus muscle from DLW had the lowest pork flavour intensity and flavour-liking, compared with the Chinese indigenous breeds.

The main problems affecting final hard candies quality as regards the cooling process are: deformation, fragility and aggregation. The main operating conditions of the cooling stage are temperature and velocity of cooling air as well as the residence time of candy inside the tunnel. The objective of this work is to study the influence of process operating conditions and candy composition on the unsteady behavior of the cooling process of hard candies to improve final product quality. The study is conducted by using a simple mathematical model which was implemented and solved by using gPROMS (general Process Modeling System). A detailed discussion of results is presented through several examples. 3amathematical models 3afood processing quality 3afood processing equipment 3acooling 3acandy 3afood processing 3aenvironmental factors 3aduration 3afood composition 3avelocity 3atemperature 3aair flow 3athermal properties 0aoptimization 0aoperating conditions 0afood quality1 aMussati, Sergio1 aScenna, Nicolas J.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 Dec., v. 101, no. 4 p.409-416dElsevier Science Pub.

Radiocarbon signatures of live and dead fine (<2 mm diameter) roots in two mature Amazon tropical forests are consistent with average ages of 4-11 years (ranging from <1 to >40 years). Measurements of ¹⁴C in the structural tissues of roots known to have grown during 2002 demonstrate that new roots are constructed from recent (<2-year-old) photosynthetic products. High [Delta]¹⁴C values in live roots most likely indicate the mean lifetime of the root rather than the isotopic signature of inherited C or C taken up from the soil. Estimates of the mean residence time of C in forest fine roots (inventory divided by loss rate) are substantially shorter (1-3 years) than the age of standing fine root C stocks obtained from radiocarbon (4-11 years). By assuming positively skewed distributions for root ages, we can effectively decouple the mean age of C in live fine roots (measured using ¹⁴C) from the rate of C flow through the live root pool, and resolve these apparently disparate estimates of root C dynamics. Explaining the ¹⁴C values in soil pore space CO₂, in addition, requires that a portion of the decomposing roots be cycled through soil organic matter pools with decadal turnover time. 3acarbon dioxide 3aradionuclides 3arhizosphere 3aradiolabeling 3atropical soils 3asoil organic matter 3atropical forests 3aforest litter 3acarbon 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 3aforest soils 3abiological activity in soil 3agas emissions 3abiodegradation 3aroots 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aroot respiration 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aCosta, Enir Salazar Da1 aNepstad, Daniel C.1 aBarbosa De Camargo, Plínio1 aMartinelli, Luiz A.1 aRay, David1 aRestom, Teresa1 aSilver, Whendee0 tGlobal change biology.g2006 Feb., v. 12, no. 2 p.217-229dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001063.x3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001063.x  a20060420b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle01736naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245009700158300001600255520070500271650002000976650002300996650001901019650002001038650001901058650001701077650002101094650001101115650002201126700001501148773008801163852000901251856008001260939003301340946001301373655001201386IND8904401820221119131426.0890817e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890440182DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/82.3.9422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeyeye, O.A.10aBioactivity of Liriope muscari (Liliaceae) extracts to corn earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 942-947.  aArtificial diets fortified with varying concentrations of Liriope muscari Bailey foliage and fed to corn earworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie), caused symptoms similar to those induced by consumption of the nonprotein amino acid L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid.

The circular geometry of the boreholes is three-dimensional, and inversion routines are typically two-dimensional. Because of the resistivity contrast, artifacts in the form of borehole inversion effects develop in the resistivity images. Other 3D effects resulting in inversion artifacts are shadow effects caused by use of a 2D code to invert data from a 3D body located outside the image plane. In both cases the inversion model misrepresents the spatial change in voltages as a corresponding spatial change in resistivity. Borehole inversion effects and shadow effects result as the forward solver attempts to resolve the discrepancy in the voltages for numerous electrode pairs into a meaningful resistivity distribution. Borehole inversion effects are shown to be related to the resistivity contrast between the borehole fill and the host medium, and to borehole diameter. Borehole inversion effects do not materialize with small diameter boreholes (e.g. <=0.1m) when the fill resistivity contrast is one order of magnitude or less; however, a borehole fill resistivity contrast of two orders of magnitude causes artifacts in the form of sheaths near the boreholes, and a conductive artifact between the boreholes. Larger diameter borehole (e.g. 0.2m) induce significant borehole inversion effects with as little as one order of magnitude fill resistivity contrast. The general resistivity patterns are similar for the borehole inversion effects. However, the artifacts are amplified as resistivity contrast and/or borehole diameter increase. These results are significant because borehole inversion effects may mask a target heterogeneity or an artifact may be confused for an anomaly resulting in improper actions for site characterizations or remediation strategies. Suggestions of best practices for experimental design to prevent or minimize borehole inversion effects include: minimizing borehole diameter, minimizing borehole fill resistivity contrast, measuring and inputting the resistivity of the borehole fill/water into the model, and inverting changes in resistivity for time-lapse ERT data. Shadow effects are shown to be related directly to the distance of the target heterogeneity out of the image plane. Our results show that shadow effects become insignificant when the target is between 3 and 5m outside the 10-m wide image plane. Because the size of the target and resistivity contrast of the target to the host rock are site-specific variables, the actual distance at which shadow effects become insignificant will vary from site to site. To reduce misinterpretations by shadow effects reduce the dipole length of the four electrode measurements and supplement data from other well pairs and/or other methods. 3awells 3agroundwater 3aelectrical resistance 3atomography 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogeology 0aboreholes 0aelectrical resistance tomography 0aborehole inversion effects1 aOsiensky, James L.1 aBinley, Andrew M.1 aWilliams, Barbara C.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Sept. 15, v. 359, no. 1-2 p.59-70dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.06.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20081125b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01561naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245004200150300001600192500001500208520036800223650002400591650001600615650001600631650001200647650001200659650001800671650003400689650001800723650002000741650001100761650001700772650001900789653002100808653001400829700001700843700002100860700001600881700001600897773010200913852001301015939003301028945000801061946001301069852000901082655001201091991564042760742620221119131755.0920504e199204  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920014742DNAL7 a15563542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugustin, J.10aAlcohol retention in food preparation  ap. 486-488.  a2019-12-04  aWe conducted this study to document the extent of alcohol lost in food preparation.

Accumulation of avenalumin I in the heterozygous plants inoculated with race 226 was less than that in the homozygous resistant parent plant. The final infection type of the hybrid plants was resistant. However, microscopic observation showed that length of infection hyphae in the heterozygous plants was much longer than that in the parental Shokan-1, and small uredia were occasionally formed. Segregation of final infection types of resistance and completely susceptible F2 plants of Shokan-1 X Pc-38 and Shokan-1 X Kanota significantly fit the expected 3:1 phenotypic ratio. It was confirmed that resistance to race 226 (as judged by the length of infection hyphae and avenalumin accumulation at 96 h after inoculation) in each of the F2 plants segregated as a single gene. Genetic analysis showed that avenalumin accumulation in Shokan-1 in response to race 226 is controlled by a single co-dominant gene that is closely linked to genes for resistance to the crown rust fungus. These results suggest that the accumulation of avenalumin I is tightly linked to the expression of specific resistance of oats to the crown rust pathogen. 3arust diseases 3acultivars 3aPuccinia coronata 3ahyphae 3acrossing 3ahypersensitive response 3adisease resistance 3aAvena sativa 3aincomplete dominance 3aphytoalexins 0asegregation 0ainheritance (genetics)1 aBordin, A.P.A.1 aMorikawa, T.1 aTanpo, H.1 aKato, H.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1995 Apr., v. 46, no. 4 p.255-261x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01978naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245009600131300001600227520104200243650002001285650001801305650001601323650001601339650002801355650002301383650000801406650001801414651001001432653001101442700001701453773009701470852000901567930003301576945000801609946001101617655001201628991564042090742620221119131718.0920501e199112  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920014592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Neill, O.10aNutrient intakes of men in South Wales: a comparison of surveys taken in 1980-1983 and 1990  ap. 413-419.  aNutrient intakes calculated from 7-day, weighed, intake records obtained from a representative community sample of 98 men in 1990 were compared with those obtained from 665 men in the same community in 1980-83.

The percentages of total energy from saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids decreased from 17.3 to 15.3% and from 15.0 to 13.5%, respectively, and polyunsaturated fatty acids increased from 5.0 to 6.2%. The ratio of polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acids increased from 0.31 to 0.43. There was also a small increase in dietary fibre and vitamin C intakes (2 g/d and 11 mg/d respectively).

The deduced VP4 amino acid sequence of strain A5 with G8 serotype specificity is 91.1% identical to that of strain NCDV of the serotype G6, and strain 61A with G10 serotype specificity has a VP4 amino acid sequence (95.2% identity) similar to that of the UK strain of the G6 serotype. In contrast, the VP4 amino acid sequences of strains A44, B223 and KK3 of the G10 serotype, isolated in Thailand, the U.S.A. and Japan respectively, have very similar sequences to each other, but less similarity (50 to 60%) to other group A rotavirus strains reported so far. Their VP4 genes are 2352 nucleotides in length and encode 772 amino acids, four amino acids fewer than the VP4 proteins of other animal rotaviruses. Thus, the presence of three different VP4 types (P types) and the independent segregation of G serotype and P type were postulated in bovine rotaviruses by VP4 sequence analysis. 3aBovidae 3aRotavirus 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d13392 0agenbank/d13393 0agenbank/d13394 0agenbank/d13395 0agenbank/d133961 aUrasawa, T.1 aUrasawa, S.0 tJournal of general virology.g1993 June, v. 74, no. pt.6 p.1215-1221x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02652naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245015400122300001600276520155400292650002901846650002201875650002001897650001901917650001201936650001901948650000901967650002001976650002401996650002202020653001502042653004002057700001402097773010102111852000902212930003302221945001302254946001102267655001202278IND2045937320221119131542.0950508e199503  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204593732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, S.10aActivity of polygalacturonase produced by Cryphonectria parasitica in chestnut bark and its inhibition by extracts from American and Chinese chestnut  ap. 199-213.  aA purified polygalacturonase (PG) from culture filtrates of a virulent strain of Cryphonectria parasitica, Ep 155, caused browning of the inner bark of American chestnut. The enzyme also hydrolysed isolated cell wall materials from both American and Chinese chestnut bark in vitro. PG activity was detected in infected chestnut bark by a cup-plate assay, and by isoelectric focusing (IEF) and overlay-gel activity staining. A hypovirulent strain of C. parasitica, Ep 713, induced small cankers on American chestnut, and produced small amounts of PG in vivo as compared to its isogenic virulent strain Ep 155. Lower PG activity was also detected in cankers on resistant Chinese chestnut as compared to those on susceptible American chestnut. IEF and immunoblotting of the PG from infected bark against antibodies raised against the purified PG produced in vitro indicated that these enzymes were the same. Tannin isolated from the bark of American chestnut inhibited this PG more than tannin isolated from Chinese chestnut bark. A proteinaceous extract from Chinese chestnut bark, however, was about 15 times more inhibitory to the C. parasitica PG than a similar protein extract from American chestnut. This PG inhibitor was active also against the PG of C. lindemuthianum, but not the PG from Rhizopus sp. The high level of this nominally specific PG inhibitor in the resistant host lends further support to the hypothesis that PG is a virulence factor for C. parasitica and that its inhibition may contribute to the resistance of Chinese chestnut. 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3apolygalacturonase 3aenzyme activity 3aplant extracts 3atannins 3aplant proteins 3abark 3aCastanea sativa 3aCastanea mollissima 3aenzyme inhibitors 0ainhibition 0apolygalacturonase inhibitor protein1 aShain, L.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1995 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.199-213x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02044naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002500144245006100169300001600230500002400246520123500270650001301505650001501518651001101533700003601544773008401580852000901664930003301673945002501706946001101731655001201742IND4423818620221119131712.0090729s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442381862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBarth, Ortrud Monika10aPalynological analysis of Brazilian red propolis samples  ap. 181-188.  aSummary in Spanish.  aSeven samples of Brazilian red propolis were analyzed using palynological methodology. The samples originate from the Brazilian northeastern coastal region, three of which were from Alagoas, three from Bahia and one from the Paraíba state. Glandular trichomes were absent in the red propolis, as were sand, earth, quartz and stark grains that normally occur in geopropolis. The presence of pollen grains of Schinus ("aroeira") was considered characteristic in the red propolis sediments. The quantity of pollen grains of Protium (Burseraceae), another possible resinous plant taxon, was very small when compared with that of Schinus. This tree also occurs beyond the intertide mangrove vegetation. The three characteristic pollen types of mangrove vegetation, Rhizophora, Laguncularia and Avicennia, were recognized only in one sample from Bahia. Pollen grains of Dalbergia ecastophyllum, another red-resinous plant species occurring in the coastal areas of Alagoas, were never detected inside the sediment of the propolis samples. Cocos pollen grains are frequent. The palynological analysis was therefore confirmed by the multivariate analysis. The red propolis may be related mainly to resin of Schinus in the studied samples. 3apropolis 3apalynology 3aBrazil1 aLuz, Cynthia Fernandes Pinto da0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2009, v. 48, no. 3 p.181-188x0021-88397nnas  aDNAL  a20090817b20091002c00000000  aINDdDFXe2009/08/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02454naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007700131300001600208520154500224650004301769650004201812650001501854650001801869650001701887650001601904650001101920650001501931700001501946773010101961852000902062930003302071945001302104946001102117655001202128IND2045938120221119131557.0950508e199503  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204593812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutherland, M.L.10aPurification of a toxin from Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici race 1  ap. 243-254.  aLeaf protoplasts from near-isogenic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) cultivars, differing only at the I1 resistance gene, showing differential cell death in response to culture filtrates of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici race 1 were used to quantify the toxic activity of crude and partially purified culture filtrates. Toxic activity was partially lost after treatment with protease or storage at pH values above neutrality and was completely destroyed by autoclaving. Fractions with toxic activity were separated by gel filtration. Following acid native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro-elution of a desalted fraction precipitated by 20% saturation with ammonium sulphate from crude culture filtrates, toxic activity was found to be associated with a single proteinaceous band with an RF value of 0.32. Electrophoresis under denaturing conditions revealed that the toxin was comprised of two bands, with apparent molecular weights 56 and 61 kDa, which stained positively for protein. Protoplasts of cv. Ace, lacking resistance genes, were sensitive to the toxin, with a LD50 of 55 ng protein ml-1 compared with > 22 micrograms protein ml-1 against cv. Royal Ace protoplasts, possessing the I1 resistance gene to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici race 1. Injection of the toxin into tomato plants induced symptoms similar to those of natural infection in susceptible cv. Ace, but caused no symptom development in resistant cv. Royal Ace.

The agent reacts with compounds in the ambient water. In our application, we use an alkaline solution injected into acidic ambient water. Threshold values of pH are visualized by adding standard pH indicators. Since aqueous-phase acid-base reactions can be considered practically instantaneous and the only process leading to mixing of the reactants is transverse dispersion, the length of the plume is controlled by the ratio of transverse dispersion to advection. We use existing closed-form expressions for multidimensional steady-state transport of conservative compounds in order to evaluate the concentration distributions of the reacting compounds. Based on these results, we derive an easy-to-use expression for the length of the reactive plume; it is proportional to the injection height squared, times the velocity, and inversely proportional to the transverse dispersion coefficient. Solving this expression for the transverse dispersion coefficient, we can estimate its value from the length of the alkaline plume. We apply the method to two experimental setups of different dimension. The computed transverse dispersion coefficients are rather small. We conclude that at slow but realistic ground water velocities, the contribution of effective molecular diffusion to transverse dispersion cannot be neglected. This results in plume lengths that increase with increasing velocity. 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater flow 3apollutants 3ahydrologic models 3amathematical models 2aAzo Compounds 2aColoring Agents 2aDiffusion 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aModels, Chemical 2aThymolphthaleinxanalogs & derivatives 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Movements 2aWater Supply 0acontaminants 0atransverse dispersion coefficients 0atranspersive dispersive mixing1 aOhlsson, Åsa.1 aJu, Qingsong1 aRahman, Md.

When the amino acid sequences of VP6 and NS28, the protein products of genes 6 and 10 respectively, were compared with other published sequences it was evident that the proteins of human rotavirus Wa have the highest degree of identity with rotavirus YM. This is in contrast with the observation that when other proteins of these two strains have been compared they have been found to be among the most distantly related pairs of rotavirus strains. This observation is in accordance with the proposed receptor-ligand interaction between NS28 and VP6 during virus morphogenesis, and suggests a specificity in the interaction between these two proteins. In addition, when rotavirus YM VP6, which belongs to subgroup I, was compared with the VP6 proteins of rotavirus strains having different subgroup specificities, it was found to be more closely related to subgroup II rather than subgroup I proteins. This finding allowed us to identify five potential amino acids on VP6 that may contribute to determining the subgroup antigens. 3aswine 3aRotavirus 3agenes 3aproteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x69487 0agenbank/x694851 aArias, C.F.0 tJournal of general virology.g1993 June, v. 74, no. pt.6 p.1223-1226x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03351naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245007400175300001600249500002400265520170700289650001501996650001502011650002102026650002702047650001302074650002002087650003302107650002702140650000902167650001202176650001402188650001202202650002102214650004202235650002402277650001102301650002702312650000902339650002302348650002102371650003302392650002602425650003002451700001702481700002102498700001602519773011602535852000902651856007902660856005802739655001202797IND4372858320221119131508.0050729s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437285832DNAL7 a160491562pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.005152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegino, Miwa10aIn vitro follicular development of cryopreserved mouse ovarian tissue  ap. 187-192.  aIncludes references  aIn a previous report, we showed that follicles isolated from frozen/thawed mouse ovarian tissues reached the mature follicle stage on the 12th day of culture. However, the developmental ability was lower than that of fresh ovarian tissue. The purpose of this study was to define a culture system with some technical modification for preantral follicles isolated from frozen/thawed ovarian tissue and to confirm cell injury. Ovaries obtained from three-week-old female mice were cryopreserved by the rapid freezing method. Preantral follicles isolated from frozen/thawed ovarian tissues were cultured for 12-16 days. The follicles were then stimulated with human chorionic gonadotropin. In vitro fertilization was performed on the released cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). Preantral follicle viability was assessed by supravital staining using Hoechst 33258. Using this stain cell death was found in part of the granulosa cells of a follicle obtained from frozen/thawed ovarian tissue. On the 14th and 16th days of culture, the diameters of follicles isolated from frozen/thawed ovaries were larger than on the 12th day of culture. The released COCs were fertilized and developed to the blastocyst stage in 15.8% (12/76) of the oocytes taken from the fresh group, and in 0% (0/73), 2.9% (2/69) and 19.1% (22/115) of the oocytes taken from the frozen/thawed group that had been cultured for 12, 14 and 16 days respectively. The preantral follicles isolated from frozen/thawed mouse ovarian tissues developed slowly compared with the freshly prepared preantral follicles. During prolonged culture from 12 to 16 days, these follicles obtained the potential to fertilize and develop to the blastocyst stage. 3ablastocyst 3acell death 3acryopreservation 3afollicular development 3afreezing 3agranulosa cells 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3ain vitro fertilization 3amice 3aoocytes 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aCryopreservation 2aCulture Media, Conditionedxchemistry 2aEstradiolxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitro 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Inbred DBA 2aOvarian Folliclexphysiology 2aStaining and Labeling 2aTissue Culture Techniques1 aIkeda, Mario1 aHirahara, Fumiki1 aSato, Kahei0 tReproduction.g2005 Aug., v. 130, no. 2 p.187-192dJournals of Reproduction and Fertility, Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.005153Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle03904naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072001700153072001700170072001700187100003000204245011100234300001600345500007100361500002400432500001500456520214100471650001902612650002202631650001802653650001802671650002402689650001802713650001102731650002402742650002102766650003202787650001902819650001802838650002302856650001702879650001002896651001402906653002102920653002602941700002002967700002002987773012003007852000903127856007703136856005603213930003303269945002503302946001103327655001203338IND4378367620221119131759.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437836762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001061.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We took advantage of a unique whole-ecosystem radiocarbon label in a temperate forest to partition soil respiration into three sources: (1) recently photosynthesized carbon (C), which dominates root and rhizosphere respiration; (2) leaf litter decomposition and (3) decomposition of root litter and soil organic matter >1-2 years old. Heterotrophic sources and specifically leaf litter decomposition were large contributors to total soil respiration during the growing season. Relative contributions from leaf litter decomposition ranged from a low of [approximately]1±3% of total soil respiration (6± 3 mg C m[superscript [-]2] h[superscript [-]1]) when leaf litter was extremely dry, to a high of 42±16% (96± 38 mg C m[superscript [-]2] h[superscript [-]1]). Total soil respiration fluxes varied with the strength of the leaf litter decomposition source, indicating that moisture-dependent changes in litter decomposition drive variability in total soil respiration fluxes. In the surface mineral soil layer, decomposition of C fixed in the original labeling event (3-5 years earlier) dominated the isotopic signature of heterotrophic respiration. Root[solidus]rhizosphere respiration accounted for 16±10% to 64±22% of total soil respiration, with highest relative contributions coinciding with low overall soil respiration fluxes. In contrast to leaf litter decomposition, root respiration fluxes did not exhibit marked temporal variation ranging from 34±14 to 40±16 mg C m[superscript [-]2] h[superscript [-]1] at different times in the growing season with a single exception (88±35 mg C m[superscript [-]2] h[superscript [-]1]). Radiocarbon signatures of root respired CO₂ changed markedly between early and late spring (March vs. May), suggesting a switch from stored nonstructural carbohydrate sources to more recent photosynthetic products. 3acarbon dioxide 3adeciduous forests 3aradionuclides 3aradiolabeling 3asoil organic matter 3aforest litter 3acarbon 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 3abiological activity in soil 3abiodegradation 3agas emissions 3aseasonal variation 3aforest soils 3aroots 3aTennessee 0aroot respiration 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aTrumbore, Susan1 aHanson, Paul J.0 tGlobal change biology.g2006 Feb., v. 12, no. 2 p.194-204dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001061.x3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001061.x  a20060421b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03243naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001600189245006700205300001600272500002400288520165900312650001701971650002101988650002902009650002202038650002502060650002402085650003002109650001202139650001802151650002702169650001502196650002402211650002302235650002202258650002002280650001602300650002002316650003402336650001702370651001102387651001102398653003202409773009202441852000902533856007602542930003302618945002502651946001302676655001202689IND4378412520221119131832.0060303e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437841252DNAL7 a165562042pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2005.00117.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX1001 aHu, Bill X.10aStochastic Study of Solute Transport in a Nonstationary Medium  ap. 222-233.  aIncludes references  aA Lagrangian stochastic approach is applied to develop a method of moment for solute transport in a physically and chemically nonstationary medium. Stochastic governing equations for mean solute flux and solute covariance are analytically obtained in the first-order accuracy of log conductivity and/or chemical sorption variances and solved numerically using the finite-difference method. The developed method, the numerical method of moments (NMM), is used to predict radionuclide solute transport processes in the saturated zone below the Yucca Mountain project area. The mean, variance, and upper bound of the radionuclide mass flux through a control plane 5 km downstream of the footprint of the repository are calculated. According to their chemical sorption capacities, the various radionuclear chemicals are grouped as nonreactive, weakly sorbing, and strongly sorbing chemicals. The NMM method is used to study their transport processes and influence factors. To verify the method of moments, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted for nonreactive chemical transport. Results indicate the results from the two methods are consistent, but the NMM method is computationally more efficient than the Monte Carlo method. This study adds to the ongoing debate in the literature on the effect of heterogeneity on solute transport prediction, especially on prediction uncertainty, by showing that the standard derivation of solute flux is larger than the mean solute flux even when the hydraulic conductivity within each geological layer is mild. This study provides a method that may become an efficient calculation tool for many environmental projects. 3ahydrogeology 3agroundwater flow 3asoil transport processes 3ahydrologic models 3astochastic processes 3amathematical models 3agroundwater contamination 3asolutes 3aradionuclides 3ahydraulic conductivity 2aAdsorption 2aModels, Theoretical 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aRadioactive Waste 2aRefuse Disposal 2aUncertainty 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Radioactive 2aWater Supply 3aNevada 0aNevada 0anumerical method of moments0 tGround water.g2006 , v. 44, no. 2 p.222-233dBlackwell Publishing Incx0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2005.00117.x3electronic resource  a20060405b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/05  aOther US 7aarticle02186naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245011700148300001600265520093100281650001601212650001001228650001501238650001201253650001401265650002201279650001801301650002001319650001101339650002301350650002801373650004001401650001801441650003201459650001101491650001401502700001601516700001801532773010201550852001301652939003301665945000801698946001301706852000901719655001201728991564039100742620221119131902.0920504e199204  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920014752DNAL7 a15563552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanek, K.10aFactors affecting use of food and commercial agents to thicken liquids for individuals with swallowing disorders  ap. 488-490.  aIndividuals with neuromuscular or structural impairments of the upper digestive tract may experience swallowing dysfunctions. In the oral stage of swallowing, liquids require greater oral coordination and fine motor control than do solids. Swallowing thin liquids may be the most difficult and may result in aspiration, decreased fluid intake, and inadequate hydration. Many food substances have been recommended for use as liquid-thickening agents, but they have not been systematically evaluated. Before any definitive recommendations can be made, thickening agents need to be compared for acceptability and taste preference. The purpose of our study was to compare a variety of common food items and commercially available agents to determine amounts needed for thickening, cost, effect on volume, and effect on energy and nutrient intake. We hope that this information will provide a starting point for sensory evaluation. 3adeglutition 3afoods 3athickeners 3aliquids 3aviscosity 3acosts and returns 3aenergy intake 3anutrient intake 3avolume 3asensory evaluation 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aDeglutition Disordersxdiet therapy 2aEnergy Intake 2aFood, Formulatedxeconomics 2aHumans 2aViscosity1 aHensley, C.1 aVan Riper, C.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 Apr., v. 92, no. 4 p.488-490x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002400167245007400191300001600265500002400281500001500305520125900320650002801579650002201607650002001629650001301649650000801662650001701670650001901687650000901706650001301715650002501728650003101753650002001784650000901804650001901813650001401832650001201846650001701858650001001875650001201885650003501897650004601932650000901978650001101987650002301998650001102021650000902032650000902041650003502050650003902085650004602124650001302170653002202183700002002205773009702225852000902322856008802331930003302419945002502452946001102477655001202488IND4442261520221119131812.0100910e20101011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226152DNAL7 a206095272pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeegan, Jason Devoy10aContamination of the hair of owned dogs with the eggs of Toxocara spp  ap. 161-164.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aToxocara canis is one of the most common gastrointestinal helminthes of dogs. Humans can become infected through ingestion of infective eggs. Infection often causes few symptoms but in rare cases blindness can occur. It is generally accepted that human infection is caused as a result of direct contact with contaminated soil. However, recently, the eggs of Toxocara spp. have been found in the hair of dogs, implicating them as a possible additional route of transmission. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which the hair of owned dogs was contaminated with the eggs of Toxocara. Samples were taken from the head, neck, back and anus of 184 dogs. Eggs were recovered from the hair using a previously standardised detection method. Eggs were found on the hair of 8.8% of the sampled dogs. None of the eggs found were embryonated. There was no significant difference found between the numbers or prevalence of eggs taken from the head, neck, back and anus. Older dogs were significantly more likely to possess eggs on their hair than those under 1 year of age. The low prevalence and the lack of potentially infective embryonated eggs suggests that direct contact with well cared for owned dogs poses a low risk of infection with T. canis. 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease detection 3adisease vectors 3azoonoses 3aova 3adog diseases 3adirect contact 3adogs 3avalidity 3adisease transmission 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3arisk assessment 3apets 3aToxocara canis 3ascreening 3ahygiene 3atoxocariasis 3ahairs 2aAnimals 2aDisease Reservoirsxveterinary 2aDog Diseasesxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHairxparasitology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOvum 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aToxocaraxisolation & purification 2aToxocariasisxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aZoonoses 0aexposure pathways1 aHolland, Celia.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Oct. 11, v. 173, no. 1-2 p.161-164dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03169naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001900188245015100207300001600358500002400374520146800398650002601866650001701892650001701909650002301926650001401949650001401963650001501977650002201992650001702014650002102031650000902052650000902061650001102070650001802081650002302099650002202122650002102144650002002165650001802185650002002203653002202223700001502245700001702260700001602277700001502293773010502308852000902413856007602422930003302498945002502531946001102556655001202567IND4378366620221119131629.0060302e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437836662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2095.2006.00394.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL500 0aM001 0aL6001 aBorgeson, T.L.10aEffect of replacing fishmeal and oil with simple or complex mixtures of vegetable ingredients in diets fed to Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  ap. 141-149.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of replacing fishmeal with simple or complex mixtures of plant proteins in tilapia diets was examined. Diet formulations were arranged in a 2 [multiplication] 4 factorial design with two types of plant protein mixtures used to replace fishmeal (simple: soybean meal and maize gluten meal or complex: soybean meal, maize gluten meal, dehulled flax, pea protein concentrate and canola protein concentrate) and four levels of protein originating from fishmeal (1000 g kg[superscript [-]1], 670 g kg[superscript [-]1], 330 g kg[superscript [-]1] and 0 g kg[superscript [-]1]). Diets contained equal digestible protein (380 g kg[superscript [-]1]) and digestible energy (17.6 MJ kg[superscript [-]1]). The average daily gains, specific growth rates and feed efficiencies of fish fed diets with 0 g kg[superscript [-]1] fishmeal were significantly lower than fish fed diets with the 330 g kg[superscript [-]1], 670 g kg[superscript [-]1] or 1000 g kg[superscript [-]1] fishmeal levels. Fish fed the complex diets had significantly higher average daily gains, specific growth rates, feed : gain ratios and protein efficiency ratios than those fed the simple diets. Intestinal villus length decreased with decreasing levels of fishmeal and increased with increased diet complexity but the effects were not significant. Replacement of fishmeal with a complex mixture of plant ingredients may allow a greater replacement of fishmeal in diets fed to Nile tilapia. 3atilapia (common name) 3afish culture 3afish feeding 3aexperimental diets 3afish meal 3afish oils 3avegetables 3avegetable protein 3asoybean meal 3acorn gluten meal 3aflax 3apeas 3acanola 3avegetable oil 3adigestible protein 3adigestible energy 3afeed composition 3afeed conversion 3aanimal growth 3aliveweight gain 0areplacement diets1 aRacz, V.J.1 aWilkie, D.C.1 aWhite, L.J.1 aDrew, M.D.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2006 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.141-149dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2006.00394.x3electronic resource  a20060329b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03370naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001800167245006900185300001600254500002400270500001500294520132200309650001001631650001601641650001901657650003201676650001101708650002001719650003801739650001701777650002801794650003001822650002201852650002301874650002101897650002201918650002501940650001901965650001801984650001602002650001202018650003302030650006402063650005002127650001102177650000902188650003902197650003002236650001102266651001102277651001102288651005202299653001702351700001902368700001702387700001702404773009702421852000902518856008802527930003302615945002502648946001102673655001202684IND4442261020221119131655.0100910e20101011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226102DNAL7 a206095242pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjörkman, C.10aSeroprevalence of Neospora caninum in gray wolves in Scandinavia  ap. 139-142.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTransmission of the protozoan parasite Neospora caninum between wild and domestic animals has gained some interest during recent years. Because of the close relationship between gray wolf (Canis lupus) and dog it has been suggested that gray wolf is a definitive host for the parasite. The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of N. caninum in Scandinavian gray wolves and to investigate any geographical patterns of the infection. The investigation was based on blood samples collected from 109 wolves between 1998 and 2009 within the Scandinavian wolf project Skandulv. They were analysed by N. caninum iscom ELISA and those with absorbance values exceeding 0.20 were also analysed by immunoblotting. Samples that were positive in both tests were deemed positive. Four (3.7%) wolves were positive at the first sampling. They were all sampled 2005 at different locations, and were both females and males. From one male wolf three samples were collected over a 7-year period. No antibodies were detected at the first sampling in 1998 when he was approximately 8 months old but when he was sampled again 5 and 7 years later the ELISA and immunoblotting were positive. The results indicate that N. caninum infection is present in Scandinavian wolves. It is unclear how the wolves acquired the infection. 3ablood 3aneosporosis 3aseroprevalence 3ahost-parasite relationships 3awolves 3arisk assessment 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3awild animals 3aepidemiological studies 3ageographical distribution 3adisease detection 3aantibody detection 3aNeospora caninum 3awildlife diseases 3adisease surveillance 3aimmunoblotting 3aserodiagnosis 3aCanis lupus 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aCoccidiosisxbloodxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNeosporaxisolation & purification 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aWolves 3aNorway 3aSweden 0aScandinavian and Nordic Countriesxepidemiology 0aimmunoassays1 aJakubek, E.-B.1 aArnemo, J.M.1 aMalmsten, J.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Oct. 11, v. 173, no. 1-2 p.139-142dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02727naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001900188245012500207300001600332500002400348520136600372650001801738650001001756650001701766650001701783650002301800650001901823650001801842650002001860650002101880650002101901650002301922650001801945700001501963700002001978773010501998852000902103856007602112930003302188945002502221946001102246655001202257IND4378366420140723000000.0060302e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437836642DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2095.2006.00391.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL500 0aM001 0aL6001 aVelÁzquez, M.10aEffect of dietary energy content on gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) feeding behaviour and nutritional use of the diet  ap. 127-133.  aIncludes references  aWe have studied how the diet energy level affects gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) daily pattern of demand-feeding activity and nutritional use of the diet under summer- and winter-like conditions. To that end, animals were kept in a closed circuit under controlled temperature and photoperiod, and fed one of two commercial diets with either high (H: 238 g kg[superscript [-]1] fat) or low (L: 172 g kg[superscript [-]1] fat) energy content. In summer conditions (26 °C; 12 : 12 L : D), both diets yielded similar growth rate (0.7 ± 0.0 and 0.7 ± 0.1) and thermal unit growth coefficient values (0.6 ± 0.0 and 0.6 ± 0.0), and although the daily rate of delivered feed was somewhat higher for fish under the high-energy diet (16 ± 2 g kg[superscript [-]1] of fish) the difference was not significant. In winter conditions (17 °C; 9 : 15 L : D), on the other hand, no differences were found for any of the parameters evaluated. Thus, the higher lipid content of the diet does not appear to have any protein sparing effect. The 'summer' demand-feeding pattern displayed three daily peaks, which were quite apparent for fish under the low-energy diet, but rather smoothed for those that ate the energy-rich diet. This profile was replaced in winter conditions by a single peak around noon, and the animals also displayed a lower overall number of demands. 3aSparus aurata 3abream 3afish culture 3afish feeding 3aexperimental diets 3aenergy content 3alipid content 3aprotein content 3afeed composition 3afeeding behavior 3aseasonal variation 3aanimal growth1 aZamora, S.1 aMartÍnez, F.J.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2006 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.127-133dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2006.00391.x3electronic resource  a20060329b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02918naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100002400188245015000212300001600362500002400378520156300402650002701965650001301992650002302005650001802028650001102046650001802057650002302075650002102098651001102119700002902130700003002159700002402189773010502213852000902318856007602327930003302403945002502436946001102461655001202472IND4378366120140723000000.0060302e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437836612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2095.2006.00388.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM120 0aL500 0aM001 0aL6001 aCampaÑa-Torres, A.10aCarbohydrate and lipid digestibility of animal and vegetal ingredients and diets for juvenile Australian redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus  ap. 103-109.  aIncludes references  aCarbohydrate and lipid digestibility of three vegetal and four animal ingredients, and diets in which they were included, were evaluated for juvenile Australian redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus. The ingredients were: soy paste, textured wheat, sorghum meal, sardine meals (67% and 58% crude protein), squid meal and red crab meal. A basal diet was formulated, and then seven experimental diets were created, including 150 g kg[superscript [-]1] of each ingredient in the reference diet. Digestibility was measured in vivo, using chromic oxide as marker. A single-factor, completely randomized experimental design with three replicates per treatment was performed. Mean carbohydrate digestibility of vegetal ingredients and the corresponding diets was better than carbohydrate digestibility of animal ingredients. Sorghum meal had a carbohydrate digestibility over 94%, and the diet in which it was included over 92%. Soy paste and wheat meals also presented excellent carbohydrate digestibility (around 88% for ingredients and over 90% for diets). Mean carbohydrate digestibility of animal ingredients and their corresponding diets were very poor (from 18% to 32%) and this affected the carbohydrate digestibility of diets in which they were included (87-89%). Lipid digestibility was also better for vegetal ingredients. Soy paste and wheat meal recorded values over 93% and their diets over 94%. Sorghum lipid presented slightly lower digestibility. Some of the animal ingredients, especially red crab, had an excellent lipid digestibility (92.1%). 3aCherax quadricarinatus 3acrayfish 3acrustacean culture 3acarbohydrates 3alipids 3adigestibility 3aexperimental diets 3afeed composition 3aMexico1 aMartÍnez-CÓrdova, L.R.1 aVillarreal-Colmenares, H.1 aCivera-Cerecedo, R.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2006 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.103-109dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2006.00388.x3electronic resource  a20060329b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002800167245011400195300001600309500002400325500001500349520087800364650001901242650003101261650001601292650001501308650001501323650001601338650002401354650002901378650002001407650001401427650001501441650001101456650001401467650002101481650001501502650001001517650002901527650001501556650001201571650005001583650003001633650002401663650002701687650006501714650001001779650006201789651001101851651002601862653002501888653001701913653001801930653001501948700002001963700002101983700002902004700002702033700003702060773009702097852000902194856008802203930003302291945002502324946001102349655001202360IND4442261420221119131604.0100910e20101011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444226142DNAL7 a206195432pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCezar, Alfredo Skrebsky10aMultiple resistance of gastrointestinal nematodes to nine different drugs in a sheep flock in southern Brazil  ap. 157-160.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBased on clinical observation of a flock of approximately 5000 sheep (breed Merino) from southern Brazil, the failure of anthelmintic treatments was suspected. The sensitivity of the gastrointestinal nematodes that infected these sheep to nine drugs (Levamisole, Moxidectin, Albendazole, Ivermectin, Nitroxynil, Disophenol, Trichlorphon, Closantel, and a combination of Ivermectin, Levamisole and Albendazole) was evaluated. None of the drugs reduced the count of nematode eggs per gram of feces (EPG) in the sheep to an adequate extent (defined as a 95% reduction in EPG). Therefore, we found multiple parasite resistance to all classes of anthelmintic drugs available for small ruminants in the Brazilian market. The genera Haemonchus spp., Trichostrongylus spp. and Ostertagia spp. had various degrees of resistance (or natural tolerance) to each of the drug treatments. 3asheep diseases 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3aalbendazole 3aHaemonchus 3alevamisole 3aavermectins 3anematode infections 3amultiple drug resistance 3arisk assessment 3ascreening 3anitroxinil 3aflocks 3aclosantel 3aTrichostrongylus 3aOstertagia 3asheep 3acombination drug therapy 3amoxidectin 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aNematodaxdrug effects 2aNematode Infectionsxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxparasitology. 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology. 0aantiparasitic agents 0atrichlorphon 0aanthelmintics 0adisophenol1 aToscan, Gustavo1 aCamillo, Giovana1 aSangioni, Luís Antônio1 aRibas, Henrique Olmedo1 aVogel, Fernanda Silveira Flôres0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Oct. 11, v. 173, no. 1-2 p.157-160dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02121naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012900124300001400253520102300267650002701290650001901317650001701336650001501353650001701368650002501385650003001410650002401440650002601464653001201490653002201502700001401524700001301538700001901551773009901570852000901669930003301678945001301711946001101724655001201735IND2047547420221119131714.0950830e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204754742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadar, Z.10aPhytoalexin production by cypress in response to infection by Diplodia pinea f.sp. cupressi and its relation to water stress  ap. 29-38.  aPredisposition or cypress saplings to extreme water stress enhanced the development of cankers caused by Diplodia pinea f.sp. cupressi, and augmented fungal colonization in the bark and xylem, in comparison with normally watered plants. Production of two phytoalexins, cupressotropolone A and B in the bark, which commenced soon after the inoculation, was lower in plants predisposed to water stress. In Plants treated with (aminooxy)acetic acid, a metabolic inhibitor, the cankers were significantly longer, and the content of phytoalexins was significantly lower, than in non-treated plants. Treatment of the bark of initiated cankers with a solution of 15% methanol, to extract soluble constituents, enhanced the subsequent development of the cankers, and significantly reduced the content of both phytoalexins in the bark, in comparison with untreated plants. Neither of the phytoalexins was detected in the extractive fluids. The results suggest that the terpenoid phytoalexins greatly inhibit canker development. 3aCupressus sempervirens 3aDiplodia pinea 3aphytoalexins 3aterpenoids 3awater stress 3ametabolic inhibitors 3afungal diseases of plants 3aaminooxyacetic acid 3abiological resistance 0acankers 0acupressotropolone1 aSolel, Z.1 aRiov, J.1 aSztejnberg, A.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1995 July, v. 47, no. 1 p.29-38x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03735naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001400158245006800172300001600240500002400256500001500280520163200295650001901927650003001946650001701976650001101993650001902004650002602023650001202049650001602061650001402077650001202091650001802103650002702121650002202148650001202170650004102182650003102223650003202254650001102286650001102297650002702308650003802335650000902373650001902382650004202401650002602443650002602469650004002495650003102535653002502566700001602591700001602607700001702623700001802640700001602658700001402674700003802688700002102726700001602747773011602763852000902879856007902888856005802967655001203025IND4372859020221119131817.0050729s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437285902DNAL7 a160491632pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.006362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanghe, S10aInhibition of bovine sperm-zona binding by bovine herpesvirus-1  ap. 251-259.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe purpose of the present study was to identify a potential interference of bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) with sperm-oocyte interactions during bovine in vitro fertilization. An inhibition of almost 70% of sperm-zona binding was observed when bovine cumulus-denuded oocytes were inseminated in the presence of 10⁷ 50% tissue culture infective dose/ml BoHV-1. The inhibitory effect of BoHV-1 on sperm-zona binding was mediated by an interaction of the virus with spermatozoa, but not with oocytes. Treatment of spermatozoa with BoHV-1, however, did not affect sperm motility and acrosomal status. Antiserum against BoHV-1 prevented the virus-induced inhibition of sperm-zona binding, indicating that BoHV-1 itself affects the fertilization process. In order to investigate which BoHV-1 glycoprotein(s) are responsible for the virus-sperm interaction, BoHV-1 was treated with monoclonal antibodies against the viral glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gH prior to insemination. Anti-gC completely prevented the inhibitory effect of BoHV-1 on sperm-zona binding, while anti-gD caused a reduction of this inhibition. Further evidence for the involvement of gC and gD in the virus-sperm interaction was provided by the fact that purified gC and gD decreased sperm-zona binding in a dose-dependent way with gC being more effective than gD. These results indicated that BoHV-1 inhibits bovine sperm-zona binding by interacting with spermatozoa. The binding of BoHV-1 to a spermatozoon is mediated by the viral glycoproteins gC and gD, and therefore seems to be comparable with the mechanisms of BoHV-1 attachment to its natural host cell. 3atissue culture 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3ainsemination 3acattle 3asperm motility 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aviruses 3aspermatozoa 3aantiserum 3aoocytes 3aglycoproteins 3ain vitro fertilization 2aAcrosome Reaction 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxpharmacology 2aAntigen-Antibody Reactions 2aAntigens, Viralxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitro 2aHerpesvirus 1, Bovinexphysiology 2aMale 2aSperm Motility 2aSperm-Ovum Interactionsxdrug effects 2aSpermatozoaxvirology 2aStaining and Labeling 2aViral Envelope Proteinsximmunology 2aViral Proteinsximmunology 0aBovine herpesvirus 11 aVanroose, G1 aVan Soom, A1 aDuchateau, L1 aYsebaert, M T1 aKerkhofs, P1 aThiry, E.1 avan Drunen Littel-van den Hurk, S1 aVan Oostveldt, P1 aNauwynck, H0 tReproduction.g2005 Aug., v. 130, no. 2 p.251-259dJournals of Reproduction and Fertility, Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.006363Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle02161naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011700125300001600242500001500258520102100273650002901294650001501323650003001338650001101368650001901379650001401398650002101412650002001433650001101453650002301464653001701487653001001504653003401514653001801548700001801566773010101584852000901685930003301694945001301727946001101740655001201751IND2047863420221119131801.0950921e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204786342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoulin, S.14aThe induction of 1,3-beta-glucanases and other enzymes in groundnut leaves infected with Cercospora arachidicola  ap. 471-489.  a2019-12-05  aInfection of groundnut leaves with the early leaf spot pathogen Cercospora arachidicola leads to a marked increase in extracellular 1,3-beta-glucanase activity, limited to the infected tissue. Three isoforms of low molecular weight and extreme pI values, typical of pathogenesis-related proteins, were induced. These beta-glucanases, when acting together, were capable of degrading the pathogen cell wall in vitro. Glucanases from homogenates of infected leaf tissue were partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography to give enzymes with molecular weights of 35, 32 and 20 kDa and pI values of 3.8, 3.6 and > 9, respectively. They were electrophoretically identical to the beta-glucanases found in the intercellular washing fluid. Treatment of groundnut plants with 200 micromolar mercuric chloride induced the accumulation of identical extracellular beta-glucanases. During the course of the infection an increase in peroxidase activity was also observed, but chitinase activity remained more or less constant. 3aMycosphaerella arachidis 3acell walls 3afungal diseases of plants 3ahyphae 3abeta-glucanase 3aleaf spot 3aArachis hypogaea 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 3adefense mechanisms 0apurification 0alysis 0apathogenesis-related proteins 0aleaf spotting1 aBuchala, A.J.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1995 June, v. 46, no. 6 p.471-489x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03466naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001700157245015500174300001600329500002400345500001500369520177100384650003202155650001102187650002302198650001802221650003402239650001802273650002502291650002302316650002602339650002502365650002502390650001202415650001602427650002702443650002302470650002502493650002802518651000902546653001502555653002102570700001702591700001302608700002402621773009902645852000902744856008802753930003302841945002502874946001302899655001202912IND4399753520221119131923.0080108e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439975352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2007.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aAbudayya, A.10aOverweight, stunting, and anemia are public health problems among low socioeconomic groups in school adolescents (12-15 years) in the North Gaza Strip  ap. 762-771.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of the study was to describe sociodemographic differences in nutritional status among school adolescents aged 12 to 15 years in north Gaza Strip. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2002 comprising 1022 students from 10 schools in Gaza city, Jabalia village, and Jabalia refugee camp. Height, weight, and hemoglobin levels were measured to assess nutritional status. Self-administered questionnaires were administered to students and parents to obtain data on sociodemographic characteristics. The prevalence of overweight/obesity, stunting, and anemia in the total sample was 17.9%, 9.7%, and 49.6%, respectively. More overweight/obese girls than boys were found (20.2% vs 15.4%). In girls, being from a low-income residential area, having employed fathers, and having reached puberty had highest risk of overweight/obesity, whereas in boys, those with medium socioeconomic status (SES) had the lowest risk of overweight. The mean height-for-age percentile was generally low for both sexes compared with the National Center for Health Statistics/World Health Organization reference, but stunting was more common in boys than girls (13.7% vs 6.2%). Age was positively associated with risk of stunting in boys, whereas in girls, SES and mother's education were negatively associated with stunting. Anemia prevalence was high in both girls and boys (51.3% vs 47.9%). Age and onset of puberty had an independent negative effect on anemia among boys. Girls from nuclear families and from Jabalia village had higher risk of being anemic. In conclusion, undernutrition and overnutrition coexisted in the study area. Anemia, stunting, and overweight among the adolescents are public health problems, especially among low SES groups that merit attention. 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3aanemia 3anutritional status 3apublic health 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahealth status 3ahigh school students 3agender differences 3alow income households 3asocioeconomic status 3aadolescent nutrition 3aobesity 3aadolescents 3amiddle school students 3agrowth retardation 3anutrition assessment 3across-sectional studies 3aIraq 0aoverweight 0aanemia (disease)1 aThoresen, M.1 aAbed, Y.1 aHolmboe-Ottesen, G.0 tNutrition research.g2007 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.762-771dElsevier Science Incx0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2007.09.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20080212b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/08  aOther US 7aarticle01946naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245008100133300001600214520108000230650002401310650002201334650002301356650002101379650001501400651001401415653002701429700001801456773009701474852000901571939003301580945000801613946001101621655001201632991564034120742620221119131831.0920506e199110  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920015352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandman, J.P.10aIntroducing nutrition into the pre-clinical curriculum--Caribbean experience  ap. 341-345.  aThe paper describes how nutrition was incorporated into the crowded pre-clinical medical curriculum in the University of the West Indies which trains doctors for its 14 member states. Close consultation with dietetics, nutrition and clinical departments in Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados ensured the curriculum was relevant to regional health problems and the medical curriculum. The main goals were to: (1) instil positive attitudes towards nutrition in the students; (2) teach nutrition integrated with biochemistry and physiology; and (3) lay the scientific basis for applying nutrition to clinical medicine. The paper outlines which key concepts were taught and the strategies used. The curriculum was evaluated twice, after 5 and 9 years. These surveys found that students in their first clinical year were satisfied with nutrition teaching, especially when it was conducted by specialists. Despite changes in staff and a fall in the number of lecture hours, the goals of the programme were met. Successful co-ordination depended upon flexibility and rapport with staff. 3anutrition education 3amedical education 3aprogram evaluation 3aprogram planning 3acurriculum 3aCaribbean 0aproject implementation1 aJackson, A.A.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1991 Oct., v. 4, no. 5 p.341-345x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02515naa a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245010900151300001600260500001500276520075000291650001601041650001801057650001601075650000801091650001001099650002201109650002401131650002501155650002001180650001401200650001201214650002301226650001001249650002101259650002101280650001601301650000901317650004201326650001801368650002501386650001101411650001101422650002501433650000901458650001601467650002201483650001701505650001201522650001601534651001401550653000901564653001601573653001801589700001801607700001801625700001401643773009601657852001301753939003301766945000801799946001301807852000901820655001201829991564033480742620221119131837.0920504e199204  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920014912DNAL7 a15500642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlesges, R.C.12aA longitudinal analysis of the impact of dietary intake and physical activity on weight change in adults  ap. 818-822.  a2019-12-04  aThe current investigation is a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between dietary intake, physical activity, and body weight change in adult men (n = 142) and women (n = 152). Measures of dietary intake, physical activity, and cigarette and alcohol consumption were obtained for 3 y. Results indicated a different pattern of predictors of weight change for men vs women. For women a high dietary energy and fat intake as well as increases in total energy intake were related to higher weight gain and increases in work activity levels were related to decreased weight gain. For men weight gain was predicted by increases in dietary fat intake. Sex differences are discussed as a possible moderator variable in the energy balance equation. 3aweight gain 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3amen 3awomen 3aphysical activity 3aalcoholic beverages 3alongitudinal studies 3asmoking (habit) 3apregnancy 3aobesity 3afamilial incidence 2aAdult 2aAlcohol Drinking 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxgenetics 2aRisk Factors 2aSmoking 2aWeight Gain 3aTennessee 0adiet 0abody weight 0aweight losses1 aKlesges, L.M.1 aHaddock, C.K.1 aEck, L.H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.818-822x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03658naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175100001400184245007300198300001400271500018500285500002400470520159500494650000902089650001902098650002202117650002702139650001802166650002702184650002402211650001402235650003502249650002402284650003302308650003402341650002002375650001202395650002302407650003602430650001102466650004702477650004002524650004202564650004602606650003102652653001502683653002002698653002202718700001902740700001602759773009302775852000902868856009602877930003302973945002503006946001303031655001203044IND4399769920140724000000.0080108e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439976992DNAL7 a179539822pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aBó, G.A.10aAlternative approaches to setting up donor cows for superstimulation  ap. 81-87.  aPaper presented at the IETS 2008 Pre- and Post-Conference Symposia on Animal Models of Reproduction/Recent Developments in the Practice of Bovine Embryo Transfer, Denver, Colorado.  aIncludes references  aProtocols that controlled follicular wave emergence and ovulation have had a great impact on the application of on-farm embryo transfer, as they permitted the initiation of superstimulatory treatments at a self-appointed time. However, the most commonly used approach for synchronization of follicular wave emergence involved estradiol, which cannot be used in many countries. Therefore, alternative treatments are required. Mechanical removal of the dominant follicle by ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration was effective, but required the use of specialized equipment and trained technical staff, which made it difficult to utilize in the field. Exogenous GnRH or pLH have also been used to induce ovulation of a dominant follicle, synchronizing follicular wave emergence, but their efficacy was dependent on the stage of the dominant follicle at treatment; thus, the emergence of the ensuing follicular wave may be too variable for superstimulation. An alternative approach could be initiating treatments at the time of emergence of the first follicular wave, but the need to synchronize ovulation may be a disadvantage in groups of donors at random stages of the estrous cycle. The final alternative may be to use FSH or eCG to initiate a new wave, without regard to the presence of a dominant follicle, followed by superstimulatory treatment at a predetermined time. All alternatives need to be thoroughly investigated in order to confirm their utility in the superstimulation of donor cows, regardless of the stage of the estrous cycle and without compromising ova/embryo production. 3acows 3asuperovulation 3aovarian follicles 3afollicular development 3aestrous cycle 3aestrus synchronization 3ahormonal regulation 3aestradiol 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aluteinizing hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3aembryo transfer 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEstrus Synchronizationxmethods 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexpharmacology 2aGonadotropins, Equinexpharmacology 2aOocyte Donationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aOvulation Inductionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSuperovulationxphysiology 0adonor cows 0afollicular wave 0adominant follicle1 aGuerrero, D.C.1 aAdams, G.P.0 tTheriogenology.g2008 Jan., v. 69, no. 1 p.81-87dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.09.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20110614b20110701c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/04/23  aOther US 7aarticle02156naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001800220245009000238300001400328500002400342520073200366650002701098650001401125650002201139650001401161650001401175650001901189650001601208650001601224650002301240650002301263653003101286700002501317700001501342773012001357852000901477856007601486856005501562930003301617945002501650946001101675655001201686IND4378335920221119131640.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437833592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3032.2005.00478.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The first mature follicles in individuals held at 15, 20, 25 and 30 °C appear at 132, 120, 108 and 96 h, respectively, after a blood meal, whereas mature follicles are present in 50% of individuals by 156, 132, 120 and 108 h. Potential fecundity is low and the production of mature follicles is not synchronized closely with digestion of the blood meal. Adult survival is both temperature- and density-dependent.

  1 aDugravot, Sébastien10aConsequences for a specialist insect and its parasitoid of the response of Allium porrum to conspecific herbivore attack  ap. 73-79.  aIncludes references  aRecent studies on the leek Allium porrum L. demonstrate that a sharp increase in the release of volatile and nonvolatile sulphur compounds occurs in response to attack by the specialist phytophage, the leek moth Acrolepiopsis assectella (Zeller). The consequences of that response on the developmental capacity and behaviour of the leek moth and on the host-searching behaviour of the parasitoid hymenoptera Diadromus pulchellus Wesmael have been studied. No immediate adverse effect on larval development is seen, but the duration of male development is significantly longer. In addition, an almost 20% decrease is observed in the number of oocytes produced by adult females that developed on attack-damaged leek plants. Leek moths do not avoid damaged plants systematically. On attacked plants, larvae tend to consume more and females to lay more eggs, although the latter tendency disappears after intensive attack. Concerning host-searching by D. pulchellus, the data indicate that females make use of the induced leek response. Parasitoids are attracted more strongly to attacked plants than to undamaged plants and mechanically damaged plants. The results of this study in a tritrophic system involving a biannual plant suggest a complex defence system combining direct and indirect mechanisms. Sulphur compounds may act by reducing second-generation pests, thereby preventing the specialist insect population from exploding at the expense of the leek. 3aAllium porrum 3aleeks 3ahost plants 3aAcrolepiopsis assectella 3aplant damage 3aplant response 3ainduced resistance 3achemical constituents of plants 3ainsect development 3aparasitoids 3aDiadromus pulchellus 3ahost seeking 3atritrophic interactions 0ahebivore-induced plant defense 0asulfur compounds1 aThibout, Éric0 tPhysiological entomology.g2006 Mar., v. 31, no. 1 p.73-79dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl6908x0307-69627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3032.2005.00489.x3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3032.2005.00489.x  a20060424b20060529c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02866naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001700179245008200196300001400278500002400292500001500316520129500331650002601626650001301652650003301665650002301698650001801721650002401739650002901763650002001792650002601812650001001838650002301848650001901871650002401890650003101914650002101945653002301966653002801989653001102017700001702028700001502045773011002060852000902170856007602179930003302255945002502288946001102313655001202324IND4378337420221119131421.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437833742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01073.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF8301 aJalali, B.L.10aSignal Transduction and Transcriptional Regulation of Plant Defence Responses  ap. 65-74.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlant defence responses are regulated by a complex network of signal molecules and transcriptional regulators. Resistance (R) genes play a role in specific recognition of a pathogen and initiate defence responses. Three key signal molecules, namely salicylic acid (SA), jasmonate (JA) and ethylene (ET) mediate expression of both specific (R gene-mediated) as well as basal defence responses. The signalling pathways involving these molecules have been studied using mutants showing enhanced susceptibility or resistance to pathogens, or those showing insensitivity to exogenously applied SA, JA or ET. Crosstalk between the different signalling pathways leads to fine-tuning of the expression of defence-related genes. Complex regulatory networks modulated by at least eight different families of transcription factors play a role in defence gene expression. The transcription factors bind to cis-elements present in the promoters of the defence genes and are specific for different transcription factors. Several cis-elements often lie within the same promoter indicating that different transcription factors may lead to induction of the same defence gene. The redundancy observed in defence signalling and gene expression enables a plant to successfully combat a wide range of pathogens. 3atranscription factors 3aethylene 3aplant diseases and disorders 3agenetic resistance 3ajasmonic acid 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aresistance mechanisms 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3asalicylic acid 3aDNA-binding domains 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 0aliterature reviews 0amolecular sequence data 0aplants1 aBhargava, S.1 aKamble, A.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2006 Feb., v. 154, no. 2 p.65-74dBlackwell Verlag GmbHx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01073.x3electronic resource  a20070103b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03305naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012900170300001800299520193900317650002502256650002602281650002702307650000802334650001202342650002202354650001302376650001502389650001202404650001202416650001202428650001002440650001302450650001402463650001602477700002402493700001802517700001602535700002302551700002002574700001902594773017402613856005102787852000902838655001202847IND60558156920221119131606.0161110e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055815692DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-4182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacombe, Alison10aReduction of Bacterial Pathogens and Potential Surrogates on the Surface of Almonds Using High-Intensity 405-Nanometer Light  ap. 1840-1845.  aThe disinfecting properties of high-intensity monochromatic blue light (MBL) were investigated against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and nonpathogenic bacteria inoculated onto the surface of almonds. MBL was generated from an array of narrow-band 405-nm light-emitting diodes. Almonds were inoculated with higher or lower levels (8 or 5 CFU/g) of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella, as well as nonpathogenic E. coli K-12 and an avirulent strain of Salmonella Typhimurium, for evaluation as potential surrogates for their respective pathogens. Inoculated almonds were treated with MBL for 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min at a working distance of 7 cm. Simultaneous to treatment, cooling air was directed onto the almonds at a rate of 4 ft3/min (1.89 × 10–3 m3/s), sourced through a container of dry ice. An infrared camera was used to monitor the temperature readings after each run. For E. coli K-12, reductions of up to 1.85 or 1.63 log CFU/g were seen for higher and lower inoculum levels, respectively; reductions up to 2.44 and 1.44 log CFU/g were seen for E. coli O157:H7 (higher and lower inoculation levels, respectively). Attenuated Salmonella was reduced by up to 0.54 and 0.97 log CFU/g, whereas pathogenic Salmonella was reduced by up to 0.70 and 0.55 log CFU/g (higher and lower inoculation levels, respectively). Inoculation level did not significantly impact minimum effective treatment times, which ranged from 1 to 4 min. Temperatures remained below ambient throughout treatment, indicating that MBL is a nonthermal antimicrobial process. The nonpathogenic strains of E. coli and Salmonella each responded to MBL in a comparable manner to their pathogenic counterparts. These results suggest that these nonpathogenic strains may be useful in experiments with MBL in which a surrogate is required, and that MBL warrants further investigation as a potential antimicrobial treatment for low-moisture foods. 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aair 3aalmonds 3aavirulent strains 3abacteria 3ablue light 3acameras 3acooling 3adry ice 3afoods 3ainoculum 3apathogens 3atemperature1 aNiemira, Brendan A.1 aSites, Joseph1 aBoyd, Glenn1 aGurtler, Joshua B.1 aTyrell, Breanna1 aFleck, Melissa0 tJournal of food protection.g2016 Nov., v. 79, no. 11 p.1840-1845dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-418  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245008300169300001600252500030800268520132500576650001901901650001801920650001701938650001001955650001401965650002401979650002102003650001602024650001102040650001502051650001602066650001702082650001002099651001102109700001402120700001902134700002202153700001702175700001602192700002302208773014502231856005502376852000902431655001202440IND60558155720170801000000.0161110e20160331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055815572DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1115.322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRufato, L.10aAbscisic acid applications increases color in grapes and juice of ‘Isabel’  ap. 217-224.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC2014): IV International Symposium on Tropical Wines and international Symposium on Grape and Wine Production in Diverse Regions held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  aJuices produced by American grapes add a great value to producers and has great advantages over the wine, since alcohol free and having the same nutraceutical properties, the juice can be consumed at any time by anyone. The cultivar 'Isabel' is the foremost among the cultivars used for the preparation of grape juice, however, has poor color and the yield improvement process of the grapes in order to produce juice. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of applying abscisic acid (ABA) on the phenolic composition of berries and juice of cultivar 'Isabel'. The experiment was conducted in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in the municipality of Pinto Bandeira, with 'Isabel' cultivar of Vitis labrusca. The experimental design was randomized blocks with five replications. Applied in the veraison stage in five levels of abscisic acid (0, 200, 400 600 and 800 ppm). After harvesting, the assessment of physical, chemical and phenolic compounds present in the skin characteristics and whole juice were performed. The application of abscisic acid provided increased levels of polyphenols, anthocyanins and the color intensity in the 'Isabel' grape and juice produced, increasing linearly to 70% anthocyanins, 119% polyphenols, 61% of the intensity of the color of the juice produced from 'Isabel' grapes. 3aVitis labrusca 3aabscisic acid 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3acultivars 3aexperimental design 3afunctional foods 3agrape juice 3agrapes 3aharvesting 3apolyphenols 3asmall fruits 3awines 3aBrazil1 aLerin, S.1 aAllebrandt, R.1 aFagherazzi, A.

All antagonists showed low sensitivity to carboxin and thiram and high sensitivity to prochloraz. For mycelial radial growth, TV15 was highly sensitive to guazatine, prochloraz and triticonazole and TH24 moderately insensitive to carboxin, guazatine and thiram. For conidial germination TL144 was the most sensitive to the fungicides, for mycelial radial growth and conidial germination CR47 was the least sensitive. None of the antagonists showed any mycelial radial growth inhibition in presence of the herbicides at field dose, except for TL144. Most antagonists did not show any conidial germination inhibition by the herbicides. The in vitro toxicity of prochloraz, guazatine and triticonazole towards the antagonists was confirmed by light and scanning electron microscope showing hyphal disruptions and extrusion of cytoplasmic content. A mixture of CR47 and/or TA312 with carboxin, thiram and triticonazole, applied to wheat seeds, was able to control Fusarium culmorum artificially inoculated to wheat seedlings in growth chambers. In the field, the antagonists applied along with triticonazole or thiram, at 1/10 of the field dose to seeds naturally infected by F. culmorum, gave a disease control comparable to that induced by triticonazole at full field dose. Our results demonstrate how an integration of microorganisms with pesticides makes the control of wheat foot rot possible. 3aTrichoderma 3awheat 3aClonostachys rosea 3afungicide resistance 3amicrobial growth 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aspore germination 3aconidia 3abiological control agents 3afungal diseases of plants 3acytoplasm 3aTriticum aestivum 3amycelium 3aFusarium culmorum 3acytotoxicity 3ahyphae 3adisease control 3aherbicide resistance 3afungicides 3aherbicides 0aHypocreales 0aClonostachys rosea f. rosea1 aBadiali, F.1 aPisi, A.1 aVeronesi, A.1 aPancaldi, D.1 aCesari, A.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2006 Feb., v. 154, no. 2 p.100-109dBlackwell Verlag GmbHx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01069.x3electronic resource  a20070103b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02078naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001700203245004600220300001400266500002400280500001500304520091600319650001201235650002001247650002601267650002301293650002101316653001301337773011701350852000901467856009201476856005501568930003301623945002501656946001101681655001201692IND4378400420221119131745.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437840042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-3010.2006.00538.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Information on the nutritional composition of foods forms the basis of the quantitative study of nutrition, and is widely used in a variety of fields, including epidemiological research, clinical practice and health promotion, policy and food manufacturing. This review details key milestones in the development of food composition databases, focusing on the history of the well-known and highly regarded McCance and Widdowson's The Composition of Foods series. Evolving requirements for food composition data are outlined together with changes in the format over time. Finally, the importance of networks and cooperations, such as the new European Food Information Resource (EuroFIR) Network of Excellence, in supporting and improving food composition data is discussed. 3ahistory 3anutritive value 3anutrition information 3anutrient databanks 3afood composition 0anetworks0 tNutrition bulletin.g2006 Mar., v. 31, no. 1 p.15-20dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl6406x1471-98277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-3010.2006.00538.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-3010.2006.00538.x  a20071121b20071210c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/11/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02311naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002000170245006900190300001600259500002400275500001500299520113400314650002001448650002201468650001301490650001301503650001101516650001001527650002301537651001601560653001501576700001801591773012201609852000901731856009201740930003301832945002501865946001101890655001201901IND4378390120221119131647.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437839012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1470-6431.2005.00457.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX800 0aU1001 aLee, Young Jin.14aThe development of an emotion model based on colour combinations  ap. 122-136.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe purpose of this study was to develop an emotion model based on the colour combinations popularly used for interior coordination in Korea. To summarize, the emotion model had the following features: (1) It consisted of three axes named as 'soft-hard' (first dimension), 'light-heavy' (second dimension) and 'splendid-sober' (third dimension). (2) The emotion descriptors were categorized into nine emotion groups and matched with the representing colour combinations. (3) This emotion model had a one-to-multiplicity correspondence structure between the colour combination and the emotion descriptor, whereas most of the previously developed models included only one-to-one correspondence. (4) It was observed that the emotion variable only showed a relatively consistent tendency within the space of the emotion model as the difference in the tone of colour combinations increased or decreased. The emotion model developed in this study can be used as a basis for the determination of local consumers' emotion on colour combinations to support colour planning in the industrial design field relevant to interior coordination. 3ainterior design 3asimulation models 3aplanning 3aemotions 3adesign 3acolor 3aconsumer attitudes 3aSouth Korea 0apsychology1 aLee, Joohyeon0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2006 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.122-136dBlackwell Science Ltdx1470-64237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2005.00457.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080110b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02081naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115245007800128300001600206500001500222520110900237650002001346650001801366650000801384650001001392650002501402650002301427650002001450650002101470650001601491651001901507653000901526700001401535773009701549852000901646939003301655945000801688946001101696655001201707991564025900742620221119131716.0920430e199006  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920014372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCade, J.10aWhat can people eat to meet the dietary goals: and how much does it cost?  ap. 199-207.  a2019-12-04  aIn order to meet the UK dietary goals, changes in the usual diet will need to be made.

A majority consumed more fat, more sugar and less carbohydrate and fibre than recommended. Nutrient intakes for those meeting the goals were compared with those who did not meet them. Fewer subjects met a combination of goals, for example, only 7% met all three COMA fat goals. The 28 subjects who met a combination of the goals for total fat/saturated fat/PS ratio/carbohydrate or sugar/fibre (the combined goals group) were compared with a similar number (the average group) from subjects whose nutrient intakes were within the twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles. Nutrient and food intakes were compared. The combined goals group ate, for example, more cereals, wholemeal and brown bread and less white bread than the others. The average daily cost of the food intake for the combined goals group was (excluding alcohol) 2.03 pounds sterling and for the average group 1.86 pounds sterling. 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3amen 3awomen 3anutritional adequacy 3amiddle-aged adults 3adietary surveys 3afood consumption 3afood prices 3aUnited Kingdom 0adiet1 aBooth, S.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1990 June, v. 3, no. 3 p.199-207x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02759naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001100173245010700184300001800291500002400309520123300333650001601566650001301582650002301595650001001618650002001628650002701648650001901675650000901694650002101703650003801724650002301762650003301785650002101818650002001839650003601859650002301895653001201918653001501930653001301945700001701958773010301975852000902078856008502087930003302172945002502205946001102230655001202241IND4378444920221119131729.0060306e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437844492DNAL7 a160883982pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-005-0027-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aXu, M.10aMolecular mapping of k2 Mdh1-n y20, an unstable chromosomal region in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]  ap. 1457-1465.  aIncludes references  aIn the soybean genome, a chromosomal region covering three tightly linked genes, k2, Mdh1-n, and y20, was found very unstable. It was suspected that the instability of the k2 Mdh1-n y20 chromosomal region was caused by a non-autonomous transposable element residing adjacent to or in this region. In this study, we located and mapped this region with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers on the soybean integrated map using five mapping populations. The k2 Mdh1-n y20 chromosomal region was located on molecular linkage group H. The integrated map from five mapping populations consisted of 13 loci in the order Satt541, Satt469, Sat_122, Satt279, Satt253, Satt314, Mdh1-n,y20, k2, Satt302, Satt142, Satt181, and Satt434. The k2 Mdh1-n y20 chromosomal region was very close to Satt314, Satt253, and Satt279. The genetic distance between the Mdh1-n gene and Satt314 was less than 1 cM. The results of the mapping study were consistent with the results from previous studies that the Mdh1-n mutation in T261 (k2 Mdh1-n) and the Mdh1-n y20 mutation in T317 (Mdh1-n y20) were caused by deletions. In addition, another putative deletion was found in the genome of T261 which covered three SSR markers (Satt314, Satt253, and Satt279). 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3agene segregation 2aChromosomal Instabilityxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenetic Linkage 2aMinisatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aSoybeansxgenetics 0ak2 gene 0aMdh-n gene 0ay20 gene1 aPalmer, R.G.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2005 Nov., v. 111, no. 8 p.1457-1465dSpringerx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-005-0027-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02730naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001400135245009600149300001400245500002300259500001500282520145000297650002801747650001501775650001701790650002001807650002101827650001601848650002701864650001901891650001301910650001601923650001701939651001101956653002401967653001501991700001502006700001702021773009302038852000902131856007502140930003302215945001302248946001102261655001202272IND2200290320221119131633.0990825e199701  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220029032DNAL7 a10.1139/x96-1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMethy, M.10aTemperature-induced changes of photosystem II activity in Quercus ilex and Pinus halepensis  ap. 31-38.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe temperature dependence of chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics and their capacity to recover from heat stress were investigated in two Mediterranean evergreen tree species, a conifer, Pinus halepensis Mill., and an oak species, Quercus ilex L. Analyses were performed over the range 5-50 degrees C, in relation to the duration and the mode of heat exposure. Changes in initial fluorescence, indicating damage to the thylakoid membrane, were observed at about 48.5 degrees C in both species from slow heating F0(T) curves (F0 is the initial (or minimum) fluorescence in the dark and T is temperature). With increasing duration of heat exposure, the rise in F0 was observed from 40 degrees C in P. halepensis and from 45 degrees C in Q. ilex. Pinus halepensis showed higher photosystem II photochemical efficiencies and photochemical fluorescence quenching in the normal physiological range of temperature. However, at the highest temperatures, Q. ilex showed a higher thermal tolerance for all the measured fluorescence parameters. Quercus ilex leaves maintained photosynthetic capacity for up to 10 min at 50 degrees C. Based on the value of Fv/Fm (where Fm is the maximum fluorescence in the dark and Fv = Fm - F0 (variable fluorescence in the dark)), a higher proportion of Q. ilex leaves recovered and recovered faster, after heat exposure, than needles of P. halepensis. The consequences for the ecology of both species are reviewed. 3ainterspecific variation 3athylakoids 3afluorescence 3aair temperature 3aPinus halepensis 3aheat stress 3aenvironmental exposure 3aphotosystem II 3aduration 3achlorophyll 3aQuercus ilex 3aFrance 0aspecies differences 0aefficiency1 aGillon, D.1 aHoussard, C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1997 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.31-38x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x96-1273Available from publisher's Web site  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01862naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245012500173300001600298520071600314650001301030650001301043650001001056650001201066650002101078650001701099650002301116650001801139650001601157700001801173700001801191773014201209852000901351856009401360939003301454946001301487655001201500IND9001029520221119131701.0900309e199001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900102952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1990.tb06047.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbrecht, J.A.10aRelationship of total sulfur to initial and retained ascorbic acid in selected cruciferous and noncruciferous vegetables  ap. 181-183.  aSelected cruciferous (including six cultivars of broccoli) and noncruciferous vegetables were analyzed for ascorbic acid, total sulfur, moisture contents and pH.

During storage ascorbic acid retention in cruciferous vegetables ranged from 75-98%, whereas non-cruciferous vegetables ranged from 16-75% retention. Initial ascorbic acid content correlated with sulfur content (r = 0.925) when comparing cruciferous and noncruciferous vegetables.

In the split split plot experimental design, NO3(-) availability (low and high) and tree species were nested in two levels of atmospheric CO2 (ambient, 355 microliters/L; elevated, 650 microliters/L). Seedlings were grown for 57 days in environmental control rooms. Increased CO2 and NO3(-) availability positively and (mostly) independently influenced total growth and relative growth rates. Moderate to weak interactions between CO2 and NO3(-) for several growth parameters (e.g., leaf production, shoot length, root collar diameter) in some species indicated an enhanced response to CO2 enrichment under conditions of high NO3(-) availability. Interactive effects were most pronounced in aspen. Seedling growth and allocation responses to CO2 and NO3(-) were frequently species specific and associated with successional status. For example, proportional increases in growth in response to elevated CO2 were greatest for sugar maple and least for quaking aspen, whereas the converse was true with respect to response to high NO3(-) availability. This research indicates that the impact of enriched CO2 atmospheres on forest communities will be influenced by both nutrient availability and unique species characteristics. 3ainterspecific variation 3acarbon dioxide 3adiameter 3aQuercus rubra 3anutrient availability 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3asoil fertility 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aAcer saccharum 3adry matter partitioning 3aapplication rate 3anitrates 3ashoots 0aspecies differences 0ainteractions 0agrowth rate 0acarbon dioxide enrichment 0agrowth1 aLindroth, R.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1997 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.1-10x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x96-1513Available from publisher's Web site  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02099naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245010100153300001800254520090500272650002201177650001201199650002201211650001301233650002401246650002301270653002401293653001901317653003401336700001401370700001601384700001701400700001701417700001601434773009801450852000901548856007501557930003301632945001301665946001101678655001201689IND2048888820221119131747.0951121e199510  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204888882DNAL7 a10.1139/x95-1762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeintraub, A.10aHeuristic procedures for solving mixed-integer harvest scheduling-transportation planning models  ap. 1618-1626.  aModeling both road construction and land management activities as 0-1 variables greatly enhances the spatial aspect of linear programming models dealing with harvest scheduling and transportation planning. In previous work we developed a heuristic procedure that modeled only road construction as 0-1 variables. We have expanded this past procedure to also consider land management decisions as 0-1 variables. This paper outlines the heuristic procedure developed for modeling both road building and land management decisions as integer variables in light of adjacency constraints. The heuristic procedure allows economic or physical objectives to be maximized or minimized. A wide variety of side constraints can be accommodated and these constraints can include both road construction and land management decision variables. These heuristic procedures have performed well on models tested thus far. 3aforest management 3alogging 3aroad construction 3aplanning 3amathematical models 3alinear programming 0ainteger programming 0aroad transport 0aheuristic integer programming1 aJones, G.1 aMeacham, M.1 aMagendzo, A.1 aMagendzo, A.1 aMalchuk, D.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1995 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1618-1626x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x95-1763Available from publisher's Web site  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02577naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001700161245009400178300001600272500002400288500001500312520114200327650001801469650001801487650003501505650002201540650001801562650001901580650001401599650000801613650003801621650001401659650002001673650001101693653001601704653001601720653002701736653002201763700001801785700001401803773011201817852000901929856007601938930003302014945002502047946001102072655001202083IND4378339120221119131728.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437833912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01068.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8331 aKumari, S.G.13aAn Improved Antiserum for Sensitive Serologic Detection of Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus  ap. 129-133.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA Syrian chickpea isolate of Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus (CpCDV; genus Mastrevirus, family Geminiviridae) was purified and yielded 0.6-0.8 mg of purified virus per kg of infected chickpea tissue.

Chemical test indicated that amino nitrogen and total volatile nitrogen increased with time of storage at the same rate as for the control. 3ahot dogs 3aproteins 3afood composition 3asensory evaluation 0amaize germ 0ameat extenders1 aLin, C.S.0 tJournal of food science : an official publication of the Institute of Food Technologists.g1989 , v. 54, no. 6 p.1452-1456x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1989.tb05133.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02236naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001600161245013000177300001600307500002400323500001500347520078500362650001701147650001301164650001201177650003201189650002501221650000901246650002701255650002501282650001301307650001601320650001201336650001901348653002501367653002801392653002201420700001501442700003101457773011201488852000901600856007601609930003301685945002501718946001101743655001201754IND4378339320221119131723.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437833932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01074.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2051 aChillet, M.10aRelationship between Ripening and the Development of Banana Anthracnose Caused by Colletotrichum musae (Berck. and Curt.)

Little is known about the effects of ethylene on the development of wound anthracnose and quiescent anthracnose. The results of our experiments with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an ethylene receptor site inhibitor, clearly revealed that ethylene was not directly involved in triggering rot development. Quiescent anthracnose symptoms were found to appear only after bananas began ripening. In contrast, wound anthracnose developed just as quickly in 'green 1-MCP-treated bananas' as in 'yellow ripening bananas'. In cases of wound anthracnose, contrary to quiescent anthracnose, rot development was not dependent on the extent of peel ripeness. 3aplant damage 3aethylene 3aconidia 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3apostharvest diseases 3aMusa 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aColletotrichum musae 3aripening 3aanthracnose 3abananas 3adisease course 0a1-methylcyclopropene 0aplant growth substances 0awound anthracnose1 aHubert, O.1 ade Lapeyre de Bellaire, L.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2006 Mar., v. 154, no. 3 p.143-147dBlackwell Verlag GmbHx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01074.x3electronic resource  a20070104b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03074naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245016900167300001800336520177600354650001402130650002402144650001002168650001102178650002002189650001902209650002602228650003102254650001902285650001302304650001602317650001102333650002002344650001902364700002202383700002702405700002202432773015502454856004602609852000902655655001202664IND60558153120221119131517.0161110e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055815312DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.77.10.10642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrisbie, David D.10aEfficacy of intravenous administration of hyaluronan, sodium chondroitin sulfate, and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine for prevention or treatment of osteoarthritis in horses  ap. 1064-1070.  aOBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of IV administration of a product containing hyaluronan, sodium chondroitin sulfate, and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine for prevention or treatment of osteoarthritis in horses. ANIMALS 32 healthy 2- to 5-year-old horses. PROCEDURES The study involved 2 portions. To evaluate prophylactic efficacy of the test product, horses received 5 mL of the product (n = 8) or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (8; placebo) IV every fifth day, starting on day 0 (when osteoarthritis was induced in the middle carpal joint of 1 forelimb) and ending on day 70. To evaluate treatment efficacy, horses received either the product or placebo (n = 8/treatment) on days 16, 23, 30, 37, and 44 after osteoarthritis induction. Clinical, diagnostic imaging, synovial fluid, gross anatomic, and histologic evaluations and other tests were performed. Results of each study portion were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS Limb flexion and radiographic findings were significantly worse for horses that received the test product in the prophylactic efficacy portion than for placebo-treated horses or product-treated horses in the treatment efficacy portion. In the prophylactic efficacy portion, significantly less articular cartilage erosion was identified in product-treated versus placebo-treated horses. In the treatment efficacy portion, joints of product-treated horses had a greater degree of bone edema identified via MRI than did joints of placebo-treated horses but fewer microscopic articular cartilage abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that caution should be used when administering the evaluated product IV to horses, particularly when administering it prophylactically, as it may have no benefit or may even cause harm. 3acartilage 3achondroitin sulfate 3aedema 3ahorses 3ahyaluronic acid 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aosteoarthritis 3aplacebos 3aradiography 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asynovial fluid1 aMcllwraith, Wayne1 aKawcak, Christopher E.1 aWerpy, Natasha M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2016 Oct., v. 77, no. 10 p.1064-1070dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.77.10.1064  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001900180245006600199300001400265500002400279500001500303520089200318650002201210650002301232650002201255650003001277650002101307650002801328650002001356650002001376650003201396650001001428650001201438650002801450650001701478650002001495650001401515650003201529650002901561650003801590653002401628653002901652653001001681700002101691700002201712700002101734700001901755700002101774773009401795852000901889856007601898930003301974945002502007946001102032655001202043IND4378333620221119131700.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437833362DNAL7 a164412992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2005.01377.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2001 aDvorak, C.M.T.10aMapping of genes expressed in activated porcine Peyer's patch  ap. 62-65.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo determine the chromosomal locations for genes expressed in porcine Peyer's patches, polymerase chain reaction-based mapping of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) isolated from a porcine Peyer's patch-specific cDNA library was performed across a 6500-rad swine radiation hybrid panel. A total of 116 ESTs were mapped with LOD scores >6.0, and another 11 ESTs had LOD scores between 5.0 and 6.0. Of these 127 ESTs, 63% matched known genes (<e-25), 26% matched genes of unknown function, and 11% matched no sequences in the public mammalian databases. Comparative mapping information for 91% of the unknown ESTs was obtained in silico by sequence matching to human chromosomes. Placement of these ESTs on the porcine map will assist in the development of high density and comparative genetic maps for positional cloning and identification of genes responsible for immune function in the gut. 3acomplementary DNA 3asequence alignment 3agenomic libraries 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amucosal immunity 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aPeyer's patches 3agene expression 3aphysical chromosome mapping 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Library 2aGenesxgenetics 2aLod Score 2aPeyer's Patchesxmetabolism 2aRadiation Hybrid Mapping 2aSus scrofaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acomparative mapping 0aradiation hybrid mapping 0agenes1 aFlickinger, G.H.1 aHendrickson, J.A.1 aFahrenkrug, S.C.1 aMurtaugh, M.P.1 aRutherford, M.S.0 tAnimal genetics.g2006 Feb., v. 37, no. 1 p.62-65dBlackwell Science Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2005.01377.x3electronic resource  a20060831b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02958naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245012700169300001800296520196500314650001702279650001302296650001102309650001902320650001202339700002102351700001702372700002502389700002002414773015502434856004602589852000902635655001202644IND60558153220221119131455.0161110e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055815322DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.77.10.10712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiedrzycki, Adam H.10aIn vitro biomechanical evaluation of four surgical techniques for fusion of equine centrodistal and tarsometatarsal joints  ap. 1071-1081.  aOBJECTIVE To evaluate the biomechanical properties of 4 methods for fusion of the centrodistal and tarsometatarsal joints in horses and compare them among each other and with control tarsi. SAMPLE 24 sets of paired tarsi without substantial signs of osteoarthritis harvested from equine cadavers. PROCEDURES Test constructs (n = 6/type) were prepared from 1 tarsus from each pair to represent surgical drilling; 2 medially to laterally placed kerf-cut cylinders (MLKCs); a single large, dorsally applied kerf-cut cylinder (DKC); and a dorsomedially applied locking compression plate (DMLCP). Constructs and their contralateral control tarsi were evaluated in 4-point bending in the dorsoplantar, lateromedial, and mediolateral directions; internal and external rotation; and axial compression. Bending, torsional, and axial stiffness values were calculated. RESULTS Mean stiffness values were consistently lower for surgical drilling constructs than for contralateral control tarsi. Over all biomechanical testing, surgical drilling significantly reduced joint stability. The MLKC constructs had superior biomechanical properties to those of control tarsi for 4-point bending but inferior properties for external and internal rotation. The DMLCP and DKC constructs were superior to control tarsi in dorsoplantar, rotational, and axial compression directions only; DMLCP constructs had no superior stiffness in lateromedial or mediolateral directions. Only the DKC constructs had greater stiffness in the mediolateral direction than did control tarsi. Over all biomechanical testing, DMLCP and DKC constructs were superior to the other constructs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE These biomechanical results suggested that a surgical drilling approach to joint fusion may reduce tarsal stability in horses without clinical osteoarthritis, compared with stability with no intervention, whereas the DMLCP and DKC approaches may significantly enhance stability. 3abiomechanics 3adrilling 3ahorses 3aosteoarthritis 3asurgery1 aGrant, Barrie G.1 aNemke, Brett1 aMorello, Samantha L.1 aMarkel, Mark D.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2016 Oct., v. 77, no. 10 p.1071-1081dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.77.10.1071  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245009100169300001800260520165100278650001101929650001101940650002401951650000901975700002201984700002502006700003002031700002502061773015502086856004602241852000902287655001202296IND60558153320221119131524.0161110e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055815332DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.77.10.10822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Roux, Christelle10aComputed tomographic findings of pulmonary atelectasis in healthy anesthetized Beagles  ap. 1082-1092.  aOBJECTIVE To characterize the extent and location of atelectasis in healthy anesthetized dogs positioned in lateral recumbency and to determine whether repositioning dogs in sternal recumbency would resolve atelectasis. ANIMALS 6 healthy adult Beagles. PROCEDURES Each dog was anesthetized and underwent a CT examination twice with a 2-week interval between examinations. Once anesthetized, each dog was positioned in sternal recumbency, and a breath-hold helical transverse thoracic CT scan was acquired. The dog was then positioned in lateral recumbency for 30 minutes, and images were obtained at 5 preselected sites at 3, 8, 13, 20, and 30 minutes after repositioning (phase 1). Then, the dog was repositioned in sternal recumbency, and CT images were obtained at the 5 preselected sites at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after repositioning (phase 2). The protocol for the second examination was the same as the first except the dog was positioned in the opposite lateral recumbency during phase 1. The attenuation and cross-sectional area of the lung lobes at the preselected sites were measured and compared over time. RESULTS Lateral recumbency did not cause atelectasis in any of the dogs. Patchy areas of abnormally increased attenuation were infrequently detected in the left cranial lung lobe when dogs were positioned in left lateral recumbency, and those areas failed to resolve when dogs were positioned in sternal recumbency. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that the extent of lung attenuation changes was minimal in healthy anesthetized Beagles positioned in lateral recumbency and should not preclude CT examination. 3aBeagle 3aadults 3acomputed tomography 3adogs1 aCassel, Nicolette1 aFosgate, Geoffrey T.1 aZwingenberger, Allison L.1 aKirberger, Robert M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2016 Oct., v. 77, no. 10 p.1082-1092dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.77.10.1082  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001900203245009400222300001400316500002400330520177300354650001602127650003602143650001402179650001502193650001802208650002202226650001602248650002002264650002202284650002102306651001302327653002302340653002702363700002102390700002202411773012002433852000902553856007602562856005502638930003302693945002502726946001102751655001202762IND4378335120221119131602.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437833512DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3032.2005.00477.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBedick, Jon C.10aHigh water-loss rates and rapid dehydration in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus marginatus  ap. 23-29.  aIncludes references  aDuring the summer months, there is a high mortality of burying beetle (Coleoptera: Silphidae) species in pitfall traps containing dry soil. The present study investigated the possibility that the burying beetle Nicrophorus marginatus is highly susceptible to death from desiccation. In the laboratory, adult beetles lose 1-5% body mass per hour in low humidity conditions (25-30% relative humidity), depending on temperature. This rate of water-loss results in a 50% mortality within 7-16 h at temperatures between 16 and 28 °C. Nicrophorus marginatus produces oral and anal defensive secretions when disturbed but these secretions do not significantly contribute to the high rate of water loss. Beetles readily drink and thus beetles with access to water or in high humidity conditions suffer near zero mortality. For comparison, the similarly sized mesic bess beetle (Coleoptera: Passalidae), Odontotaenius disjunctus, and a large nocturnal tiger beetle (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae), Amblychila cylindriformis, are exposed to dehydrating conditions. Nicrophorus marginatus have higher rates of water-loss (by 26% and 79%, respectively). It is predicted that the diurnal N. marginatus uses behavioural mechanisms to avoid lethal water loss. In the field, N. marginatus displays a strong bimodal activity pattern, avoiding the hottest hours of the day. The significance of these findings is that N. marginatus defies normal predictions of association between water-loss rates and habitat type, and has extended its range into apparently unfavourable habitats despite high water-loss rates. In addition, the results suggest that researchers should provide moisture when studying burying beetles, including the endangered American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus). 3aNicrophorus 3adehydration (animal physiology) 3amortality 3abody water 3awater content 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3ainsect behavior 3adiurnal variation 3adiurnal activity 3aNebraska 0adesiccation stress 0adesiccation resistance1 aHoback, W.

Karst.) and 6-year-old red oak (Quercus rubra L.) trees planted directly into the soil were enclosed in open-top chambers and exposed to either 350 or 700 micromoles.mol-1 of CO2 for three growing seasons. During the third year a natural drought was allowed to develop, reducing the predawn leaf water potential to between -0.80 and -1.15 MPa. Intensive gas-exchange measurements were performed before, during, and after the drought. CO2 response curves revealed mesophyll limitation to photosynthesis in drought-stressed trees grown in elevated levels of CO2. The water-use efficiency was greater for trees grown at elevated CO2, but less so during drought in red oak and the same between treatments for drought-stressed spruce. Diurnal measurements showed that enhancement of assimilation rates of trees grown at 700 micromoles.mol-1 depended upon the time of day that measurements were made. There was an acclimation to increased CO2 in both species that could not be explained by leaf area differences, available soil for roots, nutrient limitation, or starch accumulation. 3aPicea abies 3aQuercus rubra 3acarbon dioxide 3awater stress 3aphotosynthesis 3adrought 3adiurnal variation 3aconifer needles 3aleaf conductance 3astomata 3awater use efficiency 3aacclimation 0acarbon dioxide enrichment1 aDixon, M.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1996 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.87-94x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-0093Available from publisher's Web site  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle01416naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245010700135300001600242520064100258650001600899650002200915650002200937653002900959773009900988852000901087939003301096945000801129946001301137655001201150991615414580742620221122010115.0850813e198505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859258672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWetzstein, M.E.10aMethods for measuring the economic impact of ambient pollutants on the agricultural sector: discussion  ap. 419-420.  aExtract: Abstracting from Pope, models for measuring economic impact should consider the following three principles: (a) it should be flexible enough to describe the underlying environment; (b) it should accommodate theory; and (c) it should provide results that directly lead to policy implications.

  1 aShivaprasad, H.L.10aCoronary artery rupture in male commercial turkeys  ap. 226-232.  aMortalities of 3% in a 1-week period and 2.5% in a 4-week period occurred in two flocks of 13-week-old to 16-week-old male turkeys, respectively. Eleven of 18 birds submitted to the laboratory for necropsy had large amounts of clotted blood in the pericardial sac and transverse bands of haemorrhage at the base of the left heart. Three other birds had clotted blood in the abdominal cavity due to rupture of the aorta. Histopathology of the hearts with haemorrhage at the base of the left heart revealed medial degeneration, necrosis and rupture of the coronary arteries. Special stains revealed decrease in elastic fibres and increase in fibrous connective tissue in the coronary arteries. Fourteen of 16 birds had a low copper concentration (<5 mg/kg wet weight) in the liver; the zinc concentration was high in one bird. Levels of heavy metals including copper and selenium in the feed were within normal ranges for poultry. No mycotoxins were detected in the feed. Tests for bacterial and viral pathogens showed no significant findings. The average weight of these turkeys at market at 16 weeks was 12.5 kg, which was considered 1.4 to 2.3 kg higher than normal. It is well known that male turkeys are prone to hypertensive angiopathy. Therefore, it is probable that higher body weights in the turkeys in conjunction with the hypertensive angiopathy and low levels of copper may have predisposed the birds for coronary artery rupture. Genetic diseases such as connective tissue disorders of the elastin and/or collagen were also considered as possible causes. 3aturkeys 3amales 3acoronary vessels 3aheart diseases 2aAnimals 2aAortaxpathology 2aBody Weight 2aCopperxanalysis 2aCoronary Vesselsxpathology 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMale 2aNecrosis 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathology 2aRupture, Spontaneousxmortalityxpathologyxveterinary. 2aTurkeys 2aZincxanalysis1 aCrespo, R.1 aPuschner, B.0 tAvian pathology.g2004 Apr., v. 33, no. 2 p.226-232x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079450420001957773Available from publisher's Web site  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDdDfXe2006/02/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03016naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003100130040001800161100001400179245011400193300001700307500001500324506007600339520099200415506003701407650001801444650002101462650000801483650002101491650002901512650002201541650003001563650002101593650001701614650001201631650002301643650003101666650006501697650002901762650002101791650001301812650001701825650001301842650001001855650004701865650004401912650002701956653002301983653001102006653001402017653002502031700001602056700001702072773014002089852000902229856008102238930003302319945001302352946001302365655001202378IND2050453620221207114706.0960321e19960206dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205045362DNAL7 a85777752pmid7 aPMC400182pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.93.3.9962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, S.10aTranscription of tufA and other chloroplast-encoded genes is controlled by a circadian clock in Chlamydomonas  ap. 996-1000.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLevels of mRNA for the chloroplast-encoded elongation factor Tu (tufA) showed a dramatic daily oscillation in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, peaking once each day in the early light period. The oscillation of tufA mRNA levels continued in cells shifted to continuous light or continuous dark for at least 2-3 days. Run-off transcription analyses showed that the rate tufA transcription also peaked early in the light period and, moreover, that this transcriptional oscillation continued in cells shifted to continuous conditions. The half-life of tufA mRNA was estimated at different times and found to vary considerably during a light-dark cycle but not in cells shifted to continuous light. Light-dark patterns of transcription of several other chloroplast-encoded genes were examined and also found to persist in cells shifted to continuous light or dark. These results indicate that a circadian clock controls the transcription of tufA and other chloroplast-encoded genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3aDNA 3abinding proteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3adiurnal variation 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3acircadian rhythm 3achloroplasts 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCell Membrane Permeability 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aDarkness 2aGenes, Plant 2aKinetics 2aLight 2aPeptide Elongation Factor Tuxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0agenome 0atuga gene 0aelongation factor tu1 aKawazoe, R.1 aHerrin, D.L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1996 Feb. 6, v. 93, no. 3 p.996-1000x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.3.9963Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04136naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003100130040001800161100001800179245023700197300001600434506007600450520140900526506003701935650002501972650002101997650002202018650002502040650002502065650002002090650001802110650000902128650001702137650001302154650002402167650002602191650001802217650007402235650002302309650002102332650003302353650001602386650004402402650001702446650003302463650003002496650003102526650002802557650001302585650006202598650003302660650003902693650002402732650002702756650003402783650003402817653001602851653002702867653002802894653001902922700001302941700001702954700001802971700002802989700001803017700001803035773014003053852000903193856008103202930003303283945001303316946001303329655001203342IND2050356320221207130007.0960315e19960123dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205035632DNAL7 a85706312pmid7 aPMC401292pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.93.2.7652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizoguchi, T.12aA gene encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase is induced simultaneously with genes for a mitogen-activated protein kinase and an S6 ribosomal protein kinase by touch, cold, and water stress in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 765-769.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe here the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a protein kinase that has high sequence homology to members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MAPKKK or MEKK) family; this cDNA is named cATMEKK1 (Arabidopsis thaliana MAP kinase or ERK kinase kinase 1). The catalytic domain of the putative ATMEKK1 protein shows approximately 40% identity with the amino acid sequences of the catalytic domains of MAPKKKs (such as Byr2 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Ste11 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bck1 from S. cerevisiae, MEKK from mouse, and NPK1 from tobacco). In yeast cells that overexpress ATMEKK1, the protein kinase replaces Ste11 in responding to mating pheromone. In this study, the expression of the protein kinases was examined by Northern blot analyses: ATMEKK1 (structurally related to MAPKKK), ATMPK3 (structurally related to MAPK), and ATPK19 (structurally related to ribosomal S6 kinase). The mRNA levels of these three protein kinases increased markedly and simultaneously in response to touch, cold, and salinity stress. These results suggest that MAP kinase cascades, which are thought to respond to a variety of extracellular signals, are regulated not only at the posttranslational level but also at the transcriptional level in plants and that MAP kinase cascades in plants may function in transducing signals in the presence of environmental stress.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acold 3awater stress 3asalinity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCalcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCold Temperature 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDesiccation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMAP Kinase Kinase Kinases 2aMolecular Probe Techniques 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPressure 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRibosomal Protein S6 Kinases 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaltsxpharmacology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 0adesiccation 0amechanical stimulation 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d504681 aIrie, K.1 aHirayama, T.1 aHayashida, N.1 aYamaguchi-Shinozaki, K.1 aMatsumoto, K.1 aShinozaki, K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1996 Jan. 23, v. 93, no. 2 p.765-769x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.2.7653Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04782naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169100001500178245008700193300001600280500002400296500001500320520264400335650001702979650001802996650001903014650000803033650002003041650002203061650002003083650001203103650001803115650001803133650002603151650001603177650001403193650001103207650001103218650001603229650000903245650002503254650004703279650001203326650001603338650004303354650001303397650005503410650002803465650003903493650003903532650004103571650000903612650002203621653001603643653002603659653002003685700002203705700001803727700002403745773011803769852000903887856008103896930003303977945002504010946001304035655001204048IND4415421420221121224758.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441542142DNAL7 a191646792pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2008-13682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aHill, T.M.10aEffects of changing the essential and functional fatty acid intake of dairy calves  ap. 670-676.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThere is limited information on the effects and requirements of specific fatty acids for dairy calves. The starter diet based on corn and soybean meal, which is typical in the United States, is low in C₁₈:₃, and the ratio of C₁₈:₂ to C₁₈:₃ is quite high relative to recommendations for human infants. Additionally, other functional fatty acids (C₂₀:₄, C₂₀:₅, C₂₂:₆) elongated from C₁₈:₂ and C₁₈:₃ have proven benefits in monogastric species. Thus, the effect of adding Ca salts of flax oil (high in C₁₈:₃) or fish oil (high in C₂₀:₄, C₂₀:₅, C₂₂:₆) to the starter diet of calves less than 3 mo old was investigated. In trial 1, 48 Holstein bull calves [43.2 ± 1.4 kg of body weight (BW); 12/treatment] that were 2 to 3 d of age were fed 1 of 4 starter treatments containing A) no flax or fish oil (control), B) 0.125% Ca salt of flax oil, C) 0.250% Ca salt of flax oil, or D) 0.250% Ca salt of fish oil. Starters and water were fed free-choice to calves. During the first 56 d, calves were individually penned. From arrival until d 28, calves were fed a 26% crude protein, 17% fat milk replacer. From 56 to 84 d, calves were penned in groups of 6 and maintained on their same starter blended with 5% chopped grass hay. Trial 2 used 96 Holstein steer calves (66.3 ± 3.11 kg of BW; 24/treatment) that were 59 to 60 d old in a 28-d trial. These calves had been managed for their first 56 d in the same way as the calves from trial 1 before starting trial 2. Trial 2 evaluated increasing concentrations of Ca salt of flax oil within a starter blended with 5% chopped grass hay and fed with water free-choice. The 4 treatments were A) 0%, B) 0.083%, C) 0.167%, and D) 0.250% Ca salt of flax oil. In trial 1, there were no differences among calves fed the control diet and calves fed the diet supplemented with flax oil. In trial 1, average daily gain (ADG) increased linearly as flax oil increased in the starter from d 0 to 56 and from d 56 to 84, and hip width change increased linearly as flax oil increased in the starter. Serum urea nitrogen and serum glucose concentrations decreased as flax oil increased in the diet. In trial 2, ADG and feed efficiency increased linearly as flax oil increased in the starter. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations increased as flax oil increased in the diet. Supplementing a Ca salt of fish oil had no effect on any variables measured. Supplementing C₁₈:₃ (linolenic acid) as a Ca salt of flax oil to the corn and soybean meal-based diet of dairy calves less than 3 mo old resulted in increased ADG and feed efficiency. 3adairy cattle 3adose response 3alinolenic acid 3ahay 3aliveweight gain 3abody conformation 3afeed conversion 3acalcium 3astarter diets 3ablood glucose 3anutrient requirements 3afeed intake 3afish oils 3acalves 3adosage 3alinseed oil 3aurea 3aalkaline phosphatase 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexbloodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDairying 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Essentialxmetabolism 2aFish Oilsxadministration & dosage 2aLinseed Oilxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aRandom Allocation 0afatty acids 0aessential fatty acids 0ablood chemistry1 aBateman, H.G.

Because the origin of the metabolites is unknown, the formation of volatile metabolites by five mastitis pathogens inoculated in milk of healthy cows was studied. The volatile metabolites from inoculated samples were compared to those of mastitis milk samples from which the inoculated pathogens were isolated. Most metabolites formed in the inoculated samples were similar to the metabolites formed in mastitis samples, both in presence and in amount. Prediction by a neural network showed that the similarity between the inoculated samples and mastitis samples was sufficient for correct prediction of the pathogen in the inoculated sample. The main difference between the inoculated samples and the mastitis samples was the absence of ethyl esters of free fatty acids in inoculated samples. This could be explained by disturbance of the milk-blood barrier, allowing the transfer of esterase from the cows' blood to the milk in cows with mastitis. 3adairy cows 3ainterspecific variation 3avolatile compounds 3adisease detection 3abiosynthesis 3aesterases 3abiomarkers 3afree fatty acids 3aneural networks 3astrain differences 3avalidity 3apathogen identification 3amilk 3aesters 3abovine mastitis 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBacterial Infectionsxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aMastitis, Bovinexdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aVolatile Organic Compounds 0aspecies differences 0aetiology 0aethyl esters 0abacterial infections 0ametabolites1 avan Valenberg, H.J.F.1 aLam, T.J.G.M.1 avan Hooijdonk, A.C.M.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 June 12, v. 137, no. 3-4 p.384-387dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.01.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090715b00000000c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03634naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130072002000150100001900170245005400189300001600243500002800259500001500287520204800302650001502350650001202365650002402377650001502401650002002416650001202436650002002448650001302468650001102481650001302492650001902505650002302524650001402547650001302561650002102574650003602595650002102631650001102652650001902663650001802682650001702700650002002717650001902737653004402756700002002800700001902820700001502839700001902854700001902873773011802892852000903010946001303019655001203032IND4415420620221121134459.0090123s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441542062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A group of 8 nonpregnant dairy heifers were given an oral dose of oligofructose (17 g/kg of body weight). At predefined times during a period spanning 3 d before and 9 d after oligofructose overload, the heifers underwent a clinical examination including locomotion scoring, hoof-testing, and palpation of tarso-crural joints, as well as the collection of blood and ruminal fluid samples. Locomotion sessions were videotaped; subsequently, locomotion was blind-scored. Locomotion scores increased after oligofructose overload and declined toward the end of the study period. The greatest locomotion scores were recorded on d 3 to 5 (60 to 120 h) where 12 of 42 (29%) locomotion scores were 3 and 13 of 42 (32%) were score 2. Positive reactions to hoof-testing were observed from 30 h after oligofructose overload and reached a maximum on d 7 and 9 where 12 of 28 (43%) reactions were marked positive. Distension of the tarso-crural joints was observed from 24 h after oligofructose overload, with maximum distension being observed on d 2, in which 44 of 56 (79%) of observed joints were either moderately or severely distended. The heifers developed classic signs of acute ruminal and systemic acidosis after the oligofructose overload (ruminal pH 4.3 ± 0.07, standard base excess -10.8 ± 2.3 at 18 h). With few exceptions, clinical and laboratory variables returned to normal within 9 d of oligofructose overload. But, good body condition and previous feeding with grass apparently predisposed the heifers to more severe systemic affection. Oligofructose overload in dairy heifers induced ruminal and systemic acidosis, diarrhea, dehydration, and, subsequently, lameness, claw pain, and joint effusion, collectively interpreted as signs of acute laminitis. Oligofructose overload at 17 g/kg of body weight represented a relatively mild laminitis model in cattle, as demonstrated by a reasonably quick recovery from systemic as well as orthopedic signs. 3alocomotion 3agrazing 3aoral administration 3adairy cows 3acattle diseases 3aheifers 3ablood chemistry 3adiarrhea 3ahooves 3afructose 3abody condition 3atemporal variation 3alaminitis 3alameness 3aoligosaccharides 3adehydration (animal physiology) 3aruminal acidosis 3adosage 3ajoint diseases 3aanimal models 3arumen fluids 3ajoints (animal) 3adisease course 0asigns and symptoms (animals and humans)1 aEnemark, J.M.D.1 aTelezhenko, E.1 aCapion, N.1 aEkstrøm, C.T.1 aThoefner, M.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.607-616dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02973naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001500198245012300213300001600336500001500352520109700367650001401464650002101478650003001499650002701529650002601556650002301582650002101605650001801626650001801644650001101662650001801673650001001691650000901701650001201710650001201722650003801734650003501772650004901807650001301856650004501869650005801914650003901972653001502011653001102026653002702037700001602064700001602080700001502096773007302111852000902184856008502193930003302278945002502311946001102336655001202347IND4375565320221121134529.0051027e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556532DNAL7 a162365712pmid7 a10.1080/030794505002684762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This is especially true for sites such as the lung, and the present paper describes a simple method for obtaining samples from this organ in chickens. Following sacrifice, the bird was placed on its back and the trachea was cut and exteriorized. Narrow-diameter tubing, to which a 30 ml syringe was attached, was threaded down the trachea to the bronchi and air was evacuated from the lung. Warm buffer was administered and the lung sample then aspirated, processed and frozen. In the current experiment this sampling system was tested on hens that were challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis. Elevated anti-Salmonella Enteritidis antibody levels in lung from infected hens were observed in significantly more infected hens than non-infected control hens in two trials.

To fill this gap, we collected data on DMS and total dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSPt) by participating in a dozen cruises. Here, we discuss the variability in DMS and DMSPt in the north and central Indian Ocean in terms of their spatial and temporal variation. DMS and DMSPt exhibited significant spatial and temporal variability. Apart from the concentration gradients in DMS within the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Central Indian Ocean basins, differences in average abundances were conspicuous between these basins. The Arabian Sea contained more DMS (mixed layer average was 7.8 nM) followed by the Bay of Bengal (2.8 nM) and the Central Indian Ocean (2.7 nM). The highest concentrations of DMS and DMSPt (525 nM and 916 nM, respectively) were found in upwelling regimes along the west coast of India during the Southwest monsoon and fall intermonsoon seasons. Average surface DMS was the highest in the Arabian Sea. On the other hand observed sea-to-air fluxes of DMS were higher in the Bay of Bengal due to the prevalence of turbulent conditions. In the Arabian Sea wind speeds were low and hence the sea-to-air fluxes. The total diffusive flux of DMS from the study area to atmosphere is estimated to be about 1.02 x 10¹² g S y-¹, which contributes to 4.1-6.3% of the global DMS emission. 3abasins 3abiogeochemistry 3acoasts 3adimethyl sulfide 3adimethylsulfoniopropionate 3agas production (biological) 3amonsoon season 3atemporal variation 3awind speed 3aArabian Sea 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean 0aDMS 0aDMSPt 0aFluxes 0aMonsoon1 aDileep Kumar, M.,0 tBiogeochemistry.g2007 Mar., v. 83, no. 1-3 p.277-292dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9092-43Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02275naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245017300147300001600320300002100336520120200357650002501559650001201584650001001596650002201606650001801628650001701646650002201663653001501685653001501700700001801715700002101733700001801754773007401772852000901846939003301855946001301888655001201901IND8906702120221121070622.0890622e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890670212DNAL7 a166667942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoornneef, M.10aIn vivo inhibition of seed development and reserve protein accumulation in recombinants of abscisic acid biosynthesis and responsiveness mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 463-469.  ap. 463-469. ill.  aIn Arabidopsis thaliana, seed development in recombinants of the ABA-deficient aba mutant with the ABA response mutants abi1 or abi3 is compared to wild type and the monogenic parents. Aberrant seed development occurred in the aba, abi3 recombinant and was normal in aba, abi1, abi3 and aba, abi1 seeds. Embryos of the recombinant aba, abi3 seeds maintained the green color until maturity, the seeds kept a high water content, did not form the late abundant 2S and 12S storage proteins, were desiccation intolerant, and often showed viviparous germination. Application of ABA, and particularly of an ABA analog, to the roots of plants during seed development partially alleviated the aberrant phenotype. Seeds of aba, abi3 were normal when they developed on a mother plant heterozygous for Aba. In contrast to seed development, the induction of dormancy was blocked in all monogenic mutants and recombinants. Dormancy was only induced by embryonic ABA; it could not be increased by maternal ABA or ABA applied to the mother plant. It is concluded that endogenous ABA has at least two different effects in developing seeds. The nature of these responses and of the ABA response system is discussed. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3aseeds 3aplant development 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aprotein synthesis 0aregulation 0ainhibition1 aHanhart, C.J.1 aHilhorst, H.W.M.1 aKarssen, C.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 June, v. 90, no. 2 p.463-469x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04084naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001900198245013700217300001600354520204600370650001302416650001602429650002402445650002102469650002302490650002802513650001502541650001802556650001602574650002102590650002202611650002002633650001702653650001602670650002802686650001802714650002002732650002102752650001202773650001302785650009302798650008202891650000902973650009702982650007503079650002303154653002303177653003403200773007303234852000903307856008503316930003303401945002503434946001103459655001203470IND4372442820221121045354.0050719e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437244282DNAL7 a161916992pmid7 a10.1080/030794505001121952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWilliams, R.B.10aIntercurrent coccidiosis and necrotic enteritis of chickens: rational, integrated disease management by maintenance of gut integrity  ap. 159-180.  aCoccidiosis and necrotic enteritis (NE) are globally common, sometimes intercurrent, diseases of poultry. The risk of NE, due to the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium perfringens, has increased in recent years because of the voluntary or legally required withdrawal of the use of certain in-feed antibiotic growth promoters with anticlostridial activity. In-feed ionophorous anticoccidial drugs incidentally also possess anticlostridial activity. Such ionophores, although not banned, are usually precluded when live anticoccidial vaccines are used, potentially increasing yet further the risk of NE. This review provides information for the design of rational, integrated management strategies for the prevention and control of coccidiosis and NE in chickens by maintaining gut integrity. Because of differences in local availability of feed ingredients and national legislations regarding antibiotic growth promoters and anticoccidial vaccine licensing, no universal strategy is applicable. The diseases and their interactions are described under the headings of forms of disease, diagnosis, sources of infection, pathophysiological effects, predisposing factors, and control methods. Elements of gut integrity, which influences host predisposition and clinical responses to disease, include physical development, immune competence, gut enzyme activity, mucin production, gut flora and epithelial damage. Experimental studies of coccidiosis and NE are compared, and where possible reconciled, with field observations. Gaps in knowledge and necessary further experiments are identified. Insights are provided regarding interactions between coccidiosis, NE, and the use of live anticoccidial vaccines. Recent changes in NE prevalence in commercial flocks, and their possible causes, are discussed. The necessarily wide range of topics reviewed emphasizes the enormous complexity of this disease combination, and indicates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in order to reduce its harmful impact on the world's poultry industry. 3achickens 3acoccidiosis 3abacterial enteritis 3apoultry diseases 3adisease prevention 3aClostridium perfringens 3aionophores 3acoccidiostats 3aantibiotics 3agrowth promotion 3adisease diagnosis 3apathophysiology 3arisk factors 3avaccination 3agastrointestinal system 3alive vaccines 3amixed infection 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aClostridium Infectionsxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aCoccidiosisxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aDiet 2aEnterocolitis, Necrotizingxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aProtozoan Vaccines 0aliterature reviews 0aintegrated disease management0 tAvian pathology.g2005 June, v. 34, no. 3 p.159-180x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794505001121953Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/13  aNon-US 7aarticle04639naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163072001700180072001700197072001700214100001600231245014200247300001400389500002400403500001500427520269400442650002303136650001203159650001803171650002403189650002003213650001603233650001503249650001503264650001303279650001603292650002103308650001903329650002103348650001703369650002203386650001303408650000903421650001403430650001503444650001503459650001803474650001503492651001303507653001003520700002603530700001603556700001603572700001603588700001703604773011903621852000903740856008603749856004903835930003303884945002503917946001103942655001203953IND4420818020190504000000.0090522e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442081802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2009.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZingore, S.13aAn integrated evaluation of strategies for enhancing productivity and profitability of resource-constrained smallholder farms in Zimbabwe  ap. 57-68.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn African smallholder agriculture, improved farm-scale understanding of the interaction between the household, crops, soils and livestock is required to develop appropriate strategies for improving productivity. A combination of models was used to analyse land use and labour allocation strategies for optimizing income for wealthy (2.5ha with eight cattle) and poor (0.9ha without cattle) farms in Murewa, Zimbabwe. Trade-offs between profitability, labour use and partial nutrient balances were also evaluated for alternative resource management strategies. Farm data were captured using the Integrated Modelling Platform for Mixed Animal-Crop Systems (IMPACT), which was directly linked to the Household Resource use Optimization Model (HROM). HROM was applied to optimize net cash income within the constraints specific to the households. Effects of alternative nutrient resource management strategies in crop and milk production were simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and RUMINANT models, respectively, and the output evaluated using HROM. The poor farm had a net income of US$ 1yr⁻¹ and the farmer relied on selling unskilled labour to supplement her income. The poor farm's income was marginally increased by US$18yr⁻¹ and the soil nitrogen (N) balance was increased from 6 to 9kgha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ by expanding groundnut production from the previous 5-25% of the land area. Further increases in area allocated to groundnut production were constrained by lack of labour. On the poor farm, maize production was most profitable when cultivated on a reduced land area with optimal weeding. The wealthy farm had a maize-dominated cropping system that yielded a net cash balance of US$290yr⁻¹, mainly from the sale of crop produce. Net income could be increased to US$1175yr⁻¹, by re-allocating the 240 hired labour-days more efficiently, although this reallocation substantially reduced partial soil N and phosphorus (P) balances by 74kgNha⁻¹ and 11kgPha⁻¹, respectively, resulting in negative nutrient balances. Few opportunities existed to increase productivity and income of the smallholder farms without inducing negative nutrient balances. On the wealthy farm, groundnut was the least profitable crop; shifting its production to the most fertile field did not improve income unless the groundnut residues were fed to lactating cows. The analysis carried out in this paper highlights the need to develop practical technological recommendations and development interventions that consider farm resource endowment (land, fertilizers, manure and labour), variability in soil fertility within farms and competing resource use options. 3aagricultural soils 3apeanuts 3aprofitability 3asmall-scale farming 3afarm management 3afield crops 3acrop yield 3aphosphorus 3aland use 3afarm income 3anutrient balance 3asoil fertility 3aArachis hypogaea 3acase studies 3asimulation models 3aZea mays 3acorn 3alivestock 3amilk yield 3ahouseholds 3afarm families 3afarm labor 3aZimbabwe 0acrops1 aGonzález-Estrada, E.1 aDelve, R.J.1 aHerrero, M.1 aDimes, J.P.1 aGiller, K.E.0 tAgricultural systems.g2009 June, v. 101, no. 1-2 p.57-68dElsevier Science Ltd.wJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2009.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2009.03.003  a20090824b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03272naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178100001700187245015200204300001600356500002400372500001500396520131400411650001801725650001501743650001301758650002301771650002501794650002101819650002001840650001901860650001301879650001701892650001601909650001501925650001601940650002001956650001501976650001701991650003502008650004002043650003902083650002902122650002202151650002302173650001302196650001502209650001602224653001702240653001102257700002302268700001302291700001502304773011802319852000902437856008102446930003302527945002502560946001302585655001202598IND4415419020221120202035.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441541902DNAL7 a191646552pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2008-12782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ501 0aT3001 aSpence, A.J.14aThe influence of temperature and pressure factors in supercritical fluid extraction for optimizing nonpolar lipid extraction from buttermilk powder  ap. 458-468.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe milk fat globule membrane, readily available in buttermilk, contains complex lipids claimed to be beneficial to humans. Phospholipids, including sphingolipids, exhibit antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and antiatherogenic properties and have essential roles in numerous cell functions. Microfiltration coupled with supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) may provide a method for removing triacylglycerols while concentrating these nutritionally valuable lipids into a novel ingredient. Therefore, SFE as a method for phospholipid concentration needs to be optimized for triacylglycerol removal in buttermilk. The SFE conditions were assessed using a general full factorial design; the experimental factors were pressure (15, 25, and 35 MPa) and temperature (40, 50, and 60°C). Particularly interesting is that only triacylglycerols were removed from buttermilk powder. Little to no protein loss or aggregation was observed compared with the untreated buttermilk powder. Calculated theoretical values showed a linear increase for lipid solubility as pressure, temperature, or both were increased; however, experimental values showed nonlinearity, as an effect of temperature. In addition, the particular SFE parameters of 35 MPa and 50°C displayed enhanced extraction efficiency (70% total lipid reduction). 3aphospholipids 3adried milk 3apressure 3aprotein aggregates 3amedicinal properties 3atriacylglycerols 3amicrofiltration 3acell membranes 3amilk fat 3afat globules 3aingredients 3asolubility 3atemperature 3aprotein content 3abuttermilk 3ahealth foods 3asupercritical fluid extraction 2aChromatography, Supercritical Fluid 2aCultured Milk Productsxchemistry. 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aLipidsxchemistry 2aPowdersxchemistry 2aPressure 2aSolubility 2aTemperature 0aoptimization 0alipids1 aJimenez-Flores, R.1 aQian, M.1 aGoddik, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.458-468dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-12783Available from publisher's Web site  a20091209b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle04204naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001600119245012300135300001600258500002400274520274900298650001703047650002503064650002003089650001103109650001303120650001903133650002003152650001503172650002803187650003503215650001403250650001003264650001203274650002003286650001303306650001703319650002103336650002403357653002303381653002703404700001703431700002203448700001803470773011803488852000903606930003303615945002503648946001303673655001203686IND4415418820221120192040.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441541882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2001 aHayes, B.J.10aInvited review: Genomic selection in dairy cattle: Progress and challenges [Erratum: 2009 Mar., v. 92, no. 3, p. 1313]  ap. 433-443.  aIncludes references  aA new technology called genomic selection is revolutionizing dairy cattle breeding. Genomic selection refers to selection decisions based on genomic breeding values (GEBV). The GEBV are calculated as the sum of the effects of dense genetic markers, or haplotypes of these markers, across the entire genome, thereby potentially capturing all the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to variation in a trait. The QTL effects, inferred from either haplotypes or individual single nucleotide polymorphism markers, are first estimated in a large reference population with phenotypic information. In subsequent generations, only marker information is required to calculate GEBV. The reliability of GEBV predicted in this way has already been evaluated in experiments in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and the Netherlands. These experiments used reference populations of between 650 and 4,500 progeny-tested Holstein-Friesian bulls, genotyped for approximately 50,000 genome-wide markers. Reliabilities of GEBV for young bulls without progeny test results in the reference population were between 20 and 67%. The reliability achieved depended on the heritability of the trait evaluated, the number of bulls in the reference population, the statistical method used to estimate the single nucleotide polymorphism effects in the reference population, and the method used to calculate the reliability. A common finding in 3 countries (United States, New Zealand, and Australia) was that a straightforward BLUP method for estimating the marker effects gave reliabilities of GEBV almost as high as more complex methods. The BLUP method is attractive because the only prior information required is the additive genetic variance of the trait. All countries included a polygenic effect (parent average breeding value) in their GEBV calculation. This inclusion is recommended to capture any genetic variance not associated with the markers, and to put some selection pressure on low-frequency QTL that may not be captured by the markers. The reliabilities of GEBV achieved were significantly greater than the reliability of parental average breeding values, the current criteria for selection of bull calves to enter progeny test teams. The increase in reliability is sufficiently high that at least 2 dairy breeding companies are already marketing bull teams for commercial use based on their GEBV only, at 2 yr of age. This strategy should at least double the rate of genetic gain in the dairy industry. Many challenges with genomic selection and its implementation remain, including increasing the accuracy of GEBV, integrating genomic information into national and international genetic evaluations, and managing long-term genetic gain. 3adairy cattle 3aartificial selection 3aanimal breeding 3agenome 3agenomics 3abreeding value 3agenetic markers 3ahaplotypes 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aphenotype 3abulls 3aprogeny 3aprogeny testing 3aaccuracy 3aheritability 3agenetic variance 3agenetic improvement 0aliterature reviews 0agenomic breeding value1 aBowman, P.J.1 aChamberlain, A.J.1 aGoddard, M.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.433-443dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle02537naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110100002000130245015100150300001600301500002800317500001500345520094600360650004501306650001301351650003001364650001701394650002001411650001001431650001301441650002201454650002001476650001401496653007101510653002101581653001601602653001601618653003701634653002101671653002501692700001601717700001801733700002201751700001901773700001801792700001801810700001801828700002101846773011801867852000901985946001301994655001202007IND4415422520221120171132.0090123s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441542252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The DGAT1 gene was recently identified as underlying variation in milk production traits. To date, PCR techniques such as PCR-RFLP have been used for detecting the DGAT1 K232A polymorphism, despite being expensive and laborious. The method proposed here, a tetra-primer ARMS-PCR, showed 100% sensitivity and specificity when compared with PCR-RFLP results obtained in a sample of 80 animals tested in a double-blind system. Our results suggest that the use of tetra-primer ARMS-PCR for DGAT1 K232A polymorphism genotyping could greatly reduce costs providing information for both research purposes and for dairy cattle breeders who perform DGAT1 genotyping for gene-assisted selection. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aaccuracy 3apolymerase chain reaction 3adairy cattle 3amilk production 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aanimal breeding 3adetection 0aamplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction 0atest specificity 0amethodology 0anew methods 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0atest sensitivity 0agenetic polymorphism1 aPereira, L.1 aLacorte, G.A.1 aPeixoto, M.G.C.D.1 aVerneque, R.S.1 aTeodoro, R.L.1 aMachado, M.A.1 aFonseca, C.G.1 aCarvalho, M.R.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.773-776dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle01492naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005300128300001600181500005700197520060400254650001300858650000900871650001500880650001000895650001800905650001300923650001800936650001000954650001400964651001200978773017900990852000901169655001201178IND6098882720221120151320.0141110s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND609888272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShuler, K.

Previously, we have shown in etiolated oat seedlings that ubiquitin-phytochrome conjugates (Ub-P) appear after Pfr formation suggesting that oat phytochrome is rapidly degraded by a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. Here, we extend this observation to etiolated tissue from other monocotyledonous (corn [Zea mays. L] and rye [Secale cereale (L.)] and dicotyledonous species (pea [Pisum sativum (L,)] and zucchini squash [Cucurbita pepo (L.)]). Following Pfr formation by red light, all four species synthesized a heterogeneous series of Ub-P that appeared and disappeared concomitant with the degradation of the chromoprotein. When Pfr was photoconverted back to Pr by a far-red light pulse, degradation of phytochrome ceased and the levels of Ub-P concomitantly dropped. In pea and zucchini squash, loss of Ub-P after photoconversion of Pfr back to Pr was rapid, occurring with a half-life of approximately 5 to 10 minutes. These data indicate that the accumulation of Ub-P after Pfr formation is a general phenomenon in etiolated seedlings of higher plants and further support the hypothesis that plants degrade Pfr via Ub-P intermediates. 3aZea mays 3aSecale cereale 3aPisum sativum 3aCucurbita pepo 3ametabolism 3aphytochrome 3ared light 3aprotein degradation1 aShanklin, J.1 aVierstra, R.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 June, v. 90, no. 2 p.380-384x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03622naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002600185245007200211300001600283500002400299500001500323520150500338650002301843650001001866650002101876650004101897650002101938650003101959650001101990650002302001650002002024650002202044650002902066650001902095650001802114650002902132650002102161650001202182650002202194650005202216650006402268650004202332650001102374651001202385651001202397653002402409653001802433653001402451653002402465653001102489653001602500700001802516700002902534700002902563700002302592700003402615773009702649852000902746856008802755930003302843945002502876946001102901655001202912IND4420824120221120141519.0090522e20090612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442082412DNAL7 a192172222pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aSvansson, Vilhjálmur10aImmune response against equine gammaherpesvirus in Icelandic horses  ap. 363-368.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHorses are hosts to two types of gammaherpesviruses, equine herpes virus (EHV) 2 and 5. While EHV-2 is ubiquitous in adult horses, EHV-5 has been less frequently described. Due to strong serological cross-reactivity, EHV-2 and -5 cannot be discriminated in broad spectrum antibody tests and are thus commonly referred to as γ-EHV. Total IgG and IgG subclass response against γ-EHV were determined in serum from 41 healthy Icelandic horses, thereof 20 adults, 10 foals aged 10 months, and 11 foals aged 1-4 months. Additionally, in 10 of the adult horses, interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 expression were measured by real-time PCR in white blood cells upon in vitro stimulation with EHV-2. With the exception of one orphan foal, all tested individuals were seropositive for γ-EHV. All but one adult had high titer of EHV-specific IgG4/7 (IgGb) in combination with much lower titer of IgG1 (IgGa) and IgG3/5 (IgG(T)), indicating a stabilized response. IgG titer and subclasses in the foals showed considerably more variation, possibly dependant on maternal antibodies and/or recent infection. In all the 10 horses tested for cytokine expression, IFN-γ production exceeds production of IL-4. These results indicate that equine gammaherpesvirus infection is characterized by an induction of IgG1, IgG4/7 and IgG3/5 with prevailing IgG4/7 and cytokine profile dominated by IFN-γ. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the cytokine and IgG subclass response against γ-EHV in horses. 3atemporal variation 3afoals 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3ainterferon-gamma 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aadults 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3amaternal immunity 3aEquid gammaherpesvirus 5 3ahorse diseases 3ainterleukin-4 3aEquid gammaherpesvirus 2 2aAge Distribution 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viral 2aGammaherpesvirinaexclassificationximmunology. 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aHorse Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aHorses 3aIceland 0aIceland 0aEquid herpesvirus 2 0aadult animals 0acytokines 0aEquid herpesvirus 5 0ahorses 0ainterferons1 aRoelse, Mieke1 aÓlafsdóttir, Gudbjörg1 aThorsteinsdóttir, Lilja1 aTorfason, Einar G.1 aTorsteinsdóttir, Sigurbjörg0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 June 12, v. 137, no. 3-4 p.363-368dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.01.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20090715b00000000c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02965naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001800181245013100199300001800330506007600348520128500424506003701709650002201746650001901768650001401787650001401801650001001815650004901825650002201874650002201896653005401918653001801972653003401990700001402024700001802038700001602056700001502072700001802087700001402105700002002119700001602139773014202155852000902297856008202306930003302388945001302421946001302434655001202447IND2052012920221207133917.0960708e19960416dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205201292DNAL7 a116076492pmid7 aPMC396082pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.93.8.33352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoelofs, T.A.10aOxidation states of the manganese cluster during the flash-induced S-state cycle of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex  ap. 3335-3340.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Mn K-edge x-ray absorption spectra for the pure S states of the tetranuclear Mn cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II during flash-induced S-state cycling have been determined. The relative S-state populations in samples given 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 flashes were determined from fitting the flash-induced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) multiline signal oscillation pattern to the Kok model. The edge spectra of samples given 0, 1, 2, or 3 flashes were combined with EPR information to calculate the pure S-state edge spectra. The edge positions (defined as the zero-crossing of the second derivatives) are 6550.1, 6551.7, 6553.5, and 6553.8 eV for S0, S1, S2, and S3, respectively. In addition to the shift in edge position, the S0 leads to S1 and S1 leads to S2 transitions are accompanied by characteristic changes in the shape of the edge, both indicative of Mn oxidation. The edge position shifts very little (0.3 eV) for the S2 leads to S3 transition, and the edge shape shows only subtle changes. We conclude that probably no direct Mn oxidation is involved in this transition. The proposed Mn oxidation state assignments are as follows: S0 (II, III, IV, IV) or (III,III,III, IV), S1 (III, III, IV, IV), S2 (III, IV, IV, IV), S3 (III, IV, IV, IV).0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aphotosystem II 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3alight 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aspectral analysis 0ax ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy 0alight flashes 0ax ray absorption spectroscopy1 aLiang, W.1 aLatimer, M.J.1 aCinco, R.M.1 aRompel, A.1 aAndrews, J.C.1 aSauer, K.1 aYachandra, V.K.1 aKlein, M.P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1996 Apr. 16, v. 93, no. 8 p.3335-3340x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.8.33353Available from publisher's Web site  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02865naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245006000185300001600245520135600261650001101617650002201628650001501650650001001665650001701675650001001692650002101702650002001723650002501743650002601768650005001794650001101844650001101855650001101866650000901877650001601886650003001902650001601932651001101948651002601959653003501985700001902020700001802039773014502057852000902202856009202211930003302303946001102336655001202347IND4416238220221120115755.0090213e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441623822DNAL7 a191710132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02203.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuz, P.M.10aDisability adjusted life years lost to dengue in Brazil  ap. 237-246.  aTo assess the dengue burden in Brazil, and to compare it over three spatial scales: in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the state of Rio de Janeiro, and in Brazil overall. We calculated disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to dengue per million individuals annually from 1986 through 2006. To calculate DALYs, we compiled data on the number of dengue cases by age, clinical syndrome and outcome. We evaluated the sensitivity of our results to multiplication factors used to adjust for inaccuracies in reporting using a Monte Carlo method. From 1986 through 2006, a mean of 56, 47 and 22 DALYs per million individuals annually were lost to dengue in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in the state of Rio de Janeiro and in Brazil, respectively. Over 80% of the dengue burden derived from dengue fever cases. The dengue burden was highest at the city-level with a maximum single-year estimate of 560 DALYs per million individuals for 2002. Assessment of dengue burden requires consideration of all clinical syndromes over multiple years. Our results indicate that the dengue burden is as high as the burden of other major infectious diseases that afflict the Brazilian population, including malaria. These results may prompt policy makers to elevate the prioritization of dengue control, and allocate resources needed to curtail the increasing dengue burden. 3adengue 3aburden of disease 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge of Onset 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCost of Illness 2aDenguexepidemiology 2aDisability Evaluation 2aDisabled Personsxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aYoung Adult 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology. 0adisability adjusted life years1 aGrinsztejn, B.1 aGalvani, A.P.0 tTropical medicine & international health TM & IH.g2009 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.237-246dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1360-22767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02203.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090213b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02193naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002400186245005900210300001600269520111900285650002001404650001701424650001101441653002301452653002001475653001401495653002501509653001701534653001901551773012301570852000901693856008501702930003301787946001101820655001201831IND4412923320221120115831.0081121e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441292332DNAL7 a196694762pmid7 aPMC25856382pmcid7 a10.1007/s10867-008-9097-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSannita, Walter G. 10aNeuronal Functional Diversity and Collective Behaviors  ap. 267-278.  aA major question in today's neuroscience is how the brain's complex operations and organization emerge from individual components. The robustness of neuronal properties with flexible linkages between regulatory processes conceivably accounts for the adaptive, tunable, multistable dynamics; the coding schemes; and the complexity of neuronal functional (sub)systems. Interneurons and neurotransmitter diversity, resonance phenomena due to properties of the cell, time/frequency-dependent activation of dedicated neuronal assemblies, and code- and frequency-specific oscillations interact in determining the brain functional setup and operations. Such an arrangement would also provide the functional requirements for access to neural mechanisms, dedicated neuronal circuitry and the proper timing allowing for the selective differentiation among cortical neurons due to performing in different tasks. No comprehensive theory or systematic methodological approach appears yet conceivable. The scenario, however incomplete and incompletely characterized, is nevertheless promising and warrants further investigation. 3aneural networks 3ainterneurons 3asounds 0aNeuronal diversity 0aSynchronization 0aResonance 0aStochastic resonance 0aOscillations 0aGamma activity0 tJournal of biological physics.g2008 Aug., v. 34, no. 3-4 p.267-278dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0092-06067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10867-008-9097-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03506naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001400181245011000195300001800305500001500323506007600338520181900414506003702233650001802270650001502288650001302303650003102316650002202347650002702369650002202396650001402418650002102432650001902453650002502472650001102497653001502508653001902523653002302542653003402565653002702599653001102626653001702637700001802654773014202672852000902814856008202823930003302905945001302938946001302951655001202964IND2052012420221207133740.0960708e19960416dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205201242DNAL7 a116076482pmid7 aPMC396052pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.93.8.33192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoyal, A.10aAssociation of glycolate oxidation with photosynthetic electron transport in plant and algal chloroplasts  ap. 3319-3324.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhotosynthetic carbon metabolism is initiated by ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which uses both CO2 and O2 as substrates. One 2-phosphoglycolate (P-glycolate) molecule is produced for each O2 molecule fixed. P-glycolate has been considered to be metabolized exclusively via the oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle. This paper reports an additional pathway for P-glycolate and glycolate metabolism in the chloroplasts. Light-dependent glycolate or P-glycolate oxidation by osmotically shocked chloroplasts from the algae Dunaliella or spinach leaves was measured by three electron acceptors, methyl viologen (MV), potassium ferricyanide, or dichloroindophenol. Glycolate oxidation was assayed with 3-(3,4)-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) as oxygen uptake in the presence of MV at a rate of 9 micromolar per mg of chlorophyll per h. Washed thylakoids from spinach leaves oxidized glycolate at a rate of 22 micromolar per mg of chlorophyll per h. This light-dependent oxidation was inhibited completely by SHAM, an inhibitor of quinone oxidoreductase, and 75% by 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB), which inhibits electron transfer from plastoquinone to the cytochrome b6f complex. SHAM stimulated severalfold glycolate excretion by algal cells, Dunaliella or Chlamydomonas, and by isolated Dunaliella chloroplasts. Glycolate and P-glycolate were oxidized about equally well to glyoxylate and phosphate. On the basis of results of inhibitor action, the possible site which accepts electrons from glycolate or P-glycolate is a quinone after the DCMU site but before the DBMIB site. This glycolate oxidation is a light-dependent. SHAM-sensitive, glycolate-quinone oxidoreductase system that is associated with photosynthetic electron transport in the chloroplasts.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aglycolic acid 3athylakoids 3aquinones 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aDunaliella tertiolecta 3aelectron transfer 3aoxidation 3ahydroxamic acids 3aphotosynthesis 3ametabolic inhibitors 3aoxygen 0asecretions 0aorganic anions 0a2-phosphoglycolate 0aelectron transport inhibitors 0asalicylhydroxamic acid 0auptake 0achloroplasts1 aTolbert, N.E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1996 Apr. 16, v. 93, no. 8 p.3319-3324x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.8.33193Available from publisher's Web site  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03785naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003200171245011300203300001600316500002400332520180900356650001302165650002502178650001202203650001302215650001602228650002002244650004202264650003602306650001302342650002302355650001102378650002302389650004202412650002102454650001502475650002202490650002802512650001702540650002002557650002502577650001302602650002902615650002802644650002202672650002602694650002302720650002102743650003202764650003902796650004002835651001002875700003202885700002702917700003302944773010602977852000903083856005503092655001203147IND4438330120221120115912.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443833012DNAL7 a202108722pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2010.01368.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez Domínguez, David10aCadmium-induced oxidative stress and the response of the antioxidative defense system in Spartina densiflora  ap. 289-302.  aIncludes references  aSpartina densiflora is an invasive cordgrass that is colonizing new habitats and ousting indigenous species in pro-oxidative environments like cadmium-polluted salt marshes in the Odiel estuary (Spain). The aim of our study was to characterize its antioxidative system in order to find out if the system underlies the tolerance of S. densiflora to cadmium toxicity. S. densiflora plants were firstly evaluated to ascertain its antioxidative status in the natural habitat and then they were cultured in the laboratory in unpolluted sand for 28 days. Throughout this period, plants acclimatized and oxidative stress markers reached stable low levels. Then, S. densiflora plants were exposed to cadmium concentrations (10, 100 and 1000 μM Cd) for another 28 days. Higher Cd content in leaves was related to higher level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing important oxidative cell damage (lipid peroxidation and lower chlorophyll content). However, S. densiflora possesses a well-organized and appropriately modulated antioxidative defense system which comprises enzymatic activities of guaiacol peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.11) and superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) coupled with the activation of the ascorbate cycle, including enzymatic activities of glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2), dehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.8.5.1) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.6.5.4). This activation was sufficient to reduce Cd-induced ROS accumulation and oxidative damage caused by the lowest Cd-concentrations, but not by the highest Cd-concentration (1000 μM). Nevertheless, the antioxidant system seems to be efficient to achieve a tolerance to cadmium toxicity, allowing normal plant development, even at the presence of highest Cd concentration. 3aSpartina 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acadmium 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amonodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH) 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aplant development 3areactive oxygen species 3asalt marshes 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aAscorbic Acidxanalysis 2aCadmiumxtoxicity 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aOxidative Stress 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aPoaceaexdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0aSpain1 aCórdoba García, Francisco1 aCanalejo Raya, Antonio1 aTorronteras Santiago, Rafael0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2010 July, v. 139, no. 3 p.289-302dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2010.01368.x 7aarticle02897naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002800135245017400163300001600337520160000353650002801953650002301981650003002004650001002034650001202044650002802056650001002084650001602094650001702110650001902127651001002146653002302156653002302179700002002202700001902222773011802241852000902359856007502368930003302443946001102476655001202487IND4411470220221120105726.0081014s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441147022DNAL7 a10.1071/IS070522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTixier, Marie-Stéphane10aMorphological variation in the biological control agent Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Acari : Phytoseiidae): consequences for diagnostic reliability and synonymies  ap. 453-469.  aThe extent intraspecific variation among 42 morphological characters within Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Acari:Phytoseiidae) is examined. Neoseiulus californicus is an important biological control agent used commercially worldwide to control pest mites in many crops. The correct diagnosis of this species is thus of prime importance for successful biological control and agricultural development. Incorrect interpretation of intraspecific variation could lead to misidentification and potentially to the description of new species that may be invalid. Three hundred female N. californicus representing ten populations collected from all over the world were measured and compared with the types of two morphologically close species: Neoseiulus marinus (Willmann) and Neoseiulus ornatus (Athias-Henriot). Significant differences between the populations were observed for almost all of the characters considered. However, these differences were small and low within-population standard errors in measurement data were observed. The mites collected in Chile were very different from the specimens of the other populations of N. californicus considered. The level of intraspecific morphological variation found within N. californicus indicates that caution must be applied to correctly determine species boundaries within this genus and morphological variation needs to be considered more in species' descriptions. Based on our morphological analysis we conclude that N. ornatus, N. marinus and N. californicus are valid species. Redescriptions of these three species are given in this paper. 3aNeoseiulus californicus 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acrops 3afemales 3aintraspecific variation 3amites 3anew species 3apest control 3aredescriptions 3aChile 0aNeoseiulus marinus 0aNeoseiulus ornatus1 aGuichou, Sabine1 aKreiter, Serge0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2008, v. 22, no. 4 p.453-469dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1445-52267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS070523Available from publisher's Web site  a20081014b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03218naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002400186245010300210300001600313520139700329650002401726650001601750650002501766650001201791650004201803650001901845650002501864650002501889650001901914650003801933650002201971650001301993650002502006650005002031650001102081650002702092650002002119650002102139650002602160650001602186650002902202650002302231653001402254653000802268653000802276700002402284700001802308700002002326700002202346773011002368852000902478856008502487930003302572946001102605655001202616IND4412924920221120105652.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441292492DNAL7 a187978622pmid7 aPMC26635172pmcid7 a10.1007/s00251-008-0331-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingle, Richard M. 10aMethods for assessing gene content diversity of KIR with examples from a global set of populations  ap. 711-725.  aA number of statistical methods are widely used to describe allelic variation at specific genetic loci and its implication on the evolutionary history of these loci. Although the methods were developed primarily to study allelic variation at loci that are virtually always present in the genome, they are often applied to data of gene content variation (i.e., presence/absence of multiple homologous genes) at the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) gene cluster. In this paper, we discuss methodological issues involved in the analysis of gene content variation data in the KIR region and also its covariation with polymorphism at the human leukocyte antigen class I loci, which encode ligands for KIR. A comparison of several statistical methods and measures (gene frequency, haplotype frequency, and linkage disequilibrium estimation) using the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain data will be provided using KIR haplotypes that have been determined by segregation analysis, noting the strengths and weaknesses of the methods when only the presence/absence data is considered. Finally, application of these methods to a set of globally distributed populations is described (see Single et al., Nat Genet 39:1114-1119, 2007) in order to illustrate the challenges faced when inferring the joint effects of natural selection and demographic history on these immune-related genes. 3apopulation genetics 3acoevolution 3astatistical analysis 2aAlleles 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 19xgenetics 2aCohort Studies 2aEthnicityxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class Ixgenetics 2aHumans 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aModels, Genetic 2aMultigene Family 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPseudogenes 2aReceptors, KIRxgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic 0aSelection 0aKIR 0aHLA1 aMartin, Maureen P. 1 aMeyer, Diogo 1 aGao, Xiaojiang 1 aCarrington, Mary 0 tImmunogenetics.g2008 Dec., v. 60, no. 12 p.711-725dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0093-77117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00251-008-0331-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02866naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001300167245012600180300001600306500002400322500001500346520117900361650001101540650001401551650002301565650001601588650001801604650002001622650001901642650001801661650001201679650001801691650001601709650002801725650002301753650002301776650001901799650001101818651001001829653003101839653001501870653001201885653001501897700001801912700001501930700001601945700001801961700001701979773010101996852000902097856008902106930003302195945002502228946001102253655001202264IND4420816620221120095206.0090522e20090804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442081662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2009.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aP0001 aLi, Jian10aReproductive characteristics of Opisthopappus taihangensis (Ling) Shih, an endangered Asteraceae species endemic to China  ap. 474-479.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOpisthopappus taihangensis is an endangered species endemic to China and represents an important genetic resource for chrysanthemum improvement. We describe here its basic reproductive characteristics. The anthers are tetrasporangiate and the anther wall is composed of an epidermis, endothecium, middle layer and tapetum. The middle layer is lost by the microspore tetrad stage, and the tapetum disintegrates at the trinucleate pollen stage. Meiosis in the microspore mother cells is of the simultaneous type, and the tetrad is tetrahedral in shape. Mature pollen grains have three germinal apertures, two sperm nuclei and one vegetative nucleus. The in vitro pollen germination rate is only ~10%. The ovule is anatropous, dual-integument, tenuinucellatae and the development of the embryo sac follows the Oenothera pattern. The archesporial cell below the nucellus epidermis functions as the megaspore mother cell and forms a linear tetrad. The embryo passes through a globular, heart and torpedo stage before maturing into a cotyledon embryo. The endangerment of O. taihangensis may be associated with low reproductive capacity, as a consequence of poor pollen viability. 3aovules 3aviability 3aendangered species 3awild plants 3aChrysanthemum 3amicrosporocytes 3aembryo (plant) 3aembryogenesis 3ameiosis 3amature plants 3amicrospores 3aplant genetic resources 3aindigenous species 3aplant reproduction 3awild relatives 3apollen 3aChina 0aOpisthopappus taihangensis 0aandroecium 0aanthers 0aAsteraceae1 aNianjun, Teng1 aFadi, Chen1 aSumei, Chen1 aChunqing, Sun1 aWeimin, Fang0 tScientia horticulturae.g2009 Aug. 4, v. 121, no. 4 p.474-479dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2009.02.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20090716b20090801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/06/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02546naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245013400161300001600295500002800311520148100339650001401820650002001834650001601854653002901870653002101899700001701920700001901937700002001956700002201976773010301998852000902101856008502110946001302195655001202208IND4413993920221120095325.0081219s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441399392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11095-008-9723-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Preeti10aChemopreventive Potential of Resveratrol in Mouse Skin Tumors Through Regulation of Mitochondrial and PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathways  ap. 211-217.  aPublisher supplied data  aPurpose To investigate the chemopreventive potential of resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in seeds and skin of grapes, berries and peanuts in 7,12 dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced mouse skin tumorigenesis. Methods Topical treatment of resveratrol was given to the animals 1 h prior to DMBA for 28 weeks. At the end of the study period, the skin tumors were dissected out and western blotting was carried out to examine the regulation of proteins involved in anti-tumorigenesis in response to resveratrol. Results Chemopreventive properties of resveratrol were reflected by delay in onset of tumorigenesis, reduced cumulative number of tumors, and reduction in tumor volume. Results of the western blotting showed that resveratrol treatment increased the DMBA suppressed p53 and Bax while decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin. Further, resveratrol supplementation resulted in release of cytochrome C, caspases activation, increase in apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) as mechanism of apoptosis induction. Resveratrol was also found to inhibit skin tumorigenesis through regulation of Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/ and AKT proteins which are implicated in cancer progression because it stimulates proliferation and suppresses apoptosis. Conclusions Based on the results we can conclude that resveratrol regulates apoptosis and cell survival in mouse skin tumors as mechanism of chemoprevention hence deserve to be a chemopreventive agent. 3aapoptosis 3achemoprevention 3aresveratrol 0amouse skin tumorigenesis 0aPI3K/AKT pathway1 aKalra, Neetu1 aPrasad, Sahdeo1 aGeorge, Jasmine1 aShukla, Yogeshwer0 tPharmaceutical research.g2009 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.211-217dBoston : Springer USx0724-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-008-9723-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02751naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001900181245012900200300001800329500001500347506007600362520131100438506003701749650002201786650001701808650002201825650001001847650001401857650001601871650001101887650002701898650002101925653001701946653003201963700001801995773014202013852000902155856008202164930003302246945001302279946001302292655001202305IND2052013120221207134623.0960708e19960416dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205201312DNAL7 a116076502pmid7 aPMC396142pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.93.8.33682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVafopoulou, X.14aThe insect neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone is released with a daily rhythm: re-evaluation of its role in development  ap. 3368-3372.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProthoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) is the central cerebral neurohormone in insect development. Its release has been believed for decades to be confined to one (or two) critical moments early in each developmental stage at which time it triggers prolonged activation of the prothoracic glands to synthesize and release the steroid molting hormones (ecdysteroids), which elicit developmental responses in target tissues. We used an in vitro assay for PTTH released from excised brains of the bug Rhodnius prolixus and report that release of PTTH does occur at the expected time on day 6, but that this release is merely the first in a daily rhythm of release that continues throughout most of the 21 days of larval-adult development. This finding, together with reports of circadian control of ecdysteroid synthesis and titer throughout this time, raises significant challenges to several features of the current understanding of the hormonal control of insect development. New questions are raised concerning the function(s) PTTH , its relationship with the prothoracic glands. and the significance of circadian rhythmicity throughout this endocrine axis. The significance of the reported observations derives from the set of entirely new questions they raise concerning the regulation of insect development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahormone secretion 3abiosynthesis 3aRhodnius prolixus 3abrain 3ahemolymph 3aecdysterone 3alarvae 3abiological development 3acircadian rhythm 0aecdysteroids 0aprothoracicotropic hormones1 aSteel, C.G.H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1996 Apr. 16, v. 93, no. 8 p.3368-3372x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.8.33683Available from publisher's Web site  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02815naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009200167300001600259520135500275650002501630650002401655650001601679650001101695650002201706650001201728650002201740650001001762650001301772650001001785650002001795650002101815650001301836650001801849650001801867653001301885653003001898653001501928700002301943700002301966700002501989700002802014700002002042773010902062852000902171856008502180930003302265946001102298655001202309IND4413744220221120084441.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441374422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-008-9717-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallett, Paul D. 10aDisentangling the impact of AM fungi versus roots on soil structure and water transport  ap. 183-196.  aThe relative importance of roots and AM-fungi on soil physical processes was investigated by controlling the presence of roots and AM fungi in pot experiments using a mycorrhiza-defective tomato mutant and a wild-type tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Root-Zone and Bulk Soil sections were established by splitting pots into two lengthwise halves using a nylon mesh that contained roots whilst allowing the free movement of fungal hyphae. Post-incubation microbial populations and fungal biomass were measured and related to soil stability, pore structure and water repellency. Unplanted controls consistently had the least fungal biomass, fatty acids, water-stable aggregates (WSA) and water repellency. Wild-type-planted treatments had significantly more WSA than mycorrhiza-defective treatments (P < 0.01). Fluctuations in water content induced by transpiration caused significant changes in soil pore structure, measured using high-resolution X-Ray computer tomography. Porosity and mean pore size increased in soil aggregates from planted treatments, which had larger more heterogeneous pores than those in the unplanted soils. AM fungi accentuated soil stability. However, changes were not linked to repellency and fungal biomass. The presence of plants, regardless of AM fungi, appears to have the greatest impact on increasing soil stability. 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acomputed tomography 3afatty acids 3ahyphae 3amicrobial biomass 3amutants 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anylon 3aporosity 3aroots 3asoil aggregates 3asoil pore system 3atomatoes 3atranspiration 3awater content 0aAM Fungi 0aX-ray computed tomography 0aSoil biota1 aFeeney, Debbie S. 1 aBengough, A.

The explants, isolated from field plants, were previously subjected to a basic cleaning method and were inoculated onto Murashige and Skoog culture medium (MS) [Murashige, T.S., Skoog, F., 1962. A revised medium for rapid growth and bioassays with tobacco tissue culture. Physiologia Plantarum 15, 473-497] supplemented with NAA (2.0mgL⁻¹). Buds were subjected to different treatments, with or without 5.0 and 10.0mmolL⁻¹ exogenous polyamines (mixture of putrescine:spermine:spermidine, 1:1:1) combined with NAA. The calluses obtained were transferred into the same medium, supplemented with the mixture of polyamines combined with BAP, in order to induce plant differentiation. For C. longa, buds were the most efficient explants for callus induction (p <0.05). The application of exogenous polyamines (5.0 and 10.0mmolL⁻¹) produced the most developed callus, with numerous roots.

Insertional inactivation of the dltA gene resulted in complete depletion of d-alanine substitution of lipoteichoic acids. The dlt mutant had similar growth characteristics as the wild type under standard in vitro conditions, but formed lower population sizes in the gastrointestinal tract of ex-Lactobacillus-free mice, and was almost eliminated from the habitat in competition experiments with the parental strain. In contrast to the wild type, the dlt mutant was unable to form a biofilm on the forestomach epithelium during gut colonization. Transmission electron microscope observations showed evidence of cell wall damage of mutant bacteria present in the forestomach. The dlt mutant had impaired growth under acidic culture conditions and increased susceptibility to the cationic peptide nisin relative to the wild type. Ex vivo adherence of the dlt mutant to the forestomach epithelium was not impaired. This study showed that d-alanylation is an important cell function of L. reuteri that seems to protect this commensal organism against the hostile conditions prevailing in the murine forestomach. 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aLactobacillus reuteri 3aacid tolerance 3aacids 3aadhesion 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abiofilm 3acell walls 3aepithelium 3aesters 3aforestomach 3ahabitats 3amice 3amutants 3anisin 3aoperon 3apopulation size 3atransmission electron microscopes 3avirulence 3awild relatives 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEstersxchemistry 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aGene Silencing 2aLimosilactobacillus reuterixchemistryxdrug effectsxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aMice 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aNisinxtoxicity 2aOctoxynol 2aOperonxgenetics 2aPeptide Synthasesxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTeichoic Acidsxanalysisxchemistry.1 aLoach, Diane M.1 aAlqumber, Mohammed1 aRockel, Christoph1 aHermann, Corinna1 aPfitzenmaier, Markus1 aTannock, G.

The effect of a Ca²⁺ chelator, EGTA, was investigated before a lethal HS treatment in soybean (Glycine max) seedlings with acquired thermotolerance induced by preheating. Such seedlings became non-thermotolerant with EGTA treatment. The addition of Ca²⁺, Sr²⁺ or Ba²⁺ to the EGTA-treated samples rescued the seedlings from death by preventing the increased cellular leakage of electrolytes, amino acids, and sugars caused by EGTA. It was confirmed that EGTA did not affect HSP accumulation and physiological functions but interfered with the recovery of HS-released Ca²⁺ concentration which was required for thermotolerance. Pectin methylesterase (PME, EC 3.1.1.11), a cell wall remodelling enzyme, was activated in response to HS, and its elevated activity caused an increased level of demethylesterified pectin which was related to the recovery of the HS-released Ca²⁺ concentration. Thus, the recovery of HS-released Ca²⁺ in Ca²⁺-pectate reconstitution through PME activity is required for cell wall remodelling during HS in soybean which, in turn, retains plasma membrane integrity and co-ordinates with HSPs to confer thermotolerance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3aamino acids 3acell walls 3aelectrolytes 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3aplasma membrane 3aseedlings 3asoybeans 3asugars1 aHsu, Shih-Feng1 aLuo, Dan-Li1 aChen, Shiang-Jiuun1 aHuang, Wen-Dar1 aLur, Huu-Sheng1 aJinn, Tsung-Luo0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2010 June, v. 61, no. 10 p.2843-2852dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq1213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01647naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245001300134300001600147300003000163500002300193500001500216520063300231650001500864650002000879650001500899650003500914650001300949650002600962650003200988653000901020700001601029700001901045700001901064700001801083773008501101852000901186939003301195945000801228946001301236655001201249991615385540742620221120050300.0870626s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870013232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbezat, G.O.10aSelenium  ap. 231-258.  ap. 231-258. ill., charts.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-05  aA systematic review summarizes the current scientific understanding of the nutritional importance of selenium (Se) and factors influencing its gastrointestinal uptake.

The loss was estimated based on test-day (TD) cow records collected over a 1-yr period from 400 randomly selected Dutch dairy herds. After exclusion of records from cows with clinical mastitis, the data set comprised 251,647 TD records from 43,462 lactations of 39,512 cows. The analysis was carried out using a random regression test-day modeling approach that predicts the cow production at each TD based on the actual production at all previous TD. The definition of new subclinical mastitis was based on the literature and assumed a new subclinical case if somatic cell count (SCC) was >100,000 cells/mL after a TD with SCC <50,000 cells/mL. A second data set was created by applying an adjustment to correct low SCC for the dilution effect when determining if the previous test-day SCC was <50,000 cells/ mL. Thereafter, the loss was estimated for records with SCC >100,000 cells/mL. The production (milk, fat, or protein) losses were modeled as the difference between the actual and predicted production (milk, fat, or protein) at the TD of new subclinical mastitis, for 4,382 cow records, and 2,545 cow records after dilution correction. Primiparous cows were predicted to lose 0.31 (0.25-0.37) and 0.28 (0.20-0.35) kg of milk/d at an SCC of 200,000 cells/mL, for unadjusted and adjusted low SCC, respectively. For the same SCC increase, multiparous cows were predicted to lose 0.58 (0.54-0.62) and 0.50 (0.44-0.56) kg of milk/d, respectively. Moreover, it was found that the greater the SCC increase above 100,000 cells/mL, the greater the production losses. The estimated production losses were more precise than previously reported estimates. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3asimulation models 3aparity (reproduction) 3aestimation 3aaccuracy 3alactation 3amilk fat yield 3asomatic cell count 3abovine mastitis 3aeconomic impact 3aprediction 3adisease diagnosis 3aNetherlands 0amathematical models 0atest day models 0asubclinical diseases 0amilk yield1 aNielen, M.1 aDe Roos, A.P.W.1 aVan Hoorne, R.1 aJong, G. de.1 aLam, T.J.G.M.1 avan Werven, T.1 aHogeveen, H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.599-606dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle01373naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245001200132300001400144300002800158500002300186500001500209520059700224650001200821650001500833650001400848650002600862653002500888773008300913852000900996939003301005945000801038946001301046655001201059991615383750742620221120033718.0870626s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870013182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiser, M.M.10aCalcium  ap. 15-68.  ap. 15-68. ill., charts.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-05  aA comprehensive review describes various aspects of calcium (Ca) absorption and factors that affect its absorption.

Objective: The objective was to quantify the appearance of carotenoids in plasma chylomicrons after subjects ingested fresh vegetable salads with fat-free, reduced-fat, or full-fat salad dressings. Design: The subjects (n = 7) each consumed 3 salads consisting of equivalent amounts of spinach, romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, and carrots with salad dressings containing 0, 6, or 28 g canola oil. The salads were consumed in random order separated by washout periods of > = 2 wk. Blood samples were collected hourly from 0 to 12 h. Chylomicrons were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and carotenoid absorption was analyzed by HPLC with coulometric array detection. Results: After ingestion of the salads with fat-free salad dressing, the appearance of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and lycopene in chylomicrons was negligible. After ingestion of the salads with reduced-fat salad dressing, the appearance of the carotenoids in plasma chylomicrons increased relative to that after ingestion of the salads with fat-free salad dressing (P < 0.04). Similarly, the appearance of the carotenoids in plasma chylomicrons was higher after the ingestion of salads with full-fat than with reduced-fat salad dressing (P < 0.02). Conclusions: High-sensitivity HPLC with coulometric array detection enabled us to quantify the intestinal absorption of carotenoids ingested from a single vegetable salad. Essentially no absorption of carotenoids was observed when salads with fat-free salad dressing were consumed. A substantially greater absorption of carotenoids was observed when salads were consumed with full-fat than with reduced-fat salad dressing. 3aabsorption 3aalpha-carotene 3abeta-carotene 3abioavailability 3ablood sampling 3acanola oil 3acarrots 3acherry tomatoes 3achylomicrons 3adietary fat 3aelectrochemistry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aingestion 3aintestinal absorption 3alycopene 3araw vegetables 3aromaine lettuce 3asalad dressings 3asalads 3aspinach 3aultracentrifugation 2aAdult 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aBiological Availability 2aCarotenoidsxanalysisxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aChylomicronsxdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aFood Analysis 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aMale 2aVegetables1 aFerruzzi, M.G.1 aNguyen, N.L.1 aCooper, D.A.1 aEldridge, Al.1 aSchwartz, S.J.1 aWhite, W.S.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Aug., v. 80, no. 2 p.396-403dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04325naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100002100200245016100221300001400382500002400396500001500420520255400435650001902989650001403008650002403022650002703046650001003073650002503083650002003108650000903128650001603137650003203153650002703185650001803212650001803230650001203248650001503260651001503275653002303290653002803313653002003341700002803361700002003389700001803409700001803427773010203445852000903547856008603556930003303642945002503675946001103700655001203711IND4420817720221120033541.0090522e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442081772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2009.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aJ700 0aX100 0aE200 0aB200 0aF2001 aBlazy, Jean-Marc12aA methodological framework that accounts for farm diversity in the prototyping of crop management systems. Application to banana-based systems in Guadeloupe  ap. 30-41.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrototyping methods are useful for designing alternative crop management systems (CMS), but they are usually considered mainly at the field level and are poorly equipped to take into account farm diversity in terms of economic, social and natural constraints. This may limit the likelihood of adoption of alternative CMS. This paper proposes a two-step methodological framework that takes into account the diversity of farms in the prototyping of new CMS. The first step of the framework is to design a farm typology that is able to characterise the diversity of current CMS in terms of their technical nature, farming context, and performance. We define a farming context as a set of characteristics at the farm level that are likely to influence the structure and the biophysical and economic performances of CMS at the field level. The typology is designed from a statistical analysis of a set of descriptive variables collected for a sample of farms. The second step of the framework uses this farm typology in a specific work agenda with a panel of experts in order to design a set of alternative CMS prototypes. Prototypes, and the objectives they are meant to reach, are designed by analysing current CMS performances and by mobilising agro-ecological knowledge to identify technical ways to improve them. The typological characterisation of farm diversity then makes it possible to define a set of constraints (SOC) for each farm type. Once the prototypes are designed, the experts use a compatibility indicator (CI) ranging from zero to one to measure the level of compatibility between each prototype and the SOC of each farm type. We define a prototype as compatible with a farm type if the prototype is not likely to increase the constraints of a farm of that type (CI=1). Using this indicator in a process of iterative improvement of prototype design makes it possible to define a set of a priori compatible prototypes for each farm type. The aim of this paper is to present our methodological framework and its application for prototyping new banana crop management systems in Guadeloupe. The six-class typology we developed corresponded to a great diversity of CMS with contrasting performances and farming contexts. The method led to the prototyping of 16 innovative CMS, involving different modalities of intercropping, patterns of pesticide use, choices of hybrid cultivars, and rotations with cover or cash crops. Finally, we discuss the limits of our methodological framework and its utility for improving prototyping approaches. 3aagroecosystems 3acultivars 3ainnovation adoption 3ageographical variation 3afarms 3aagroecological zones 3afarming systems 3aMusa 3afarm income 3agood agricultural practices 3aconservation practices 3aintercropping 3acrop rotation 3abananas 3apesticides 3aGuadeloupe 0aset of constraints 0acrop management systems 0acrop management1 aOzier-Lafontaine, Harry1 aDoré, Thierry.1 aThomas, Alban1 aWery, Jacques0 tAgricultural systems.g2009 June, v. 101, no. 1-2 p.30-41dElsevier Science Ltd.x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2009.02.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03535naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100002000215245014400235300001600379500001500395520147500410650001301885650001801898650001801916650002101934650002701955650001401982650003101996650005202027650001902079650002302098650002002121650001502141650002102156650001602177650001202193650005202205650002402257650002002281650003102301650003102332650004102363650002102404650005202425650002702477650001802504653001002522653002702532700001502559700001702574700001802591700001602609773007302625852000902698856008502707930003302792945002502825946001102850655001202861IND4380392820221120025616.0060523e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438039282DNAL7 a165953012pmid7 a10.1080/030794506005975352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Heterophils produce cytokines and modulate acute protection against Salmonella in neonatal poultry. We hypothesized that heterophils from S. enteritidis-resistant chickens produce an up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response compared with S. enteritidis-susceptible chickens. In this study, heterophils were isolated 1, 14, and 28 days post-hatch, treated with RPMI or phagocytic agonists, and the cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression assessed using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. At all time-points, heterophils from S. enteritidis-resistant chickens (line A) had higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression upon stimulation compared with heterophils from S. enteritidis-susceptible chickens (line B). Furthermore, heterophils from line A chickens had decreased mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta4, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, compared with line B. These data indicate a relationship between cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression by heterophils and determining overall immune competence. Therefore, heterophil functional efficiency, accompanied by evaluating cytokine/chemokines produced by heterophils, may be useful biomarkers for breeders to consider when developing new immunocompetent lines. 3achickens 3amessenger RNA 3acarrier state 3aimmunocompetence 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3acytokines 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3afood pathogens 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3aphagocytes 3aline differences 3aheterophils 2aAnimals 2aChickensxclassificationxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCytokinesxgenetics 2aDown-Regulation 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aNeutrophilsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aOpsonin Proteins 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSalmonella enteritidis 2aUp-Regulation 0alines 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aKaiser, P.1 aRothwell, L.1 aPevzner, I.Y.1 aKogut, M.H.0 tAvian pathology.g2006 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.102-108x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794506005975353Available from publisher's Web site  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03140naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245014800131300001400279520187300293650002502166650002002191650001402211650001902225650003202244650001202276650000902288650002602297650001802323650002302341650002202364650001202386650002202398651001202420653001502432653001302447700001502460700001402475700001802489700001902507773009502526852000902621939003302630945000802663946001102671655001202682991615382130742620221120022341.0920805e199202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920025302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMowat, E.A.12aA comparison of nutritional intake, functional status and muscle strength between elderly day hospital and day centre attenders in South London  ap. 35-51.  aTwo sample groups of elderly were compared from a population living in South London. One group attended a local day centre (a socially orientated establishment), and the other attended a local day hospital (a therapeutically orientated establishment). The aim of the study was to compare nutritional intake, functional status and muscle strength between these two groups. The mean nutritional intakes of the day hospital and day centre attenders were similar. Intake of macronutrients, with the exception of fibre, met Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) in both groups. In take of folic acid, vitamin D and zinc fell below recommendations in both groups. Low intake of folic acid was improved by supplementation, and some individual blood levels of folate reflected this. Blood folate levels were generally within normal limits. Low intake of vitamin D was improved by supplementation, but blood levels were generally normal anyway. There was, however, a tendency for the more dependent day hospital patients to have lower vitamin D levels. This group also had less sunshine exposure. Communal dining, whether in the setting of day hospital or day centre, may have been an essential means of bolstering nutritional intake for many 'at risk' elderly. There were significant differences in functional status and muscle strength in favour of the day centre group and these indicate that anthropometric indices rather than nutritional or biochemical indices were the most reliable markers of disease and disability in this study. The effect of fortifying local meals-on-wheels was also highlighted, and suggests that this may be one means of preventing nutritional deficiencies in the vulnerable, house-bound elderly. Alcohol intake was reported as being modest. However, discrepancies were noted on review of biochemical indices known to be influenced by alcohol intake. 3aHealth and Pathology 3anutrient intake 3ahospitals 3aadult day care 3aanthropometric measurements 3amuscles 3adiet 3anutrient deficiencies 3aenergy intake 3anutritional status 3aindicator species 3aelderly 3ahematologic tests 3aEngland 0aassessment 0astrength1 aThomas, S.1 aHyatt, R.1 aMaxwell, J.D.1 aWhitelaw, M.N.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1992 Feb., v. 5, no. 1 p.35-51x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02939naa a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245007200151300001400223520124500237650002301482650002501505650002601530650001301556650002101569650001601590650001601606650003001622650001001652650000901662650002001671650002201691650001501713650001601728650002801744650001001772650002801782650001101810650001101821650001601832650000901848650002301857650001701880650002101897650001601918650002101934650002001955650001601975651002101991651001102012653001202023700001502035700001802050700001302068700001402081700001402095773010702109852000902216939003302225945000802258946001102266655001202277991615381090742620221117162129.0920803s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920025212DNAL7 a15877032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWetherilt, H.10aBlood vitamin and mineral levels in 7-17 years old Turkish children  ap. 21-29.  aSummary: Blood vitamin (thiamin, riboflavin, vitamins B6, B12, C, A, and E, folate and beta-carotene), mineral (iron and zinc), alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol levels and hematocrit were assessed in 960 school-age children selected by random sampling from urban and rural regions of Turkey. Nutritional statuses of the children according to each index were compared with respect to age, sex, area and type of settlement. A biochemical deficiency was observed in 20.1% of the children for thiamin, in 89.9% for riboflavin, in 83.4% for vitamin B6, in 23.3% for folate, in 5.9% for vitamin B12, in 43.0% for vitamin C, in 11.6% for vitamin A, in 3.5% for beta-carotene, in 21.8% for vitamin E, in 6.1% for iron, and in 15.7% for zinc. Hematocrit was low in 54.3%. Alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol levels were found to be above normal in 54.6% and 4.9% of the children respectively. It is surmised that a major cause of the deficiencies was an ignorance of good dietary practice. Although the children were found to be relatively short according to the National Center for Health Statistics standards, their normalised weights were within acceptable limits, which suggested a prevalence of stunting but not wasting in this population. 3anutritional status 3anutritional adequacy 3anutrient deficiencies 3avitamins 3adietary minerals 3aurban areas 3arural areas 3ageographical distribution 3agirls 3aboys 3aschool children 3ahematologic tests 2aAdolescent 2aAge Factors 2aBlood Chemical Analysis 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIronxblood 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aRisk Factors 2aRural Population 2aSex Factors 2aUrban Population 2aVitaminsxblood 2aZincxblood 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkey 0aregions1 aAckurt, F.1 aBrubacher, G.1 aOkan, B.1 aAktas, S.1 aTurdu, S.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1992, v. 62, no. 1 p.21-29x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02438naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011600162300001600278520114200294650001801436650002101454650001601475650001301491650002501504650000901529650001901538650003701557650004301594650005201637650001201689700001701701700002001718700001601738700001901754773011701773852000901890856008501899930003301984946001102017655001202028IND4447697720221117162113.0110121e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444769772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0156-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yinghui 10aRNA interference targeting CITRON can significantly inhibit the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells  ap. 693-702.  aCITRON (rho-interacting, serine/threonine kinase 21), which is a key component of the midbody, is essential for cytokinesis. However, the role of CITRON in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. Here we first measured the expression of CITRON in HCC specimens by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. The results showed CITRON to be frequently up-regulated in HCC as compared with adjacent non-tumour tissues. Then we employed adenovirus-mediated RNA interference against CITRON to assess its anti-proliferation effect on SMMC-7721 cells, a representative HCC cell line. The resulting data demonstrated that CITRON knockdown was capable of inhibiting the proliferation and colony formation of SMMC-7721 cells, with an obvious increase of multinucleated cells. Furthermore, we subcutaneously injected the SMMC-7721 cells with the CITRON knockdown into nude mice to evaluate the tumourigenicity. The data indicated that adenovirus-mediated RNA interference can suppress tumourigenicity in vivo of HCC cells. Our data suggest that CITRON may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC. 3aCitrus medica 3aRNA interference 3acytokinesis 3ahepatoma 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atissues1 aHuang, Jian 1 aWang, Ke-Sheng 1 aZhang, Xin 1 aHan, Ze-Guang 0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.693-702dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0156-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110121b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03456naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002200170245012400192300001600316500002400332520213100356650002302487650003202510650000902542650002102551650002702572650001402599650002302613650003202636650001902668650001702687650002302704700002202727773011502749852000902864856009202873930003302965945002502998946001103023655001203034IND4420818520221123041105.0090522e20090526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442081852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aEryavuz, Abdullah10aEffects of supplemental zinc concentration on cellulose digestion and cellulolytic and total bacterial numbers in vitro  ap. 175-183.  aIncludes references  aEffects of various zinc (Zn) concentrations on cellulose digestion and cellulolytic and total bacterial numbers were studied in vitro. All fermentation tubes were inoculated with a 1:10 dilution of whole rumen contents and used either 0.0075 or 0.015g/ml purified cellulose as substrate. When Zn was added at six different concentrations: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 50μg/ml, using either 0.0075 or 0.015g/ml cellulose, the 50μg/ml concentration reduced cellulose digestion (P<0.01) at 24h of incubation. However, cellulose digestion was similar to the control tubes at 48h. At 24h, addition of Zn at 50μg/ml to the medium containing 0.0075g/ml cellulose lowered cellulose digestion (P<0.016), but did not affect cellulolytic and total bacterial concentrations. By 48h, cellulolytic bacterial concentrations in the control tubes were lower (P<0.001) than in the Zn supplemented tubes. Total bacterial concentrations were also lower (P=0.076) for control tubes. Using 0.015g/ml cellulose and Zn concentrations of 0, 50, 100 and 150μg/ml, cellulose digestion after 24h was lower than the control for all tubes with added Zn (P<0.01). By 48h, cellulose digestion was similar in tubes containing 0 and 50μg/ml concentrations of Zn, while digestion remained lower with concentrations of 100 and 150μg/ml (P<0.01). After 72h, only the 150μg/ml Zn concentration had less cellulose digested (P<0.05). Final pH values followed a similar pattern: the higher the Zn concentration, the less decrease in pH. Concentrations of cellulolytic bacteria were lower (P<0.001) in all tubes with Zn after 24h incubation, but their concentration in the control tubes decreased markedly between 24 and 48h, presumably due to low pH and substrate limitation. No differences were observed in total bacterial concentrations at any fermentation time period. The decreased cellulolytic bacterial concentration in the tubes with high Zn levels may be due to decreased utilization of cellulose by the bacteria, rather than a toxic effect of high Zn on the bacteria. Possibly Zn has an inhibitory effect on the cellulolytic enzymes produced by the bacteria. 3aruminant nutrition 3adietary mineral supplements 3azinc 3adietary minerals 3achemical concentration 3acellulose 3ain vitro digestion 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3arumen bacteria 3arumen fluids 3arumen fermentation1 aDehority, Burk A.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 May 26, v. 151, no. 3-4 p.175-183dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090715b00000000c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02910naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245007900148300001400227520133400241650001701575650001401592650002001606650001201626650002301638650001001661650001401671650002001685650001101705650002001716650001501736650001101751650002401762650001501786650001001801650002801811650001101839650004701850650002001897650001101917650004401928650000901972650002901981650001902010650004502029651001102074700001602085700001702101700001602118700001802134773010702152852000902259939003302268945000802301946001102309655001202320991615380430742620221123041112.0920803s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920025232DNAL7 a15877112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNath, S.K.10aUrinary excretion of iodide and fluoride from supplemented food grade salt  ap. 66-72.  aSummary: Iodide and fluoride supplemented food grade salt (NaCl) is a common source of these two micronutrients. In a pilot study, we investigated whether increased intake of NaCl supplemented with iodide (I-) and fluoride (F-) results in their higher bioavailability. Twelve healthy adult human volunteers ingested increasing quantities (1, 3, 6 and 9 g) of NaCl with usual diet over 8 days. Sodium (Na+), I- and F- were measured in 24 hour urine specimen. During the 4 day basal period when no additional NaCl was ingested, ingestion of NaCl calculated from urinary Na+ concentration and diuresis was 8.25 +/- 0.67 g/24 h. During the same period 0.11 +/- 0.04 and 0.61 +/- 0.04 mg of I- and F- respectively were excreted in the urine per 24 h. Increased ingestion of supplemented NaCl resulted in higher urinary excretion of sodium while urinary creatinine remained stable. 92% of I- and 40% of F- contained in the additional amount of NaCl ingested were excreted in the urine. These results indicate that with increased ingestion of supplemented (I- and F-) NaCl, almost the totality of I- is excreted in the urine while fluoride is either incompletely absorbed or retained by the body to a higher extent. I- and F- supplemented NaCl is, therefore, an effective vehicle to provide these micronutrients when ingested with diet. 3aiodized salt 3afluorides 3abioavailability 3aiodides 3aexperimental diets 3aurine 3aexcretion 3anutrient intake 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3acreatinine 3aadults 3adietary supplements 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBiological Availability 2aFemale 2aFluoridesxadministration & dosagexurine. 2aFood, Fortified 2aHumans 2aIodinexadministration & dosagexurine. 2aMale 2aMetabolic Clearance Rate 2aPilot Projects 2aSodium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 3aFrance1 aMoinier, B.1 aThullier, F.1 aRongier, M.1 aDesjeux, J.F.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1992, v. 62, no. 1 p.66-72x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02758naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245017300175300001600348500002800364520147100392650001301863650001301876650001501889650001801904650001601922650002501938653005401963653002302017700001702040700002002057700002402077700002302101700002302124773011302147852000902260856009202269946001102361655001202372IND4413869120221123041219.0081219s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441386912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02657.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelimov, Andrey A.10aRhizosphere bacteria containing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase increase yield of plants grown in drying soil via both local and systemic hormone signalling  ap. 413-423.  aPublisher supplied data  aDecreased soil water availability can stimulate production of the plant hormone ethylene and inhibit plant growth. Strategies aimed at decreasing stress ethylene evolution might attenuate its negative effects. An environmentally benign (nonchemical) method of modifying crop ethylene relations - soil inoculation with a natural root-associated bacterium Variovorax paradoxus 5C-2 (containing the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase that degrades the ethylene precursor ACC), was assessed with pea (Pisum sativum) plants grown in drying soil. Inoculation with V. paradoxus 5C-2, but not with a transposome mutant with massively decreased ACC deaminase activity, improved growth, yield and water-use efficiency of droughted peas. Systemic effects of V. paradoxus 5C-2 included an amplified soil drying-induced increase of xylem abscisic acid (ABA) concentration, but an attenuated soil drying-induced increase of xylem ACC concentration. A local bacterial effect was increased nodulation by symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which prevented a drought-induced decrease in nodulation and seed nitrogen content. Successfully deploying a single bacterial gene in the rhizosphere increased yield and nutritive value of plants grown in drying soil, via both local and systemic hormone signalling. Such bacteria may provide an easily realized, economic means of sustaining crop yields and using irrigation water more efficiently in dryland agriculture. 3abacteria 3aethylene 3anodulation 3aPisum sativum 3arhizosphere 3aVariovorax paradoxus 0a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase 0ahormone signalling1 aDodd, Ian C.1 aHontzeas, Nikos1 aTheobald, Julian C.1 aSafronova, Vera I.1 aDavies, William J.0 tNew phytologist.g2009 Jan., v. 181, no. 2 p.413-423dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02657.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01530naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007200167300001600239500001500255520048800270650001300758653001300771653002200784653002500806653001400831700002300845700002300868700002000891700002400911773010500935852000901040856008501049930003301134946001301167655001201180IND4416391520221123041154.0090213e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441639152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10913-008-0045-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBochkarev, G.

Reliable and automatic prediction of these movements is crucial to properly identify the protective measures for residents living within the inundation flood zones. In this regard, BISHOP, a decision tool to automatically predict, at multiple river cross-sections, the slope failure circle with the minimum safety factor has been developed. In this paper, the computer tool BISHOP, named after the simplified Bishop method, is presented. Its applications have proven to be highly efficient in real case studies, where the stability of multiple slope profiles, at different river cross-sections, must be analyzed to establish spatial and temporal evolution of the river banks failures. The integration of the proposed methodology within a comprehensive flow hydrodynamic, sediment transport and landslide calculation has particularly enhanced the evaluation of the flood-risk zone during major flooding. Typical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed methodology are demonstrated during the analysis of the evolution of a river reach downstream of a dam a dam break scenario. 0aRisk area 0aSlope stability 0aSafety factor automated search 0aSimplified Bishop method1 aMerabtene, Tarek 0 tNatural hazards.g2010 Oct., v. 55, no. 1 p.3-14dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9570-13Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02251naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010000166300001600266500002800282520123200310650001101542650002801553650001601581653003201597653001001629653002101639700001901660700002101679773012001700852000901820856008501829946001101914655001201925IND4415679620221123041234.0090130s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441567962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-008-0730-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAranishi, Hiromi10aCharacterization of interstitial cells of Cajal in the subserosal layer of the guinea-pig colon  ap. 323-329.  aPublisher supplied data  aInterstitial cells of Cajal in the subserosa (ICC-SS) of the guinea-pig proximal colon were studied by immunohistochemistry for c-Kit receptors and by transmission electron microscopy. These cells were distributed within a thin layer of connective tissue space immediately beneath the mesothelium and were multipolar with about five primary cytoplasmic processes that divided further into secondary and tertiary processes to form a two-dimensional network. Ultrastructural observations revealed that ICC-SS were connected to each other via gap junctions. They also formed close contacts and peg-and-socket junctions with smooth muscle cells. Three-dimensional analysis of confocal micrographs revealed that the cytoplasmic processes of ICC-SS had contacts with interstitial cells in the longitudinal muscle layer. Taking account of the location and peculiar arrangement of the ICC-SS and the main functions of the proximal colon, i.e. the absorption and transport of fluids, we suggest that the superficial network of ICC-SS acts as a stretch receptor to detect circumferential expansion and swelling of the colon wall and triggers the contraction of the longitudinal muscle to accelerate the drainage of fluids from the colon. 3aserosa 3agastrointestinal system 3aguinea pigs 0aInterstitial cells of Cajal 0ac-Kit 0aStretch receptor1 aKunisawa, Yumi1 aKomuro, Terumasa0 tCell and tissue research.g2009 Feb., v. 335, no. 2 p.323-329dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-008-0730-53Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03066naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245014500166300001600311500001500327520157900342650001901921650001101940650001101951650001001962650002001972650002101992650002402013650001102037650001202048650002902060650001502089650001102104650002002115650001102135650002102146650002102167650001202188651001102200653001602211653000802227653001102235653002002246700001802266700001702284773011302301852000902414856006902423930003302492946001102525655001202536IND4387059120221123041125.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438705912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-006-9060-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonsson, Anders 10aComposition and variations in the occurrence of dissolved free simple organic compounds of an unproductive lake ecosystem in northern Sweden  ap. 153-163.  a2019-12-05  aLow molecular weight organic carbon compounds are potentially important carbon and energy substrates to heterotrophic production in the aquatic environment. We studied the occurrence of dissolved free amino acids (AA), monosaccharides (CHO), and carboxylic acids (CA) in the subarctic Lake Diktar-Erik. The lake is unproductive with slightly humic water, and receives water via one major inlet stream draining a birch forest environment. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the inlet stream was strongly correlated with the discharge. This relationship changed from season to season, indicating changes in the sources of the DOC entering the stream. AA and CHO each accounted for an average of less than 0.5% of the DOC. After high discharge events during the ice-free period, AA and CHO occurred in especially high concentrations. CA occurred in higher concentrations during the ice-free period, when it generally accounted for 20-30% of the DOC pool. The CA content relative to the total DOC pool was strongly inversely correlated with overall DOC concentration, and at low DOC levels the relative content of CA was high and vice versa. This followed a seasonal trend, with CA accounting for a smaller proportion of the DOC in winter and a larger part in spring/early summer. A conservative estimate suggested that the studied simple organic carbon compounds potentially could cover 30% of the bacterial gross production in the lake and therefore potentially also was an important source of CO₂ that occur in supersaturated concentrations in the lake. 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3awinter 3alakes 3amonosaccharides 3afree amino acids 3aaquatic environment 3aspring 3astreams 3adissolved organic carbon 3aecosystems 3asummer 3abiogeochemistry 3aBetula 3amolecular weight 3acarboxylic acids 3aforests 3aSweden 0aRespiration 0aDOC 0acarbon 0aSubarctic lakes1 aStröm, Lena 1 aÅberg, Jan 0 tBiogeochemistry.g2007 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.153-163dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-006-9060-43electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03129naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245012300188300001600311500001500327520122000342650004301562650001801605650000801623650002101631650001701652650000901669650001001678650003301688650005601721650003401777650004701811650002601858650003001884650003901914650003201953650008001985650002202065650002402087650001402111653002602125653002502151653002702176653000902203700001302212700001702225700002002242700001602262773012802278852000902406856009202415930003302507946001102540655001202551IND4416226420221123024108.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441622642DNAL7 a192078542pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02532.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrabelsi, D.10aDevelopment of real-time PCR assay for detection and quantification of Sinorhizobium meliloti in soil and plant tissue  ap. 355-361.  a2019-12-04  aSinorhizobium meliloti is a nitrogen-fixing alpha-proteobacterium present in soil and symbiotically associated with root nodules of leguminous plants. To date, estimation of bacterial titres in soil is achieved by most-probable-number assays based on the number of nodules on the roots of test plants. Here, we report the development of two real-time PCR (qPCR) assays to detect the presence of S. meliloti in soil and plant tissues by targeting, in a species-specific fashion, the chromosomal gene rpoE1 and the pSymA gene nodC. rpoE1 and nodC primer pairs were tested on DNA extracted from soil samples unspiked and spiked with known titres of S. meliloti and from plant root samples nodulated with S. meliloti. Results obtained were well in agreement with viable titres of S. meliloti cells estimated in the same samples. The developed qPCR assays appear to be enough sensitive, precise and species-specific to be used as a complementary tool for S. meliloti titre estimation. These two novel markers offer the possibility of quick and reliable estimation of S. meliloti titres in soil and plant roots contributing new tools to explore S. meliloti biology and ecology including viable but nonculturable fraction. 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aplant tissues 3aDNA 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aroot nodules 3asoil 3agenes 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aMedicago sativaxmicrobiology 2aN-Acetylglucosaminyltransferasesxgenetics 2aPlant Root Nodulation 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSinorhizobium melilotixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosis 0abacterial populations 0amost probable number 0aSinorhizobium meliloti 0aqPCR1 aPini, F.1 aAouani, M.E.1 aBazzicalupo, M.1 aMengoni, A.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.355-361dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02532.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090213b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03103naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001700161245011400178300001400292500002400306500001500330520158900345650001601934650002301950650000801973650001701981650001601998650001002014650002702024650002202051650002602073650001202099650001302111650003402124650002002158650002002178650002802198650001102226653000902237653001302246700001802259700001602277773012202293852000902415856009202424930003302516945002502549946001102574655001202585IND4415344320221123002119.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441534432DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00920.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aSvendsen, M.14aThe long-term influence of orlistat on dietary intake in obese subjects with components of metabolic syndrome  ap. 55-63.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOrlistat is a lipase inhibitor that reduces the intestinal absorption of fat and may enhance the effects of dietary and behavioural therapy on weight loss and maintenance. The present study examined the effect of orlistat on dietary intake, especially fat intake, during long-term weight maintenance. Subjects comprised 44 men and women (aged 18-63 years; body mass index 37.5 ± 4.3 kg m⁻²) included in the Scandinavian Multicenter study of Obese subjects with the metabolic syndrome, a 3-year clinical trial of orlistat or placebo following an 8-week, very low energy diet (VLED). Two months after the end of the trial when the use of orlistat was optional, 33 subjects remained in the study. A dietary interview based on a validated food frequency questionnaire was conducted before the VLED, after 1 year of treatment with orlistat or placebo and 2 months after the end of the trial. At 1 year, dietary intake did not differ between the orlistat and placebo group. Energy percent (E%) fat was reduced and E% carbohydrate was increased within both groups. Two months after the end of the trial, E% fat was 32.6% (SD 6.2%) in subjects that chose to take orlistat and 27.7% (SD 5.5%) in subjects not taking orlistat [between group difference -5.0% (95% confidence interval -9.2 to -0.7); P = 0.021]. The use of orlistat compared with placebo in a lifestyle modification programme does not appear to influence dietary intake. Subjects that chose to take orlistat after the end of the programme did not comply with dietary recommendations and this may hamper the effect of the drug. 3afood intake 3ametabolic syndrome 3amen 3adrug therapy 3adietary fat 3awomen 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aintestinal absorption 3aobesity 3apatients 3afood frequency questionnaires 3abody mass index 3aclinical trials 3adietary recommendations 3aadults 0adiet 0aorlistat1 aHelgeland, M.1 aTonstad, S.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2009 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.55-63dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00920.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03549naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002200180245016500202300001400367500002400381500001500405520114300420650002801563650002201591650002501613650001701638650002501655650002301680650000901703650000901712650001901721650001701740650002001757650000901777650003201786650001401818650001601832650001601848650001201864650002201876650004801898650005701946650000902003650006002012650005702072650000902129650001102138650001602149650001102165650000902176650006002185650004202245651001602287651003102303653002602334653003202360653004402392700002002436700001902456700001802475700002402493773010402517852000902621856009202630930003302722945002502755946001102780655001202791IND4415346320221123001917.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441534632DNAL7 a186998132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2008.00691.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8311 aDrouot, Stéphane10aPets as the main source of two zoonotic species of the Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex in Switzerland, Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii and Arthroderma benhamiae  ap. 13-18.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn cases of highly inflammatory dermatophytosis in humans, it is important to identify the possible source of animal transmission in order to prevent recurrence, family outbreaks or rapidly progressing epidemics. A survey of dermatophytes in pets during a 14-month period in Switzerland revealed, in addition to Microsporum canis, two different species of the Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex, Arthroderma benhamiae and Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii, all causing inflammatory dermatophytoses. Arthroderma benhamiae was only and frequently isolated from guinea pigs. Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii was isolated mainly from European short hair cats, but also from dogs and in one case from a pure-bred cat. Ninety-three percent of the cats carrying A. vanbreuseghemii were hunters and all had skin lesions. In contrast, cats with skin lesions that were strictly indoors were found to be almost exclusively infected by M. canis. Therefore, it can be suspected that infection with A. vanbreuseghemii occurred during hunting and that the natural source of this dermatophyte is either soil or an animal other than the cat, most probably a rodent. 3aepidemiological studies 3aMicrosporum canis 3akeratinophilic fungi 3askin lesions 3adisease surveillance 3adisease prevalence 3acats 3adogs 3adermatomycoses 3arisk factors 3arisk assessment 3apets 3aTrichophyton mentagrophytes 3apredation 3aguinea pigs 3aArthroderma 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aArthrodermataceaexisolation & purification 2aCat Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aCats 2aDermatomycosesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aGuinea Pigs 2aHumans 2aMale 2aRodent Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aZoonosesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 3aSwitzerland 0aSwitzerlandxepidemiology. 0aArthroderma benhamiae 0aArthroderma vanbreuseghemii 0asigns and symptoms (animals and humans)1 aMignon, Bernard1 aFratti, Marina1 aRoosje, Petra1 aMonod, M.q(Michel)0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2009 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.13-18dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2008.00691.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03526naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010500193300001600298520152900314650001801843650002801861650003001889650002601919650003001945650001801975650005001993650003902043650002702082650004202109650003202151650001502183650001102198650005002209650002802259650005502287653002602342653000902368653002602377653001502403700001902418700003102437700001902468700001902487700001702506700002602523700002602549700002002575700002102595700002502616700002202641773010402663852000902767856009202776930003302868946001102901655001202912IND4417959420221123002107.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441795942DNAL7 a191922492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00882.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStechly, Laurence10aGalectin-4-Regulated Delivery of Glycoproteins to the Brush Border Membrane of Enterocyte-Like Cells  ap. 438-450.  aWe have previously reported that silencing of galectin-4 expression in polarized HT-29 cells perturbed apical biosynthetic trafficking and resulted in a phenotype similar to the inhibitor of glycosylation, 1-benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β- d-galactopyranoside (GalNAcα-O-bn). We now present evidence of a lipid raft-based galectin-4-dependent mechanism of apical delivery of glycoproteins in these cells. First, galectin-4 recruits the apical glycoproteins in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) because these glycoproteins were depleted in DRMs isolated from galectin-4-knockdown (KD) HT-29 5M12 cells. DRM-associated glycoproteins were identified as ligands for galectin-4. Structural analysis showed that DRMs were markedly enriched in a series of complex N-glycans in comparison to detergent-soluble membranes. Second, in galectin-4-KD cells, the apical glycoproteins still exit the Golgi but accumulated inside the cells, showing that their recruitment within lipid rafts and their apical trafficking required the delivery of galectin-4 at a post-Golgi level. This lectin that is synthesized on free cytoplasmic ribosomes is externalized from HT-29 cells mostly in the apical medium and follows an apical endocytic-recycling pathway that is required for the apical biosynthetic pathway. Together, our data show that the pattern of N-glycosylation of glycoproteins serves as a recognition signal for endocytosed galectin-4, which drives the raft-dependent apical pathway of glycoproteins in enterocyte-like HT-29 cells. 3aglycosylation 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCarbohydrate Conformation 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCell Polarity 2aDipeptidyl Peptidase 4xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnterocytesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aGalectin 4xmetabolism 2aGlycoproteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGolgi Apparatusxmetabolism 2aHT29 Cells 2aHumans 2aMembrane Microdomainsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0abrush border membrane 0aDRMs 0aenterocyte-like cells 0agalectin-41 aMorelle, Willy1 aDessein, Anne-Frédérique1 aAndré, Sabine1 aGrard, Georges1 aTrinel, Dave1 aDejonghe, Marie-José1 aLeteurtre, Emmanuelle1 aDrobecq, Hervé1 aTrugnan, Germain1 aGabius, Hans Joachim1 aHuet, Guillemette0 tTraffic.g2009 Apr., v. 10, no. 4 p.438-450dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1398-92197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00882.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02722naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001500179245016700194300001600361500002400377500001500401520113000416650002501546650001601571650001501587650001701602650001801619650001001637650001201647650002101659650002201680650002101702650001001723650001601733650001201749650001801761650001401779653002901793653002101822700002101843700001201864700001901876773011501895852000902010856009202019930003302111945002502144946001102169655001202180IND4420819920221122182323.0090522e20090526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442081992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aR3001 aLi, Ya-Jun10aEffect of dietary isomaltooligosaccharides on nutrient digestibility and concentration of glucose, insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides in serum of growing pigs  ap. 312-315.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEight growing pigs (25.6±1.1kg) were used to study the effect of isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO) on nutrient digestibility and concentration of glucose, insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides in the serum. Four diets were formulated by adding 0, 25, 50 and 75gIMO/kg to the basal diet. Pigs were allotted to treatments according to a 4x4 Latin square design. Each treatment consisted of 2 individual pigs used in each of the period and faeces and urine were collected for 4 days. At each experimental period feed intake was measured and blood samples were collected from each pig after a 12h fasting period. The inclusion of IMO did not influence total tract apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, total ash, and phosphorus or the concentration of insulin and cholesterol in the serum. However, IMO inclusion tended to increase dry matter (P=0.078) and calcium (P=0.065) digestibility and triglycerides concentration in the serum (P=0.061) and decreased glucose concentration in the serum (P=0.017). It is concluded that the inclusion of IMO in the diet has limited influence on performance of growing pigs. 3achemical composition 3afeeder pigs 3aisomaltose 3ablood lipids 3aswine feeding 3aurine 3aglucose 3afeed supplements 3achemical analysis 3atriacylglycerols 3afeces 3acholesterol 3ainsulin 3adigestibility 3anutrients 0aisomaltooligosaccharides 0aoligosaccharides1 aZhao, Guang-Yong1 aDu, Wen1 aZhang, Tiejun.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 May 26, v. 151, no. 3-4 p.312-315dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.01.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090715b00000000c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03886naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001900175245010800194300001600302500002400318520231500342650001402657650001802671650002602689650001702715650001802732650001602750650002402766650003202790650001902822650001802841650001502859650001802874650001502892650001602907650002002923650002202943650002102965653002202986700002103008700002103029700001903050773010903069852000903178856008803187930003303275945002503308946001103333655001203344IND4420820520221122182403.0090522e20090615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442082052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aF300 0aK0011 aBaum, Christel10aOverstory-specific effects of litter fall on the microbial carbon turnover in a mature deciduous forest  ap. 109-114.  aIncludes references  aMature deciduous forests can serve as important carbon (C) sinks, but the C storage differs significantly in dependency on the tree species. To specify the significance of overstory-specific effects of litter fall on the soil microbial C turnover, we have investigated the ¹³C isotopic signature of microbial biomarker phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Samples were taken under pure Fagus sylvatica and mixed overstory (F. sylvatica and Fraxinus excelsior or F. excelsior, Acer spp. and F. sylvatica) in a mature temperate deciduous forest in Central Germany 4 weeks prior to and 3 weeks after litter fall. Accordingly, the CO₂ emission from soil was measured before, during and after the litter fall to investigate the response of decomposition. At all sites and at both sampling dates the fungal biomarker PLFA 18:2ω6,9 had predominantly lower δ ¹³C values (from -32 to -43[per thousand]) than the bacterial biomarker PLFAs (δ ¹³C values from -23 to -39[per thousand]). This difference indicated that fungi generally used preferentially plant derived C, whereas the bacterial populations include groups which used SOM derived C, independent on the overstory trees. Under pure F. sylvatica overstory the δ ¹³C values of microbial biomarker PLFAs were slightly decreased (up to 2[per thousand] for 17:0br) or unchanged after litter fall. By contrast, under both variants of mixed overstory the δ ¹³C values of biomarker PLFAs of fungi (18:2ω6,9) were increased after litter fall (+3.5 and +3.8[per thousand]). This might be explained partly by a faster initial decomposition of foliar litter from mixed overstory already during litter fall as confirmed by higher CO₂ emission under mixed F. excelsior, Acer spp. and F. sylvatica than under pure F. sylvatica in this period. However, the involved microbial populations differed overstory-specific. Bacterial biomarker PLFAs with strongest overstory-specific differences in the response on litter fall were 17:0br (Gram-positive bacteria), 18:1 and 19:0cy (Gram-negative bacteria). The present results indicate that a tree species conversion even exclusively between deciduous tree species might alter the soil microbial C turnover during litter decomposition and suggest that it would in the long-term change the SOM stability and C storage. 3aoverstory 3aforest canopy 3abotanical composition 3aforest trees 3aforest litter 3adegradation 3asoil organic matter 3abiological activity in soil 3acarbon dioxide 3agas emissions 3asoil fungi 3asoil bacteria 3abiomarkers 3afatty acids 3astable isotopes 3adeciduous forests 3asoil respiration 0aisotope signature1 aFienemann, Mirko1 aGlatzel, Stephan1 aGleixner, Gerd0 tForest ecology and management.g2009 June 15, v. 258, no. 2 p.109-114dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.03.0473Available from publisher's Web site  a20090605b20090703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03703naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001700189245017000206300001400376500002400390500001500414520155500429650001401984650001601998650001402014650001502028650002802043650001302071650001602084650001302100650001702113650001102130650000902141650003302150650002702183650002802210650002802238650002302266650001102289650001102300650000902311650001602320650005802336650003002394650003102424650003202455650002202487653003702509653004102546653002102587653001602608653001602624700001602640700001402656700001602670700001502686773012202701852000902823856009202832930003302924945002502957946001102982655001202993IND4415344220221122182338.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441534422DNAL7 a191920262pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00919.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aX3801 aIsenring, E.10aEstimation of total body water from bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy in oncology outpatients receiving radiotherapy and agreement with three prediction equations  ap. 50-54.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) may be more accurate in determining total body water (TBW) than bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The present study compared the agreement between three TBW prediction equations developed using BIA and BIS-derived TBW in oncology outpatients. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted in 37 outpatients receiving radiotherapy (27 males/10 females, aged 68.3 ± 10.2 years). TBW was estimated by BIS (TBWBIS) and three BIA TBW prediction equations (TBWca₋u: underweight cancer patients; TBWca₋n: normal-weight cancer patients; and TBWrad: patients receiving radiotherapy). Bland-Altman analyses determined agreement between methods. BIS-derived TBW using new resistivity constants was calculated. The mean ± SD of TBW estimated by BIS was 39.8 ± 8.3 L, which was significantly different from the prediction equations; TBWrad 35.1 ± 7.9 L, TBWca₋u 33.1 ± 7.5 L and TBWca₋n 32.3 ± 7.3 L, (P < 0.001). Using new resistivity constants, TBW was 36.2 ± 8.1 L but this still differed from the equations (P < 0.001). Bias between TBWBIS and that predicted by the equations was in the range 4.7-7.4 L or 1.1-3.9 L using new resistivity constants. TBW estimated by BIS cannot be directly compared with oncology-specific BIA equations, suggesting that BIS cannot be used at the group level in outpatients receiving radiotherapy. There was a reduced bias with BIS using new resistivity constants; however, further research should determine any advantage of BIS over BIA in this population. 3aneoplasms 3abody weight 3aequations 3abody water 3abioelectrical impedance 3apatients 3ameasurement 3aaccuracy 3aspectroscopy 3aadults 2aAged 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Waterxmetabolism 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aElectric Impedance 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMathematics 2aNeoplasmsxmetabolismxphysiopathologyxradiotherapy. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpectrum Analysis 0abioelectrical impedance analysis 0abioelectrical impedance spectroscopy 0abody composition 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aColombo, M.1 aCross, G.1 aKellett, E.1 aSwaney, L.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2009 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.50-54dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00919.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02776naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245010800175300001600283520121400299650002501513650001601538650001801554650001901572650001301591650001101604650000901615650001201624650001301636650002401649650001401673650001001687650001201697650001501709650002701724650001801751650002101769653001101790653001501801653002701816700002501843700002001868700002601888700001701914700002001931700002101951773011701972852000902089856009202098930003302190946001102223655001202234IND4419504520221121022119.0090424e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441950452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02162.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera, Marcelino10aPhysiological responses of juvenile wedge sole Dicologoglossa cuneata (Moreau) to high stocking density  ap. 790-797.  aPhysiological responses to a high stocking density were tested in juvenile wedge sole Dicologoglossa cuneata (Moreau). Fish were kept at low (1 kg m⁻²), medium (3 kg m⁻²) and high (9 kg m⁻²) stocking densities for 22 days. No differences in the weight, length, survival and hepatosomatic index were observed among treatments. Basal plasma cortisol and osmolality were found to be directly and positively related to stocking density. A mild increase in plasma glucose was seen at medium density, and plasma protein was elevated at medium and high densities. The liver glucose and glycogen content was inversely related to stocking density. The liver triglyceride level was significantly elevated at the highest density, and the α-amino acid content decreased at the highest density. In muscle, glucose levels were significantly higher in fish kept at the lowest density; the α-amino acid content was elevated in fish kept at high density. In conclusion, plasma cortisol levels indicated an increasing stress level depending on the culture density, but significant changes in energy reserves did not occur in tissue (mainly liver and muscle glycogen and glucose reserves were significantly affected). 3aDicologlossa cuneata 3aamino acids 3ablood glucose 3ablood proteins 3acortisol 3aenergy 3afish 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3ahepatosomatic index 3ajuveniles 3aliver 3amuscles 3aosmolality 3aphysiological response 3astocking rate 3atriacylglycerols 0astress 0awedge sole 0aDicologoglossa cuneata1 aVargas-Chacoff, Luis1 aHachero, Ismael1 aRuíz-Jarabo, Ignacio1 aRodiles, Ana1 aNavas, José I.1 aMancera, Juan M.0 tAquaculture research.g2009 Apr., v. 40, no. 7 p.790-797dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02162.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02531naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245016300184300001600347500001500363520124300378650001301621650002601634650001001660650002601670650001101696650002101707650001201728650002401740650000901764653001001773653002701783653003201810653001401842700001701856773007301873852000901946856008501955930003302040945001302073946001102086655001202097IND2327667620221122155508.0020621e200112  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232766762DNAL7 a191849572pmid7 a10.1080/030794501200921252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandman, W.J.M.10aField studies on the association between amyloid arthropathy and Mycoplasma synoviae infection, and experimental reproduction of the condition in brown layers  ap. 629-639.  a2019-12-04  aApproximately 20% of outbreaks of amyloid arthropathy in The Netherlands were earlier attributed to Enterococcus faecalis but there was no explanation for the remaining cases. In a further study, material from the joints of 10 birds from each of 10 affected brown layer flocks and two broiler flocks was cultured in several bacteriological media. E. faecalis was isolated from one layer flock but Mycoplasma synoviae was recovered from purulent joints in six of the layer flocks and both broiler flocks. Brown layers were then infected experimentally with one of the M. synoviae isolates to assess its arthropathic and amyloidogenic potential. Using Congo red staining, articular amyloid deposits were seen 12 weeks after intra-articular or intravenous inoculation in almost all birds. After intra-articular inoculation of the left knee joint the contralateral hock tendon sheath tended to be affected, while hock and foot joints were mainly affected after intravenous inoculation. Amyloid deposits were seen in livers and spleens of many birds. This is the first demonstration of arthropathic strains of M. synoviae with an association with amyloid arthropathy, while for one isolate its amyloidogenic potential was shown experimentally. 3achickens 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aliver 3aintravenous injection 3aspleen 3asynovial sheaths 3aamyloid 3aMycoplasma synoviae 3afeet 0ahocks 0aexperimental infection 0aintra-articular inoculation 0ainjection1 aFeberwee, A.0 tAvian pathology.g2001 Dec., v. 30, no. 6 p.629-639x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501200921253Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02953naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245015000184300001600334500001500350520162500365650002101990650001902011650001302030650002202043650002502065650001302090650001402103653004202117653001202159653002002171700003502191700001302226700001602239700001402255700001402269773007302283852000902356856008502365930003302450945001302483946001102496655001202507IND2327669220221122113351.0020621e200112  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232766922DNAL7 a191849622pmid7 a10.1080/030794501200921702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandman, W.J.M.10aAvian leukosis virus subtype J in ovo-infected specific pathogen free broilers harbour the virus in their feathers and show feather abnormalities  ap. 675-684.  a2019-12-04  aIn the present paper, abnormal feather development associated with an in ovo avian leukosis virus (ALV) subgroup J infection in specific pathogen free broilers is reported. A description of gross lesions is given, together with the results of light microscopic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies to further elucidate the characteristics of the feather pathology and to assess the presence of ALV subtype J in broiler feathers. The feather lesions found, which were mainly restricted to primary and secondary remiges, were thinness and increased transparency of the calamus and sparseness of the vane. In a few cases, feather growth retardation was present, while the vane remained ensheathed. Light microscopy did not reveal abnormalities, although immunohistochemically prominent anti-p27 staining was found in the central area of the feather pulp between cells forming the barbular epithelium. Transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of retroviral particles in various structures of the feather (epidermal collar and intermediate layer of feather epidermis), most virus being present in the same area that stained most prominently by immunohistochemistry and where apparently intra-epithelial gaps were seen. ALV was isolated from the upper two-thirds of primary remiges of almost all inoculated birds and 40% of contact birds. Polymerase chain reaction of cell cultures showed that the virus isolates belonged to subgroup J. This study shows that subtype J virus can be massively present in feather tissue of infected birds, which could have consequences for its transmission and diagnosis. 3abroiler chickens 3aavian leukosis 3ayolk sac 3agerm-free animals 3aabnormal development 3afeathers 3ainfection 0apathological processes and conditions 0alesions 0aavian oncovirus1 aNieuwenhuisen-van Wilgen, J.L.1 aKoch, G.1 aDwars, R.M.1 aUltee, A.1 aGruys, E.0 tAvian pathology.g2001 Dec., v. 30, no. 6 p.675-684x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501200921703Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03579naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012900164300001600293520187300309650001302182650002302195650002002218650001202238650001202250650001402262650001802276650001502294650001402309650001302323650000702336650001302343650001402356650000902370650002302379650001002402650001102412650001202423650001302435650001602448650002602464650001502490651001302505651001102518653002002529653002302549653002402572653002602596700002402622700002202646700002902668700002302697773010702720852000902827856008502836930003302921946001102954655001202965IND4396209820221122083940.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439620982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-007-9152-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGermer, Sonja 10aSeasonal and within-event dynamics of rainfall and throughfall chemistry in an open tropical rainforest in Rondônia, Brazil  ap. 155-174.  aProlonged dry periods, and increasingly the generation of smoke and dust in partially-deforested regions, can influence the chemistry of rainfall and throughfall in moist tropical forests. We investigated rainfall and throughfall chemistry in a palm-rich open tropical rainforest in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon state of Rondônia, where precipitation averages 2300 mm year-¹ with a marked seasonal pattern, and where the fragmentation of remaining forest is severe. Covering the transition from dry to wet season (TDWS) and the wet season (WS) of 2004-2005, we sampled 42 rainfall events on event basis as well as 35 events on a within-event basis, and measured concentrations of DOC, Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, NH ₄ ⁺ , Cl-, SO ₄ ²- , NO ₃ - and pH in rainfall and throughfall. We found strong evidence of both seasonal and within-event solute rainfall concentration dynamics. Seasonal volume-weighted mean (VWMS) concentrations in rainfall of DOC, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, NH ₄ ⁺ , SO ₄ ²- and NO ₃ - were significantly higher in the TDWS than the WS, while VWMS concentrations in throughfall were significantly higher for all solutes except DOC. Patterns were generally similar within rain events, with solute concentrations declining sharply during the first few millimeters of rainfall. Rainfall and throughfall chemistry dynamics appeared to be strongly influenced by forest and pasture burning and a regional atmosphere rich in aerosols at the end of the dry season. These seasonal and within-event patterns of rainfall and throughfall chemistry were stronger than those recorded in central Amazônia, where the dry season is less pronounced and where regional deforestation is less severe. Fragmentation and fire in Rondônia now appear to be altering the patterns in which solutes are delivered to remaining moist tropical forests. 3aaerosols 3aammonium compounds 3abiogeochemistry 3aburning 3acalcium 3achlorides 3adeforestation 3adry season 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3apH 3apastures 3apotassium 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3asmoke 3asodium 3asolutes 3asulfates 3athroughfall 3atropical rain forests 3awet season 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aNutrient fluxes 0aRainfall chemistry 0aSequential sampling 0aThroughfall chemistry1 aNeill, Christopher 1 aKrusche, Alex V. 1 aNeto, Sergio C.

VP3 was expressed as a fusion protein either with glutathione S-transferase or with a six-histidine tag. Both recombinant proteins reacted specifically with anti-VP3 monoclonal antibodies and with serum from vaccinated chickens by Western blot and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, when testing sera from birds of different ages and genetic backgrounds, high non-specific reactions were evident and false positives were observed, especially in older birds. This suggests that VP3 is poorly immunogenic during infection and low antibody concentrations are masked by non-specific reactions. Thus, VP3 is not suitable for use as antigen in ELISAs. 3aChicken anemia virus 3aviral proteins 3aserodiagnosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3arecombinant antigens 3aWestern blotting1 aLew, A.M.1 aTannock, G.A.0 tAvian pathology.g2001 Dec., v. 30, no. 6 p.613-619x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501200921073Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03092naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008200164300001600246520146800262650002001730650002701750650002201777650002801799650001901827650001201846650001001858650001401868650002101882650001101903650001401914650002101928650001701949650002401966650001301990650003802003650001002041650001902051650001602070651001402086653001502100653001502115700002102130700003402151700001902185700001802204700001902222700001902241773012802260852000902388856008502397930003302482946001102515655001202526IND4411352920221122065953.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441135292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-008-9299-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobato, M.

In this research, the effect of Phi applied to potato plants on severity of three important potato diseases in Argentina was assessed. Seed tubers and foliage of potato cvs Shepody and Kennebec were treated with Phi to assess effects on resistance against Phytophthora infestans, Fusarium solani and Rhizoctonia solani. Protection resulting from Phi treatment in seed tubers was high against P. infestans, intermediate against F. solani, and low against R. solani. In addition, seed tubers treated with calcium or potassium phosphites (CaPhi and KPhi, respectively) at 1% of commercial product emerged earlier than untreated ones. When Phi were foliarly applied two or four times at different doses, high levels of protection against P. infestans were achieved in both cultivars. Higher protection was observed in Kennebec when CaPhi was applied, while in Shepody this was true for KPhi. Expression of β-1,3-glucanases was induced at different times after treatment but no correlation between β-1,3-glucanases expression and foliar protection level was found. On the other hand, Phi positive protection effects did not produce negative effects in plant growth. Leaves from CaPhi-treated plants showed a darker green colour than leaves from control plants; also an increase in Rubisco protein and a delay in crop senescence was observed. 3aFusarium solani 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3abeta-glucanase 3acalcium 3acolor 3acultivars 3adisease severity 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aphosphorous acid 3aplant growth 3apotassium phosphite 3apotatoes 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3asalts 3aseed treatment 3aseed tubers 3aArgentina 0aPhosphites 0aProtection1 aOlivieri, F.

Baseline height, weight, waist and hip girth, and 23-year follow-up mortality, data were available for 84 910 white men. Proportional hazard survival analysis was performed by 5-year age group for waist/hip ratio (WHR) and for body mass index (BMI) in prediction of time to death from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke. Relative risk of IHD fatality per standard deviation (s.d.) of WHR ranged from 1.11 to 1.17, the higher values appearing in younger age groups. Relative risk due to BMI was not significant in the group aged 16-20 years at time of discharge from service, but ranged from 1.22 to 1.25 per s.d. among the 21-30 year olds. WHR was predictive of cerebrovascular disease mortality among 16-25 year olds, carrying a relative risk of 1.24 to 1.35 per s.d. BMI was not predictive of cerebrovascular disease mortality in any age group. Multivariate models indicated that WHR and BMI were related to subsequent IHD independently of each other in most age groups. WHR and BMI both contribute to risk of premature IHD mortality and WHR to risk of cerebrovascular disease mortality in an initially relatively healthy population of young men, although the effects are not equivalent in all age groups. 3abody fat 3abody weight 3acardiovascular diseases 3aepidemiology 3amortality 3abody measurements 3amen 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histology 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Mass Index 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxmortality 2aCerebrovascular Disordersxmortality 2aCohort Studies 2aCoronary Diseasexmortality 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMilitary Personnel 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRetrospective Studies 2aVeterans 0aUnited States 0adistribution1 aPage, W.F.1 aHaskell, W.L.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g1992 June, v. 16, no. 6 p.417-423x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03221naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001800181245012800199300001400327500001500341520145700356650001301813650002601826650001601852650003701868650002701905650002101932650003101953650002301984650002702007650002502034650001202059650004002071650001302111650003102124650003202155650005002187650003302237650007102270651001402341651002902355653001202384700001902396700001802415773007102433852000902504856008502513930003302598945002502631946001102656655001202667IND4380399120221122052955.0060523e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438039912DNAL7 a164489372pmid7 a10.1080/030794505004656432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Based on available minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoint values for Brachyspira hyodysenteriae or other Gram-negative enteric veterinary pathogens, isolates of both species generally were susceptible to tiamulin, lincomycin, metronidazole and tetracycline. Although not classed as resistant, four isolates of B. intermedia had an elevated MIC range for tiamulin (1 to 4 mg/l), 11 isolates of B. intermedia and five of B. pilosicoli had an elevated MIC range for lincomycin (10 to 50 mg/l), one isolate of B. pilosicoli had an elevated MIC range for tetracycline (10 to 20 mg/l), and one isolate of B. intermedia and five of B. pilosicoli had an elevated MIC range for ampicillin (10 to 50 mg/l). A clear lack of susceptibility to tylosin (MIC >4 mg/l) was seen in 11 isolates each of B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli, and to ampicillin (MIC > 32 mg/l) in two isolates of B. pilosicoli. These data suggest that some resistance to common antimicrobials exists among intestinal spirochetes obtained from laying hens and supports the need of MIC data for clinical isolates before any treatment is considered. 3achickens 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aBrachyspira intermedia 3apoultry diseases 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3astrain differences 3aBrachyspira pilosicoli 3abacterial infections 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aChickens 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aSpirochaetalesxdrug effects 2aSpirochaetales Infectionsxdrug therapyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 3aAustralia 0aAustraliaxepidemiology. 0astrains1 aStephens, C.P.1 aOxberry, S.L.0 tAvian pathology.g2006 Feb., v. 35, no. 1 p.12-16x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794505004656433Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02850naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011600167300001600283520145500299650002201754650002401776650001101800650001301811650002001824650002201844650001501866650002701881650002201908650002101930651001801951651002001969651001101989653001602000653002002016700002202036700002402058700002102082700002102103773013002124852000902254856008502263930003302348946001102381655001202392IND4412942620221122052854.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441294262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-008-0648-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViricel, Amélia 10aInsights on common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) social organization from genetic analysis of a mass-stranded pod  ap. 173-185.  aCompared to terrestrial mammals, little is known of cetacean social systems as they are generally less accessible to behavioral investigations due to their aquatic environment. The present study investigates group structure of the pelagic common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, using genetic markers. Tissue samples from 52 individuals representing a recent live mass-stranding event were compared to 42 single strandings taken from presumably different groups. The mass-stranding event occurred in 2002 on the French coast of the English Channel, whereas the single strandings were collected between 1993 and 2003 along the western coast of France (Bay of Biscay and English Channel). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences indicated that genetic variability within the mass-stranded pod was similar to variability observed in single strandings. The mass-stranded group was composed of 41 different mitochondrial haplotypes or matrilines while the single strandings revealed 29 different haplotypes. Analysis of 11 microsatellite loci revealed that average relatedness of the mass-stranded pod was not different from average relatedness among all single strandings suggesting that individuals within the group had no closer kin relationships than animals taken from presumably different groups. These results do not support a matriarchal system and suggest that common dolphins constituting a pod are not necessarily genetically related. 3aDelphinus delphis 3aaquatic environment 3acoasts 3adolphins 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3asocial structure 3aBay of Biscay 3aEnglish Channel 3aFrance 0aRelatedness 0aSex segregation1 aStrand, Allan E. 1 aRosel, Patricia E. 1 aRidoux, Vincent 1 aGarcia, Pascale 0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2008 Dec., v. 63, no. 2 p.173-185dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-008-0648-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02986naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245008600171300001400257520164800271650001601919650002501935650002001960650001301980650001201993650001902005650001302024650001602037650003302053653002102086653002002107653001502127653002402142653002102166700004002187700002102227700001902248700002102267773011302288852000902401856008602410930003302496946001102529655001202540IND4391509820221122031945.0070522e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439150982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-007-9085-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRousseau, Véronique 14aThe life cycle of Phaeocystis: state of knowledge and presumptive role in ecology  ap. 29-47.  aDespite numerous investigations, the number and role of morphotypes involved in the life cycle of Phaeocystis species remain under debate. This is partly due to the application of different methodologies such as light, transmission, scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry on specific samples. This heterogeneity of approaches results in the incomplete morphometric description of the different cell types existing within one species according to relevant criteria and the indetermination of the ploidy level of each observed stage. We review here the different morphotypes observed within each of the six Phaeocystis species recognized up to now. Four different cell types have been observed. In common to all six species is the occurrence of a scaly flagellate producing star-forming filaments (all species except P. jahnii) or not (P. globosa and P. jahnii). In three colony-forming species, P. globosa, P. pouchetii and P. antarctica, three morphotypes are observed: a flagellate with scales and filaments, a colonial cell, and a flagellate devoid of scales and filaments. In the non-colony-forming species, P. scrobiculata and P. cordata, only flagellates with scales and filaments have been observed. While suspected in P. pouchetii and P. antarctica, a haploid-diploid life cycle has only been evidenced for P. globosa. The two main prominent features of this cycle are that sexuality is prevalent in colony bloom formation and termination and that two types of vegetative reproduction exist. The ecological relevance of alternating haploid and diploid stages is not clearly apparent on the basis of existing ecological studies. 3aPhaeocystis 3aasexual reproduction 3abiogeochemistry 3adiploidy 3aecology 3aflow cytometry 3ahaploidy 3amorphometry 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aEcological niche 0aHaploid-diploid 0aMorphotype 0aPhaeocystis species 0aSexual processes1 aChrétiennot-Dinet, Marie-Josèphe.1 aJacobsen, Anita 1 aVerity, Peter 1 aWhipple, Stuart 0 tBiogeochemistry.g2007 Mar., v. 83, no. 1-3 p.29-47dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9085-33Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02285naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011700164300001800281520102000299650001301319650001101332650001301343650001301356650001401369650002301383650001501406650001301421650001901434650001601453653002001469653000701489653002401496700002001520700001901540700001801559700001501577773012101592852000901713856008501722930003301807946001101840655001201851IND4411346220221122010522.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441134622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-008-9240-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurjeet Singh.10aTransformation Technique for Water Table Estimation in a 2-D Aquifer with Inclined Base Subjected to Variable ET  ap. 1521-1530.  aAn analytical solution for two-dimensional water table variation in an aquifer basin with inclined impermeable base has been proposed incorporating the effect of depth-dependent evapotranspiration (ET) from land surface. The proposed analytical solution has been obtained by devising a sound mathematical transformation, which transforms a complex partial differential equation into the simplest form. The results obtained from the proposed solution are in good agreement with the already existing mathematical solutions. The results of the proposed solution have been illustrated to study the variation of water table in the 2-D aquifer. Since the water table profiles are obtained lower by consideration of ET, the solution will result in wider drain spacing and, thus, economy in the drainage design. The proposed analytical solution can be used as an important tool for reliable prediction of water table variation in the salinity affected croplands of arid and semi-arid regions where the ET rate is very high. 3aaquifers 3abasins 3acropland 3adrainage 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3aprediction 3asalinity 3asemiarid zones 3awater table 0aSloping aquifer 0aET 0aAnalytical solution1 aJaiswal, C.

  1 aJeffery, N.10aOrganization of the Mycoplasma synoviae WVU 1853T vlhA gene locus  ap. 53-57.  a2019-12-04  aMycoplasma synoviae causes respiratory disease and synovitis in poultry. It has two major membrane antigens of approximately 45 to 50 kDa, MSPA and MSPB. Both MSPA and MSPB are encoded by a single gene, vlhA (variable lipoprotein and haemagglutinin), possibly with a post-translational cleavage generating the two proteins. The vlhA gene belongs to a large multigene family, but only one vlhA gene is expressed in any single cell; the other vlhA genes/fragments are transcriptionally silent. In order to characterize the vlhA gene locus, DNA fragments were cloned from three different M. synoviae WVU 1853T genomic DNA libraries and their nucleotide sequences were fully or partially determined. Analysis of the resultant nucleotide sequences identified a transcriptional termination signal for the expressed vlhA gene, determined the genes located downstream of the expressed vlhA gene and revealed that vlhA pseudogenes were arranged as tandem repeats upstream (843 base pairs) of the expressed vlhA gene. In order to determine whether vlhA was expressed as a monocistronic or polycistronic message, RNA from two M. synoviae clones expressing truncated or full-length versions of the vlhA gene product were purified and examined by northern blotting. Messages corresponding to the full length of the vlhA gene (approximately 2.4 kb) were detected in both clones, suggesting that truncation of the vlhA gene product was probably post-transcriptional. These studies have revealed the organization of the M. synoviae vlhA gene locus and established that the vlhA gene transcript is monocistronic. 3atranscription factors 3atranslation (genetics) 3aprotein synthesis 3aloci 3atandem repeat sequences 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3abacterial antigens 3amembrane proteins 3amultigene family 3aMycoplasma synoviae 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aChromosomes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aLectinsxgenetics 2aMycoplasma synoviaexgenetics 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aPseudogenesxgenetics 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aBrowning, G.F.1 aNoormohammadi, A.H.0 tAvian pathology.g2006 Feb., v. 35, no. 1 p.53-57x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794505004657753Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01259naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245008800131300001400219520031200233650003100545650001900576650002000595650002200615650001800637650000800655650002400663650001700687653001400704700001600718700001900734773009500753852000900848939003300857945000800890946001100898655001200909991615365010742620221121233550.0920805e199202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920025312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuah, S.Y.10aExacerbation of hepatic encephalopathy by branched-chain amino acids--a case report  ap. 53-56.  aA 49-year-old alcoholic developed hepatic encephalopathy following dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA).

The modelling of river processes involves numerous uncertainties, resulting in uncertain model outcomes. Knowledge of the type and magnitude of uncertainties is crucial for a meaningful interpretation of the model results and the usefulness of results in decision making processes. The aim of this study is to identify the sources of uncertainty that contribute most to the uncertainties in the model outcomes and quantify their contribution to the uncertainty in the model outcomes. Experts have been selected based on an objective Pedigree analysis. The selected experts are asked to quantify the most important uncertainties for two situations: (1) the computation of design water levels and (2) the computation of the hydraulic effect of a change in the river bed. For the computation of the design water level, the uncertainties are dominated by the sources that do not change between the calibration and the prediction. The experts state that the upstream discharge and the empirical roughness equation for the main channel have the largest influence on the uncertainty in the modeled water levels. For effect studies, the floodplain bathymetry, weir formulation and discretization of floodplain topography contribute most to the uncertainties in model outcomes. Finally, the contribution of the uncertainties to the model outcomes show that the uncertainties have a significant effect on the predicted water levels, especially under design conditions. 3adecision making 3aequations 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3afloodplains 3ahydrodynamics 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3apedigree 3aprediction 3arivers 3aroughness 3astream channels 3atopography 0aPedigree analysis 0aRiver modelling 0aHydraulic roughness 0aRiver Rhine1 aVan der Klis, Hanneke 1 aBooij, Martijn J. 1 aHulscher, Suzanne J.

In previous studies, the possibility of the involvement of pox viruses in the cause of DSCC was considered. In this work, a sensitive and specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was developed that could amplify a 419 base pair DNA fragment of fowlpox virus with a detection limit of less than one infectious unit. Fowlpox virus DNA was always detected in skin samples with fowlpox lesions while it was not detected in samples of unrelated diseases such as cowpox, Marek's disease or infectious laryngotracheitis. Some macroscopically normal skin samples from vaccinated and non-vaccinated birds also produced PCR-positive results, corroborating previous studies on the possibility that a latent or chronic form of fowlpox occurs. Fowlpox virus DNA was consistently detected from DSCC skin lesions, and this finding is discussed. 3abroiler chickens 3aAvipoxvirus 3acarcinoma 3ameat carcasses 3aDNA 3askin lesions 3adetection 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aAvipoxvirusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aChick Embryo 2aChickens 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Viralxisolation & purification 2aNucleic Acid Amplification Techniquesxveterinary 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathologyxvirology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSkin Neoplasmsxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms1 aCanal, C.W.1 aSalle, C.T.P.1 aMoraes, H.L.S.1 aRocha, S.L.S.1 aPereira, R.A.1 aSilva, A.B. da.0 tAvian pathology.g2002 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.241-246x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794502201365583Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02257naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245006100149300001600210500002300226500001500249520100400264650002501268650001801293650002301311650001701334650001501351650001501366650001701381650001901398650001201417650005401429650001101483650001101494650000901505650003201514653002401546653002301570653001601593773010201609852001301711939003301724945000801757946001301765852000901778655001201787991615361410742620221121195549.0920730e199207  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920024732DNAL7 a16246542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoufs, J.B.10aReview of L-tryptophan and eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome  ap. 844-850.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aThe ingestion of L-tryptophan (LT)-containing products has recently been associated with a newly diagnosed disorder known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS). This article reviews the pertinent research concerning the association between LT-containing products and EMS, including (a) the incidence and clinical course of EMS; (b) characteristics (eg, age and sex) of patients with EMS; (c) LT intakes (eg, dose, duration of intake) associated with EMS; (d) tracing of implicated LT-containing products to one raw material manufacturer, (e) theories related to the association, for example, the contamination theory; and (f) regulatory issues surrounding LT-containing products. The importance of this information to the dietitian is twofold. First, because LT is an essential amino acid, questions concerning LT-containing products and EMS are often directed to dietitians. Second, dietitians should be aware of the association to help facilitate the identification and care of patients with EMS. 3alaws and regulations 3adose response 3afood contamination 3apatient care 3atryptophan 3adietitians 3aeosinophilia 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aEosinophilia-Myalgia Syndromexchemically induced 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aTryptophanxadverse effects 0aclinical experience 0aliterature reviews 0afood safety0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 July, v. 92, no. 7 p.844-850x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01588naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115245009300128300001600221520066400237650002100901650002000922650001500942650001600957650001000973650001000983650002000993653001401013700001801027700001601045700001601061773009801077852000901175939003301184945000801217946001301225655001201238991615361240742620221121195641.0920918e199205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMira, M.10aChanges in creatinine clearance during treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa  ap. 403-406.  aThe improvement in renal clearance of creatinine in anorexia nervosa patients during treatment has been attributed to the increase in body weight. The body weight and creatinine clearance of 12 anorexia nervosa and 10 bulimia nervosa patients were studied during inpatient treatment. The anorexia nervosa patients gained an average of 4.5 kg, while the body weight of the bulimia nervosa patients was unchanged. Both groups showed a similar increase in weight-corrected creatinine clearance. The increase in creatinine clearance of eating disorder patients is associated with the cessation of the abnormal weight-controlling behaviors rather than weight gain. 3aeating disorders 3arenal clearance 3acreatinine 3abody weight 3aurine 3awomen 3abody mass index 0atreatment1 aStewart, P.M.1 aRussell, J.1 aAbraham, S.0 tInternational journal of eating disorders.g1992 May, v. 11, no. 4 p.403-406x0276-34787nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02304naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245009300177300001400270520084300284650001201127650001701139650003001156650002601186650001401212650002501226650002201251650003801273650001201311650005501323650002801378650003001406650002501436650003901461650003201500650002401532653001501556700001601571700001301587773007101600852000901671856008501680930003301765945001301798946001101811655001201822IND2328565820221121133913.0020816e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232856582DNAL7 a124257962pmid7 a10.1080/030794501201066602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaue, R.12aA fiber gene-based polymerase chain reaction for specific detection of pigeon adenovirus  ap. 95-99.  aA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed to detect a recently described pigeon adenovirus (PiAV). Primers located in the fiber gene of PiAV amplified a PCR fragment solely from PiAV DNA, whereas all 12 serotypes of fowl adenoviruses (FAV1 to FAV12), some of them able to infect pigeons, did not react. A PCR fragment of 967 base pairs was amplified from three different isolates serologically typed as PiAV and from some pigeon liver samples showing morphological and histological signs of an adenovirus infection. Those samples did not react with a published primer pair (H3/H4) able to detect FAV, demonstrating the specificity of both PCRs to react exclusively with the respective pathogen, PiAV or FAV. The presented PCR is a suitable diagnostic tool to gain further insight into the epidemiology of PiAV infections in pigeons. 3apigeons 3aAdenoviridae 3apolymerase chain reaction 3adiagnostic techniques 3adetection 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 2aAdenoviridae Infectionsxvirology 2aAnimals 2aAviadenovirusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBird Diseasesxvirology 2aCapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aColumbidaexvirology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 0aevaluation1 aHafez, H.M.1 aHess, M.0 tAvian pathology.g2002 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.95-99x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501201066603Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02447naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011400164300001600278500002800294520133100322650001701653653001201670653002601682653002601708700001901734700001701753700001701770700002501787700002101812700002101833773013801854852000901992856008502001946001102086655001202097IND4415669420221121133932.0090130s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441566942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00384-008-0609-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarid, Mohamed10aComparative study between botulinum toxin injection and partial division of puborectalis for treating anismus  ap. 327-334.  aPublisher supplied data  aObjectives The objective of this study was to compare the results of partial division of puborectalis (PDPR) versus local botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injection in treating patients with anismus. Patients and methods This prospective randomized study included 30 male patients suffering from anismus. Diagnosis was made by clinical examination, barium enema, colonoscopy, colonic transit time, anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion test, defecography, and electromyography. Patients were randomized into: group I which included 15 patients who were injected with BTX-A and group II which included 15 patients who underwent bilateral PDPR. Follow-up was conducted for about 1 year. Improvement was considered when patients returned to their normal habits. Results BTX-A injection achieved initial success in 13 patients (86.7%). However, long-term success persisted only in six patients (40%). This was in contrast to PDPR which achieved initial success in all patients (100%) with a long-term success in ten patients (66.6%). Recurrence was observed in seven patients (53.8%) and five patients (33.4%) following BTX-A injection and PDPR, respectively. Minor degrees of incontinence were confronted in two patients (13.3%) following PDPR. Conclusion BTX-A injection seems to be successful for temporary treatment of anismus. 3aconstipation 0aAnismus 0aPuborectalis syndrome 0aObstructed defecation1 aYoussef, Tamer1 aMahdy, Tarek1 aOmar, Waleed1 aMoneim, Hesham Abdul1 aEl_Nakeeb, Ayman1 aYoussef, Mohamed0 tInternational journal of colorectal disease.g2009 Mar., v. 24, no. 3 p.327-334dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0179-19587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00384-008-0609-73Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03449naa a2200649 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245011300151300001600264500002300280520163600303650003201939650002001971650001801991650002202009650001602031650001302047650000802060650001002068650001502078650001002093650002102103650001602124650001602140650001002156650001902166650001802185650002202203650001302225650002102238650001102259650001602270650001102286650000902297650001602306650003602322650003102358650007002389650003202459653002302491653001702514653002202531653002602553700001602579700001402595773010202609852001302711939003302724945000802757946001302765852000902778655001202787991615358720742620221121133946.0920730e199207  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920024702DNAL7 a16246512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffman, C.J.12aA nutrition survey of and recommendations for individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome who live in group homes  ap. 823-833.  aLiterature review.  aThe purpose of this study was to describe anthropometric data and identify diet-related problems of individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) who reside in group homes. A group home is a licensed foster care facility that provides 24-hour care for the developmentally disabled. Questionnaires were sent to dietitians (or the person responsible for nutrition care) of 25 group homes; responses from 18 homes were analyzed. The mean age of residents with PWS was 25 +/- 8.4 years and the mean height was 162.4 +/- 9.7 cm. The mean weight for 19- to 22-year-old men was 75.5 +/- 26.8 kg and that for women of the same age was 74.5 +/- 20 kg. The residents consumed a mean of 1,000 to 1,500 kcal/day. Most of the group homes (n = 16) locked their kitchens at night, and in 12 of the homes stealing and hoarding of food occurred. Pica behavior (eating of nonfoods) was reported in 7 homes. One third of all residents had success in weight loss and were on a maintenance diet, but a major problem was determination of a desirable weight goal. Our key recommendations for dietitians are weigh residents weekly; use the body mass index with prescribed zones for determination of weight goals; monitor change in circumference measurements; follow the guidelines of 7 to 8 kcal/cm of height for weight loss and 10 to 14 kcal/cm of height for weight maintenance; administer 1,000 kcal/day or more and encourage daily aerobic exercise; respect food preferences while adhering to dietary prescriptions; adhere to strict food control procedures; and use nutrition education methods and an interdisciplinary approach for behavior modification. 3aanthropometric measurements 3adietary surveys 3aeating habits 3abehavior problems 3abody weight 3achildren 3amen 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBehavior Therapy 2aBody Height 2aBody Weight 2aChild 2aDiet, Reducing 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aExercise 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aGroup Homes 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Sciencesxeducation 2aPatient Education as Topic 2aPrader-Willi Syndromexdiet therapyxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 0aliterature reviews 0afoster homes 0agroup interaction 0aprader-willi syndrome1 aAultman, D.1 aPipes, P.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 July, v. 92, no. 7 p.823-833x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245014100167300001600308520181100324650002002135650001102155650001902166650001602185650002602201650001602227650001802243650002202261650001202283650001002295650001902305650001602324650001702340650001802357650001102375650001402386650002102400650001602421650002302437650002402460650001102484650001402495650002302509650002102532650002102553650001602574650001502590651002602605653002202631653001302653653001802666773011302684852000902797856008502806930003302891946001102924655001202935IND4393986020221121100207.0070812e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439398602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-007-9118-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobziar, Leda N. 14aThe role of environmental factors and tree injuries in soil carbon respiration response to fire and fuels treatments in pine plantations  ap. 191-206.  aThe need to understand how forest management practices affect soil CO₂ exchange with the atmosphere (soil respiration) has increased with the recognition of a likely feedback effect of climate warming on soil respiration rates. Previous research addressing the mechanisms driving soil respiration has yielded inconsistent and/or conflicting results. This study looked to alternative above-ground forest characteristics to help explain spatial variability in soil respiration in a 30-year-old Sierra Nevada pine plantation. Fire hazard mitigation is one of the predominant management goals in these and other western US forests. Therefore, this analysis examined how fuels treatments, including shredding of understory vegetation (mastication), prescribed fire, and a combination thereof, affected soil respiration and its relationship to environmental factors and post-fire tree injuries. Multiple regression models indicated that mastication had no significant impact on soil respiration, but the roles of soil temperature and forest floor depth (O horizons) in the models increased after the treatment. Burning reduced soil respiration by ~14%, and increased its sensitivity to tree proximity and the exposure of bare mineral soil. Scorch height in burned stands was negatively correlated with soil respiration. Models incorporating only tree injury or tree proximity parameters explained between 63% and 91% of the variability in burned plantations. This work suggests that measures of above-ground forest features can increase understanding of management impacts on soil respiration, and the mechanisms by which these impacts occur. These results are especially applicable in Mediterranean climates, where moisture stress reduces the effectiveness of soil microclimate in explaining soil respiration. 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3aenvironmental factors 3afire hazard 3aforest litter 3aforest management 3aforests 3afuels 3aglobal warming 3amastication 3amicroclimate 3amineral soils 3amodels 3amountains 3aorganic horizons 3aplantations 3aprescribed burning 3aregression analysis 3ascorch 3ashredding 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3atree damage 3aunderstory 3aWestern United States 0aSoil CO₂ efflux 0aThinning 0aScorch height0 tBiogeochemistry.g2007 June, v. 84, no. 2 p.191-206dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9118-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02643naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245008500149300001600234520102700250650002801277650001601305650001601321650002301337650002001360650002101380650001501401650001001416650000801426650002701434650002001461650002001481650003301501650001001534650001601544650000901560650001101569650001101580650000901591650001601600650001601616651001601632651001601648653002101664653006801685700001801753700001601771700001501787700001901802700001601821700001901837773009701856852001301953939003301966945000801999946001302007852000902020655001202029991615358450742620221121100203.0920923e199209  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030422DNAL7 a15030662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurnand, B.10aSerum 25-hydroxyvitamin D: distribution and determinants in the Swiss population  ap. 537-542.  aThe serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was measured in a representative sample of the general adult population in Switzerland (n = 3276).

First, the suitable constituents of a W/O/W emulsion adjuvant were investigated with polyvalent vaccines using NDV, infectious bronchitis virus and Haemophilus paragallinarum. The W/O/W emulsion adjuvant, composed of the antigen in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), liquid paraffin, squalene, diglyceryl monooleate, polysorbate 80 and PBS in a 30:25:10:5:2:28 ratio, induced a good antibody response with less adverse local reactions. HN protein of NDV was expressed by an improved baculovirus expression vector, a hybrid nucleopolyhedrovirus (HyNPV) between Autographa californica NPV and Bombyx mori NPV, and was prepared from silkworm pupae infected with the recombinant baculovirus, HyNPV-HN. Then, the W/O/W emulsion vaccine containing HN protein was prepared using the aforementioned constituents. Chickens showed 100, 100 and 80% protection against challenge exposure to virulent NDV at 4 weeks after vaccination with W/O/W emulsion vaccines containing 30, 6 and 3% of HyHPV-HN-infected pupae, respectively. The vaccines containing HN protein did not induce adverse local reactions at the site of injection. The subunit vaccine for NDV containing HN protein expressed in the recombinant baculovirus-infected pupae, formulated as a W/O/W emulsion vaccine composed of the antigen in PBS, liquid paraffin, squalene, diglyceryl monooleate, polysorbate 80 and PBS in a 30:25:10:5:2:28 ratio, was therefore found to be safe and effective. 3achickens 3aadjuvants 3ahuman health and safety 3adisease prevention 3avaccines 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3avaccination 3aemulsions 3aglycoproteins 0aefficacy 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aIwakura, T.1 aIwaki, S.1 aMatsumoto, K.1 aTakeda, R.1 aIkeda, K.1 aShi, Z.1 aMori, H.0 tAvian pathology.g2001 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.509-516x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501200787073Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02741naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245012900150300001600279500001500295520102300310650002001333650000901353650001101362650001201373650002601385650002501411650000901436650002001445650002101465650002301486650004601509650002101555650001101576650001101587650004201598650004001640650004501680650004401725650003401769651001001803651001001813651001101823651001001834651001001844651001101854653000901865653002101874653002301895700001701918700001901935773009701954852001302051939003302064945000802097946001302105852000902118655001202127991615356210742620221121055731.0920923e199209  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030462DNAL7 a15030702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, S.P.10aEstimated mineral intakes of toddlers: predicted prevalence of inadequacy in village populations in Egypt, Kenya, and Mexico  ap. 565-572.  a2019-12-04  aIntakes of minerals and factors that might affect their bioavailability were estimated for 255 toddlers aged 18-30 mo living in villages in Egypt, Kenya, and Mexico. Mean intakes over 1 y were compared with international-requirement estimates by using a probability approach. The prevalence of iron intakes likely to be inadequate to prevent anemia was estimated as 35% in Egypt, 13% in Kenya, and 43% in Mexico. The prevalence of zinc intakes likely to be inadequate to meet basal requirements was estimated as 57% and 25% in Kenya and Mexico, respectively, but only 10% in Egypt, where the use of yeast-leavened breads was judged to have improved zinc availability. There was no suggestion that estimated copper or magnesium intakes were inadequate, but calcium intakes in Kenya and Egypt were well below recommended amounts. Studies of factors affecting mineral bioavailability in the diets of these countries' populations could suggest dietary changes that might improve effective mineral intake with minimal cost. 3anutrient intake 3azinc 3acopper 3acalcium 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutritional adequacy 3airon 3abioavailability 3adietary minerals 3apreschool children 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aChild, Preschool 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aIronxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aPhosphorusxadministration & dosage 2aSodium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aTrace Elementsxadministration & dosage 2aZincxadministration & dosage 3aEgypt 3aKenya 3aMexico 0aEgypt 0aKenya 0aMexico 0adiet 0anutrient sources 0amineral absorption1 aBeaton, G.H.1 aCalloway, D.H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Sept., v. 56, no. 3 p.565-572x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010000163300001600263500002800279520089800307650002501205653001801230653001301248653002201261700001101283700001901294700002001313700001601333773010301349852000901452856008501461946001301546655001201559IND4410188520221121055722.0080912s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441018852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10528-008-9168-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jianmin10aGenetic Structure of the Veined Rapa Whelk (Rapana venosa) Populations Along the Coast of China  ap. 539-548.  aPublisher supplied data  aThe veined rapa whelk (Rapana venosa) is a valuable and important fishery resource in China. In order to provide guidelines for fisheries management, the genetics population structure was assessed using 10 polymorphic allozyme loci from seven populations of R. venosa across the species' range on the Chinese coast. The mean allele richness ranged from 1.65 to 2.13, and the mean heterozygosity ranged from 0.086 to 0.149. Significant genetic differentiation was present, and the θ value was 0.016 across all populations. The nMDS plot of pairwise θ values, UPGMA dendrogram, and AMOVA analysis were in good agreement and identified three geographic subdivision groups. We propose that the genetic structure may be due to larval dispersal barriers and localized adaptation or a combination thereof. The implications of these results for the management of R. venosa populations are discussed. 3afisheries management 0aRapana venosa 0aAllozyme 0aGenetic structure1 aLi, Qi1 aKong, Lingfeng1 aZheng, Xiaodong1 aWang, Rucai0 tBiochemical genetics.g2008 Oct., v. 46, no. 9-10 p.539-548dBoston : Springer USx0006-29287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-008-9168-43Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01838naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001900193245004900212300001300261520058000274650001400854650001200868650002200880650001200902650003800914650003700952650002700989650001101016650001901027650003501046650003101081653002301112700001701135773013101152852000901283856009201292930003301384946001101417655001201428IND4413320720221121040053.0081205e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441332072DNAL7 a190768242pmid7 aPMC26656732pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03834.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErcolini, A.M.14aThe role of infections in autoimmune disease  ap. 1-15.  aAutoimmunity occurs when the immune system recognizes and attacks host tissue.

Chickens and guinea fowl, 30 each on the same premises, were not affected. Plastic tubes containing diphacinone and zinc phosphide were used on the premises to control ground squirrels. Most of the six dead peafowl, which ranged in age from 6 months to 4 years, had an accumulation of serosanguinous fluid in the abdominal cavity, semi-clotted blood over the liver lobes, increased pericardial fluid, and enlarged and pale kidneys. Pellets of diphacinone and zinc phosphide were found in the crop and gizzard contents from most of the birds. Microscopically, most of the birds had mild to moderate centrolobular degeneration of hepatocytes and multifocal degeneration of myofibres in the heart with infiltration by a few mononuclear cells. Acute nephrosis and mucosal oedema in the oesophagus and crop were also observed. Toxicological analysis of the crop and gizzard contents revealed the presence of diphacinone and phosphine gas, and analysis of the crop contents from two birds for heavy metals revealed zinc levels of up to 6600 parts/10(6). It was suspected that only the peafowl and not the chickens and guinea fowl were affected because peafowl, with their longer necks, were able to reach into the plastic tubes and eat the pellets. 3azinc phosphide 3aflocks 3apoisoning 3amortality 3ahistopathology 3acase studies 3apeafowl 3adiphacinone1 aGaley, F.0 tAvian pathology.g2001 Dec., v. 30, no. 6 p.599-603x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501200920803Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02061naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245005600178300001600234520077900250650001201029650001701041650002601058650002301084650001901107650002401126650003001150650001901180650003101199650002001230653002801250700001901278700001701297700001601314700001601330700001601346700001701362773007301379852000901452856008501461930003301546945001301579946001101592655001201603IND2327666820221121040300.0020621e200112  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232766682DNAL7 a191849542pmid7 a10.1080/030794501200920992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoike, D.12aA diagnostic study on columbid circovirus infection  ap. 605-611.  aA systematic study was performed to examine the frequency of columbid circovirus (CoCV) infection in diseased young pigeons submitted for necropsy and its relevance to pigeon health.

Histopathological examination allowed a clear diagnosis in only 42 pigeons. Therefore, a polymerase chain reaction assay and an in situ hybridization test were developed as additional diagnostic tools.

Irradiation can provide good tasting, wholesome food with fresh-like quality and nutritional value at costs competitive with more traditional processing methods. Products can be irradiated up to 1 Mrad yet remain wholesome. WHO has recommended approval of food irradiation processing and the FDA has opened a dialogue asking for comments regarding possible regulatory guidelines and limits of its use. Food irradiation is considered a cool process causing only a slight temperature rise in the food during preservation processing. This is a flexible process because a wide variety of foods can be irradiated. Radiation pastuerization and sterilization are explained, a glossary of terms is given, and other appplications of radiation preservation of foods are presented. The advantages of irradiation are discussed as are the methods used to consider wholesomeness, testing for safety, and regulation of the irradiation process.

In the experiment a particle's path through the slits is determined by measuring the Coulomb field that it produces at large distances; under these conditions the interference pattern must be suppressed. The key is that, as the particle's trajectory is bent in diffraction by the slits, it must radiate and the radiation must carry away phase information. Thus, the radiation field must be a quantized dynamical degree of freedom. However, if one similarly tries to determine the path of a massive particle through an inferometer by measuring the Newtonian gravitational potential the particle produces, the interference pattern would have to be finer than the Planck length and thus indiscernible. Unlike for the electromagnetic field, Bohr's argument does not imply that the gravitational field must be quantized.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectromagnetic field 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantum mechanics1 aOzawa, Tomoki0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 3, v. 106, no. 9 p.3035-3040dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08132391063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02277naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005800128300001600186500002300202520137000225650001901595650001701614650001701631650001501648650001901663650002501682650002901707653002301736653001701759653001701776773009301793852000901886939003301895946001101928655001201939IND9205504420221121033803.0920903e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920550442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, N.D.G.12aA multidisciplinary approach to stored-grain research  ap. 127-137.  aLiterature review.  aThe management of stored grains and oilseeds is a complex process. Grain bulks form distinct ecosystems with dormant seeds as "producers" and communities of insects, mites, microflora, and occasionally, rodents or birds interacting in a unique environment. An effective interaction among many scientific disciplines is needed for effective grain management. Biologists, such as entomologists, acarologists, mycologists, biochemists, toxicologists, geneticists, ecologists, and mycotoxicologists, interact with physical scientists such as agricultural engineers, computer modellers, and food scientists, as well as economists and statisticians. A critical factor that encourages multidisciplinary research is the potential manipulation of the storage environment to control or prevent pest outbreaks, a method that cannot be used on growing crops. Some examples of practical studies to solve storage problems with expertise from many different perspectives are discussed. The development of computer "expert systems" to integrate biological and physical models and direct areas of research will stimulate further multidisciplinary research. Although the grain-storage specialist will have limited knowledge of the relevant disciplines outside his or her own, it is important to have a good grasp of the whole system and to plan and execute research as a team effort. 3ainsect control 3ainsect traps 3ainsecticides 3aecosystems 3aexpert systems 3apostharvest diseases 3agrain storage facilities 0aliterature reviews 0ainteractions 0abulk storage0 tJournal of stored products research.g1992 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.127-137x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02384naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245011200205300001800317506007600335520096100411506003701372650001301409650001101422650001801433650001101451650001501462650002001477650001901497650001901516700002501535700001901560700001901579700002201598700002001620773017201640852000901812856008301821930003301904946001301937655001201950IND4417345420221207134038.0090306e20090303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441734542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08103181052doi7 aPMC26512982pmcid7 a192042902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, Sarah R.14aThe core trisaccharide of an N-linked glycoprotein intrinsically accelerates folding and enhances stability  ap. 3131-3136.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe folding energetics of the mono-N-glycosylated adhesion domain of the human immune cell receptor cluster of differentiation 2 (hCD2ad) were studied systematically to understand the influence of the N-glycan on the folding energy landscape. Fully elaborated N-glycan structures accelerate folding by 4-fold and stabilize the β-sandwich structure by 3.1 kcal/mol, relative to the nonglycosylated protein. The N-glycan's first saccharide unit accounts for the entire acceleration of folding and for 2/3 of the native state stabilization. The remaining third of the stabilization is derived from the next 2 saccharide units. Thus, the conserved N-linked triose core, ManGlcNAc₂, improves both the kinetics and the thermodynamics of protein folding. The native state stabilization and decreased activation barrier for folding conferred by N-glycosylation provide a powerful and potentially general mechanism for enhancing folding in the secretory pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3aenergy 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aprotein folding 3athermodynamics 3atrisaccharides1 aCulyba, Elizabeth K.1 aHsu, Tsui-Ling1 aWong, Chi-Huey1 aKelly, Jeffery W.1 aPowers, Evan T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 3, v. 106, no. 9 p.3131-3136dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08103181053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02179naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006700127300001600194500001500210520122900225650001601454650002901470650002201499650001801521650001701539650001901556650001801575650002401593651001201617651001101629700001601640700001501656773009301671852000901764939003301773946001101806655001201817IND9205504520221121012350.0920903e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920550452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawamoto, H.10aComputer simulation modelling for stored-grain pest management  ap. 139-145.  a2019-12-04  aSimulation models are used to solve various problems in stored-grain management. Temperature and moisture content of stored grain are simulated to evaluate the efficacy of ambient air ventilation and to estimate the maximum safe storage period of grain. Population dynamics and bioenergetics of stored-grain insects and mites are simulated to estimate the risk of pest outbreaks. Degradation of pesticide is simulated to evaluate its efficacy. These individual simulation models will be organized into a granary-ecosystem model to simulate the dynamics of the ecosystem. Simulation models can be used as parts of an expert system to optimize granary management. A regional model is being developed to predict pest infestations in farm granaries on the Canadian prairies to help local extension personnel warn farmers of potential infestations, and recommend intensive monitoring of their grain and proper management actions. The regional model would use the granary-ecosystem model along with regional estimations of initial storage conditions based on meteorological and other databases. A method to estimate the temperature and moisture content of freshly harvested grain from a meteorological database is being developed. 3atemperature 3agrain storage facilities 3asimulation models 3awater content 3amite control 3ainsect control 3astorage pests 3apopulation dynamics 3aOntario 0aCanada1 aSinha, R.N.1 aMuir, W.E.0 tJournal of stored products research.g1992 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.139-145x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03039naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003300145245016400178300001800342520155400360650001901914650001101933650001201944650001901956650001801975650001201993650001202005650002602017650002502043650002602068650001402094650001102108650001102119650001102130650001202141650002502153651001002178653000802188653002202196653001702218700002002235700001902255773013302274852000902407856008502416930003302501946001102534655001202545IND4444083720221120234102.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444408372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-010-0399-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-García, Encarna 10aEnvironmental influences on post-harvest natural regeneration of Pinus pinaster Ait. in Mediterranean forest stands submitted to the seed-tree selection method  ap. 1119-1128.  aResearch on natural regeneration is crucial for the development of sustainable forestry practices, in light of the global climate changes taking place. In this study, 151 plots were sampled in six Pinus pinaster stands that were naturally regenerated by the seed-tree method in Mediterranean forests in central Spain. The objectives of the survey were to study the suitability of different forest stands designated for natural regeneration as well as to analyse seedling establishment and the relationship between regeneration and different site factors. Analysis of variance and multivariate analysis with canonical ordination techniques were employed. Full and partial redundancy analyses on a correlation matrix were used to carry out a direct gradient analysis of regeneration density as a function of site factors. Nearly all stands presented seedling densities over 2,000 seedlings ha⁻¹ and were thus found to be suitable for natural regeneration of Pinus pinaster by the seed-tree selection method. Significant variables that best explained total seedling and viable seedling density were spring and autumn precipitation of the year prior to establishment, spring and summer precipitation of the year of establishment and percentage cover of litter. There were no signs of competition between shrubs and seedlings, but a negative significant correlation with grass cover was observed. Pinus pinaster natural regeneration was successful with the seed-tree method, although it appeared to be highly dependent on climate and stand conditions. 3aPinus pinaster 3aautumn 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforest stands 3aforests 3agrasses 3amultivariate analysis 3anatural regeneration 3aordination techniques 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3aspring 3asummer 3asurveys 3asustainable forestry 3aSpain 0aRDA 0aSeedling dynamics 0aSite factors1 aJuez, Libertad 1 aBravo, Felipe 0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2010 Nov., v. 129, no. 6 p.1119-1128dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-010-0399-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03813naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245017600183300001600359500001500375520186300390650001302253650002802266650001602294650002402310650001002334650001202344650002602356650002302382650001902405650001602424650001202440650001402452650002602466650001002492650001202502650001302514650003902527650001002566650002102576650006402597650005402661650003502715650002402750650001002774650001202784650001402796653002402810653001502834653001202849653001502861653001202876700002202888700001702910773007302927852000903000856008503009930003303094945001303127946001103140655001203151IND2329689520221120222814.0021113e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232968952DNAL7 a123963642pmid7 a10.1080/030794501201186942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhairwa, A.P.10aSerum resistance of Pasteurella multocida in avian and porcine sera, and comparative virulence investigations of selected serum-sensitive and resistant strains in chickens  ap. 183-191.  a2019-12-04  aGrowth in serum of Pasteurella multocida and related species in chicken, turkey, duck and pig sera were compared, and selected serum-resistant and serum-sensitive strains were inoculated into 18-week-old layers. Eighty-seven field strains of Pasteurella spp. and nine reference strains representing different clones defined by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) profiles were used in the study. Serum activity was measured by changes in the optical density (OD) of the serum after inoculation and incubation at 41 degrees C for chicken, turkey and duck serum and 39 degrees C for pig serum. Serum activity was measured by comparison with previously determined serum-resistant (P-1059) and serum-sensitive (CU vaccine) strains, and classified into highly serum-resistant, moderately serum-resistant and serum-sensitive. Strains of the same REA type were found to have identical growth curves and the same maximum OD values when tested in serum from the same host species. Turkey serum was shown to be less inhibitory to a wide range of P. multocida strains than chicken, duck and pig sera. Serum-resistant strains were demonstrated among avian as well as mammalian strains. Among the avian strains, the proportion of serum-resistant strains was higher in outbreak strains than in strains from apparently healthy carriers. Removal of the capsule from selected strains by hyaluronidase treatment failed to change the serum activity. The most severe lesions in experimentally infected chickens were produced by a serum-resistant strain; however, lesions were also found in chickens infected by serum-sensitive strains, indicating the involvement of multiple factors in the virulence of P. multocida. Further investigations on serum resistance are indicated in order to relate other host and bacterial factors responsible for the development of fowl cholera. 3achickens 3ainterspecific variation 3ablood serum 3arestriction mapping 3aducks 3aturkeys 3abiological resistance 3astrain differences 3acultured cells 3avaccination 3adensity 3avirulence 3aPasteurella multocida 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDisease Susceptibilityxveterinary 2aDucks 2aImmunity, Innate 2aPasteurella Infectionsxbloodxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aPasteurella multocidaxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aPoultry Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwine 2aTurkeys 2aVirulence 0aspecies differences 0aresistance 0alesions 0ainhibition 0astrains1 aChristensen, J.P.1 aBisgaard, M.0 tAvian pathology.g2002 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.183-191x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501201186943Available from publisher's Web site  a20030101b20030107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04203naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011900182300001400301500001500315520204100330650002102371650002602392650002602418650004202444650002402486650001702510650001302527650002302540650001302563650001502576650001802591650001602609650002002625650005702645650001202702650003202714650003002746650002702776650002702803650003902830650006302869650001102932650008002943650002703023650004603050650002503096650002403121650000903145650005003154653001103204653001303215653001203228700001803240700001703258700002003275773007103295852000903366856008503375930003303460945001303493946001103506655001203517IND2328564320221120200835.0020816e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232856432DNAL7 a124257902pmid7 a10.1080/030794501201066062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteentjes, A.10aMolecular epidemiology of unilateral amyloid arthropathy in broiler breeders associated with Enterococcus faecalis  ap. 31-39.  a2019-12-04  aAlthough symmetrical polyarticular amyloidosis has been described extensively in brown layers, spontaneous unilateral amyloid arthropathy has not been described previously in chickens. Birds from nine flocks of broiler parent stock (PS) had unilateral lameness associated with severe swelling of the left hock joint and the caudal aspect of the metatarsus. Gross pathology was restricted to the left hock joint and the left digital flexor tendons in almost all cases, suggesting an association with administration of Marek's disease vaccine. Amyloid deposits were found in 83% (25/30) of affected joints by histological examination of Congo red stained sections. Systemic amyloidosis, involving mainly the liver and spleen, was found in 59% (10/17) of birds. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from joints in 77% (23/30) of cases and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the joint in one case (1/30). Thirty-five E. faecalis isolates from joints, tendons and blood samples from birds in five affected PS flocks were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to separate genomic fragments after digestion with SmaI. All but one isolate had identical or closely related restriction endonuclease digestion (RED) patterns that were very similar to a known arthropathic and amyloidogenic E. faecalis isolate. A further 30 E. faecalis isolates from seven grandparent stock (GPS) flocks and two isolates from two unaffected PS flocks of the same genetic background were analysed by PFGE. Among these isolates, 11 originating from four GPS flocks had RED patterns identical to or closely related to the reference amyloid-inducing strain. Moreover, one E. faecalis isolate from amyloidotic joints of brown layers housed in California, USA was included in the analysis and appeared to be identical to the reference strain. This study showed that the E. faecalis isolates involved in these outbreaks of unilateral amyloid arthropathy in broiler breeders belonged to the same clone as that responsible for outbreaks in brown layers. 3abroiler chickens 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3apathological processes and conditions 3arestriction mapping 3aepidemiology 3avaccines 3astrain differences 3alameness 3aMardivirus 3aMarek disease 3aamyloidosis 3ajoints (animal) 2aAmyloidosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBone Marrowxmicrobiology 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aEgg Yolkxmicrobiology 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aEnterococcus faecalisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFemale 2aGram-Positive Bacterial Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aHindlimbxmicrobiology 2aJoint Diseasesxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aJointsxmicrobiology 2aLiverxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 0atarsus 0aswelling 0astrains1 aVeldman, K.T.1 aMevius, D.J.1 aLandman, W.J.M.0 tAvian pathology.g2002 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.31-39x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501201066063Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02648naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245007400186300001600260520094500276650002101221650005601242650003201298650005001330650001101380650003501391650002801426650003201454650001501486650004301501650004701544653001601591653001401607653001501621653001701636700001501653700001701668700001801685700001601703700001901719700001501738700001901753700001501772700001501787700001201802700003101814773010401845852000901949856009201958930003302050946001102083655001202094IND4415305820221120182317.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441530582DNAL7 a191339232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01916.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanca, M.10aUpdate on the evaluation of hypersensitivity reactions to betalactams  ap. 183-193.  aHypersensitivity reactions to betalactams (BLs) are classified as immediate or nonimmediate. The former usually appear within 1 h of drug-intake and are mediated by specific IgE-antibodies. Nonimmediate reactions are those occurring more than 1 h after drug-intake, and they can be T-cell mediated. The diagnostic evaluation of allergic reactions to BLs has changed over the last 5 years, for several reasons. Major and minor determinants are no longer commercially available for skin testing in many countries. In immediate allergic reactions, the sensitivity of skin testing and immunoassays is decreasing and new in vitro methods, such as the basophil activation test, are gaining importance for diagnosis. For nonimmediate reactions, skin testing appears to be less sensitive than previous results, although more studies need to be carried out in this direction. Nevertheless, the drug provocation test is still necessary for diagnosis. 3ahypersensitivity 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadverse effectsximmunology. 2aCross Reactionsximmunology 2aDrug Hypersensitivityxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Cellularximmunology 2aImmunoglobulin Exblood 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSkin Tests 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2abeta-Lactamsxadverse effectsximmunology. 0abetalactams 0adiagnosis 0aimmmediate 0anonimmediate1 aRomano, A.1 aTorres, M.J.1 aFernandez, J.1 aMayorga, C.1 aRodríguez, J.1 aDemoly, P.1 aBousquet, P.J.1 aMerk, H.F.1 aSanz, M.L.1 aOtt, H.1 aAtanasković-Marković, M.0 tAllergy.g2009 Feb., v. 64, no. 2 p.183-193dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01916.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090123b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03337naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245009700188300001600285520183700301650001302138650006102151650001202212650004802224650001102272650004102283650003502324650003902359650003802398650006602436653002002502653002202522653001202544653003602556653000902592653002002601700002102621773010902642852000902751856008502760930003302845946001302878655001202891IND4417760420221120182254.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441776042DNAL7 a192598292pmid7 a10.1007/s12035-009-8059-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillot, Thomas S. 10aProtective Actions of the Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2) in Monoaminergic Neurons  ap. 149-170.  aVesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) are responsible for the packaging of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine into synaptic vesicles. These proteins evolved from precursors in the major facilitator superfamily of transporters and are among the members of the toxin extruding antiporter family. While the primary function of VMATs is to sequester neurotransmitters within vesicles, they can also translocate toxicants away from cytosolic sites of action. In the case of dopamine, this dual role of VMAT2 is combined--dopamine is more readily oxidized in the cytosol where it can cause oxidative stress so packaging into vesicles serves two purposes: neurotransmission and neuroprotection. Furthermore, the deleterious effects of exogenous toxicants on dopamine neurons, such as MPTP, can be attenuated by VMAT2 activity. The active metabolite of MPTP can be kept within vesicles and prevented from disrupting mitochondrial function thereby sparing the dopamine neuron. The highly addictive drug methamphetamine is also neurotoxic to dopamine neurons by using dopamine itself to destroy the axon terminals. Methamphetamine interferes with vesicular sequestration and increases the production of dopamine, escalating the amount in the cytosol and leading to oxidative damage of terminal components. Vesicular transport seems to resist this process by sequestering much of the excess dopamine, which is illustrated by the enhanced methamphetamine neurotoxicity in VMAT2-deficient mice. It is increasingly evident that VMAT2 provides neuroprotection from both endogenous and exogenous toxicants and that while VMAT2 has been adapted by eukaryotes for synaptic transmission, it is derived from phylogenetically ancient proteins that originally evolved for the purpose of cellular protection. 3adopamine 2a1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridinexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiogenic Monoaminesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMPTP Poisoningxprevention & control 2aNeuronsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxmetabolism 2aSynaptic Transmissionxphysiology 2aVesicular Monoamine Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aNeuroprotection 0aNeurodegeneration 0aVesicle 0aVesicular monoamine transporter 0aMPTP 0aMethamphetamine1 aMiller, Gary W. 0 tMolecular neurobiology.g2009 Apr., v. 39, no. 2 p.149-170dNew York : Humana Press Incx1559-11827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12035-009-8059-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02719naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007700172300001800249520156000267650002601827650002201853650002201875650000701897650002301904650002201927653000901949653000901958653001601967653002201983653002702005700002102032700002202053773011302075852000902188856009202197930003302289946001102322655001202333IND4413087320221120182305.0081128e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441308732DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06747.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuchi, Zhiguang10aGCN4 enhances the stability of the pore domain of potassium channel KcsA  ap. 6228-6236.  aThe prokaryotic potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans, KcsA, is the first channel that has a known crystal structure of the transmembrane domain. The crystal structure of its soluble C-terminal domain, however, still remains elusive. Biophysical and electrophysiological studies have previously implicated the essential roles of the C-terminal domain in pH sensing and in vivo channel assembly. We examined this functional assignment by replacing the C-terminal domain with an artificial tetramerization domain, GCN4-LI. The expression of KcsA is completely abolished when its C-terminal domain is deleted, but it can be rescued by fusion with GCN4-LI. The secondary and quaternary structures of the hybrid channel are very similar to those of the wild-type channel according to CD and gel-filtration analyses. The thermostability of the hybrid channel at pH 8 is similar to that of the wild-type but is insensitive to pH changes. This supports the notion that the pH sensor of KcsA is located in the C-terminal domain. The result obtained in the present study is in agreement with the proposed functions of the C-terminal domain and we show that the channel assembly role of the C-terminal domain can be substituted with a non-native tetrameric motif. Because tetramerization domains are found in different families of potassium channels and their presence often enhances the expression of channels, replacement of the elusive C-terminal domains with a known tetrameric scaffold could potentially assist the expression of other potassium channels. 3aStreptomyces lividans 3acrystal structure 3aelectrophysiology 3apH 3apotassium channels 3athermal stability 0aGCN4 0aKcsA 0apore domain 0apotassium channel 0atetramerization domain1 aPau, Victor P.T.1 aYang, Daniel S.C.0 tFEBS journal.g2008 Dec., v. 275, no. 24 p.6228-6236dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06747.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081128b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03336naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245018800178300001400366520197400380592002802354650001902382650001902401650001702420650001202437650001102449650001102460650001502471650001302486650004402499650001902543650001102562650001302573650001702586650001602603650002102619650001202640650001202652700002302664700001802687773009202705856008402797852000902881655001202890IND60112961020221116202336.0141111e20120504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshu-Arrah, Benjamin A.10aPreparation and characterization of bonded silica hydride intermediate from triethoxysilane and dimethylmethoxysilane using supercritical carbon dioxide and dioxane as reaction medium  ap. 42-50.  aThis research examines bonding methodology, surface coverage and silanol conversion efficiencies on the preparation of silica hydride (SiH) intermediate from triethoxysilane (TES) and dimethylmethoxysilane (DMMS) using sc-CO₂ and dioxane as reaction solvent. Under sc-CO₂ reaction conditions (at temperature and pressure of 100°C, 414bar, respectively and 3h reaction time), the surface coverages of SiH (evaluated from %C obtained from elemental analysis) prepared with DMMS (3.39μmol/m²) and TES (4.46μmol/m²) increased by 2- and 4-folds respectively, when compared to reaction performed in dioxane (2.66μmol/m², SiH, DMMS and 0.69μmol/m², SiH, TES). The relatively higher surface coverage of SiH from TES over DMMS generated in sc-CO₂ is due to the inherent trialkoxy moiety of the TES that favours siloxane crosslinkage, forming polymeric surface attachments to yield a higher ligand density than the monomeric DMMS ligand. A conversion efficiency of ∼84.4% of SiH prepared from TES in sc-CO₂ estimated from ²⁹Si CP/MAS NMR analysis is comparable to TES silanization in dioxane or toluene. Moreover, silica hydride (SiH) conversion efficiency of ca. 42.4% achieved for the hydride intermediate prepared from DMMS in sc-CO₂ is more superior to 33.3% efficiency obtained in dioxane. The differences in conversion efficiencies is attributed to the ability of sc-CO₂ being able to access silica pores that are inaccessible in organic solvents. Bonded silica hydride from TES, DMMS prepared in sc-CO₂ were characterized using elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), BET surface area, Fourier transform infrared (FI-IR) and solid state NMR spectroscopy. Silica hydride technology/chemical functionalization of silica in sc-CO₂ avoid extended purification steps (i.e. filtration and washing), generation of waste organic solvent and the need of costly or energy consuming drying processing with improved modification efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achromatography 3acrosslinking 3adioxane 3adrying 3aenergy 3afiltration 3ahydrides 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic wastes 3asilica 3asolvents 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atoluene 3awashing1 aGlennon, Jeremy D.1 aAlbert, Klaus0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 May 4, v. 1236 p.42-50dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03792naa a2201069 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010200167520141600269592002801685650001801713650001201731650001901743650001501762650003001777653002301807653002801830653001301858653002101871653002501892653001901917653000701936653001001943653000801953653000701961653001001968653001001978653000801988653000701996653000802003653000802011653000802019653000802027653000702035653000802042653000702050653000902057653000802066653001102074653000802085653000802093653001002101653000802111653000802119653000902127653000802136653000702144653000802151653001002159653000802169653000902177653001002186653000902196653000802205653000902213653000902222653000702231653000702238653000802245653000702253653000702260653001002267653001102277653000802288653000802296653000902304653000802313653000802321653000802329653000802337653000902345653001102354653000802365653000902373653000802382653000802390653000802398653000902406700001902415700002002434700002202454700001802476700002002494773010202514856008502616852000902701655001202710IND60709530420221119024417.0201118e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.1011362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalti, Hanen12aA review of drought monitoring with big data: Issues, methods, challenges and research directions  aOver recent years, the frequency and intensity of droughts have increased and there has been a large drying trend over many parts of the world. Consequently, drought monitoring using big data analytic has gained an explosive interest. Droughts stand among the most damaging natural disasters. It threatens agricultural production, ecological environment, and socio-economic development. For this reason, early warning, accurate evaluation, and efficient prediction are an emergency especially for the nations that are the most menaced by this danger. There are numerous emerging studies addressing big data and its applications in drought monitoring. In fact, big data handle data heterogeneity which is an additive value for the prediction of drought, it offers a view of the different dimensions such as the spatial distribution, the temporal distribution and the severity detection of this phenomenon. Big data analytic and drought are introduced and reviewed in this paper. Besides, this review includes different studies, researches and applications of big data to drought monitoring. Challenges related to data life cycle such as data challenges, data processing challenges and data infrastructure management challenges are also discussed. Finally, we conclude that big data analytic can be beneficial in drought monitoring but there is a need for statistical and artificial intelligence-based approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata analysis 3adrought 3ainfrastructure 3aprediction 3asocioeconomic development 0aDrought monitoring 0aArtificial intelligence 0aBig data 0aMachine learning 0aStatistical approach 0aRemote sensing 0aAI 0aANFIS 0aANN 0aAR 0aARIMA 0aAVHRR 0aBRT 0aCI 0aCNN 0aCSM 0aDAI 0aDDI 0aDL 0aDSI 0aDT 0aENSO 0aETL 0aGADMFS 0aGAM 0aGIS 0aGRASS 0aIPO 0akNN 0aLSTM 0aMJO 0aML 0aMLP 0aMODIS 0aNAO 0aNDVI 0aNIDIS 0aNOAA 0aPDO 0aPDSI 0aPHDI 0aRD 0aRF 0aRNN 0aRS 0aRT 0aSADMS 0aSARIMA 0aSDI 0aSOI 0aSPEI 0aSPI 0aSST 0aSVD 0aSVM 0aSWSI 0aTAMSAT 0aTCI 0aTRMM 0aTWI 0aVCI 0aVHI 0aZIND1 aBen Abbes, Ali1 aMellouli, Nedra1 aFarah, Imed Riadh1 aSang, Yanfang1 aLamolle, Myriam0 tEcological informatics.g2020 Nov., v. 60 p.101136-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.1011363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245007000162300001800232500000900250520151600259592002801775650002001803650002301823650001501846650002701861650002601888650001801914650002101932650001101953650001301964650002501977650001702002650001302019650001402032650001102046650000902057650001902066650002402085650002002109650001102129650000902140651001802149700001602167700001602183700001802199700001602217700002202233700001302255700001702268773013502285856008002420852000902500655001202509IND60663389120221118063938.0191122e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066338912DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2011.03872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHgaza, V.

As information regarding fertilizer N use in yam is lacking, a field experiment was undertaken in 2006 and repeated in 2007 in central Côte d’Ivoire using ¹⁵N (¹⁵NH₄¹⁵NO₃) labeled fertilizers to monitor N uptake and fertilizer use efficiency in D. alata. The ¹⁵N-labeled fertilizer was added in two splits (at 90 and 130 d after planting) for a target tuber yield of 40 Mg fresh tuber ha⁻¹. The application of mineral fertilizers increased total biomass production and tuber yield as well as N uptake from native soil organic matter. The recovery of ¹⁵N-labeled fertilizer applied at 90 and 130 d after planting was not significantly different but the year affected ¹⁵N recovery by the plant. The maximum ¹⁵N recoveries calculated from the sum of the ¹⁵N recovery measured at both application dates were 46 and 23% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Leaf dry matter and leaf N uptake were higher in 2006 than in 2007, but tuber dry matter was not different between years at the final harvest. Up to 170 kg N ha⁻¹ was returned to the soil through the fallen shoots, indicating an important recycling of N for soil fertility replenishment. Thus, crop succession or intercropping are encouraged in a yam cropping system.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of conservative agronomic practices on yield and quality of wheat. The effects of these practices on soil fertility were further investigated in this four-year study (2005–2008). Two cropping systems, durum wheat in continuous cropping, and in two-year rotation with leguminous crops, were investigated at Foggia (Southern Italy) in rain-fed conditions. Within each cropping system, two levels of crop management were compared: i) conventional, characterized by a higher soil tillage management and mineral fertilizers application; ii) conservative, with a lower soil tillage management and organic-mineral fertilizers. The seasonal weather greatly affected the wheat yield and quality, inducing lower production in years that were characterized by unfavorable climatic conditions. This trend was found when the conventional treatment was applied, both in continuous cropping and rotations. The effects of cropping systems and crop management pointed out the positive role played by the leguminous crops (common vetch and chickpea) in crop rotation. This introduction improved wheat yield in rotation (6.47% compared to the continuous cropping), improved grain protein content (5.88%), and reduced the productive gap between conventional and conservative treatments (9.24 and 14.14% of the wheat in rotation and continuous cropping, respectively). Conversely, the effects of cropping systems and crop management on soil fertility were not very high, since the differences found at the end of the study in total nitrogen values were poor. However, total organic carbon (16.04 and 17.58% for cropping system and crop management, respectively) and available phosphorus values (11.30 and 7.43%) depend on root organic matter contribution, plant biomass residues, and fertilizations. The suitable crop rotation and the sustainable crop management appear important agronomical practices to improve yield and quality of wheat, and may reduce the environmental risks resulting from conventional intensive cropping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia sativa subsp. sativa 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achickpeas 3aclimatic factors 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3adurum wheat 3aenvironmental impact 3afertilizer application 3agood agricultural practices 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3aintensive cropping 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen content 3aorganic fertilizers 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aprotein content 3arisk 3asoil fertility 3atillage 3aweather 3aItaly 0awheat and leguminous crops 0acrop rotation 0atillage depths 0afertilization strategies 0aMediterranean environmental conditions1 aMaiorana, Michele0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2015 Mar. 21, v. 38, no. 4 p.624-638dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2014.9883563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007800171300001600249520057000265592002800835650002000863650001600883650002500899650002700924650001700951650001500968650001600983650000700999650001601006653001601022653001401038653002301052653002501075700001901100700001701119700001501136773010201151856008501253852000901338655001201347IND60515408020221119104418.0160315e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051540802DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10620072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiaotong10aExtraction and composition characterisation of amino acids from tung meal  ap. 849-852.  aThe most desirable content of amino acids (AAs) in the extracted products from tung (Aleurites fordii) meal was 93.88%, which was obtained from shelled tung meal at a hydrolysis temperature of 45°C and a isoelectric precipitation pH value of 4.4.

In recent years, kiwifruit rot has been a serious problem in Sichuan Province, one of the important kiwifruit production areas of China. Botryosphaeria dothidea has previously been associated with kiwifruit rot but little is known regarding whether other Botryosphaeriaceae genera also constitute kiwifruit rot pathogens in China. Accordingly, diseased fruit were collected from six different areas of Sichuan Province. Based on morphological characteristics, pathogenicity testing, and comparisons of DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer, transcription elongation factor 1-α, and β-tubulin genes, 135 isolates of Botryosphaeriaceae were identified as B. dothidea, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, and Neofusicoccum parvum. All of these species were found to cause kiwifruit rot. To understand the infection cycle of kiwifruit rot pathogens, these three species were used to inoculate leaves and shoots of kiwifruit. The results showed that these species could cause spots on leaves and lesions on shoots, producing abundant pycnidia on leaves and shoots surfaces. Moreover, B. dothidea conidia and ascospores from overwintered pycnidia and pseudothecia in kiwifruit orchards in April and August could cause fruit rot and spots on leaves of kiwifruit. Therefore, we concluded that overwintered pycnidia and pseudothecia of B. dothidea in kiwifruit orchards are the primary inoculum for kiwifruit rot, with new pycnidia that develop during the growing season serving as a secondary inoculum. This is the first report of N. parvum and L. theobromae causing kiwifruit rot in China and is also the first report that B. dothidea is able to overwinter as pycnidia and pseudothecia in kiwifruit orchards and serve as the primary inoculum for kiwifruit rot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryosphaeria dothidea 3aDNA 3aLasiodiplodia theobromae 3aNeofusicoccum 3aascospores 3ablight 3aconidia 3afungi 3agenes 3agrowing season 3ahost range 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akiwifruit 3aleaves 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogens 3aplant rots 3apycnidia 3ashoots 3atubulin 3aChina1 aGong, Guoshu1 aCui, Yongliang1 aZhang, Daixi1 aChang, Xiaoli1 aHu, Rongping1 aLiu, Na1 aSun, Xiaofang0 tPlant disease.g2015 May, v. 99, no. 5 p.699-708dPlant Diseasex0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPDIS-07-14-0727-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008800174520173900262592002802001650001902029650002002048650001102068650002002079650001502099650001902114650002002133650002102153650001102174650001702185650001302202650002002215650001402235650001402249650001502263651001202278651002102290653002302311653002502334653002302359653001102382653001302393653001502406653003102421700002202452700002002474700002202494700002202516700002102538773011002559856008802669852000902757655001202766IND60698599620221122225105.0201025e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069859962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.1032552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovács, Zsófia10aNew constraints on the evolution of 87Sr/86Sr of seawater during the Upper Triassic  aThe Late Triassic time interval witnessed several important biological turnovers, extinctions and onset of new life forms. Therefore, it is crucial to better constrain the tectonic, climatic and oceanographic framework at this time. The radiogenic strontium isotopic composition (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr) of seawater, recorded in marine carbonates is sensitive to variations in continental weathering and oceanic spreading rates. This makes it a powerful proxy for palaeo-environmental reconstructions and an excellent global stratigraphic correlation tool of marine sediment records. In this study, we present a new and extended ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr dataset across the late Norian - Hettangian interval, established from carbonate successions in Austria and Turkey. The well-established biostratigraphy and high sampling resolution allow evaluating changes in the ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr record with a better time constraint than in previous studies. An exceptionally sharp trend towards unradiogenic values has been observed in the latest Norian and in the early Rhaetian from 0.70800 to 0.70779. Considering Late Triassic climate change, updated tectonic models and actual dating of magmatic events, possible explanations for the observed trend in the ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr record are: (i) enhanced dissolution of pre-Norian carbonates, (ii) dissolution of widespread Late Triassic evaporites and (iii) tectonic reorganization of sedimentary basins due to the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea. At the very end of the Choristoceras marshi Zone, in the late Rhaetian, the unradiogenic ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr trend is reversed. This is likely related to environmental changes due to the continental emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHettangian age 3aTriassic period 3abasins 3abiostratigraphy 3acarbonates 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3amarine sediments 3amodels 3apaleoecology 3aseawater 3astable isotopes 3astrontium 3atectonics 3aweathering 3aAustria 3aTurkey (country) 0aPalaeo-environment 0aRadiogenic strontium 0aSeawater evolution 0aNorian 0aRhaetian 0aHettangian 0aTriassic/Jurassic boundary1 aDemangel, Isaline1 aRichoz, Sylvain1 aHippler, Dorothee1 aBaldermann, Andre1 aKrystyn, Leopold0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2020 Sept., v. 192 p.103255-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.1032553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007500170300001600245520132400261592002801585650001701613650001901630650001401649650001901663650002501682650001701707650001101724650002001735650002301755650001601778650001401794650001701808650001001825650002301835650001201858650001801870650001201888650002001900700001601920700001801936773010401954856008402058852000902142655001202151IND60089994220221118055103.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008999422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonet, M.

Treatment with retinoic acid, in particular, has been shown to reduce body fat and improve insulin sensitivity in lean and obese rodents by enhancing fat mobilization and energy utilization systemically, in tissues including brown and white adipose tissues, skeletal muscle and the liver. Nevertheless, controversial data have been reported, particularly regarding retinoids' effects on hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and blood lipid profile. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying retinoid effects on lipid metabolism are complex and remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a brief overview of mammalian lipid metabolism and its control, introduce mechanisms through which retinoids can impact on lipid metabolism, and review reported activities of retinoids on different aspects of lipid metabolism in key tissues, focusing on retinoic acid. Possible implications of this knowledge in the context of the management of obesity and the metabolic syndrome are also addressed.

From 1986 through 2015, we followed a cohort in Northern Italy that had been inadvertently consuming tap water with unusually high concentrations of inorganic hexavalent selenium from 1974 to 1985. We had previously documented an excess incidence of ALS in this cohort during 1986–1994. Here, we report extended follow-up of the cohort for an additional 21 years, encompassing 50,100 person-years of the exposed cohort and 2,233,963 person-years of the unexposed municipal cohort. We identified 7 and 112 incident ALS cases in the exposed and unexposed cohorts, respectively, yielding crude incidence rates of 14 and 5 cases per 100,000 person-years. A Poisson regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex and calendar year, produced an overall incidence rate ratio (IRR) for ALS of 2.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 6), with a substantially stronger IRR in 1986–1994 (8.2, 95% CI 2.7, 24.7) than in 1995–2015 (1.5, 95% CI 0.5, 4.7), and among women (5.1, 95% CI 1.8, 14.3) than men (1.7, 95% CI 0.5, 5.4). Overall, these results indicate an association between high exposure to inorganic selenium, a recognized neurotoxicant, and ALS incidence, with declining rates after cessation of exposure and stronger effects among women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3aconfidence interval 3amen 3amotor neurons 3aneurotoxins 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aselenium 3atap water 3awomen 3aItaly 0aDrinking water 0aCohort study 0aIncidence 0aalphabetical list: ALS 0aCI 0aIRR1 aFilippini, Tommaso1 aMalagoli, Carlotta1 aVioli, Federica1 aMandrioli, Jessica1 aConsonni, Dario1 aRothman, Kenneth J.1 aWise, Lauren A.0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Sept. 11, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1087423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245007200211300001600283506007600299520173400375592002802109506003702137650001502174650001702189650001402206650002402220650002102244650000902265650001802274650001202292650002102304650001602325650001402341650001402355650001202369650001802381650001802399650002102417650002902438650002602467650001702493650001402510650002502524700002802549700002202577700001902599700002502618773010402643856008402747852000902831655001202840IND60089994320221207142841.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008999432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.06.0042doi7 aPMC31967432pmcid7 a217047312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasmeen, Rumana14aThe contribution of vitamin A to autocrine regulation of fat depots  ap. 190-197.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMorbidity and mortality associated with increased white fat accumulation in visceral fat depots have focused attention on the pathways regulating the development of this tissue during embryogenesis, in adulthood, and while under the influence of obesogenic diets. Adipocytes undergo clonal expansion, differentiation (adipogenesis) and maturation through a complex network of transcriptional factors, most of which are expressed at similar levels in visceral and subcutaneous fat. Rigorous research attempts to unfold the pathways regulating expression and activity of adipogenic transcription factors that act in a fat-depot-specific manner. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is the master regulator of adipogenesis, and is expressed at higher levels in subcutaneous than in visceral depots. PPARγ expression in adipogenesis is mediated by CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) and several transcription factors acting in conjunction with C/EBPs, although alternative pathways through zinc-finger protein-423 (ZFP423) transcription factor are sufficient to induce PPARγ expression and adipogenesis. Vitamin A and its metabolites, retinaldehyde and retinoic acid, are transcriptionally-active molecules. Retinoic acid is generated from retinaldehyde in adipose tissue by the aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 family of enzymes (Aldh1). In this review, we discuss the role of Aldh1 enzymes in the generation of retinoic acid during adipogenesis, in the regulation of the transcriptional network of PPARγ in a fat-depot-specific manner, and the important contribution of this autocrine pathway in the development of visceral obesity.

The broad synchroneity of this interval is striking and has been revealed in many different deep lakes from humid or montane forest, lakes or swamps marginal to tropical forest, and swamp forests where the oscillations of the surface water table produce temporary emersions. In parallel, a chronological review is presented of the Bantu arrival in these areas, including indicators for burning, metallurgy and land clearance. Nevertheless, evidence of human occupation, such as artefacts or deposits containing charcoal is exceptional and generally absent in most areas. Although the archaeological data exhibit a gradual southward densification of human occupation throughout Central Africa, the increase of settlements clearly began after 2350 yr BP, not before 2500 BP. However, some authors have interpreted the geochemical signal of increased erosion in the Congo Basin or the opening up of the forest around Lake Barombi Mbo in Cameroon as being attributed to agricultural clearance, or even the supply of charcoal required for metallurgy. In short, these early Bantu settlers (in such modest densities) may have been responsible for some local landscape degradation (clearance, fire, metallurgy), but these same settlers could not, under any circumstances and across all Central Africa, be held responsible directly or indirectly for the synchronous changes of lake levels, draining vast swamps and opening up of the tropical forest canopy, which was due to an increased dry season, while the recovery with the recolonization of light demanding species, including oil palms (Elaeis guineensis) assisted by dispersers such as chimpanzees, was likewise due to natural processes. Therefore, it can be concluded that no data available validate the hypothesis that the major erosion or vegetation destruction ca. 2500 yr BP, was the result of large population movements. Indeed, the evolution of the environments of Central Africa are linked to the natural responses induced by general palaeoclimatic processes, observed synchronously not only in northern and eastern Africa, but globally. The natural recovery and resilience of these forests until the last centuries contrasts with the situation currently being faced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aHolocene epoch 3aPan troglodytes 3aarchaeology 3abasins 3aburning 3acharcoal 3adry season 3aforest canopy 3alakes 3aland clearing 3alandscapes 3ametallurgy 3amontane forests 3apaleoclimatology 3arain forests 3asurface water 3aswamps 3atropical forests 3awater table 3aCameroon 3aEastern Africa 0aLate Holocene rainforest crisis 0aWest and Central Africa 0aPalaeoenvironments 0aNatural dispersers 0aPioneer species 0aTropical forest dynamics1 aMaley, Jean1 aChepstow-Lusty, Alex0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2020 Sept., v. 192 p.103257-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.1032573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010700166300001600273520123700289592002801526596003001554650002301584650002401607650001701631650001301648650001701661650001101678650001001689650001501699650001601714650001201730650004301742650002601785650002901811650002601840700001801866700001901884700001801903773014201921856008202063852000902145655001202154IND60638264020221118221938.0190427e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063826402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-019-02079-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Weimeng10aImprovement of kojic acid production in Aspergillus oryzae AR-47 mutant strain by combined mutagenesis  ap. 753-761.  aKojic acid is a kind of secondary metabolites, whose biosynthesis pathway remains unclear to date. It is produced industrially by microbial fermentation, and thus, mutagenesis breeding still plays a vital role for obtaining strains with high kojic acid production. The starting strain KA-11 isolated from mildewed fruits was identified as Aspergillus oryzae and then subjected to a combined mutagenesis program including microwave mutagenesis, UV irradiation, heat-LiCl, atmospheric, and room temperature plasma (ARTP). The kojic acid production was increased by 47.0%, 87.1%, 126.2%, and 292.3% compared with the starting strain KA-11 after each mutagenesis stage. A mutant strain AR-47 with kojic acid production of 96.5 g/L in flask-shake fermentation was finally obtained. The fermentation time also decreased from 7 to 5 days. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to determine the transcriptional expression levels of genes that may be relevant to kojic acid biosynthesis, including kojA, kojR, kojT, AO090113000141, AO090113000143, AO090113000145, nrtA, and laeA. The results showed that the transcriptional expression levels of all these genes in high yield strain AR-47 had increased compared with the starting strain KA-11.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 111-2-07c111 Project 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aambient temperature 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding 3afermentation 3afruits 3agenes 3akojic acid 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary metabolites 3atranscription (genetics) 3aultraviolet radiation1 aLiang, Jinrui1 aWang, Bingbing1 aChen, Jianhua0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2019 May, v. 42, no. 5 p.753-761dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-019-02079-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007400170520172300244592002801967650001601995650001102011650001502022651001102037653001702048653003302065653002502098653002202123700002102145700002102166700002102187773010202208856008502310852000902395655001202404IND60709530920221119024434.0201118e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.1011532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Chen-Jui12aA rolling forecast approach for next six-hour air quality index track  aCurrent daily AQI forecasting results do not help people making decision to undertake outdoor activities in the coming hours effectively, because the air quality index (AQI) varies greatly at different times of the day. In this study, an approach to providing a rolling forecast of the next six-hour AQI in the seven air quality areas of Taiwan by using big data analysis is proposed. The segmented fitted characteristic curves for the intervals midnight, early morning, morning, afternoon, evening, and night by using the piecewise cubic spline method was potted based on the monitoring data of the past three years to establish the rolling forecast model, which can fully match the local environmental and climatic characteristics. The principle of the proposed rolling forecast track is as follows: (1) replace the constant coefficient with the current AQI in the characteristic curves to form the prediction formula, (2) use the sum of the predicted values plus or minus half of the mean standard deviations to set upper or lower boundaries, respectively, of the forecast range, (3) increase the range of boundaries with the forecast hour, and (4) repeat steps (1)–(3) when entering the next hour. The step (1) is an important step for the rolling forecast, which ensures that the deviation of the predicted value is minimized. The average mean absolute normalized gross error ranges of the rolling forecasts were all lower than 9%. These results demonstrate that the proposed rolling forecast model established using monthly characteristic curves can yield highly accurate forecasts. Therefore, the proposed rolling forecast approach can be used by governments to update people about the AQI over the next 6 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3amodels 3aprediction 3aTaiwan 0aAmbient haze 0aAir quality index prediction 0aQuantification index 0aBig data analysis1 aLiang, Jeng-Jong1 aJheng, Chiao-Wun1 aTsai, Ming-Chang0 tEcological informatics.g2020 Nov., v. 60 p.101153-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.1011533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01314naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245010600158300001600264520045900280592002800739650001200767650002600779650002200805650001200827700002200839773009500861856007100956852000901027655001201036IND60518551920221118230216.0160418e197205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855192DNAL7 a10.2307/19342332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlime, Janice M.10aSpecies Diversity of Stream Insects of Fontinalis SPP.

In a fraction (n = 120) of workers measurements of internal PFOA serum concentration were used to predict a cumulative serum PFOA concentration of each cohort member. Mortality rates were compared to that of the regional population using the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and to that of the workers of a nearby metalworking factory in terms of risk ratio (RR), across categories of probability of PFASs exposure and tertiles of cumulative serum PFOA concentrations.Internal PFOA serum concentration among 120 workers in the 2000–2013 period was very high (Geometric Mean: 4048 ng/mL; range 19–91,900 ng/mL). The mortality of the chemical cohort was increased for liver cancer (SMR: 2.32; CI: 1.11–4.87), malignant neoplasm of lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue (SMR: 2.26; CI: 1.08–4.73). In the comparison with the cohort of workers from the metalworking factory, the RRs for mortality of the cohort were increased for overall mortality (RR: 1.42; CI: 1.12–1.79), diabetes (RR: 5.95; CI: 1.08–32.8), liver cancer (RR: 6.69; CI: 1.71–26.2) and liver cirrhosis (RR: 3.87; CI: 1.18–12.7). Mortality for these causes increased in association with probability of PFASs exposure and with tertiles of cumulative PFOA serum concentrations.The present is a small observational study with limited control over confounding factors. The cohort showed increased mortality for all causes and subjects in the highest cumulative internal dose of PFOA had a statistically significant increase for mortality of liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, malignant neoplasms of lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue in both comparisons. Toxicological studies on PFOA and PFOS provide support for causality for the observed association with the risk for liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbed dose 3aacids 3ablood serum 3adeath 3adiabetes 3ahuman resources 3aliver cirrhosis 3aliver neoplasms 3amales 3amortality 3aobservational studies 3aoccupational exposure 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3arelative risk 3atoxicology 3aItaly 0aCohort study 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aRetrospective assessment 0a(PFASs) 0a(PFOS) 0a(PFOA) 0a(FA) 0a(BTF) 0a(RM) 0a(OGR)1 aMerler, Enzo0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Sept. 11, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1087433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002100171245013500192300001600327500001500343520166900358592002802027650002302055650001002078650002202088650002302110650001502133650002102148650001802169650001802187650001702205650001802222650001102240650002902251650001102280650001202291650002402303650002202327650002202349650002102371650001302392650002402405650002202429653002602451653001602477653001402493653001302507653001602520653001802536700001802554700002202572700002402594773011702618856008702735852000902822655001202831IND60112347020221120044833.0190318e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011234702DNAL7 a235176172pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivers, David B.10aWater balance characteristics of pupae developing in different size maggot masses from six species of forensically important flies  ap. 552-559.  a2019-12-04  aThe impact of maggot mass size on body water content, net transpiration rate, and dehydration tolerance of fly pupae was examined in six species of necrophagous flies. Species that spent more time on food as larvae, produced pupae with high body water contents. Dehydration tolerance limits of pupae were modest, matching the moisture-rich conditions of decaying carrion for larvae. Protophormia terraenovae pupariates on food as it dries, and this was reflected by pupae having the highest body water content and lowest net transpiration rate. Megaselia scalaris featured the lowest body water content and highest dehydration tolerance, implying that this species is arid-suited, which matches its ability to feed and colonize on post-decay carrion. Lucilia illustris was the most sensitive to larval overcrowding, resulting in a dramatic decrease in pupal size, early dispersal from food, fed less and had fast net transpiration rates. By contrast, Lucilia sericata was the most resistant, by showing no pupal size decrease and no change in net transpiration rate. Other species were between these extremes, requiring larger maggot mass sizes to produce the effect of decreasing pupal size and increasing net transpiration rate. We conclude: (1) the pupa’s response to overcrowding and water balance profile are species-specific, varying according to pupal size and net transpiration rate as independent characteristics; (2) water balance profile of the pupae reflects the behavior and microhabitat of the larva; and (3) danger of lethal desiccation to smaller-sized pupae is circumvented by a faster developmental rate rather than enhanced water conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater conservation 3apupae 3aLucilia illustris 3aMegaselia scalaris 3abody water 3aLucilia sericata 3amicrohabitats 3atranspiration 3adead animals 3awater content 3alarvae 3aProtophormia terraenovae 3adrying 2aAnimals 2aDipteraxphysiology 2aForensic Sciences 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aPupaxphysiology 2aRaccoons 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWaterxphysiology 0aDehydration tolerance 0aHeat stress 0aFlesh fly 0aBlow fly 0aScuttle fly 0awater balance1 aYoder, Jay A.1 aJajack, Andrew J.1 aRosselot, Andrew E.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2013 May, v. 59, no. 5 p.552-559dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245009700210300001600307520111800323592002801441596005901469596006001528650002101588650001901609650001801628650002401646650001101670700002501681700002201706700002501728700005901753773014201812856008201954852000902036655001202045IND60638264120221118222133.0190427e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063826412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-019-02089-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMöller, Johannes,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9546-055X10aModel-assisted Design of Experiments as a concept for knowledge-based bioprocess development  ap. 867-882.  aDesign of Experiments methods offer systematic tools for bioprocess development in Quality by Design, but their major drawback is the user-defined choice of factor boundary values. This can lead to several iterative rounds of time-consuming and costly experiments. In this study, a model-assisted Design of Experiments concept is introduced for the knowledge-based reduction of boundary values. First, the parameters of a mathematical process model are estimated. Second, the investigated factor combinations are simulated instead of experimentally derived and a constraint-based evaluation and optimization of the experimental space can be performed. The concept is discussed for the optimization of an antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary batch and bolus fed-batch process. The same optimal process strategies were found if comparing the model-assisted Design of Experiments (4 experiments each) and traditional Design of Experiments (16 experiments for batch and 29 experiments for fed-batch). This approach significantly reduces the number of experiments needed for knowledge-based bioprocess development.  aPublisher supplied data  a031B0305cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung  a031B0577AcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 3aChinese hamsters 3aanimal ovaries 3abioprocessing 3aexperimental design 3amodels1 aKuchemüller, Kim B.1 aSteinmetz, Tobias1 aKoopmann, Kirsten S.1 aPörtner, Ralf,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1163-97180 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2019 May, v. 42, no. 5 p.867-882dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-019-02089-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013400174300001600308520124700324592002801571650002001599650001901619650002601638650002901664650001301693650001201706650001301718650001301731650001301744653001301757653001201770700002501782700002001807700002201827700001801849700001501867700002101882700001801903700001901921773013701940856008402077852000902161655001202170IND60698599920221122225128.0200614e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069859992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2017.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogdanova, Katerina10aAntibiofilm activity of bioactive hop compounds humulone, lupulone and xanthohumol toward susceptible and resistant staphylococci  ap. 127-134.  aBacterial biofilms pose a serious medical problem due to their significant resistance to antimicrobials, and staphylococci are recognized as the most frequent cause of biofilm-associated infections. The hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.) contains substances that have been determined to act as anti-infective agents against bacteria, mainly in planktonic form. Therefore, we decided to investigate the antibiofilm properties of H. lupulus L.-derived compounds (humulone, lupulone and xanthohumol) against a selected group of Staphylococcus spp., including methicillin-susceptible and resistant strains. All tested hop compounds were shown to possess antimicrobial properties against all tested staphylococci, both planktonic and biofilm-dwelling, with no significant difference between resistant and susceptible strains. All compounds lowered the number of bacterial cells released from the biofilm, with the strongest effect seen for lupulone, followed by xanthohumol. Moreover, lupulone and xanthohumol were not only able to penetrate the biofilm and reduce the number of bacteria within it, but their higher concentrations (∼60 μg/mL for xanthohumol and ∼125 μg/mL for lupulone) reduced the number of surviving bacterial cells to zero.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHumulus lupulus 3aStaphylococcus 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3ahumulone 3alupulone 3aplankton 0aBiofilms 0aHumulus1 aRöderova, Magdalena1 aKolář, Milan,1 aLangova, Katerina1 aDusek, Martin1 aJost, Petr1 aKubelkova, Klara1 aBostik, Pavel1 aOlsovska, Jana0 tResearch in microbiology.g2018 Apr., v. 169, no. 3 p.127-134dElsevier Masson SASaInstitut PasteurwJournal:11932x0923-25087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2017.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245010600211300001600317520090700333592002801240650002201268650002101290650001301311650001401324650001401338650001401352650002601366650002601392650001801418653001401436653001301450653001301463653002101476653002601497700002301523700002001546700005701566700001901623773013501642856008701777852000901864655001201873IND60610392120221119173219.0200228e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061039212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsobe, Noriyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8571-337310aCellulose hydrogel with tunable shape and mechanical properties: From rigid cylinder to soft scaffold  ap. 625-631.  aCellulose hydrogel from aqueous solution of lithium bromide demonstrated excellent tunability of mechanical property and shape. A series of compression tests showed that cellulose hydrogel covered a wide range of mechanical property, where the compressive Young's modulus was controllable from 30 kPa to 1.3 MPa by changing the initial concentration of cellulose solution. Meanwhile, the diameter of the building block of gel, namely nano-fibrous cellulose, was constant at 15–20 nm irrelevant of the initial concentration of cellulose solution. Moreover, thanks to the biocompatibility of cellulose, the cultivation of cartilage tissue was successful in the micro-porous sponge-like cellulose hydrogel prepared by salt-leaching process. These findings show that this environmentally-benign versatile gel offers a new substrate for the biomaterial-based nanomaterial in biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocompatibility 3abromides 3acartilage 3acellulose 3ahydrogels 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananomaterials 0aCellulose 0aHydrogel 0aScaffold 0aCompression test 0aSalt leaching process1 aKomamiya, Takehiro1 aKimura, Satoshi1 aKim, Ung-jin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7517-16111 aWada, Masahisa0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 117 p.625-631dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006300174300001600237520097400253592002801227650002701255650001601282650001401298650001301312650001901325650002401344650001601368650002201384650001301406650001101419651001201430653002801442653002401470653002001494653002401514653002901538700002401567700002201591700002201613700002601635773009901661856005101760852000901811655001201820IND50088354120221121120849.0140414e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008835412DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2013.7920222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSponarski, Carly C.10aHeterogeneity among Rural Resident Attitudes Toward Wolves  ap. 239-248.  aRural communities are often considered a homogeneous population in resource management. Wolf management is no exception. To understand the diversity of rural attitudes toward wolves and wolf management, data were obtained through a mail questionnaire to rural residents (n = 555; 69% response rate) of southwestern Alberta. Results indicated three distinct clusters differentiated by respondents' attitudes toward: (a) wolves and fear and (b) wolf management. Cluster 1 had negative attitudes toward wolves (n = 85) and was composed of livestock producers and hunters. Cluster 2 was neutral (n = 184), and cluster 3 was positive (n = 276) toward wolves. Cluster 2 and 3 were primarily composed of non-hunters and non-livestock producers. With movement of people into rural areas with varying backgrounds the rural community now has multiple attitudinal groups and wildlife managers will need to tailor their efforts to communicate with different groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3afearfulness 3alivestock 3amanagers 3aquestionnaires 3aresource management 3arural areas 3arural communities 3awildlife 3awolves 3aAlberta 0aattitudes toward wolves 0aclassification tree 0arural residents 0awildlife management 0aK-means cluster analysis1 aSemeniuk, Christina1 aGlikman, Jenny A.1 aBath, Alistair J.1 aMusiani, M.q(Marco),0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2013 July 1, v. 18, no. 4 p.239-248dRoutledgex1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2013.792022  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012900168300001400297520112500311592002801436650001501464650002501479650001501504650001501519650006601534650001701600650001901617650002601636650001901662650001501681653008101696653002901777653001901806653003101825653001801856700002101874700001901895700001901914700001701933700002601950700002301976773009001999856008102089852000902170655001202179IND60544761420221116145650.0160901e20150215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErnst, Madeleine12aA metabolomic protocol for plant systematics by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry  ap. 46-58.  aMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been widely used for the identification and classification of microorganisms based on their proteomic fingerprints. However, the use of MALDI-TOF MS in plant research has been very limited. In the present study, a first protocol is proposed for metabolic fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF MS using three different MALDI matrices with subsequent multivariate data analysis by in-house algorithms implemented in the R environment for the taxonomic classification of plants from different genera, families and orders. By merging the data acquired with different matrices, different ionization modes and using careful algorithms and parameter selection, we demonstrate that a close taxonomic classification can be achieved based on plant metabolic fingerprints, with 92% similarity to the taxonomic classifications found in literature. The present work therefore highlights the great potential of applying MALDI-TOF MS for the taxonomic classification of plants and, furthermore, provides a preliminary foundation for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical chemistry 3adesorption 3aionization 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3amicroorganisms 3amultivariate analysis 3aplant taxonomy 3aproteomics 0aMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry 0aMetabolic fingerprinting 0aPlant taxonomy 0amultivariate data analysis 0aR environment1 aSilva, Denise B.1 aSilva, Ricardo1 aMonge, Marcelo1 aSemir, João1 aVêncio, Ricardo Z.N.1 aLopes, Norberto P.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 859 p.46-58dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245010500169300001600274500001500290520126500305592002801570650001901598650001801617650001001635650002301645650001001668650002201678650002201700650002101722650001201743650001001755650002101765650001001786651001101796653002001807653002401827653002001851653001501871653002301886653001901909700002401928700002101952700002001973700002501993773010602018856007802124852000902202655001202211IND60129145820221120052646.0151124e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012914582DNAL7 a10.3375/043.034.04042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalankiewicz, Wiesław10aTree Cavity Resources in Spruce-Pine Managed and Protected Stands of the Białowieża Forest, Poland  ap. 423-428.  a2019-12-04  aTree cavities are vital resources for many animals, especially birds and mammals. We aimed to determine density of cavity resources in coniferous spruce-pine (Pinus/Picea genera) stands of the Białowieża Forest, Poland, and to correlate their presence with tree species composition, and characteristics of trees and stands (condition, DBH, basal area). We conducted studies in spruce-pine stands with no (national park), medium (seminatural reserves), and high (managed forest) management activity. We measured all trees within 50-m × 50-m sample plots (eight plots in each zone) and searched for all tree cavities. The highest density of cavities was observed in the national park (12.5/ha) and the lowest in managed plots (3.0/ha). Most cavities were found in dead trees (74.4%), mainly in pines Pinus sylvestris L. The basal area of dead pines within the stand was the best predictor of cavity presence on sample plots. Our results confirm a key role of pine snags in natural coniferous stands. Forest management leads to dramatic reduction of tree cavity resources in managed stands. We suggest that the leaving or creation of pine snags is the most effective method of providing or retaining cavity resources in commercial coniferous forests in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3anational parks 3atree cavities 3asnags 3aconiferous forests 3atrees 3aforest management 3aspecies diversity 3aPinus sylvestris 3amammals 3aPicea 3astand basal area 3abirds 3aPoland 0anature reserves 0aBiałowieża Forest 0aprimeval stands 0abasal area 0afoundation species 0amanaged stands1 aCzeszczewik, Dorota1 aStański, Tomasz1 aSahel, Mustapha1 aRuczyński, Ireneusz0 tNatural areas journal.g2014 Oct., v. 34, no. 4 p.423-428dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.034.04043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007100148245011000219300001200329520121000341592002801551596007301579650001201652650001501664650001201679650001601691650001001707650001301717650001801730650002401748650001101772650001901783650001501802651001101817700003201828700002601860700002901886700002801915700002901943773015101972856008302123852000902206655001202215IND60746340720221122065011.0211027e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074634072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09288-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Rosa Wieliczko, Andressa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8028-652510aMeteorological drivers and ENSO influence on phytoplankton biomass dynamics in a shallow subtropical lake  ap. 536.  aMeteorological features influence the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems and consequently their biotas. This study aimed to identify the meteorological drivers of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a), sampled seasonally over a period of 12 years (2001–2013) in Lake Mangueira, a large shallow subtropical lake in southern Brazil. The lake is 90 km long and 3–10 km wide with a mean depth of 3 m and is oligo-mesotrophic and highly affected by wind action. In general, non-parametric multiplicative regression analysis identified wind direction, radiation, and the Oceanic Niño Index as the main drivers of variation in chlorophyll a. Notably, ENSO periods caused changes in physical, chemical, and meteorological parameters, including conductivity, total suspended solids, total and dissolved nitrogen, alkalinity, soluble reactive silica, wind speed, and precipitation. Phytoplankton biomass showed significant differences between ENSO periods and the periods without events, occurring in the highest values during La Niña years. This study showed that meteorological variables can significantly influence productivity patterns, indicating the importance of including them in limnological studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aLa Nina 3aalkalinity 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3alakes 3anitrogen 3aphytoplankton 3aregression analysis 3asilica 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aBrazil1 aCrossetti, Luciane Oliveira1 aCavalcanti, J.

Electrospun matrices were fabricated from PCL/COLL (1:1 (w/w)) solution. The insulin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were produced by ionic gelation process and then attached onto the yarns. The dressings were investigated regarding their surface wettability, microstructure, the capacity to absorb water, water vapour permeability, mechanical properties, blood compatibility, microbial penetration, and cellular behavior. Full-thickness excisional wound model was used to assess the in vivo healing capacity of the dressings. Our data showed that after 14 days the wounds covered with PCL/COLL/Cs-Ins wound dressing could reach to nearly full wound closure compared with the sterile gauze which exhibited nearly 45% of wound size reduction. Our results suggest that fabricated scaffolds can be potentially applied in clinical practice for wound treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiocompatibility 3achitosan 3agelation 3ain vivo studies 3ainsulin 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3apermeability 3atissue repair 3awater vapor 3awettability 3awound treatment 3ayarns 0aPoly (ε-caprolactone) 0aCollagen 0aChitosan 0aInsulin 0aElectrospinning 0aSkin wound-dressing1 aṢāliḥī, Majīd,1 aFarzamfar, Saeed1 aVaez, Ahmad1 aSamadian, Hadi1 aSahrapeyma, Hamed1 aMirzaii, Mehdi1 aGhorbani, Sadegh1 aGoodarzi, Arash1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4020-887X0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 117 p.601-609dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.1843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158300001600279500002000295520156800315592002801883650001701911650001401928650001201942650001001954650002101964650001201985650001401997650001502011650002602026650001802052650001202070650001402082650000902096650002902105650002602134700001702160700001602177700001302193700001702206700002002223700001802243773011902261856007402380852000902454655001202463IND60580125320221121132831.0170909e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058012532DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.125942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Qingcai10aRegulatory network and genetic interactions established by OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet morphogenesis  ap. 693-707.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrasses display highly diversified inflorescence architectures that differ in the arrangement of spikelets and flowers and determine cereal yields. However, the molecular basis underlying grass inflorescence morphogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of a functionally diversified SEPALLATA MADS‐box transcription factor, OsMADS34, in regulating rice (Oryza sativa L.) inflorescence and spikelet development. Microarray analysis showed that, at the very early stages of inflorescence formation, dysfunction of OsMADS34 caused altered expression of 379 genes that are associated with protein modification and degradation, transcriptional regulation, signaling and metabolism activity. Genetic analysis revealed that OsMADS34 controls different aspects of inflorescence structure, branching and meristem activity synergistically with LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), as evidenced by the enhanced phenotypes of osmads34 lax1 and osmads34 fon4 compared with the single mutants. Additionally, double mutant between osmads34 and the sterile lemma defective mutant elongated empty glume (ele) displayed an enhanced phenotype, that is, longer and wider sterile lemmas that were converted into lemma/palea‐like organs, suggesting that ELE and OsMADS34 synergistically control the sterile lemma development. OsMADS34 may act together with OsMADS15 in controlling sterile lemma development. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the regulatory function of OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abranching 3aflowers 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3agrasses 3ameristems 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3arice 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aLi, Xiaofeng1 aZhu, Wanwan1 aYang, Li1 aLiang, Wanqi1 aDreni, Ludovico1 aZhang, Dabing0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2017 Sept., v. 59, no. 9 p.693-707dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.125943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245023500167520103700402592002801439650003501467650001601502650001101518650001601529650001101545650002001556650002401576650001901600650001901619650003301638650001201671650001001683650001801693650002001711650003301731650001301764653001901777653001101796653002701807653002901834653001001863653001001873700001901883700001801902773010001920856008702020852000902107655001202116IND60727617620221119161940.0220606e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072761762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1292372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElik, Adil10aIonic hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents in developing air-assisted liquid-phase microextraction based on experimental design: Application to flame atomic absorption spectrometry determination of cobalt in liquid and solid samples  aThis paper reports a new and simple microextraction procedure for cobalt determination using green ionic hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent in developing air-assisted liquid-phase microextraction and flame atomic absorption spectrometry.

A., Bourque, C. P.-A., Swift, D. E. and Meng, F.-R. 2013. Generation of soil drainage equations from an artificial neural network-analysis approach. Can. J. Soil Sci. 93: 329-342. Soil properties, especially soil drainage, are known to be related to topo-hydrologic variables derived from digital elevation models (DEM), such as vertical slope position, slope steepness, sediment delivery ratio, and topographic wetness index. Such relationships typically are strongly non-linear and thus difficult to define with conventional statistical methods. In this study, we used artificial neural network (ANN) models to establish relationships between soil drainage classes and DEM-generated topo-hydrologic variables and subsequently formulated the relationships to generate soil drainage equations for soil mapping. A high-resolution field soil map of the Black Brook Watershed in northwest New Brunswick, Canada, was used to calibrate/validate the ANN models, and the obtained equations. Independent data from an experimental farm, about 180 km away, were also used for validation. Results indicated that vertical slope position was the best predictor of soil drainage classes (r=0.55), followed by slope steepness (r=0.44), sediment delivery ratio (r=0.39), and topographic wetness index (r=0.38). The obtained soil drainage equations fitted well to the ANN model predictions (r ²=0.78-0.99; root mean squared error=0.39-4.55). Analyses indicated that soil drainage equations clearly reflected the actual relationships between soil drainage classes and DEM-generated topo-hydrologic variables, and have the potential to minimize bias originated from over-training the ANN models when applied outside the area of calibration, especially when the ranges of input variables were outside of the range of calibration data.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademonstration farms 3adigital elevation models 3adrainage 3aequations 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3asediments 3asoil map 3asoil properties 3asoil surveys 3astatistical analysis 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3aNew Brunswick 0aSoil drainage 0aartificial neural network 0adigital elevation models 0aslope position 0asediment delivery ratio 0atopographic wetness index1 aMacLean, David A.1 aBourque, Charles P.-A.1 aSwift, D.

In this study, directed for this purpose, research was conducted on the protective effect of hydro-ethanolic extract of saffron petals (SPE) against acetaminophen (APAP) induced acute nephrotoxicity. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were distributed into four groups of six each. Group I, as a control group, received normal saline (0.09%) orally (PO). Group II, as an intoxicated group was treated with APAP, PO (600 mg/kg). In the groups III and IV, SPE in a dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg along with APAP (600 mg/kg) was administered, respectively. At the end of the trial (8ᵗʰ day), blood was taken from the heart of rats for assessment of biochemical parameters and the right kidney was placed in 10% buffered formalin for histopathological evaluations. In the APAP treatment group, higher serum creatinine and uric acid were observed. SPE in a dose of 20 mg/kg significantly reduced serum creatinine and uric acid. In pathologic evaluation, a dose of 20 mg/kg of SPE prevented the kidney injuries induced by APAP. Tissues changes were in accordance with biochemical findings. It is likely that the SPE contributed to the prevention of acute nephrotoxicity induced by APAP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3ablood serum 3acorolla 3acreatinine 3adrug toxicity 3aformalin 3aherbal medicines 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3amales 3anephrotoxicity 3aplant extracts 3aprotective effect 3arats 3asaffron 3auric acid 0aAcetaminophen 0arat 0arenal toxicity 0asaffron petals1 aRiahinia, Narges1 aTorbati, Mohammad Bagher Montazer1 aBehdani, Mohammad Ali0 tVeterinary science development.g2015 Mar. 25, v. 5, no. 1dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, ItalywJournal:21534x2038-96987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/vsd.2015.58213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03745naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245011900177300001400296520186400310592002802174650002502202650001102227650001102238650000902249650002002258650001002278650002502288650002002313650002002333650001602353650002102369650001602390650001902406650001202425650002102437650002002458650002402478650001902502650002402521650002602545650000902571650000902580650001502589650002002604650002502624653001002649653002002659653003402679653001302713653002302726700001902749700002002768700001802788700002102806700002102827700002302848700001902871773010202890856008202992852000903074655001203083IND50066226120221119091948.0190403e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006622612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2013.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlberto, Ma. Carmelita R.10aCarbon uptake and water productivity for dry-seeded rice and hybrid maize grown with overhead sprinkler irrigation  ap. 51-65.  aA growing scarcity of irrigation water could progressively lead to changes in rice production to systems using less irrigation water for rice or more crop diversification. A shift from current production of rice on flooded soils to production of rice on non-flooded soil with water-saving irrigation or to production of more water-efficient crops will have profound effects on carbon, water, and energy exchanges. This study used the eddy covariance technique to examine C uptake and water use efficiencies for water-saving, dry-seeded rice production and production of hybrid maize under overhead sprinkler irrigation as an alternative to flooded rice during two growing seasons. Maize with its C4 physiology has greater photosynthetic capacity than rice. In 2011, maize had 1.4 times higher net C uptake than rice and twice as much grain yield as rice (10.4 vs 5.3Mgha−1). In 2012, lower solar radiation due to increased cloudiness and heavy rainfall during critical growth stages (late vegetative to early reproductive) decreased LAI and resulted to about 20% less net C uptake and maize yield (8.2Mgha−1), but the rice yield was unchanged (5.3Mgha−1) presumably because of improved crop management which included effective crop establishment at lower seed rate and efficient N application using fertigation. Canopy light use efficiency, crop water productivity (WPET), and photosynthetic water use efficiency were 1.8, 1.9, and 1.6 times higher for maize than rice, respectively, despite sensitivity of maize to excess water. Net C uptake, evapotranspiration, and WPET of dry-seeded rice under overhead sprinkler irrigation were comparable to those reported elsewhere for flooded rice. Average total water input (irrigation+rainfall) for rice was only 908mm, as compared to 1300–1500mm reported in literature for typical puddled transplanted rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasexual reproduction 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acorn 3acrop management 3acrops 3adevelopmental stages 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy transfer 3afertigation 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3ahybrids 3airrigation water 3aleaf area index 3aoverhead irrigation 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant establishment 3aproduction technology 3arain 3arice 3arice soils 3asolar radiation 3awater use efficiency 0aMaize 0aDry-seeded rice 0aOverhead sprinkler irrigation 0aC budget 0aWater productivity1 aBuresh, R.

Relatively little information, however, is available on animal acceptance of cicer milkvetch forage. The objective of this study was to determine if the component polycross progenies of ‘Monarch’ differed in palatability as measured by grazing sheep (Ovis aries) offered a choice of progenies. The progenies were evaluated in a spaceplanted, irrigated nursery during three grazing cycles in 1980 and two grazing cycles in 1981. Progenies differed significantly (P ≦ 0.05) for grazing score (palatability) during four of the five cycles. Several progenies ranked consistently high for palatability, while other progenies ranked consistently low. None of the Monarch progenies, however, were significantly more palatable than ‘Lutana’. All sheep remained healthy and suffered no observable side effects during the course of the study. Plant height, vigor, and flowering score were not related to palatability of progenies. The results suggest that it may be possible to improve the palatability of cicer milkvetch by breeding and selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus cicer 3aadverse effects 3abreeding 3aflowering 3aforage legumes 3agrazing 3airrigation 3apalatability 3aplant height 3asheep 3avigor0 tCrop science.g1986 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.377-380dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1986.0011183X002600020035x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009000165300001800255520166700273592002801940650001501968650001901983650001302002650001502015650002502030650001202055650001802067650002502085650001202110650001602122650001502138650002302153650001602176650001902192650002502211653002302236653001602259653002502275653001302300700001902313700001102332773011302343856008002456852000902536655001202545IND60616447220221120223137.0181016e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061644722DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166733282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chenxiao10aInnovative artificial leather with high thermal conductivity as a new leather product  ap. 2487-2504.  aArtificial leather has been developed for decades as a key element in apparel design due to its thermal insulation function. However, with the changes of public preferences, the focus has shifted from functionality to a greater awareness of aesthetics. Therefore, an area for innovative artificial leather with high thermal conductivity as the cover of smart electronic devices is emerging. This leather will enable both special functions and aesthetical appearance to catch the attention of the public. It can also be utilized for spring–summer clothing in following fashion trends. Exploring new markets also means breaking away from the traditional seasonal cycle. However, the only current method for improving thermal conductivity (k) is to reduce its thickness, which sacrifices durability and appearance. Therefore, in this research, a novel solution is established, in which an additive with high k (TCA), aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃), is added into the resin layer of artificial leather at appropriate ratios to improve its thermal conductivity. Currently, the two most adopted production methods are used to develop a prototype without generating any extra cost. The results indicate that the modified leather has a high k, has an aesthetically pleasing appearance and a soft and cool hand feeling. The k of HTCAL is 48.3% higher than that of normal leather. In addition, in wear trials, a larger temperature difference is found between the skin and the HTCAL, indicating that HTCAL has a good heat transfer. Finally, a prototype for an iPhone case is developed and it is established that the method can be used for mass production to realize benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aaluminum oxide 3aclothing 3adurability 3aelectronic equipment 3afabrics 3aheat transfer 3ainsulating materials 3aleather 3anew markets 3aprototypes 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3athermal conductivity 0aartificial leather 0aresin layer 0athermal conductivity 0aadditive1 aWang, Jingping1 aLi, Li0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 20 p.2487-2504dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166733283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245017900184300001400363520163400377592002802011650001302039650001402052650002102066650002502087650001702112650001002129650001402139650000902153650002102162650002002183650001302203650002002216650002702236650001302263650002002276650001002296650002002306650001902326650001402345653001702359653001502376653001902391653001302410653001402423700002902437700002502466700001602491700002402507700002002531700002702551773012202578856009002700852000902790655001202799IND60532537020221120133355.0190405e20141130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053253702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüyükleblebici, Serhat10aCryopreservation of bull sperm: Effects of extender supplemented with different cryoprotectants and antioxidants on sperm motility, antioxidant capacity and fertility results  ap. 77-83.  aThe objectives of this study were to compare glycerol (G) and ethylene glycol (EG) at different concentrations and trehalose (T) or cysteine (C; with/without) in Tris extender for cryopreservation of bull semen. Twenty-four ejaculates obtained from three bulls were included in the study. Each ejaculate was divided into four equal aliquots and diluted using both of the Tris extenders with G (5% or 7%) or EG (3% or 5%). After that, each extenders were divided into three equal aliquots and diluted using both of the 5mM C or 25mM T, and control (without additives) was cooled to 4°C and frozen in 0.25ml French straws. The addition of 3% and 5% EG without antioxidants resulted in the least Computer-Assisted Sperm motility Analysis (CASA) motility as compared with the other groups. Treatment with 25mM T in 3% EG beneficially effected acrosome morphology as compared with the other groups. Also, treatment with 3% EG with 25mM T and 5% EG resulted in a greater rate of total abnormalities. Treatment with 3% G yielded a slightly greater percentage of membrane integrity by Hypo-Osmotic Swelling Test (HOST) assessment than that of the other groups. Treatment with 3% EG with 5mM C resulted in the greatest concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). The glutathione peroxidase (GPx) antioxidant activity was increased in the C-treatment groups when compared to the other groups. Treatment with 5% EG and 5mM C resulted in less chromatin damage and detrimental impacts on tail moment. Treatment with 5% EG led to greater non-return rates of inseminated cows. However, this result was not considered to be statistically important.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3aadditives 3aanimal fertility 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abulls 3achromatin 3acows 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3acysteine 3aethylene glycol 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglycerol 3amalondialdehyde 3asemen 3asemen extenders 3asperm motility 3atrehalose 0aAntioxidants 0aBull semen 0aCryoprotectant 0aFreezing 0aFertility1 aTuncer, Pürhan Barbaros1 aBucak, Mustafa Numan1 aEken, Ayşe1 aSarıözkan, Serpil1 aTaşdemir, Umut1 aEndirlik, Burcu Ünlü0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2014 Nov. 30, v. 150, no. 3-4 p.77-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001800163245006700181300001600248500000900264520160100273592002801874650002201902650000901924650001301933650001701946650001101963650001801974650001901992650001502011650001802026650002102044650001702065700001702082700001702099773012102116856009802237852000902335655001202344IND60665245520221118145751.0191122e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066524552DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1981.0011183X002100060023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFowler, D.

Screening Methods  ap. 896-901.  aepub  aThirty-four biochemical, physiological, and morphological characters of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were evaluated to determine their usefulness in winter survival prediction tests. Differences among cold acclimated plants from genotypes with a range of cold hardiness potential were significant for most of the characters evaluated. Close linear associations were found among many of these characters indicating that there are a number of possible screens which could be utilized as a supplement to field survival trials. However, at best, they are very coarse screens and, for differences of practical concern, size of experimental errors become a major limitation to their usefulness in selecting for field survival potential. Estimates of field survival (FSI) and LT₅₀ had the smallest relative experimental errors and the highest heritability values. Crown LT₅₀ estimates also gave the highest correlation with FSI. However, because LT₅₀ is a destructive test which requires a large number of plants, it is limited to nonsegregating populations, Tissue water content and LT₅₀ explained similar variability in FSI. Because tissue water content was not measured with as great a precision as LT₅₀, it would appear to be less useful as a screen. However, when combined with a measure of plant erectness, tissue water content provided nearly as much information on FSI as did LT₅₀. Both leaf water content and plant erectness can be measured without sacrificing entire plants and therefore they should be helpful winter hardiness screens for use by plant breeders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acold 3agenotype 3aheritability 3aleaves 3aoverwintering 3aplant breeders 3aprediction 3awater content 3awinter hardiness 3awinter wheat1 aGusta, L.

Silver (Ag) is an efficient antimicrobial due to its direct function with the cellular membrane of probe samples. The application of Ag in the textile industry is limited due to its poor stability in repeatedly washing. In this study we synthesized a kind of novel antibacterial fiber containing nano-size silver particles in a reversed emulsion reaction system. The Ag nano-particles are incorporated onto the bamboo fibers solidly through primitive oxidation by sodium periodate. The identification, dependent on Staphylococcus aureus, was implemented to check the influence of the reaction conditions on the antimicrobial property. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species and the leakage of cytoplasmic contents were focused on investigating the antimicrobial mechanism. The antimicrobial assay suggested that samples from inversed micelle and aqueous system own the comparative antibacterial activity. However, samples from an emulsion system could maintain a better bactericidal property than samples from an aqueous system. Meanwhile, the reactive oxygen species and ultraviolet absorption show the same trend consistent with the antibacterial result. This result might be explained by the morphology and size of Ag particles attached on cellulose surface, which was proved by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was revealed that the surface-to-volume ratio of Ag particles played a more crucial role in achieving higher antimicrobial activity than the mass. This approach will provide a practical solution for the synthesis of wash-durable antimicrobial substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aabsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3abamboos 3acell membranes 3acellulose 3aemulsions 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afabrics 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoxidation 3areactive oxygen species 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atextile fibers 3atextile industry 3awashing 0anano silver 0abamboo fiber 0aantimicrobial 0amicroemulsion 0awashing stability1 aLiu, Jian1 aXue, Yong1 aDing, Jiajia1 aHuang, Naizhong1 aGan, Lihui1 aLong, Minnan0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 20 p.2505-2512dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166733293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245008500172520148800257592002801745650001201773650001501785650001401800650001401814650002401828650001101852650001501863650001901878650001801897650003001915650001401945650001501959650001501974650001401989650001102003700001702014700001902031700002102050700002102071700002902092700002502121700002002146700002502166700002402191700002402215700002502239700002902264700002002293773012102313856007902434852000902513655001202522IND60791081520221119070428.0220826e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079108152DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111621392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandhu, Karansher Singh10aIntegrated Approach in Genomic Selection to Accelerate Genetic Gain in Sugarcane  aMarker-assisted selection (MAS) has been widely used in the last few decades in plant breeding programs for the mapping and introgression of genes for economically important traits, which has enabled the development of a number of superior cultivars in different crops. In sugarcane, which is the most important source for sugar and bioethanol, marker development work was initiated long ago; however, marker-assisted breeding in sugarcane has been lagging, mainly due to its large complex genome, high levels of polyploidy and heterozygosity, varied number of chromosomes, and use of low/medium-density markers. Genomic selection (GS) is a proven technology in animal breeding and has recently been incorporated in plant breeding programs. GS is a potential tool for the rapid selection of superior genotypes and accelerating breeding cycle. However, its full potential could be realized by an integrated approach combining high-throughput phenotyping, genotyping, machine learning, and speed breeding with genomic selection. For better understanding of GS integration, we comprehensively discuss the concept of genetic gain through the breeder’s equation, GS methodology, prediction models, current status of GS in sugarcane, challenges of prediction accuracy, challenges of GS in sugarcane, integrated GS, high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), high-throughput genotyping (HTG), machine learning, and speed breeding followed by its prospective applications in sugarcane improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abioethanol 3acultivars 3aequations 3agenetic improvement 3agenome 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3aintrogression 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3apolyploidy 3aprediction 3asugarcane 3asugars1 aShiv, Aalok 1 aKaur, Gurleen 1 aMeena, Mintu Ram1 aRaja, Arun Kumar1 aVengavasi, Krishnapriya 1 aMall, Ashutosh Kumar1 aKumar, Sanjeev 1 aSingh, Praveen Kumar1 aSingh, Jyotsnendra 1 aHemaprabha, Govind 1 aPathak, Ashwini Dutt1 aKrishnappa, Gopalareddy 1 aKumar, Sanjeev 0 tPlants.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111621393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245009200129300001600221520196500237592002802202650001602230650002002246650002302266650002302289650001102312650001402323650001202337650001502349650001002364650001402374650001702388650003102405650001402436650001102450650001402461650002102475650000702496650001002503650002502513650001102538650001902549650002002568650001302588650001302601653002402614653001302638653000902651653002302660653001602683653001502699653001102714653002502725653001002750653001002760653002202770653001402792653001802806653000902824700002002833700002202853773011902875852000902994655001203003IND60563384620221121233445.0170215e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056338462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiadi, Noura10aCrop yield and soil fertility as affected by papermill biosolids and liming by-products  ap. 319-328.  aZiadi, N., Gagnon, B. and Nyiraneza, J. 2013. Crop yield and soil fertility as affected by papermill biosolids and liming by-products. Can. J. Soil Sci. 93: 319-328. Papermill biosolids (PB) in combination with alkaline industrial residuals could benefit agricultural soils while diverting these biosolids from landfill. A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the effect of three types of PB at rates of 0, 30, and 60 wet Mg ha⁻¹, as well as five liming by-products at 3 wet Mg ha⁻¹ along with 30 Mg PB ha⁻¹ on crop yield, nutrient accumulation, and soil properties. De-inking paper biosolids (DB, C/N of 65) were applied to soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and two combined PB (PB₁, C/N of 31; and PB₂, C/N of 14) were applied to dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), respectively. The liming by-products included lime mud (LM), wood ash (WA) from paper mills, commercial calcitic lime (CL), Mg dissolution by-product (MgD), and Mg smelting and electrolysis work (MgSE). Compared with the control, PB₂ increased barley yield and total Mg and Na accumulation, and both PB increased plant N, P, and Ca accumulation in barley and dry bean. The impact of DB on soybean was limited. The addition of liming by-products to PB or DB did not affect crop attributes except the combination with MgSE, which severely reduced the growth of dry bean and, to a lesser extent, soybean. Soil NO₃-N was immobilized following DB application, whereas there was a net release with both PB. Combining PB and liming by-products produced the greatest changes in soil properties at harvest. Generally, LM and CL raised pH and Mehlich-3 Ca, and MgSE caused a strong increase in Mehlich-3 Mg and Na and water-soluble Cl. When used with appropriate crops, biosolids from paper mills and alkaline residuals other than MgSE can efficiently enhance soil fertility by providing organic C and macronutrients for balanced crop fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aHordeum vulgare 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aagricultural soils 3abarley 3abiosolids 3acalcium 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adry beans 3aelectrolysis 3agreenhouse experimentation 3alandfills 3aliming 3amagnesium 3anitrate nitrogen 3apH 3apaper 3apulp and paper mills 3asodium 3asoil fertility 3asoil properties 3asoybeans 3awood ash 0aPapermill biosolids 0anitrogen 0alime 0aalkaline residuals 0asalt effect 0aleguminous 0abarley 0aBiosolides papetiers 0aazote 0achaux 0arésidus alcalins 0asalinité 0alégumineuses 0aorge1 aGagnon, Bernard1 aNyiraneza, Judith0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2013 Aug., v. 93, no. 3 p.319-328dCanadian Science Publishingx1918-18417nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008700159300001800246500002000264520152800284592002801812650001101840650003001851650001101881650002401892650001001916650002401926650001101950650001001961650000901971650002001980650002302000650000902023650001402032700001902046700002102065700001402086700002102100700001902121700002002140700001302160700001902173700002302192700002002215773009902235856007402334852000902408655001202417IND60580125820221121103815.0170909e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058012582DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.141442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wen‐Rong10aCRISPR/Cas9‐mediated loss of FGF5 function increases wool staple length in sheep  ap. 2764-2773.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) regulates hair length in humans and a variety of other animals. To investigate whether FGF5 has similar effects in sheep, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR‐associated 9 (Cas9) to generate loss‐of‐function mutations with the FGF5 gene in Chinese Merino sheep. A total of 16 lambs were identified with genetic mutations within the targeting locus: 13 lambs had biallelic modifications and three lambs had monoallelic modifications. Characterization of the modifications revealed that 13 were frameshift mutations that led to premature termination, whereas the other three were in‐frame deletions. Thus, CRISPR/Cas9 efficiently generated loss‐of‐function mutations in the sheep FGF5 gene. We then investigated the effect of loss of FGF5 function on wool traits in 12 lambs and found that wool staple length and stretched length of genetically modified (GM) yearling sheep were significantly longer compared with that of wild‐type (WT) control animals. The greasy fleece weight of GM yearling sheep was also significantly greater compared with that of WT sheep. Moreover, the mean fiber diameter in GM sheep showed no significant difference compared with WT sheep, suggesting that the increase in greasy fleece weight was likely attributed to the increase in wool length. The results of this study suggest that CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated loss of FGF5 activity could promote wool growth and, consequently, increase wool length and yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3afibroblast growth factors 3afleece 3aframeshift mutation 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3ahumans 3alambs 3aloci 3astaple (fibers) 3atransgenic animals 3awool 3ayearlings1 aLiu, Chen‐Xi1 aZhang, Xue‐Mei1 aChen, Lei1 aPeng, Xin‐Rong1 aHe, San‐Gang1 aLin, Jia‐Peng1 aHan, Bin1 aWang, Li‐Qin1 aHuang, Jun‐Cheng1 aLiu, Ming‐Jun0 tFEBS journal.g2017 Sept., v. 284, no. 17 p.2764-2773dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.141443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245008900198300002000287506007600307520072900383592002801112506003701140650001501177650004901192650001801241650001001259650002501269650001101294650001101305650002001316650001401336650001601350700002501366700002001391700002001411773012401431856007401555852000901629655001201638IND60640872620221207130626.0190505e20160629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064087262DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11372a2doi7 aPMC54073012pmcid7 a284588822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Meng-xia10aRadicals from the gas-phase pyrolysis of a lignin model compound: p-coumaryl alcohol  ap. 62399-62405.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe intermediate radicals produced in the gas-phase pyrolysis of one of the main building blocks of lignin – p-coumaryl alcohol (p-CMA) – were investigated using the low temperature matrix isolation technique interfaced with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (LTMI-EPR). An anisotropic EPR spectrum characterized by a high g-value (>2.0080) and a relatively low saturation coefficient (∼1.40) throughout the high pyrolytic temperature region (700 to 1000 °C) was observed. Theoretical calculations revealed plausible decomposition pathways for p-CMA comprising highly delocalized aromatic radicals. The results provide evidence for a dominant role of oxygen-centered radicals during the pyrolysis of p-CMA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanisotropy 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afree radicals 3agases 3aisolation techniques 3alignin 3amodels 3ap-coumaric acid 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aKhachatryan, Lavrent1 aBaev, Alexander1 aAsatryan, Rubik0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 29, v. 6, no. 67 p.62399-62405dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11372a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245014800170300001600318520159000334592002801924653002701952653001201979653001401991653001502005653000802020700001602028700002802044700001702072700002002089773012502109856007602234852000902310655001202319IND60681615620221119185619.0200226e20161130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068161562DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2016.00772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, E.

The effects of strains of Propionibacterium acidipropionici isolated from poultry intestine on microbiota activity and intestinal mucosa development were investigated in the early stage of rearing chicks and the safety of the dose used was investigated. The strains P. acidipropionici LET105 and LET107, administered as monoculture to chicks from the 1ˢᵗ to 14ᵗʰ day of life in a daily dose of 106 cfu/ml administered in the drinking water resulted harmless. The animals arrived at the expected weight for age and no differences were observed with respect to the food intake and water consumption related to control without bacteria administration. The analysis of microbiota composition revealed the presence of propionibacteria at the middle and end of the trial only in treated groups. Normal development of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, and slow colonisation by Bacteroides at the 7ᵗʰ day of the study was observed in the same groups. Analysis of the organic acids concentrations in the caecal content of birds revealed higher lactic acid and lower butyric acid production. Lower short chain fatty acids total concentration than expected during treatment was related to a better development of the gut mucosa. Increase in length of villus-crypt units, goblet cells counts and neutral mucins production were evidenced. Higher mucus secretion produced by dietary supplementation with propionibacteria could provide increased protection against pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 0adairy propionibacteria 0achicken 0aprobiotic 0amicrobiota 0agut1 aBabot, J.D.1 aLorenzo-Pisarello, M.J.1 aApella, M.C.1 aChaia, A.

Soil mineral nitrogen responses following liquid hog manure application to semiarid forage lands. Can. J. Soil Sci. 93: 369-378. Expansion of intensive livestock operations into semiarid regions lacking cultivated lands requires consideration of perennial forages for the efficient and sustainable disposal of manure. Little information exists on the nutrient dynamics associated with the application of manure to these areas. We examined soil mineral nitrogen (N) responses in four sites of the mixed-grass prairie, including two native grasslands and two introduced pastures, following different seasons (fall vs. spring), methods (dribble broadcast vs. coulter injected) and rates of liquid hog manure application (9.4, 18.8, 37.5, 75 and 150 kg ha⁻¹ available N). Soil mineral N, including NO₃-N, NH₄-N and total mineral N, were assessed after application but prior to plant growth in April 1999, and again one growing season later in April 2000. Initial soil N did not vary with season of application. Soil mineral N predictably increased with application rate, but only in the upper soil profile (0-20 cm). Decreases in soil mineral N after one growing season in all treatments highlighted the ability of these perennial forage lands to immobilize large amounts of soil N, a significant portion of which was related to N uptake by vegetation. Compared with broadcast application, manure injection led to 35% greater soil mineral N (both NO₃ and NH₄) prior to plant growth, a response that persisted 1 yr later (+12%), thus demonstrating the N conserved benefits of manure incorporation. Overall, increases in soil mineral N within these forage lands appeared to be relatively short-term in nature, largely depleting over the course of a single growing season, suggesting one-time liquid hog manure application at low to moderate rates may be sustainable in this region of the mixed-grass prairie.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3aammonium nitrogen 3aapplication rate 3aautumn 3aforage 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3alivestock 3amanure spreading 3amineral soils 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3apastures 3apig manure 3aplant growth 3asemiarid zones 3asoil profiles 3aspring 0aCoulter injection 0aintroduced pasture 0aliquid hog manure 0amineral nitrogen 0anative grassland 0anitrogen recovery1 aLambert, B.

Using remote sensing data from 2000 to 2012, factors that drive land-use conversions, including environmental and socio-economic characteristics, are explored. This study also adopts spatial techniques to allow for neighborhood effects from land-use activities in neighboring areas. Key findings include the following: higher land suitability hinders the process of agricultural land abandonment; road density prohibits agricultural land conversion to natural land; the implementation of conservation sites protects land in its natural status; and land-use activities have strong neighborhood effects on nearby regions. Incorporating spatial interactions can generate less biased empirical results and provide more accurate policy recommendations. In addition, an investigation of bi-directional land-use transitions helps to better understand the associated gains and losses between agriculture and natural land and offers further insights into the effectiveness of preservation programs that aim to protect wild space and maintain ecological balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabandoned land 3aagricultural land 3aecological balance 3aissues and policy 3aland suitability 3aland use change 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asocioeconomics 3aspatial data 3aAlberta 0aLand use conversion 0aAgricultural land abandonment 0aAgricultural land expansion 0aSpatial regression model 0aNeighborhood effect1 aQiu, Feng1 aRuan, Xiaofeng0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 221 p.222-234dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013800168300001600306520125100322592002801573650001901601650001501620650001201635650002001647650002101667650001501688650001301703650001901716650002101735650002001756700001401776700001501790700001701805700001501822773010301837856008201940852000902022655001202031IND60091546920221119192020.0141103e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009154692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Bingying10aHighly sensitive electrochemical detection of cocaine on graphene/AuNP modified electrode via catalytic redox-recycling amplification  ap. 305-308.  aWe demonstrated a new strategy for highly sensitive electrochemical detection of cocaine by using two engineered aptamers in connection to redox-recycling signal amplification. The graphene/AuNP nanocomposites were electrochemically deposited on a screen printed carbon electrode to enhance the electron transfers. The cocaine primary binding aptamers were self-assembled on the electrode surface through sulfur–Au interactions. The presence of the target cocaine and the biotin-modified secondary binding aptamers leads to the formation of sandwich complexes on the electrode surface. The streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) were used as labels to generate quantitative signals. The addition of the ALP substrate and the co-reactant NADH results in the formation of a redox cycle between the enzymatic product and the electrochemically oxidized species and the signal is thus significantly amplified. Because of the effective modification of the sensing surface and signal amplification, low nanomolar (1nM) detection limit for cocaine is achieved. The proposed aptamer-based sandwich sensing approach for amplified detection of cocaine thus opens new opportunities for highly sensitive determination of other small molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3abiosensors 3acocaine 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3aoligonucleotides 3aredox reactions1 aWang, Min1 aChen, Ying1 aXie, Jiaqing1 aXiang, Yun0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 32, no. 1 p.305-308dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245013000158300001600288520177100304592002802075653001302103653001602116653001202132653001402144653001702158700001202175700001702187700001602204700001402220700001802234773012502252856007602377852000902453655001202462IND60681615720221119185421.0200226e20161130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068161572DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2016.00802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPender, C.M.10aEffects of in ovo supplementation of probiotics on performance and immunocompetence of broiler chicks to an Eimeria challenge  ap. 699-705.  aCoccidiosis is regarded as the parasitic disease with the greatest economic impact on the poultry industry due to reduced performance and increased mortality. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of in ovo administration of probiotics on hatchability, performance, immune organ weights, and lesion scores in broiler chicks during a mixed Eimeria infection. At embryonic day 18, 210 eggs were injected with either sterile water or 1×10⁶ cfu probiotic bacteria. On day 3 post-hatch, half of the chicks from each treatment group were challenged with a mixed inoculum of Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima and Eimeria tenella. Measurements and tissue samples were taken on day of hatch (DOH) and days 3, 9 and 15. On day 9, 24 birds per treatment were scored for intestinal Eimeria lesions. No differences were seen among groups for hatchability as well as for body weight (BW), BW gain (BWG), or immune organ weights prior to the Eimeria challenge. On day 9, the non-challenged birds with probiotic supplementation had higher BW and BWG than the non-supplemented controls while no differences were seen among the challenged groups. On day 15, probiotic supplemented birds had improved BW compared to the non-supplemented birds as well as increased BWG from day 9 to 15. Bursa weight was not affected by treatment at any time point while spleen weight was greater in supplemented birds on day 15. Birds receiving the probiotic had significantly lower mortality than non-treated birds. Additionally, gross lesion severity was reduced due to probiotic supplementation in all intestinal segments evaluated. These results suggest that in ovo supplementation of probiotics may improve early performance and provide protection against a mixed Eimeria infection.  aPublisher supplied data 0aimmunity 0acoccidiosis 0apoultry 0achallenge 0aalternatives1 aKim, S.1 aPotter, T.D.1 aRitzi, M.M.1 aYoung, M.1 aDalloul, R.A.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2016 Nov. 30, v. 7, no. 5 p.699-705dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2016.00803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245010600161300001400267520053900281592002800820650001500848650001000863650002000873650001200893650001400905653001300919653002400932653002500956653001400981700001800995773008901013856003801102852000901140655001201149IND50061719120221120200910.0130320s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006171912DNAL7 a10.1071/AM120032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStannard, Hayley J.10aDescription of the gastrointestinal tract and associated organs of the kultarr (Antechinomys laniger)  ap. 39-42.  aThis paper provides a macro- and microscopic description of the digestive tract of the kultarr (Antechinomys laniger), a small dasyurid marsupial.

Promoterless vectors, which do not possess a promoter to drive marker gene expression, confer higher targeting efficiencies than conventional vectors due to the reduced number of drug‐resistant clones. We here show that gene‐targeting efficiency is typically ≥ 25% with the use of exon‐trapping‐type promoterless vectors in a human diploid cell line, Nalm‐6. The efficiency of exon‐trapping gene targeting was correlated with the level of target gene expression when a 2A peptide sequence was linked to the marker gene. Intriguingly, total arm length was not necessarily a determinant of targeting efficiency, as longer arms tend to enhance both homologous (targeted) and nonhomologous (nontargeted) integration of the vector; rather, the presence of an exon in the 5′ arm led to a decreased targeting efficiency. Strikingly, loss of Rad54 did not severely affect the targeting efficiency of exon‐trap vectors. Moreover, additional deletion of the Rad54 paralog Rad54B had limited impact on the high‐efficiency gene targeting. These results indicate that targeted integration occurs in human cells even when both Rad54 and Rad54B are missing. These studies provide additional important insight into the contribution of various DNA repair factors on the targeting mechanics.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanics 3ahuman cell lines 3adiploidy 3ahumans 3aclones 3agene expression 3agene targeting 3ahomologous recombination 3aDNA repair 3aexons 3agenetic markers 3adrug resistance 0agenes1 aKurosawa, Aya1 aAdachi, Noritaka0 tFEBS journal.g2017 Sept., v. 284, no. 17 p.2748-2763dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.141373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009400174300001800268500000900286520090800295592002801203650001301231650001201244650001601256650000901272650001401281650001401295650001701309650000901326650001301335650001401348650001001362650001601372700002101388700002301409773013401432856008701566852000901653655001201662IND60665246020221118145916.0191228e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066524602DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2006-03-0149tpg2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTracy, William F.10aRecurrent Mutation and Genome Evolution: Example of Sugary1 and the Origin of Sweet Maize  ap.

The traditional North American sweet maize is homozygous for a recessive sugary1 (su1) allele. Determining the number of unique alleles among su1 maize races is relevant to the debate in archeology and evolutionary biology over whether independent mutation or migration plays a dominant role in the spread of novel phenotypes. We sequenced su1 from 57 cultivars of su1 maize and determined that five independent mutations have been selected. Three of these five alleles were single base pair changes at highly conserved sites and a fourth was a 1.3-kbp transposon. It will be interesting to note if future study in a variety of disciplines will lead to consensus on the significant role of recurrent mutation in evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3aarchaeology 3acorn 3acultivars 3aevolution 3ahomozygosity 3aloci 3amutation 3aphenotype 3araces 3atransposons1 aWhitt, Sherry R.1 aBuckler, Edward S.0 tCrop science.g2006 Nov., v. 46, no.

In this context, chitosan of fungal origin was introduced as a new tool to control B. bruxellensis in the context of winemaking. Recent studies have showed the impact of a fungal origin chitosan application on wines contaminated with B. bruxellensis, leading to the elimination of B. bruxellensis cells. In these studies, the chitosan preparation was added, the wine racked off after 10 days and the efficiency of the treatment was evaluated in a short delay after the treatment. This study focused on the evaluation of the impact of different addition protocols of an enological chitosan preparation on B. bruxellensis population evolution and volatile phenols content along the aging, up to 9 months. The results confirm the interest of fungal origin chitosan as a preventive tool to control B. bruxellensis in the context of wine aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3afungi 3aphenols 3aprotocols 3awine aging 3awine quality 3awines 0aBrettanomyces bruxellensis 0achitosan 0awine aging1 aVagnoli, Paola1 aMinacci, Andrea1 aGautier, Sandrine1 aSieczkowski, Nathalie0 tWine studies.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 3, no. 1dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, ItalywJournal:21535x2039-44467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ws.2014.45743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011700172300001600289520177400305592002802079650002402107650001502131650002302146650001502169650002202184650001602206650000902222650002602231650002302257650001902280650001502299650000902314650001102323650001602334650001502350651001102365700002502376700002202401700002202423700001902445700002402464773010302488856008202591852000902673655001202682IND60091547020221119191736.0141103e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009154702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedman, Elliot S.12aA cost-effective and field-ready potentiostat that poises subsurface electrodes to monitor bacterial respiration  ap. 309-313.  aHere, we present the proof-of-concept for a subsurface bioelectrochemical system (BES)-based biosensor capable of monitoring microbial respiration that occurs through exocellular electron transfer. This system includes our open-source design of a three-channel microcontroller-unit (MCU)-based potentiostat that is capable of chronoamperometry, which laboratory tests showed to be accurate within 0.95±0.58% (95% Confidence Limit) of a commercial potentiostat. The potentiostat design is freely available online: http://angenent.bee.cornell.edu/potentiostat.html. This robust and field-ready potentiostat, which can withstand temperatures of −30°C, can be manufactured at relatively low cost ($600), thus, allowing for en-masse deployment at field sites. The MCU-based potentiostat was integrated with electrodes and a solar panel-based power system, and deployed as a biosensor to monitor microbial respiration in drained thaw lake basins outside Barrow, AK. At three different depths, the working electrode of a microbial three-electrode system (M3C) was maintained at potentials corresponding to the microbial reduction of iron(III) compounds and humic acids. Thereby, the working electrode mimics these compounds and is used by certain microbes as an electron acceptor. The sensors revealed daily cycles in microbial respiration. In the medium- and deep-depth electrodes the onset of these cycles followed a considerable increase in overall activity that corresponded to those soils reaching temperatures conducive to microbial activity as the summer thaw progressed. The BES biosensor is a valuable tool for studying microbial activity in situ in remote environments, and the cost-efficient design of the potentiostat allows for wide-scale use in remote areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrochemistry 3abiosensors 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3ahumic acids 3airon 3alaboratory techniques 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3amonitoring 3asoil 3asummer 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aAlaska1 aRosenbaum, Miriam A.1 aLee, Alexander W.1 aLipson, David A.,1 aLand, Bruce R.1 aAngenent, Largus T.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 32, no. 1 p.309-313dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011500172520099900287592002801286650002501314650001101339650001401350650002001364650001901384650002301403650002001426650002101446650001101467650001301478650000901491653002201500653002301522653002301545653003201568700002201600700001801622700002501640773010001665856008701765852000901852655001201861IND60727618320221119161715.0220606e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072761832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1292462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartini, Serena10aBlack, green, and pink pepper affect differently lipid oxidation during cooking and in vitro digestion of meat  aLipid oxidation products generated during meat digestion may contribute to the apparent epidemiological link between red meat intake and the risk of cardiovascular diseases and colorectal cancer. The aim of this work was to assess the lipid oxidation inhibitory activity of black, green, and pink pepper during cooking and in vitro digestion of meat. Peppers were characterized for their phenolic profiles by LC-ESI-MS and the antioxidant properties. Pink pepper showed the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activities. Then, the peppers were added to meat either before or after cooking, and the meat was subjected to in vitro digestion. Pink pepper added before cooking was the most effective, with an inhibition of 80% and 72% in lipid hydroperoxides and TBA-RS formation after digestion, respectively. These findings suggest that peppers, particularly pink pepper, can be used to minimize lipid oxidation in the gastro-intestinal tract and for the design of healthy dietary patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adesign 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3afood chemistry 3alipid peroxidation 3alipid peroxides 3ameat consumption 3apepper 3ared meat 3arisk 0aMass spectrometry 0aPhenolic compounds 0aLipid peroxidation 0aGastro-intestinal digestion1 aCattivelli, Alice1 aConte, Angela1 aTagliazucchi, Davide0 tFood chemistry.g2021 July 15, v. 350 p.129246-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1292463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245014600160300001600306520184100322592002802163653000902191653001402200653003202214653002002246653002302266653000902289653002002298700001602318700001602334700002302350700001902373700001702392773012502409856007602534852000902610655001202619IND60681615920221119185350.0200226e20161130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068161592DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2016.00892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFabbrocini, G.10aSupplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus SP1 normalises skin expression of genes implicated in insulin signalling and improves adult acne  ap. 625-630.  aSystemic supplementation with probiotics is increasingly being explored as a potential treatment strategy for skin disorders. Because both the gut-skin axis and dysregulation of insulin signalling have been implicated in the pathogenesis of adult acne, we designed the current study to evaluate the effect of supplementation with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus SP1 (LSP1) on skin expression of genes involved in insulin signalling and acne improvement in adult subjects. A pilot, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 20 adult subjects (14 females and 6 males; mean age: 33.7±3.3 years) with acne. Over a 12-week period, the probiotic group (n=10) consumed a liquid supplement containing LSP1 at a dose of 3×109 cfu/day (75 mg/day), whereas the placebo group (n=10) received a liquid lacking probiotics. Paired skin biopsies – one obtained before treatment initiation and one obtained at the end of the 12-week treatment period – were analysed for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) gene expression. The clinical criterion for efficacy was the investigator's global improvement rating on a five-point scale. Compared with baseline, the probiotic group showed a 32% (P<0.001) reduction, as well as a 65% increase (P<0.001) in IGF1 and FOXO1 gene expression in the skin, respectively. No such differences were observed in the placebo group. Patients in the probiotic group had an adjusted odds ratio of 28.4 (95% confidence interval = 2.2-411.1, P<0.05) to be rated by physicians as improved/markedly improved (versus worsened or unchanged) compared with the placebo group. We conclude that supplementation with the probiotic strain LSP1 normalises skin expression of genes involved in insulin signalling and improves the appearance of adult acne.  aPublisher supplied data 0aacne 0aprobiotic 0aLactobacillus rhamnosus SP1 0asupplementation 0ainsulin signalling 0askin 0agene expression1 aBertona, M.1 aPicazo, Ó.1 aPareja-Galeano, H.1 aMonfrecola, G.1 aEmanuele, E.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2016 Nov. 30, v. 7, no. 5 p.625-630dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2016.00893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245008000166300001400246520159100260592002801851650001001879650001201889650001701901650001601918650002301934650001001957650001101967650001001978651001901988700002002007700001702027773009402044856008402138852000902222655001202231IND4472717620221119092435.0150808e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447271762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.01.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillem, R.M.10aUsing chemo-taxonomy of host ants to help conserve the large blue butterfly  ap. 39-43.  aThe large blue butterfly (Phengaris arion) is an endangered Palaearctic species that was reintroduced into the British Isles after becoming extinct in 1979. The conservation of this butterfly in Britain is extremely important as it is a priority species under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. P. arion larvae are highly specialised parasitizing the ant Myrmica sabuleti, but are also adopted into nests of other Myrmica species, particularly M. scabrinodis, where they are unable to survive. Therefore, it is critical for the success of any introduction programme to ensure that the correct host ant species is present. This poses a major challenge since Myrmica ants, especially M. sabuleti and M. scabrinodis, are morphologically extremely similar with the correct identification proving problematic even for the trained myrmecologist. Here we demonstrate that chemo-taxonomy can be used as a fast, cheap and accurate way to separate morphologically similar species. We found that using the simple presence or absence of just two species-specific compounds found on the antâs cuticle we could easily, reliably and quickly separate M. sabuleti (5-methylpentacosane) from M. scabrinodis (3-methyltricosane) from samples taken from across Britain. This knowledge will help increase the success of future reintroduction programmes of P.arion by allowing non-specialists to ensure the correct host species is present prior to any introduction. To our knowledge, this is the first time that chemo-taxonomy has been applied specifically to aid the conservation of an endangered species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArion 3aMyrmica 3abiodiversity 3abutterflies 3aendangered species 3ahosts 3alarvae 3anests 3aUnited Kingdom1 aDrijfhout, F.P.1 aMartin, S.J.0 tBiological conservation.g2012 Apr., v. 148, no. 1 p.39-43dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.01.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011300164300001600277520163500293592002801928650001301956650002101969650000901990650001201999650001302011650001302024650002702037650001402064650001602078653002102094653002002115653002902135653002202164653001002186700001602196700001802212700001702230700001902247700001502266773016102281856008102442852000902523655001202532IND60736772720221120231226.0220228e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073677272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2021.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Jiapeng10aBrassinosteroids modulate nitrogen physiological response and promote nitrogen uptake in maize (Zea mays L.)  ap. 166-176.  aBrassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that function in plant growth and development and response to environmental stresses and nutrient supplies. However, few studies have investigated the effect of BRs in modulating the physiological response to nitrogen (N) supply in maize. In the present study, BR signaling-deficient mutant zmbri1-RNAi lines and exogenous application of 2,4-epibrassinolide (eBL) were used to study the role of BRs in the regulation of physiological response in maize seedlings supplied with N. Exogenous application of eBL increased primary root length and plant biomass, but zmbri1 plants showed shorter primary roots and less plant biomass than wild-type plants under low N (LN) and normal N (NN) conditions. LN induced the expression of the BR signaling-associated genes ZmDWF4, ZmCPD, ZmDET2, and ZmBZR1 and the production of longer primary roots than NN. Knockdown of ZmBRI1 weakened the biological effects of LN-induced primary root elongation. eBL treatment increased N accumulation in shoots and roots of maize seedlings exposed to LN or NN treatment. Correspondingly, zmbri1 plants showed lower N accumulation in shoots and roots than wild-type plants. Along with reduced N accumulation, zmbri1 plants showed lower NO₃⁻ fluxes and ¹⁵NO₃⁻ uptake. The expression of nitrate transporter (NRT) genes (ZmNPF6.4, ZmNPF6.6, ZmNRT2.1, ZmNRT2.2) was lower in zmbri1 than in wild-type roots, but eBL treatments up-regulated the transcript expression of NRT genes. Thus, BRs modulated N physiological response and regulated the transcript expression of NRT genes to promote N uptake in maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abrassinosteroids 3acorn 3amutants 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphysiological response 3aphytomass 3aroot growth 0aBrassinosteroids 0aNitrogen uptake 0aNitrate transporter gene 0aRoot architecture 0aMaize1 aWang, Yubin1 aYao, Qingqing1 aZhang, Yushi1 aZhang, Mingcai1 aLi, Zhaohu0 tcrop journal.g2022 Feb., v. 10, no. 1 p.166-176dElsevier B.V.aCrop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop SciencewJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2021.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245010300161300001600264520148800280592002801768653002401796653001401820653001401834653003201848653001301880700001601893700001501909700001701924773012501941856007602066852000902142655001202151IND60681616220221119185605.0200226e20170426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068161622DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2016.00962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuwerkerk, J.P.10aPreparation and preservation of viable Akkermansia muciniphila cells for therapeutic interventions  ap. 163-169.  aThe anaerobic gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila is a well-characterised member of the mucosal microbiota and has shown to be a gut symbiont in human. A. muciniphila has been negatively associated with obesity and its associated metabolic disorders in various human cohorts while treatment with A. muciniphila cells reversed highfat diet-induced obesity and its associated metabolic disorders in mouse models. Therefore, administration of A. muciniphila has been suggested as a possible new therapeutic treatment for these omnipresent diseases. Here we describe a potentially scalable workflow for the preparation and preservation of high numbers of viable cells of A. muciniphila obtained from 1 l laboratory scale growth under strict anaerobic conditions for therapeutic interventions. This resulted in viable A. muciniphila cells with high yields and very high stability, with up to 97.9±4.5% survival for a time period of 1 year at -80 °C in glycerol-amended medium. Moreover, various quality assessment and control procedures were developed to ensure the use of viable cells of A. muciniphila. Several microscopic, culturing, and molecular approaches were applied to monitor the presence, abundance and recovery of A. muciniphila before, during, and after its administration to high-fat treated mice. We show that viable A. muciniphila cells can be recovered from caecal and colon content (up to 1×10¹⁰ cells/g), testifying for the efficiency of the described workflow.  aPublisher supplied data 0atherapeutic microbe 0astability 0aviability 0alaboratory scale production 0adelivery1 aAalvink, S.1 aBelzer, C.1 aDe Vos, W.M.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2017 Apr. 26, v. 8, no. 2 p.163-169dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2016.00963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134040001800171100002300189245009300212300001800305500000900323506002800332506003000360520155600390592002801946596004501974596004602019506003702065650002302102650001202125650001402137650001402151650001502165650001902180650004302199650001402242650001402256650001402270650002202284650002002306650002802326650001602354650001502370650002002385650002102405650001702426700002102443700001902464700001702483700002102500700002302521773013302544856008402677903002202761852000902783655001202792IND60665246420221207140806.0191122e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066524642DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2015.05.02812chorus7 a10.2135/cropsci2015.05.02812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrapp, Jennifer J.10aSelective Phenotyping Traits Related to Multiple Stress and Drought Response in Dry Bean  ap. 1460-1472.  aepub  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aAbiotic stress tolerance in dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is complex. Increased population sizes are contributing to finding QTL conditioning stress response but phenotyping has not kept pace with high throughput genotyping for such studies. Our objectives were to determine effectiveness of 20 most tolerant and 20 most susceptible lines representing phenotypic extremes from a RIL population (‘Buster’ × ‘Roza’ [BR]) to facilitate examination of 19 traits for relevance to stress response and to validate existing QTL conditioning stress response. Using phenotypic extremes tested across multiple trials, eight of the 19 traits were clearly associated with drought stress. Pod wall ratio (PW), plant biomass by weight or a visual rating, and greenness index (NDVI) were most associated with seed yield (SY) under stress followed by phenology traits. The phenotypic extreme lines were also useful for validating QTL previously identified in the whole RIL population conditioning SY, seed weight (SW) and days to flower (DF), harvest maturity (HM), and seed fill (DSF). New QTL were identified for biomass, PW, and NDVI which co-segregated with major QTL for seed yield SY1.1ᴮᴿ and SY2.1ᴮᴿ. The preliminary finding of NDVI 1.1ᴮᴿ supports aerial imaging in larger genetic populations geared toward QTL analysis of stress response. In summary, phenotypic extremes helped sort through traits relevant to stress response in the Buster × Roza RIL population and verified the effect of two major QTL in response to terminal drought.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSAIDdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000002000 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3adrought 3adry beans 3aflowering 3agenotyping 3aimage analysis 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aphytomass 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3awater stress1 aUrrea, Carlos A.1 aZhou, Jianfeng1 aKhot, Lav R.1 aSankaran, Sindhu1 aMiklas, Phillip N.0 tCrop science.g2016 July, v. 56, no. 4 p.1460-1472dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2015.05.02813Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008700166300001600253520089400269592002801163650001501191650002601206650003301232650001601265650002101281650001401302650002201316650001801338651001001356700001801366700001901384700001901403773009501422856004801517852000901565655001201574IND50062223720221119155948.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006222372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-012-0817-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiao-Ming12aA new species of Lophodermium associated with the needle cast of Cathay silver fir  ap. 141-149.  aCathay silver fir, Cathaya argyrophylla, is a national first-class protected species in China and honored as a “living fossil” of the plant kingdom. Recently, a needle cast of Cathay silver fir of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China was investigated. This pathogen not only reduces the host ornamental value, but seriously affects the growth of this endangered plant. In this paper, the needle cast, formerly misidentified as Lophodermium pinastri, is identified as Lophodermium cathayae. L. cathayae differs morphologically from L. pinastri in many aspects, but particularly in anamorph morphology. An analysis of the internal transcribed spacer of rDNA shows that L. cathayae is closely related to L. pinastri and that further study is required in order to update the circumscription of L. pinastri. The fungal diversity conservation for new species L. cathayae is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aLophodermium pinastri 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew species 3aornamental value 3apathogens 3aprotected species 3aribosomal DNA 3aChina1 aLin, Yingren,1 aHuang, Hua-Yan1 aHou, Cheng-Lin0 tMycological progress.g2013 Feb., v. 12, no. 1 p.141-149dSpringer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-012-0817-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016700168300001300335520122900348592002801577650002201605650002201627650001301649650001601662650002301678650001601701650001301717650001401730650001201744650001101756650001901767650002601786650001901812650001301831650002501844650001301869650002001882650001601902650001001918700001901928700002001947700002101967700002001988700002302008773010802031856004802139852000902187655001202196IND50064079920221119053903.0130824e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006407992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1478-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCopaciu, Florina10aDiffuse Water Pollution by Anthraquinone and Azo Dyes in Environment Importantly Alters Foliage Volatiles, Carotenoids and Physiology in Wheat (Triticum aestivum)  ap. 1478.  aTo gain insight into the effects of aqueous solutions of different dyes on plant performance and identify the most promising traits for fast assessment of toxicity, we studied the influences of two anthraquinone dyes (Optilan Blue and Lanasyn Blue) and four azo dyes (Lanasyn Red, Nylosan Red, Nylosan Dark Brown and Lanasyn Dark Brown) at two different concentrations (0.5 and 1.5 mg l -1) on foliage photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments and emissions of lipoxygenase pathway products (LOX; green leaf volatiles) and monoterpenes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. "Lovrin"). Net assimilation rate was only inhibited by the highest concentration of Nylosan Red, while stomatal conductance to water vapor was strongly influenced by all azo dyes. Concentrations of photosynthetic pigments, chlorophylls and carotenoids, were most strongly reduced in treatments with azo dyes especially with those which contained chromium in their molecular structure. These data collectively indicate important reduction of foliage physiological activity by textile dyes and indicate that emissions of leaf volatiles can provide a promising tool to assess the toxicity of different dyes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aaqueous solutions 3aazo dyes 3acarotenoids 3achemical structure 3achlorophyll 3achromium 3aemissions 3afabrics 3aleaves 3amonoterpenoids 3anet assimilation rate 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3astomatal conductance 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3awater vapor 3awheat1 aOpriş, Ocsana1 aComan, Virginia1 aRistoiu, Dumitru1 aNiinemets, Ulo,1 aCopolovici, Lucian0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2013 Mar., v. 224, no. 3 p.1478-1478dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1478-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009500169300001800264500000900282520141700291592002801708650001901736650002201755650001201777650002201789650001101811650001301822650001401835650001401849650001401863650001201877650001701889650001901906650001501925700002101940700001901961773013401980856008402114852000902198655001202207IND60665246620221118145907.0191122e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066524662DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2016.01.00412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Habibur10aPatterns of Heterosis in Three Distinct Inbred Populations of Spring Brassica napus Canola  ap. 2536-2545.  aepub  aAllelic diversity of the allied species of Brassica napus L. as well as of the winter form of this species has been demonstrated to be related with increasing productivity of hybrid spring B. napus cultivars. To compare potential value of the different gene pools of Brassica species three spring B. napus inbred populations were developed by use of a B. oleracea L. line, a spring B. napus breeding line, and a winter B. napus cultivar crossed to a spring B. napus ‘Hi-Q’; and test hybrids of these inbred lines were produced by crossing with Hi-Q as the common tester. Mid-parent heterosis (MPH) showed a negative correlation with seed yield of the inbred lines in all three populations; however, a positive correlation existed between seed yield of the inbred lines and heterosis over Hi-Q (HiQH) (or, inbred vs. hybrid yield). On average, the level of MPH in hybrid of the inbred lines derived from B. napus × B. oleracea cross was twice greater than the level of heterosis found for the inbred lines derived from spring × spring or winter × spring B. napus crosses. The inbred population derived from winter × spring cross gave highest seed yield, and this population also gave highest HiQH. The results suggested that B. oleracea and winter canola could be used in spring B. napus canola breeding for accumulating additive and non-additive effect genes for increased seed yield in hybrid cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica oleracea 3aalleles 3aallelic variation 3acanola 3acrossing 3acultivars 3agene pool 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3aplant breeding 3aseed yield1 aBennett, Rick A.1 aYang, Rong-Cai0 tCrop science.g2016 Sept., v. 56, no. 5 p.2536-2545dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2016.01.00413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245009100210520076300301592002801064650002101092650001801113650001201131650001601143650001501159650002701174650001701201653001201218653001401230653001401244653001201258700002601270700005901296773009401355856008601449852000901535655001201544IND60749119120221121233406.0211030e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074911912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e078842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattad, Tanmay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2489-807610aPrebiotic activity of paramylon isolated from heterotrophically grown Euglena gracilis  aParamylon from Euglena gracilis is an insoluble crystalline β-1,3-glucan which have pharmaceutical and nutraceuticals applications.

However, poor stand establishment, often due to seed dormancy, limits its widespread use. Seed dormancy is often caused by structures surrounding the embryo, the physiological state of the embryo itself, or a combination of these factors. The eastern gamagrass dispersal unit is a floret within a thick, hard cupule. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of cupule (including lemma and palea) removal and caryopsis scarification on germination of eastern gamagrass by means of different commercial seed lots produced in different locations and years. Germination tests were conducted at 20/30°C alternating temperature with light during 30°C for 8 h daily. Germination counts were made every 7 d. After 28 d, the germination of decupulated caryopses from different seed lots germinated from 16 to 49% across seed lots, compared with 5 to 18% germination for caryopses with cupule intact. Scarifying the pericarp over the embryo, however, resulted in germination of all dormant seeds. We conclude that while the cupule (including the lemma and palea) contributes to the dormancy of eastern gamagrass, the pericarp and/or testa are the main factors restricting germination of this species. In addition, caryopsis scarification increased the germination rate and the germination test could be shortened to 21 or even 14 d depending on the seed lot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTripsacum dactyloides 3acaryopsis 3aflorets 3agermination 3apalatability 3aperennial grasses 3apericarp 3aphysiological state 3aseed dormancy 3astand establishment 3atemperature 3atesta 3awarm season1 aKnapp, A.

In Experiment 1 (synchrony of ovulation), 31 cows were submitted to an estradiol/progestin-based synchronization protocol (Day 0) and randomly assigned to one of three treatments at the time of progestin removal on Day 8: 0.5 or 1.0mg of estradiol cypionate (EC) at that time or 1.0mg of estradiol benzoate (EB) 24h later (Day 9). To determine the timing of ovulation, ultrasound examinations were performed every 12h from ear implant removal to 96h after the removal. Orthogonal comparisons were performed to determine the effects of estradiol ester and the effects of the dose of EC on reproductive parameters. Although neither the E2 ester (P=0.83) nor the dose of EC (P=0.55) affected the ovulation rate, the interval from progestin removal to ovulation was longer (P=0.04) in EC-treated cows (1.0mg EC=71.1±3.6 and 0.5mg EC=78.0±3.5) than EB-treated cows (EB=66.0±2.3) was detected. Ovulation in 0.5-mg-EC-treated cows was less synchronous than that in 1.0-mg-EC-treated cows (distribution curves compared using kurtosis). In Experiment 2 (pregnancy per AI; P/AI), 660 cows at two different locations received the same synchronization protocol (n=361 at Farm A and n=299 at Farm B) and were treated with estradiol esters as in Experiment 1 [0.5mg EC (n=220) or 1.0mg EC (n=219) at the time of progestin removal or 1.0mg EB (n=221) 24h later]. The cows were inseminated 54 to 56h after progestin removal. As applied in the Experiment 1, orthogonal comparisons were performed to evaluate the effect of estradiol ester and the dose of EC on P/AI. Although the type of estradiol ester used did not affect the P/AI (P=0.57; EB – 43.0% vs. EC – 44.6%), the P/AI was higher (P=0.03) in cows treated with 1.0mg EC (55.7%) than in those treated with 0.5mg EC (38.6%). In summary, the administration of 0.5mg EC at the time of progestin removal altered the distribution of ovulation and resulted in a lower P/AI when compared with the use of 1.0mg EC in suckled B. indicus cows. However, the P/AI following the administration of 1.0mg EC at the time of progestin removal did not differ from that after the administration of 1.0mg EB 24h later.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3abeef cows 3aesters 3aestradiol 3afarms 3aovulation 3apregnancy 3astatistical analysis 3azebu 0aReproduction 0aCattle 0aProgesterone 0aTAI 0aNelore1 aPenteado, L.1 aSales, J.N.S.1 aSá Filho, M.F.1 aAyres, H.1 aBaruselli, P.S.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 151, no. 1-2 p.9-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245010500130300001600235520167800251592002801929650000901957650002001966650001301986650001501999650002302014650001302037650000802050650002202058650001902080650001502099650001302114650002102127650001502148650001302163650002102176650001702197650001502214650002302229650002502252650002002277650001602297650001402313650001802327651001702345653002202362653001802384653002302402653002202425653001702447653002102464653001502485653002502500653002402525653001902549700002702568700002202595773012002617852000902737655001202746IND60563385920221122040535.0170215e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056338592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFouli, Ymène10aFreeze—thaw cycles and soil water content effects on infiltration rate of three Saskatchewan soils  ap. 485-496.  aFouli, Y., Cade-Menun, B. J. and Cutforth, H. W. 2013. Freeze-thaw cycles and soil water content effects on infiltration rate of three Saskatchewan soils. Can. J. Soil Sci. 93: 485-496. Many soils at high latitudes or elevations freeze and thaw seasonally. More frequent freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) may affect ecosystem diversity and productivity because freeze-thaw cycles cause changes in soil physical properties and affect water movement in the landscape. This study examined the effects of FTCs (0, 1, 5, and 10) and antecedent soil water content [at soil water potentials (SWP) -1.5, -0.033 and -0.02 MPa] on the infiltration rate of three Saskatchewan soils (a clay, a loam, and a loamy sand). A tension infiltrometer was used at tensions [water potentials of the tension infiltrometer (WPT)] -5, -10 and -15 cm. Infiltration rates increased with increasing SWPs for the loam and clay soils due to higher infiltrability into drier soils. Infiltration rates decreased with increasing SWPs for the loamy sand, probably the result of less surface tension, unimodal porosity, and increased gravitational potential. Infiltration rates either decreased or did not change with increasing FTCs, and this may be due to increased water viscosity as temperatures approach freezing. Also, ice may have formed in soil pores after frequent FTCs, causing lower infiltration rates. Infiltration rates for clay at -1.5 MPa were higher than for loam or loamy sand, probably the result of clay mineralogy and potential shrinking and cracking. Soil texture and initial water content had a significant effect on infiltration rates, and FTCs either maintained or lowered infiltration rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclay loam soils 3acracking 3aecosystems 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3aice 3ainfiltration rate 3ainfiltrometers 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3aloamy sand soils 3amineralogy 3aporosity 3asoil pore system 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water potential 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awater content 3aSaskatchewan 0aFreeze-thaw cycle 0asoil freezing 0asoil water content 0ainfiltration rate 0asoil texture 0aCycle gel-dégel 0agel du sol 0ateneur en eau du sol 0ataux d'infiltration 0atexture du sol1 aCade-Menun, Barbara J.1 aCutforth, Herb W.0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2013 Sept., v. 93, no. 4 p.485-496dCanadian Science Publishingx1918-18417nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014400153300002000297520147800317592002801795650002201823650003701845650001501882650001401897650002301911650002801934650002101962650000901983650001601992650001202008650002402020650001902044650001302063650001802076650001902094650001902113650001702132650001102149650003002160650002102190650003702211700001502248700001702263700001502280700001602295700001602311773012402327856007402451852000902525655001202534IND60640873720221120190644.0190505e20160725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064087372DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11390g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu10aGold nanoparticle-modified TiO₂/SBA-15 nanocomposites as active plasmonic photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols  ap. 70352-70363.  aThe catalytic performance of noble-metal on mesoporous silica hosts has been widely investigated because the effects of surface plasmon resonance can open new avenues for the improvement of catalytic performance under light irradiation. In this study, a series of photoactive Au/TiO₂/SBA-15 catalysts were developed for the selective oxidation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes and ketones. The catalysts thus developed were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Au and small TiO₂ nanoparticles (NPs) were uniformly anchored into the SBA-15 channels by the microwave-assisted alcohol reduction, resulting in the increase of the interfacial area between gold and titania; this increase in turn results in better catalytic performance of the Au₂/TiO₂/SBA-15 catalysts toward the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aromatic aldehydes (ketones) as a result of the efficient pore confinement and visible-light absorption by the LSPR effect. A scheme with respect to the enhancement of photooxidation induced by the LSPR effect on the Au NP-decorated TiO₂/SBA-15 composite was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aaldehydes 3acatalytic activity 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric current 3agold 3airradiation 3aketones 3amicrowave treatment 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotooxidation 3aporous media 3asilica 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLi, Weizun1 aWang, Jingyu1 aYang, Qian1 aHou, Qidong1 aJu, Meiting0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 25, v. 6, no. 74 p.70352-70363dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11390g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245019400171500001900365520210500384592002802489650002702517650001302544650002602557650001002583650001502593650001802608650001302626650001702639650001402656650001002670650001502680650001402695650003102709650002902740650001402769653005602783653001802839653001902857700002002876700003002896773011502926856008503041852000903126655001203135IND60709527720221119025148.0201125e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070952772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1045182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahmasebi, Hamed10aCo-harboring of mcr-1 and β-lactamase genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by high-resolution melting curve analysis (HRMA): Molecular typing of superbug strains in bloodstream infections (BSI)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackgroundColistin resistance in P. aeruginosa (CRPA) is due to the appearance of superbug strains. As this pathogen gains more transferrable resistance mechanisms and continues to adapt to acquire additional resistance mechanisms during antimicrobial therapy rapidly, we face the growing threat of CRPA in bloodstream infections (BSI). This study designed to evaluate the frequency of CRPA strains producing different β-lactamases by the High-Resolution Melting Curve Analysis (HRMA) method in BSI and to characterize the different types by multilocus sequence typing (MLST).Sixty-nine (69) P. aeruginosa isolates were collected from blood culture. MIC E-test methods examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the bacterial isolates. Detection of resistant strains performed by using HRMA assay.The strains resistant to amikacin (n = 11; 15.94%) and colistin (n = 10; 14.49%) were the least abundant and the gentamicin (n = 56; 82.6%) and ciprofloxacin (n = 67; 97.10%) resistant strains were the most frequent. Also, 39 isolates (56.52%) considered as multidrug-resistant (MDR), 20 isolates (28.98%) as extensively drug resistant (XDR), and 11 isolates (15.94%) as Pandrug Resistance (PDR). Further, 32 isolates (46.37%) considered as AmpC producer, and 28 isolates (40.57%) were considered an MBL producer. According to HRMA results, the blaSPM gene was detected in 19 isolates (27.53%), blaNDM gene in 11 isolates (15.94%), blaFOX gene in 31 isolates (44.92%), mcr-1 gene in 10 isolates (14.49%), blaACC and blaVIM genes in 27 isolates (39.13%), and blaTEM gene was reported in 20 isolates (28.98%). Furthermore, P. aeruginosa PASGNDM699, ST3340, and ST235 identified in 1.44%, 11.59% and 17.39% isolates, respectively.CRPA strains play an essential role in the spread of antibiotic resistance in BSI. Likewise, the HRMA method was sensitive and specific for the detection of superbugs. Moreover, MLST analysis of a diverse collection of P. aeruginosa from blood culture suggests that particular strains or clonal complexes are associated with antibiotic resistance profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aamikacin 3aantibiotic resistance 3ablood 3ablood flow 3aciprofloxacin 3acolistin 3adrug therapy 3aevolution 3agenes 3agentamicin 3ainfection 3amultilocus sequence typing 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogens 0aHigh-resolution melting curve analysis (HRMA) assay 0aβ-Lactamases 0aSequence types1 aDehbashi, Sanaz1 aArabestani, Mohammad Reza0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Nov., v. 85 p.104518-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1045183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04808naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008000171300001200251500001500263520315700278592002803435650003603463650001003499650001003509650001903519650001003538650001603548650001203564650003703576650001903613650001203632650001503644650001403659650001103673650001803684650001503702650002503717650003403742650005203776650002203828650002503850650000803875651001103883651000903894653001003903700001803913700001603931700002303947700002003970700001903990773012904009856008304138852000904221655001204230IND60549232820221118111234.0160907e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054923282DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-14-1045-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezende, J. A. M.10aFirst Report of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus on Red Table Beet in Brazil  ap. 423.  a2019-12-06  aBeet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) is an economically important pathogen of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris var. saccharifera) in several European, and Asian countries and in the United States (3). The virus is transmitted by the soil-inhabiting plasmodiophorid Polymyxa betae and causes the rhizomania disease of sugar beet. In November 2012, plants of B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris cv. Boro (red table beet) exhibiting mainly severe characteristic root symptom of rhizomania were found in a commercial field located in the municipality of São José do Rio Pardo, State of São Paulo, Brazil. No characteristic virus-inducing foliar symptom was observed on diseased plants. The incidence of diseased plants was around 70% in the two visited crops. As the hairy root symptom is indicative of infection by BNYVV, the present study aimed to detect and identify this virus associated with the diseased plants. Preliminary leaf dip analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of very few benyvirus-like particles. Total RNA was extracted from roots of three symptomatic plants and one asymptomatic plant according to Toth et al. (3). One-step reverse-transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed as described by Morris et al. (2) with primers that amplify part of the coat protein gene at RNA2. The initial assumption that the hairy root symptom was associated with BNYVV infection was confirmed by the amplification of a fragment of ~500 bp from all three symptomatic samples. No amplicon was obtained from the asymptomatic control plant. Amplicons were directly sequenced, and the consensus nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed 100% identity. The nucleotide sequence for one amplicon (Accession No. KM433683) was compared with other sequences deposited in GenBank. The nucleotide (468 nt) and deduced amino acid (156 aa) sequences shared 93 to 100 and 97 to 99% identity, respectively with the corresponding nucleotide and amino acid sequences for other isolates of type A of BNYVV. The virus was transmitted to three of 10 red table beet plants inoculated with contaminated soil, and infection was confirmed by nested RT-PCR, as described by Morris et al. (1), and nucleotide sequencing. This is the first report on the occurrence of BNYVV in Brazil, which certainly will affect the yield of red table beet in the producing region. Therefore, mapping of the occurrence of BNYVV in red table beet-producing areas in Brazil for containment of the spread of the virus is urgent. In the meantime, precautions should be taken to control the movement of contaminated soil and beet roots, carrots, or any vegetable grown on infested land that might introduce the virus to still virus-free regions.References: (1) J.

However, there are poorly relevant reports in rapeseed so far. In this study, we identified a homologous 14-3-3 gene BnGF14-2c (AtGRF2_Like in Brassica napus) in rapeseed based on bioinformatic analysis by using the sequences of the flowering-related 14-3-3s in other plant species. Then, we found that overexpression of BnGF14-2c in the semi-winter rapeseed “93275” promoted flowering without vernalization. Moreover, both yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis indicated that BnGF14-2c may interact with two vernalization-related flowering regulators BnFT.A02 and BnFLC.A10., respectively. qPCR analysis showed that the expression of BnFT (AtFT_Like) was increased and the expression of two selected vernalization-related genes were reduced in the overexpression transgenic plants. Further investigation on subcellular localization demonstrated that BnGF14-2c localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The results of RNA-seq analysis and GUS staining indicated that BnGF14-2c is ubiquitously expressed except for mature seed coat. In general, the interaction of 14-3-3 and FLC was firstly documented in this study, indicating BnGF14-2c may act as a positive regulator of flowering in rapeseed, which is worthy for more in-depth exploration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3abioinformatics 3acytoplasm 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3arapeseed 3aseed coat 3asequence analysis 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3avernalization1 aLiu, Hongfang 1 aLiu, Jing 1 aHua, Wei 1 aLi, Jun 0 tPlants.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 11, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111723123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245009700177300001800274520145700292592002801749650001701777650001201794650001701806650001401823650001601837650001801853650001001871650000901881650001701890650002501907650001401932650002101946650003301967700002102000700001602021700002102037773010702058856008402165852000902249655001202258IND60089991320221118060241.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008999132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiebergall, Lorissa J.10aPhosphatidylcholine protects against steatosis in mice but not non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  ap. 1177-1185.  aSeveral studies suggest that low levels of hepatic phosphatidylcholine (PC) play a role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is the key regulatory enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis. Liver-specific elimination of CTα (LCTα⁻/⁻) in mice fed a chow diet decreases very-low-density lipoprotein secretion, reduces lipid efflux from liver, and causes mild steatosis. We fed LCTα⁻/⁻ mice a high fat diet to determine if impaired PC biosynthesis played a role in development of NASH. LCTα⁻/⁻ mice developed NASH within one week of high fat feeding. Hepatic CTα deficiency caused hepatic steatosis, a 2-fold increase in ceramide mass, and a 20% reduction in PC content. In an attempt to prevent NASH, LCTα⁻/⁻ mice were either injected daily with CDP-choline or fed the high fat diet supplemented with betaine. In addition, LCTα⁻/⁻ mice were injected with adenoviruses expressing CTα. CDP-choline injections and adenoviral expression of CTα increased hepatic PC, while dietary betaine supplementation normalized hepatic triacylglycerol but did not alter hepatic PC mass in LCTα⁻/⁻ mice. Interestingly, none of the treatments normalized hepatic ceramide mass or fully prevented the development of NASH in LCTα⁻/⁻ mice. These results show that normalizing the amount of hepatic PC is not sufficient to prevent NASH in LCTα⁻/⁻ mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3abetaine 3abiosynthesis 3aceramides 3afatty liver 3ahigh fat diet 3aliver 3amice 3apathogenesis 3aphosphatidylcholines 3asecretion 3atriacylglycerols 3avery low density lipoprotein1 aJacobs, René L.1 aChaba, Todd1 aVance, Dennis E.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Dec., v. 1811, no. 12 p.1177-1185dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010500165300001600270500001900286520094600305592002801251596007501279650004801354650001501402650000901417650004301426650002901469650001201498700001801510700001601528700001901544700001601563700005601579773010001635856008301735852000901818655001201827IND60718377620221119074853.0210201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071837762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-020-01800-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jian-hui10aTranscriptional programs of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) in vitro and in vivo  ap. 749-755.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInfectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), causing serious infectious diseases to marine and freshwater fishes, is the type species of the genus Megalocytivirus, family Iridoviridae. In this study, the transcriptional programs of ISKNV in vitro (MFF-1 cells) and in vivo (spleens from mandarin fish) were investigated using real-time PCR. Transcription of all the putative open reading frames (ORFs) of ISKNV was verified. The temporal expression patterns of ISKNV ORFs in vitro and in vivo, including peak expression times (PETs) and relative maximal expression levels, were determined and compared. The K-means clustering with Spearman rank correlation was generated in heat maps constructed based on ISKNV ORF expression profiles in vivo and in vitro. The current study may provide a global picture of ISKNV infection at the transcription level and help better understand the molecular pathogenic mechanism of megalocytiviruses.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0900505cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aInfectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus 3afreshwater 3aheat 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviruses1 aHuang, Lichao1 aGuo, Zhixun1 aWeng, Shaoping1 aHe, Jianguo1 aXu, Xiaopeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8248-50420 tVirus genes.g2020 Dec., v. 56, no. 6 p.749-755dSpringer USwJournal:jnl53274x0920-85697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-020-01800-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012800162520200900290592002802299650002102327650001202348650001302360650001202373650002202385650001102407650001902418650001102437650002002448650001502468650001902483650002702502650001202529650002502541650001702566650002502583651001002608700001602618700001802634700001902652700001802671700001602689773012202705856007902827852000902906655001202915IND60792714820221122011122.0220908e20220904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079271482DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111723132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yongdao 10aResponse of Bletilla striata to Drought: Effects on Biochemical and Physiological Parameter Also with Electric Measurements  aIn heterogeneous landscapes with temporary water deficit characteristics in southwestern China, understanding the electrophysiological and morphological characteristics of Bletilla striata under different water conditions can help to better evaluate its suitability for planting plants in specific locations and guide planting and production. Using B. striata seedlings as experimental materials, the maximum field capacity (FC) was 75–80% (CK: control group), 50–60% FC (LS: light drought stress), 40–45% FC (MS: moderate drought stress), and 30–35% FC (SS: severe drought stress). In terms of physiological response, the activities of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) decreased under drought conditions, but the activity was well under the LS treatment, and the contents of proline (Pro) and malondialdehyde (MDA) increased. In terms of morphological responses, under drought conditions, root lengths of the rhizomes (except the LS treatment) were significantly reduced, the leaf lengths were reduced, and the biomass was significantly reduced. The stomatal size reached the maximum under the LS treatment, and the stomatal density gradually decreased with the increase in drought degree. In terms of electrophysiological responses, drought significantly decreased the net photosynthetic rate (PN) of B. striata, stomatal conductance (gₛ), and transpiration rate (Tr), but effectively increased the water use efficiency (WUE). The effective thickness of leaves of B. striata increased under drought conditions, and drought promoted the formation of leaf morphological diversity. Our results showed that drought stress changed the physiological and morphological characteristics of B. striata, and under light drought conditions had higher physiological activity, good morphological characteristics, higher cellular metabolic energy and ecological adaptability. Appropriate drought can promote the improvement of the quality of B. striata, and it can be widely planted in mildly arid areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBletilla striata 3abiomass 3acatalase 3adrought 3aelectrophysiology 3aenergy 3afield capacity 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aproline 3astomatal conductance 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aCai, Chang 1 aYang, Qiaoan 1 aQuan, Wenxuan 1 aLi, Chaochan 1 aWu, Yanyou 0 tPlants.g2022 Sept. 04, v. 11, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111723133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012300159300001400282520127500296592002801571650001501599650002501614650000901639650001101648650003101659650001501690650002401705650002201729653002001751653002301771653003701794653002601831653003101857700001901888700001401907700001801921700001701939700001601956773009001972856008102062852000902143655001202152IND60544759120221116150134.0160901e20150209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054475912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ke12aA consensus successive projections algorithm – multiple linear regression method for analyzing near infrared spectra  ap. 16-23.  aThe successive projections algorithm (SPA) is widely used to select variables for multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling. However, SPA used only once may not obtain all the useful information of the full spectra, because the number of selected variables cannot exceed the number of calibration samples in the SPA algorithm. Therefore, the SPA-MLR method risks the loss of useful information. To make a full use of the useful information in the spectra, a new method named “consensus SPA-MLR” (C-SPA-MLR) is proposed herein. This method is the combination of consensus strategy and SPA-MLR method. In the C-SPA-MLR method, SPA-MLR is used to construct member models with different subsets of variables, which are selected from the remaining variables iteratively. A consensus prediction is obtained by combining the predictions of the member models. The proposed method is evaluated by analyzing the near infrared (NIR) spectra of corn and diesel. The results of C-SPA-MLR method showed a better prediction performance compared with the SPA-MLR and full-spectra PLS methods. Moreover, these results could serve as a reference for combination the consensus strategy and other variable selection methods when analyzing NIR spectra and other spectroscopic techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical chemistry 3acorn 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aselection methods 0aConsensus model 0aVariable selection 0aSuccessive projections algorithm 0aNear infrared spectra 0aMultiple linear regression1 aChen, Xiaojing1 aLi, Limin1 aChen, Huiling1 aRuan, Xiukai1 aLiu, Wenbin0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Feb. 09, v. 858 p.16-23dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245012200210300001500332520141800347592002801765650000801793650002301801650002601824650001301850650001301863650001301876650001901889650001501908650001501923650001101938650002201949700002001971700001601991773008602007856008502093852000902178655001202187IND60669772920221118005228.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066977292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRestuccia, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0419-723X10aMonitoring water and oxygen splitting at graphene edges and folds: Insights into the lubricity of graphitic materials  ap. 93-103.  aThe functionality of graphene as lubricant material is affected by extrinsic factors, such as the film thickness and the environmental conditions. Graphite lubricating capability depends as well on air humidity. To accurately describe the tribochemistry mechanisms underlying these behaviours we adopt a Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics approach. We show that reactive edges are able to cause a huge friction increase, which is quantified for graphene flakes between sliding diamond surfaces. Moreover, folds spontaneously formed in single layer graphene under tribological conditions are shown to be highly reactive due to carbon re-hybridization. This observation offers a new hint for interpreting the dependence of graphene friction on the number of layers. Both water and oxygen molecules are found to be effective in quenching the reactivity of defects by dissociative chemisorption. However, peculiar mechanisms of water molecules makes humidity more effective than oxygen for enabling the lubricity of graphitic media. They include collective processes as Grotthus-like proton diffusion enhanced by confinement, and the strong change in hydrophilic character of the passivated media. This comprehensive study sheds a new light on debated issues of graphene and graphite tribology, and highlights the potentiality of these materials for metal-free catalysis, e.g., for H production by water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acatalytic activity 3aenvironmental factors 3afriction 3agraphene 3ahumidity 3ahydrophilicity 3alubricants 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3aquantum mechanics1 aFerrario, Mauro1 aRighi, M.C.0 tCarbon.g2020 Jan., v. 156 p.93-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.09.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008200161300001800243520175200261592002802013596005902041596007502100650002202175650002702197650002502224650002302249650002102272650001802293650002002311650001002331650001202341650001302353650003902366650002202405650001102427650002902438700001502467700001602482700001802498700001302516700001502529700001702544773014502561856008302706852000902789655001202798IND60638261720221118222635.0190504e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063826172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-09722-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Jing10aEffect of the spoIIID mutation on mother cell lysis in Bacillus thuringiensis  ap. 4103-4112.  aSpoIIID is a small, sequence-specific DNA-binding protein which can direct many genes’ transcription and has an effect on spore formation in Bacillus subtilis. We investigated the role of SpoIIID in mother cell lysis in Bacillus thuringiensis. A β-galactosidase assay based on the promoter fusions with lacZ indicated that the sigK gene was positively regulated by SpoIIID and σᴷ negatively regulated the expression of sigE. The spoIIID mutant strain exhibited no mother cell lysis in Schaeffer’s sporulation medium (SSM) but did in ½ Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. cwlC is an essential hydrolase gene for mother cell lysis. Moreover, the expression of a PcwₗC-lacZ fusion in spoIIID mutant was proved to be higher in ½ LB medium than in SSM. HD (ΔspoIIID)(ΔcwlC) mutant was obtained by knocking out the cwlC gene in HD(ΔspoIIID) and displayed no mother cell lysis in both SSM and ½ LB mediums. The deletion of spoIIID decreased the crystal protein production in HD73. The expression of Pₒᵣf₁cᵣy₈E and P₅₀₁₄ promoter fusions with lacZ gene in the acrystalliferous HD⁻(ΔspoIIID) mutant showed similar activity to that in the acrystalliferous HD73⁻ strain before T₇ and slightly higher than that in the acrystalliferous HD73⁻ after T₇. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that Cry1Ac production in HD⁻(ΔspoIIID) directed by the Pₒᵣf₁cᵣy₈E and P₅₀₁₄ promoters was at a similar level as that in HD73 wild strain. Altogether, these results suggested that the spoIIID mutant with Pₒᵣf₁cᵣy₈E or P₅₀₁₄ promoters could be an alternative delivery system for cry gene expression with no mature spore formation and medium-dependent mother cell lysis.  aPublisher supplied data  a31530095cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0200400cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abeta-galactosidase 3acrystal proteins 3aculture media 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3amutation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein synthesis 3aspores 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhang, Xin1 aGao, Tantan1 aCui, Tingting1 aPeng, Qi1 aZhang, Jie1 aSong, Fuping0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 May, v. 103, no. 10 p.4103-4112dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09722-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245015900177300001600336520100300352592002801355650001401383650001501397650002301412650001201435650001701447653001201464653001301476653001001489653001201499700002101511773011201532856005101644852000901695655001201704IND50088350920221121093936.0140414e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008835092DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2012.6801742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobison, Kristopher K.10aWhither the Love of Hunting? Explaining the Decline of a Major Form of Rural Recreation as a Consequence of the Rise of Virtual Entertainment and Urbanism  ap. 418-436.  aRecent journalism and scholarship have noted a years-long decline in Americans' participation in rural forms of outdoor recreation such as hunting. While some attempt has been made to understand these declines few have analyzed the causes of these changes in a theoretically rigorous empirical manner. This study addresses this issue in two empirical approaches. First, we analyze survey data on hunting and various theoretical predictors from the General Social Survey. Second, we statistically analyze changes in hunting license acquisitions at the state level for a period of several years. We empirically test the Videophilia hypothesis (Pergams & Zaradic, 2006) as one explanation positing a substitution effect involving electronic forms of indoor entertainment. We find evidence that the switch to certain kinds of electronic entertainment as well as the growth in urban living explain the decline in hunting and discuss the implications of these findings and future directions for research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3anews media 3aoutdoor recreation 3asurveys 3aurbanization 0ahunting 0aInternet 0aurban 0atourism1 aRidenour, Daniel0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 17, no. 6 p.418-436dTaylor & Francis Groupx1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2012.680174  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245015200164300001600316520127900332592002801611650001801639650002501657650002701682650001801709650002301727650001701750650001201767650001501779650002001794650003001814650002401844650001201868650001101880650001101891650001301902650001401915651003101929653001601960653001901976653002301995653001002018653001302028700001902041700002502060700002302085773009902108856007802207852000902285655001202294IND60129143120221120023555.0151124e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012914312DNAL7 a10.3375/043.034.02032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVernon, Marian E.10aInvasive European Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.) Association with Mammalian Species Distribution in Natural Areas of the Chicagoland Region, USA  ap. 134-143.  aCommon buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.) is an invasive Eurasian shrub that has successfully invaded many of the woodlands of the northeastern United States. While the ecology and invasive properties of this species are well documented, little research has focused on buckthorn's effects on wildlife species. In this study, we surveyed 35 forest preserves and natural areas in the Chicago metropolitan region for the presence of buckthorn. Motion-triggered infrared cameras were used to detect mammal species in sites with and without buckthorn. Cameras were active for an average of four weeks for seven seasons during 2010 and 2011. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) were more likely to be present in sites without buckthorn, while coyotes (Canis latrans Say) and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana Kerr) were more likely to be present in sites invaded with buckthorn. While there was no overall significant difference in raccoon (Procyon lotor L.) presence between the two site types, raccoons were more likely to be present in invaded sites during the spring season, a trend that was also observed for other mesocarnivores. Our results strongly suggest that the presence of invasive buckthorn impacts habitat use and the presence of wildlife species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis latrans 3aDidelphis virginiana 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aProcyon lotor 3aRhamnus cathartica 3abiogeography 3acameras 3acarnivores 3aforest reserves 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat preferences 3amammals 3ashrubs 3aspring 3awildlife 3awoodlands 3aNortheastern United States 0ahabitat use 0ainvasive plant 0aRhamnus cathartica 0aurban 0awildlife1 aMagle, Seth B.1 aLehrer, Elizabeth W.1 aBramble, Judith E.0 tNatural areas journal.g2014 Apr., v. 34 p.134-143dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.034.02033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024004000135040001800175100001900193245005600212300001600268506007600284520118100360592002801541506003701569650001201606650001901618650001701637650001201654650002101666650002701687650001601714650001201730650002101742650003201763650003101795650001801826650001901844650001601863650002401879650001601903650002401919650002201943653000901965653001201974653002501986653002502011653002302036653001602059700001802075700002502093773011802118856008702236852000902323655001202332IND60112345320221207114222.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011234532DNAL7 aPMC36162622pmcid7 a233994742pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKäfer, Helmut10aRespiration patterns of resting wasps (Vespula sp.)  ap. 475-486.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe investigated the respiration patterns of wasps (Vespula sp.) in their viable temperature range (2.9–42.4°C) by measuring CO2 production and locomotor and endothermic activity.Wasps showed cycles of an interburst–burst type at low ambient temperatures (Ta<5°C) or typical discontinuous gas exchange patterns with closed, flutter and open phases. At high Ta of >31°C, CO2 emission became cyclic. With rising Ta they enhanced CO2-emission primarily by an exponential increase in respiration frequency, from 2.6mHz at 4.7°C to 74mHz at 39.7°C. In the same range of Ta CO2 release per cycle decreased from 38.9 to 26.4μlg−1cycle−1. A comparison of wasps with other insects showed that they are among the insects with a low respiratory frequency at a given resting metabolic rate (RMR), and a relatively flat increase of respiratory frequency with RMR.CO2 emission was always accompanied by abdominal respiration movements in all open phases and in 71.4% of the flutter phases, often accompanied by body movements. Results suggest that resting wasps gain their highly efficient gas exchange to a considerable extent via the length and type of respiration movements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVespula 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3ainsects 3arespiratory rate 3aresting metabolic rate 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aBasal Metabolism 2aBody Temperature Regulation 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aInfrared Rays 2aMotor Activity 2aRespiration 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTemperature 2aVideotape Recording 2aWaspsxphysiology 0aWasp 0aVespula 0aRespiration patterns 0aVentilation movement 0aResting metabolism 0aTemperature1 aKovac, Helmut1 aStabentheiner, Anton0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2013 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.475-486dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245022300168300001400391520144700405592002801852650001501880650001701895650002001912650004301932650001501975650001101990650001302001650000702014653002902021653002902050653004402079653004302123653001302166653001202179700001702191700001802208700001302226700001602239700001502255773009002270856008102360852000902441655001202450IND60544759520221116150159.0160901e20150225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054475952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQing, Xiang-Dong12aA novel fourth-order calibration method based on alternating quinquelinear decomposition algorithm for processing high performance liquid chromatography–diode array detection– kinetic-pH data of naptalam hydrolysis  ap. 12-24.  aFive-way high performance liquid chromatography–diode array detection (HPLC–DAD)–kinetic-pH data were obtained by recording the kinetic evolution of HPLC–DAD signals of samples at different pH values and a new fourth-order calibration method, alternating quinquelinear decomposition (AQQLD) based on pseudo-fully stretched matrix forms of the quinquelinear model, was developed. Simulated data were analyzed to investigate the performance of AQQLD in comparison with five-way parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The tested results demonstrated that AQQLD has the advantage of faster convergence rate and being insensitive to the excess component number adopted in the model. Then, they have been successfully applied to investigate quantitatively the kinetics of naptalam (NAP) hydrolysis in two practical systems. Additionally, the serious chromatographic peak shifts were accurately corrected by means of chromatographic peak alignment method based on abstract subspace difference. The good recoveries of NAP were obtained in these samples by selecting the time region of chromatogram. The elution time, spectral, kinetic time and pH profiles resolved by the chemometric techniques were in good agreement with experimental observations. It demonstrates the potential for the utilization of fourth-order data for some complex systems, opening up a new approach to fourth-order data generation and subsequent fourth-order calibration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemometrics 3afactor analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3amodels 3anaptalam 3apH 0aFourth-order calibration 0aParallel factor analysis 0aAlternating quinquelinear decomposition 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography 0aNaptalam 0aKinetic1 aWu, Hai-Long1 aZhang, Xi-Hua1 aLi, Yong1 aGu, Hui-Wen1 aYu, Ru-Qin0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Feb. 25, v. 861 p.12-24dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011000174300001600284520139800300592002801698650001801726650002401744650001201768650001001780650001101790650001601801650001201817650004301829650001401872650002201886650000901908650001101917650002201928650002101950650001801971651002101989653001402010653000902024653002802033653002102061653001102082653001202093700001802105773009902123856008502222852000902307655001202316IND60515406320221119104354.0160315e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051540632DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2016.11429792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzen, Sukran Akkus10aPhytoextraction of lead and its relationship with histidine in six plant species using ICP-MS and HPLC-MS  ap. 346-356.  aHigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) methods were used for determination of histidine and lead in leaves of six plant species taken from industrial areas, including Gaziantep and Bursa cities, Turkey. For extraction of histidine from plant samples, ultrapure water was used at 90°C for 30 min. Using optimum conditions of 0.2 mL min ⁻¹, 70 V, 15 µL and 20°C, concentrations of histidine (in mg kg ⁻¹) were found to be between 2 and 9 for Morus L., 6 and 13 for Robinia pseudoacacio L., 2 and 10 for Populous nigra L., 3 and 10 for Thuja , 1 and 11 for Cupressus arizonica and 4 for Cedrus libani. Concentrations of lead were in the ranges of 4–378 mg kg ⁻¹ for Morus L., 1–122 mg kg ⁻¹ for R. pseudoacacio L., 1–14 mg kg ⁻¹ for P. nigra L., 1.6–224 mg kg ⁻¹ for Thuja (Cupressaceae), 1.5–57 mg kg ⁻¹ for C. arizonica and 1.8 mg kg ⁻¹ for C. libani . Related with correlation coefficient, significant linear correlation for Thuja (Cupressaceae) (r = 0.81) and insignificant linear correlation for P. nigra L. (r = 0.50) were seen.

In order to gain greater understanding of the mechanistic basis and capability of the 8β-hydroxylase we have transformed a range of structurally diverse androgens and progestogens with this organism. This has revealed that both steroid types can be hydroxylated at the 8β-position. The collective data has demonstrated the first time that 8β-hydroxylation occurs through inverted binding within a 9α-hydroxylase of the fungus. In the case of the progestogens, for this to occur, the presence of 17α-oxygen functionality (alcohol or epoxide) was essential. Remarkably monohydroxylation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone at carbons 8β and 15β has strongly indicated that the responsible hydroxylase has 2 different binding sites for the ring-A ketone. Unusually, with one exception, all hydroxylation occurred at axial protons and in the case of the progestogens, all above the plane of the ring system.

The microsystem integrates microfluidics, a gas-diffusion module and a detection system in a single substrate. The gas-diffusion module was integrated by a hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The potentiometric detection system is based on an all-solid state ammonium selective electrode and a screen-printed Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The analytical features provided by the analytical microsystem after the optimization process were a linear range from 0.15 to 500mgL−1 and a detection limit of 0.07±0.01mgL−1. Nevertheless, the operational features can be easily adapted to other applications through the modification of the hydrodynamic variables of the microfluidic platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3aanalytical chemistry 3acomposite polymers 3adetection limit 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophobicity 3aolefin 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3aspecific ion electrodes 3athermoplastics 3awater reuse 0aLab on a chip 0aPolymer technology 0aMiniaturization 0aGas-diffusion 0aPotentiometric detection 0aAmmonium ion1 aYmbern, Oriol1 aPuyol, Mar1 aCasalta, Joan Manel1 aAlonso-Chamarro, Julián0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 May 18, v. 874 p.26-32dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009300176300001600269520121300285592002801498650004401526650001501570650001401585650001701599650001601616650002601632650001801658650002401676650001401700650001301714650001901727650001801746650002901764650000701793650001101800650002301811653001301834653001101847653002301858653002801881653002601909700002101935700001901956773013501975856008702110852000902197655001202206IND60610390120221119173348.0200228e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061039012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.2112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassoumi, Bakhshali12aA starch-based stimuli-responsive magnetite nanohydrogel as de novo drug delivery system  ap. 418-426.  aA novel starch-based stimuli-responsive magnetite nanohydrogel (MNHG), namely Fe₃O₄-g-[poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-maleic anhydride)]@strach; Fe₃O₄-g-(PNIPAAm-co-PMA)@starch, was successfully developed for targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) as an anticancer drug. First, magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) was modified using chloroacetyl chloride moiety followed by grafting of NIPAAm and MA monomers through ATRP technique. The resultant Fe₃O₄-g-(PNIPAAm-co-PMA) nanocomposite was crosslinked through the reaction between the anhydride group of MA and hydroxyl groups of starch to afford a Fe₃O₄-g-(PNIPAAm-co-PMA)@starch MNHG. The chemical structure of the synthesized materials were confirmed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, morphology, size, thermal property, and magnetic properties of the synthesized MNHG were studied. This MNHG was loaded with DOX, and drug loading and encapsulation efficiencies as well as pH- and temperature-responsive drug release behavior of the fabricated MNHG were also evaluated. As results, we envision that the developed MNHG has potential as de novo drug delivery system (DDS) due to its smart physicochemical features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanhydrides 3achlorides 3acrosslinking 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3aencapsulation 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetite 3amoieties 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apH 3astarch 3athermal properties 0aHydrogel 0aStarch 0aStimuli-responsive 0aMagnetite nanoparticles 0aDe novo drug delivery1 aMozaffari, Zahra1 aJaymand, Mehdi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 117 p.418-426dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.2113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001500171245010100186300001600287520139200303592002801695650002401723650002101747650002401768650002101792650002401813650001001837650001201847650002201859650001801881650001201899650002101911650002101932650001101953650003701964650004302001650003502044650000902079650001902088650002102107650004802128650004202176650004002218650002402258650001702282653002102299653001202320653001302332653001502345653002002360653002402380700001802404700001902422700001902441773011802460856008702578852000902665655001202674IND60112345520221122041016.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011234552DNAL7 a234583402pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUryu, Outa10aLong-term effect of systemic RNA interference on circadian clock genes in hemimetabolous insects  ap. 494-499.  aRNA interference (RNAi) strategy, which enables gene-specific knock-down of transcripts, has been spread across a wide area of insect studies for investigating gene function without regard to model and non-model insects. This technique is of particular benefit to promote molecular studies on non-model insects. However, the optimal conditions for RNAi are still not well understood because of its variable efficiency depending on the species, target genes, and experimental conditions. To apply RNAi technique to long-running experiments such as chronobiological studies, the effects of RNAi have to persist throughout the experiment. In this study, we attempted to determine the optimal concentration of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for systemic RNAi and its effective period in two different insect species, the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus and the firebrat Thermobia domestica. In both species, higher concentrations of dsRNA principally yielded a more efficient knock-down of mRNA levels of tested clock genes, although the effect depended on the gene and the species. Surprisingly, the effect of the RNAi reached its maximum effect 1–2weeks and 1month after the injection of dsRNA in the crickets and the firebrats, respectively, suggesting a slow but long-term effect of RNAi. Our study provides fundamental information for utilizing RNAi technique in any long-running experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGryllus bimaculatus 3aRNA interference 3aThermobia domestica 3acircadian rhythm 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenes 3ainsects 3along term effects 3amessenger RNA 2aAnimals 2aCircadian Clocks 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aFemale 2aGryllidaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsectaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMotor Activity 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 0aRNA interference 0aCricket 0aFirebrat 0aClock gene 0aGene knock-down 0aDouble-stranded RNA1 aKamae, Yuichi1 aTomioka, Kenji1 aYoshii, Taishi0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2013 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.494-499dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245022900167300001600396520149100412592002801903650001401931650002501945650001301970650001901983650002302002650000902025650002202034650002402056700001302080700001602093700001502109700001502124773009602139856008402235852000902319655001202328IND60112959920221122224001.0141111e20120427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011295992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanellas, E.10aAtmospheric pressure gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry as a powerful tool for identification of non intentionally added substances in acrylic adhesives used in food packaging materials  ap. 141-148.  aAcrylic adhesives are used to manufacture multilayer laminates that are used in food packaging to form the geometric shape of the package as well as to stick labels on the packages. Once applied on the packaging adhesives can supply potential migrants that could endanger the packaged food. Adhesives are complex matrices where intentionally and non intentionally added substances are present, but the identification of the migrants is required by law. In this study atmospheric pressure gas chromatography coupled to a quadrupole hyphenated to a time of flight mass spectrometer (APGC–MS/Q-TOF) has been explored for identification of unknowns coming from three different acrylic adhesives. The results are compared to those obtained by conventional GC–MS-Q (quadrupole). Sixteen compounds were identified by GC–MS/Q and five of them were confirmed by APGC–MS/Q-TOF as their molecular ions were found. Moreover, additional three new compounds were identified and their structure was elucidated working with the spectra obtained by APGC–MS/Q-TOF. This finding was very relevant as these compounds were biocides suspected to be allergenic and cytotoxic in humans. Migration studies were carried out using Tenax as solid food simulant and the results showed that the three acrylic adhesives tested in this work were safe for being used in food packaging materials since the migration of compounds previously identified was below the limit established in the current legislation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiocides 3afood packaging 3agas chromatography 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3apackaging materials1 aVera, P.1 aDomeño, C.1 aAlfaro, P.1 aNerín, C.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Apr. 27, v. 1235 p.141-148dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010300162300001600265500001900281520106200300592002801362596006301390596006301453596008401516596007901600596007901679596008101758596012201839650001601961650001001977650000801987650001601995650001002011650001302021650001102034650002502045650001402070650001702084650001202101651001002113700001502123700001402138700001602152700001502168700001402183700005502197773010002252856008302352852000902435655001202444IND60718378420221119074914.0210201e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071837842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-020-01792-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Liyan10aFirst identification and genomic characterization of equine hepacivirus sub-type 3 strain in China  ap. 777-780.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEquine Hepacivirus (EqHV) is a newly discovered equine virus that is classified under the Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. There are three sub-types of EqHV worldwide namely; sub-types 1–3. The majority of EqHV sub-type 1 strains were found in China. While different sub-types have been found in Japan and USA, therefore, to investigate whether the other sub-types of EqHV strains were present in China, a total of 60 horse serum samples were collected and screened for EqHV RNA through RT-PCR. The results revealed that 19 serum samples were RNA-positive (19/60) and the EqHV detection rate was 31.67%. One EqHV strain named GD23 was obtained and its near-complete genome sequence was acquired. Analysis of nucleotide p-distance with reference to the entire polyprotein gene revealed that GD23 was classified into sub-type 3. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that GD23 was clustered together with EqHV strains of sub-type 3 in other countries. The present study is the first to identify an EqHV sub-type 3 strain in China.  aPublisher supplied data  a31372448cThe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31672563cThe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a201303042cThe Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest  a2016YFD0501004cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2016YFD0501010cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2013B040200032cThe Promote Scientific and Technological Development Program  a2013A061401013cThe Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Prevention and Control for Severe Clinical Animal Diseases 3aHepacivirus 3aJapan 3aRNA 3ablood serum 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahorses 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apolyproteins 3aviruses 3aChina1 aOu, Jiajun1 aCai, Siqi1 aJi, Jinzhao1 aRen, Zixin1 aShao, Ran1 aLi, Shoujun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9560-28260 tVirus genes.g2020 Dec., v. 56, no. 6 p.777-780dSpringer USwJournal:jnl53274x0920-85697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-020-01792-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245008800179500001900267520114800286592002801434650001901462650002001481650002201501650002301523650002801546650001901574653002101593653002701614653002601641653002101667653002101688700002201709700002201731700002601753700002401779700002501803773012001828856008801948852000902036655001202045IND60698597920221123030136.0210114e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069859792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1048412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaunich, Megan Kramer10aLife-cycle modeling framework for electronic waste recovery and recycling processes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolicies and regulations such as Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) have been implemented to potentially increase the recycling rate of electronic waste (e-waste), but the cost and environmental impacts of associated collection, transportation, material recovery, material re-processing, and disposal could outweigh the benefits of recycling if the e-waste management system is not effectively designed and implemented. This paper presents a quantitative, holistic framework to systematically estimate life-cycle impacts and costs associated with e-waste management. This new framework was tested using data from the state of Washington's EPR program to represent e-waste collection, transportation, processing and disposal. Sensitivity of process-level life-cycle model outputs to parameter and input variability was also conducted. Drop-off using fossil-fuel-powered personal vehicles was found to be a key contributor to cost and carbon dioxide emissions. Decision-makers must account for drop-off and consider the feasibility of alternate e-waste aggregation strategies to ensure life-cycle benefits of e-waste recycling are maximized.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adecision making 3aelectronic wastes 3amanagement systems 3aproducer responsibility 3atransportation 0alife-cycle model 0aend-of-life management 0alife cycle assessment 0aelectronic waste 0awaste management1 aDeCarolis, Joseph1 aHandfield, Robert1 aKemahlioglu-Ziya, Eda1 aRanjithan, S.

It is also important to amass information on the trends in specific drug use as well as the sources of such compounds that enter the environment and we review current international knowledge on this. There are regional differences in the types and quantities of illicit drug consumption and this is reflected in the quantities detected in water. Generally, the levels of illicit drugs in wastewater effluents are lower than in raw influent, indicating that the majority of compounds can be at least partially removed by conventional treatment processes such as activated sludge or trickling filters. However, the literature also indicates that it is too simplistic to assume non-detection equates to drug removal and/or mitigation of associated risks, as there is evidence that some compounds may avoid detection via inadequate sampling and/or analysis protocols, or through conversion to transformation products. Partitioning of drugs from the water to the solids fraction (sludge/biosolids) may also simply shift the potential risk burden to a different environmental compartment and the review found no information on drug stability and persistence in biosolids. Generally speaking, activated sludge-type processes appear to offer better removal efficacy across a range of substances, but the lack of detail in many studies makes it difficult to comment on the most effective process configurations and operations. There is also a paucity of information on the removal effectiveness of alternative treatment processes. Research is also required on natural removal processes in both water and sediments that may over time facilitate further removal of these compounds in receiving environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aamphetamines 3abiosolids 3acannabinoids 3acocaine 3adrinking water 3aeffluents 3afilters 3aillicit drugs 3ametabolites 3anarcotics 3arisk 3asediments 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aIllicit drugs 0aWastewater 0aSurface water 0aDrinking water 0aDrug removal efficacy1 aShort, Michael D.1 aAryal, Rupak1 aGerber, Cobus1 avan den Akker, Ben1 aSaint, Christopher P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4229-43480 tWater research.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 124 p.713-727dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.07.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245005000167300001300217520107800230592002801308650001901336650002701355650002301382650001101405650001301416650001501429650001301444653001901457653001101476653001701487653001701504653001901521700001901540773010901559856005101668852000901719655001201728IND50088351720221121064310.0140414e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008835172DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2012.6940142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubois, Sara10aExploring “Humane” Dimensions of Wildlife  ap. 1-19.  aThe field of wildlife management has been on a collision course with human nature for some time, documented by the growing and important body of human dimensions of wildlife research. As the evolution of this field continues, a new dimension of “humane” considerations in wildlife management should be investigated. An exploratory online study of opinions about management decisions with 351 British Columbians of various wildlife engagement levels was conducted. Many participants were not willing to accept trading-off individual animals to protect populations, or killing other species to protect an endangered species, expressing both conservation and animal welfare rationales. Participants' wildlife engagement level and utilitarian or protectionist values influenced how they perceived the acceptability of invasive monitoring and population reduction techniques. The application of animal welfare science to conservation can improve the humaneness of practices and in turn, will help managers communicate with the public and generate support for their programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aattitudes and opinions 3aendangered species 3ahumans 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3awildlife 0aanimal welfare 0ahumane 0aintervention 0ainvasiveness 0alethal control1 aHarshaw, H.

Curiously, the boundary between the two recognized P. ciris subspecies does not separate the two allopatric breeding populations but instead runs roughly through the center of the interior population. Genetic relationships among these subspecies, and the allopatric breeding populations of Painted Bunting, have not been assessed. Given the recent decline in overall abundance of this species, such an assessment is warranted. We sampled birds from 15 localities (138 individuals) and identified 35 distinct haplotypes, six belonging to the Atlantic Coast population and 26 to the interior population, with three shared by both populations. AMOVA results showed that a significantly greater portion of the total genetic variance is explained when grouping birds by the interior and Atlantic Coast populations rather than by subspecies. Furthermore, our data indicate that the Atlantic Coast and interior populations represent independently evolving taxa, with no measureable gene flow between them. Although recently diverged (26,000–115,000 years ago), these isolated bunting populations represent incipient species. For development of conservation strategies, we suggest that the Atlantic Coast and interior populations be recognized as separate management units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasserina 3aallopatry 3agene flow 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variance 3ahaplotypes 3aphylogeography 3asongbirds1 aSykes, Paul W., Jr.cJr.1 aKlicka, John0 tConservation genetics.g2011 Dec., v. 12, no. 6 p.1395-1410dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-011-0237-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245011400159300001600273520103600289592002801325650002401353650002201377650001601399650002201415650000901437650001501446650001301461650001001474650001001484650001801494650001201512650001301524650000901537650001901546650001001565650001401575650001501589650001001604773009601614856007101710852000901781655001201790IND60518550420221118230920.0160418e197203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855042DNAL7 a10.2307/19340922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanzen, Daniel H.10aEscape in Space by Sterculia Apetala Seeds from the Bug Dysdercus Fasciatus in a Costa Rican Deciduous Forest  ap. 350-361.  aWhen a seed of the large tree Sterculia apetala falls to the ground beneath the parent tree in a Costa Rican tropical deciduous forest, it is typically found and fed upon within a few minutes by cotton—stainer bugs (Dysdercus fasciatus). The rate of seed discovery by the bugs is highest where the seed fall is most intense and tapers off to zero between 30 and 60 m from the tree trunk. Seeds that fall beneath the parent appear to have no chance of survival under forest conditions. Seeds in open pasture are not found by the bugs, but probably die of desiccation. The bugs are not present under sterile S. apetala trees. Squirrels and monkeys appear to be the primary dispersal agents; after carrying the pods away from the parent, they appear to lose some seeds because of their face and hands being stuck by the hairs on the inner walls of the seed pods. The coevolution of the Dysdercus—Sterculia‐mammal interaction is discussed with respect to the effect of seed predators on the density of adult trees in the habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDysdercus fasciatus 3aSterculia apetala 3acoevolution 3adeciduous forests 3aface 3agranivores 3ahabitats 3ahairs 3ahands 3amature plants 3amonkeys 3apastures 3apods 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3asquirrels 3atree trunk 3atrees0 tEcology.g1972 Mar., v. 53, no. 2 p.350-361dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19340923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013400167300001600301520172000317592002802037650003302065650002402098650001602122650002302138650002002161650001402181650002602195650001802221650001502239650001102254650001302265650001302278650001102291651001202302651001202314651001602326651001102342700002202353700001802375700002102393700001902414773010402433856008202537852000902619655001202628IND60549234020221118111222.0160907e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054923402DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-14-0836-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohl, Jürgen,10aToward an Integrated Use of Biological Control by Cladosporium cladosporioides H39 in Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis) Management  ap. 535-543.  aApple scab, caused by Venturia inaequalis, is the most important disease in apple production, reducing yield and quality of fruit. Control of apple scab in commercial orchards currently depends on multiple applications of fungicides. The potential of the antagonistic isolate Cladosporium cladosporioides H39, originating from a sporulating colony of V. inaequalis, to control apple scab development was tested in eight trials during 2 years in orchards in Eperjeske (Hungary), Dabrowice (Poland), and Bavendorf (Germany) planted with different cultivars. Treatments were conducted as calendar sprays or after infection periods. Additional trials in an orchard in Randwijk (The Netherlands) focused on the effect of timing of antagonist application before or after infection periods. The overall results of the field trials consistently showed—for the first time—that stand-alone applications of the antagonist C. cladosporioides H39 can reduce apple scab in leaves and fruit. This was demonstrated in an organic growing system as well as in conventional orchards by spray schedules applied during the primary or the summer season. In both systems, the same control levels could be reached as with common fungicide schedules. Efficacies reached 42 to 98% on leaf scab incidence and 41 to 94% on fruit scab. The antagonist was also effective if applied one or even several days (equivalent to approximately 300 to 2,000 degree h) after infection events in several field trials and a trial conducted in Randwijk with single-spray applications at different intervals before or after infection events. Better understanding of the biology of the antagonist will help to further exploit its use in apple scab control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aantagonists 3abiological control 3acrop production 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3afruit quality 3afungicides 3aleaves 3aorchards 3aplanting 3asummer 3aGermany 3aHungary 3aNetherlands 3aPoland1 aScheer, Christian1 aHolb, Imre J.1 aMasny, Sylwester1 aMolhoek, Wilma0 tPlant disease.g2015 Apr., v. 99, no. 4 p.535-543dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-08-14-0836-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014200172300001800314520108300332592002801415596004501443650002701488650002301515650001201538650001901550650002001569700002001589700002801609700002601637700006501663773014501728856008301873852000901956655001201965IND60638262420221118222758.0190504e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063826242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-09812-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberlein, Christian10aQuantification of outer membrane vesicles: a potential tool to compare response in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to stress caused by alkanols  ap. 4193-4201.  aThe bacterial release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) is an important physiological mechanism of Gram-negative bacteria playing numerous key roles. One function of the release of OMVs is related to an increase in surface hydrophobicity. This phenomenon initiates biofilm formation, making bacteria more tolerant to environmental stressors. Recently, it was qualitatively shown for Pseudomonas putida that vesicle formation plays a crucial role in multiple stress responses. Yet, no quantification of OMVs for certain stress scenarios has been conducted. In this study, it is shown that the quantification of OMVs can serve as a simple and feasible tool, which allows a comparison of vesicle yields for different experimental setups, cell densities, and environmental stressors. Moreover, the obtained results provide insight to the underlying mechanism of vesicle formation as it was observed that n-alkanols, with a chain length of C7 and longer, caused a distinct and steep increase in vesiculation (12–19-fold), compared to shorter chain n-alkanols (2–4-fold increase).  aPublisher supplied data  a633962cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPseudomonas putida 3abiofilm 3ahydrophobicity 3astress response1 aStarke, Stephan1 aDoncel, Álvaro Escobar1 aScarabotti, Francesco1 aHeipieper, Hermann J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3723-96000 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 May, v. 103, no. 10 p.4193-4201dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09812-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245006200159300001600221520073400237592002800971650001000999650001701009650001501026650001201041650001101053650001801064650001101082650001501093651002101108653001701129653001501146653001501161653001401176653001501190700001701205700001701222773009901239856007801338852000901416655001201425IND60129143920221120201427.0151124e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012914392DNAL7 a10.3375/043.034.02112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNevin, Owen,10aBears, Place-Making, and Authenticity in British Columbia  ap. 216-221.  aExtreme sports, adventure, and ecotourism are bringing increasing numbers of people into remote backcountry areas worldwide.

Reflecting on over a decade's research on the impacts of the bear-viewing (Ursus spp.) ecotourism industry in British Columbia, Canada, this paper considers authenticity, place, and ‘place making’ via a case study of bear tourism in British Columbia (B.C.), Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus 3acase studies 3aecotourism 3amarkets 3apeople 3asocial impact 3asports 3awilderness 3aBritish Columbia 0aauthenticity 0abrown bear 0aecotourism 0asemiotics 0awilderness1 aSwain, Peter1 aConvery, Ian0 tNatural areas journal.g2014 Apr., v. 34 p.216-221dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.034.02113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04082naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003500132040001800167100001800185245008100203300001400284506017300298520193700471592002802408650001902436650001602455650001502471650001602486650001302502650002302515650001302538650001402551650002002565650001702585650001702602650001102619650000902630650001602639650002702655650002002682650002802702650003502730650001302765650001202778650002302790650002302813650002002836650001402856650003602870650002802906650002302934650003602957651001802993700002103011700002203032773010603054856011203160856004803272956008203320961000903402852000903411655001203420IND4463822720221119035418.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446382272DNAL7 a219128562pmid7 a10113/544752hdl7 a10.1007/s00122-011-1682-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJun, Tae-Hwan10aGenetic mapping revealed two loci for soybean aphid resistance in PI 567301B  ap. 13-22.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) is the most damaging insect pest of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in North America. New soybean aphid biotypes have been evolving quickly and at least three confirmed biotypes have been reported in USA. These biotypes are capable of defeating most known aphid resistant soybean genes indicating the need for identification of new genes. Plant Introduction (PI) 567301B was earlier identified to have antixenosis resistance against biotype 1 and 2 of the soybean aphid. Two hundred and three F7:9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross of soybean aphid susceptible cultivar Wyandot and resistant PI 567301B were used for mapping aphid resistance genes using the quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping approach. A subset of 94 RILs and 516 polymorphic SNP makers were used to construct a genome-wide molecular linkage map. Two candidate QTL regions for aphid resistance were identified on this linkage map. Fine mapping of the QTL regions was conducted with SSR markers using all 203 RILs. A major gene on chromosome 13 was mapped near the previously identified Rag2 gene. However, an earlier study revealed that the detached leaves of PI 567301B had no resistance against the soybean aphids while the detached leaves of PI 243540 (source of Rag2) maintained aphid resistance. These results and the earlier finding that PI 243540 showed antibiosis resistance and PI 567301B showed antixenosis type resistance, indicating that the aphid resistances in the two PIs are not controlled by the same gene. Thus, we have mapped a new gene near the Rag2 locus for soybean aphid resistance that should be useful in breeding for new aphid-resistant soybean cultivars. Molecular markers closely linked to this gene are available for marker-assisted breeding. Also, the minor locus found on chromosome 8 represents the first reported soybean aphid-resistant locus on this chromosome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis glycines 3aGlycine max 3aantibiosis 3aantixenosis 3abiotypes 3achromosome mapping 3acrossing 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3ainbred lines 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3aloci 3amajor genes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apest resistance 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoybeans 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGenetic Linkage 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSoybeansxgenetics 2aStress, Physiologicalxgenetics 3aUnited States1 aRouf Mian, M.

This module is composed of four interlinked components: PKCδ, the signal adapter p66Shc, cytochrome c, and vitamin A. It resides in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, and is at the center of a feedback loop that senses upstream the redox balance between oxidized and reduced cytochrome c as a measure of the workload of the respiratory chain, and transmits a forward signal to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to adjust the flux of fuel entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The novel role of vitamin A as co-activator and potential electron carrier, required for redox activation of PKCδ, is discussed.

The growth and time-course of nutrient accumulation of the plant and its partitioning between roots, stems, leaves, and fruits were examined. The study was conducted analyzing two nutrient solutions in soilless culture under greenhouse conditions during two consecutive seasons. The macronutrient contents were analyzed. On average, the yield was 8.9 t·ha ⁻¹. Growth of the plant until 90 d after transplanting obeys an exponential function of time and the relative growth rate for this period was determined. Nitrogen (N) was the element that showed the highest concentration, corresponding to leaves (4.67%), followed by potassium (K) in stems (4.46%). The highest accumulations of N, phosphorous (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were found in leaves and of K in the stems. Potassium showed the highest nutrient accumulation (29 g·plant ⁻¹) and the highest specific uptake rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysalis peruviana 3aabsorption 3acalcium 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anutrient solutions 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aroots 3asoilless culture 3astems1 aPascual-Seva, N.1 aSan Bautista, A.1 aPascual, B.1 aLópez-Galarza, S.1 aAlagarda, J.1 aMaroto, J.

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) rather than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were found more functionally important in the extremely acidic soils of the natural forests in Nanling National Nature Reserve. The relative abundances of Nitrosotalea, Nitrososphaera sister group, and Nitrososphaera lineages recovered by ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) transcripts were reassessed and compared to AOA communities formerly detected by genomic DNA. Nitrosotalea, previously found the most abundant AOA, were the second-most-active lineage after Nitrososphaera sister group. Our field study results, therefore, propose the acidophilic AOA, Nitrosotalea, can better reside in extremely acidic soils while they may not contribute to nitrification proportionately according to their abundances or they are less functionally active. In contrast, the functional importance of Nitrososphaera sister group may be previously underestimated and the functional dominance further extends their ecological distribution as little has been reported. Nitrososphaera gargensis–like AOA, the third abundant lineage, were more active in summer. The analyses of AOA community composition and its correlation with environmental parameters support the previous observations of the potential impact of organic matter on AOA composition. Al³⁺, however, did not show a strong adverse correlation with the abundances of functional AOA unlike in the DNA-based study. The new data further emphasize the functional dominance of AOA in extremely acidic soils, and unveil the relative contributions of AOA lineages to nitrification and their community transitions under the environmental influences.  aPublisher supplied data  a31470562cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArchaea 3aDNA 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3aammonia 3aammonia monooxygenase 3acommunity structure 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3amessenger RNA 3anitrification 3anitrifying bacteria 3aorganic matter 3aoxidants 3asummer1 aMeng, Han1 aWang, Yong-Feng1 aGu, J.-D.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7082-97840 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 May, v. 103, no. 10 p.4229-4240dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09721-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245017000171300001400341520133900355592002801694650001501722650000901737650001501746650002001761650002101781650001701802650002301819650001801842650001101860650002001871650000701891650002601898650002301924650001501947650001301962650003301975650003202008650002502040650001602065653003302081653002302114653002402137653003102161653002402192700001802216700002702234700001602261700001802277700002302295700002102318700001702339773009002356856008102446852000902527655001202536IND60544760120221116145654.0160901e20150215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelit, Füsun Okçu12aA novel polythiophene – ionic liquid modified clay composite solid phase microextraction fiber: Preparation, characterization and application to pesticide analysis  ap. 37-45.  aThis report comprises the novel usage of polythiophene – ionic liquid modified clay surfaces for solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber production to improve the analysis of pesticides in fruit juice samples. Montmorillonite (Mmt) clay intercalated with ionic liquids (IL) was co-deposited with polythiophene (PTh) polymer coated electrochemically on an SPME fiber. The surface of the fibers were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Operational parameters effecting the extraction efficiency namely; the sample volume and pH, adsorption temperature and time, desorption temperature and time, stirring rate and salt amount were optimized. In order to reveal the major effects, these eight factors were selected and Plackett–Burman Design was constructed. The significant parameters detected; adsorption and temperature along with the stirring rate, were further investigated by Box–Behnken design. Under optimized conditions, calibration graphs were plotted and detection limits were calculated in the range of 0.002–0.667ngmL−1. Relative standard deviations were no higher than 18%. Overall results have indicated that this novel PTh-IL-Mmt SPME surface developed by the aid of electrochemical deposition could offer a selective and sensitive head space analysis for the selected pesticide residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aclay 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3afruit juices 3aheadspace analysis 3aionic liquids 3amixing 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3apesticide application 3apesticide residues 3apesticides 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase microextraction 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 0aSolid phase micro extraction 0aPesticide analysis 0aPolythiophene fiber 0aIonic liquid modified clay 0aExperimental design1 aPelit, Levent1 aDizdaş, Tuğberk Nail1 aAftafa, Can1 aErtaş, Hasan1 aYalçınkaya, E.E.1 aTürkmen, Hayati1 aErtaş, F.N.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 859 p.37-45dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011200170300001600282520116700298592002801465650001201493650002501505650001301530650003601543650003901579650001701618650002101635650001801656650001501674650001501689650002301704650000701727650001801734653002901752653001501781653001501796653002201811653002501833700001801858700002001876700001501896700002001911773013501931856008702066852000902153655001202162IND60610390920221119172922.0200228e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061039092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.1832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Jun-Xia10apH-Dependent intestine-targeted delivery potency of the O-carboxymethyl chitosan – gum Arabic coacervates  ap. 315-322.  aBovine serum albumin (BSA)-loaded microcapsules were prepared at pH 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 through O-carboxymethyl (O-CMC) – gum Arabic (GA) coacervation followed by genipin crosslinking to explore the effects of coacervation acidity on the intestine-targeted delivery potency of resultant microcapsules. Confocal laser scanning microscope observation revealed that microcapsules with the multilayer structure were successfully prepared. As the coacervation pH rose from 3.0 to 6.0, the amount of O-CMC deposited on the microcapsule surface and the particle size increased accordingly. Swelling and BSA release results indicated that coacervation at higher pH conferred greater stability against simulated gastric fluid and better intestine-targeted delivery potency to the microcapsules. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrated that the structural integrity of entrapped BSA was well maintained during microencapsulation and incubation in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. Hence, genipin-crosslinked O-CMC – GA coacervates could be used to deliver nutraceuticals to the intestine and its delivery performance could be tailored by varying the coacervation pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abovine serum albumin 3achitosan 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acrosslinking 3afunctional foods 3agastric juice 3agum arabic 3aintestines 3amicroencapsulation 3apH 3aparticle size 0aO-carboxymethyl chitosan 0aGum Arabic 0aCoacervate 0aTargeted delivery 0aComplexation acidity1 aZhu, Cui-Ping1 aCheng, Ling-Yun1 aYang, Jian1 aHuang, Guo-Qing0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 117 p.315-322dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.1833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245008900167300001600256520191800272592002802190650002402218650002602242650002402268650003502292650001302327650002302340650002102363650001602384650001502400650001502415650001702430650001102447650001902458650000902477650001902486650000902505651001802514653002402532653001302556653002602569653002002595653001902615653003202634700002002666700001802686700002302704700002102727773010502748856007802853852000902931655001202940IND60129144320221120201441.0151124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012914432DNAL7 a10.3375/043.034.03032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLookingbill, Todd R.10aIncorporating Risk of Reinvasion to Prioritize Sites for Invasive Species Management  ap. 268-281.  aThe relationship between landscape pattern and the distribution and spread of exotic species is an important determinant of where and when management actions are best applied. We have developed an interdisciplinary approach for prioritizing treatment of harmful, nonnative, invasive plants in National Park landscapes of the Mid-Atlantic USA. The approach relies upon a detailed model of reinvasion risk that combines information on: (1) global factors representing park-level infestation from seed and sprout, (2) landscape factors including disturbance-based spread vectors and neighborhood seed density, and (3) local factors determining establishment probability based on habitat suitability. Global seed rain estimates are derived empirically from park inventory data and modified by information on species reproductive strategies. Landscape-level propagule pressure is modeled spatially using species life history characteristics including dispersal attributes, connectivity to nearby plant populations, and increased propagule pressure through disturbance. The local-scale habitat suitability model uses a Mahalanobis distance approach, parameterized from plant inventory plot data and GIS-based data on plot wetness, land cover, slope, radiation, and soil characteristics. We illustrate the model for Ailanthus altissima (tree-of-heaven) in Antietam National Battlefield Park. The results of the A. altissima modeling highlight regions of the park where eradication would be most prudent and feasible based on current infestation patterns and landscape heterogeneity. Although the success of different treatment modalities is often considered in invasive species management, a spatially explicit assessment of likely treatment success is rarely undertaken. Our approach provides a valuable tool to assist natural resource practitioners to prioritize management options in confronting biological invasions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAilanthus altissima 3abotanical composition 3aecological invasion 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3ainventories 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amodels 3anational parks 3arisk 3aseed dispersal 3asoil 3aUnited States 0aAilanthus altissima 0aAntietam 0adecision support tool 0ainvasive plants 0aNational Parks 0aspecies distribution models1 aMinor, Emily S.1 aBukach, Nadia1 aFerrari, Joseph R.1 aWainger, Lisa A.0 tNatural areas journal.g014 July, v. 34, no. 3 p.268-281dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.034.03033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005300169300001400222520209600236592002802332650001802360650001302378650001802391650001602409650001002425650001002435650002302445650001302468650004302481650001202524650002702536650001402563650002102577650002902598650002102627700002202648700003102670700002202701773010202723856008402825852000902909655001202918IND60089993120221118055115.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008999312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez, Efrén10aModulation of RXR function through ligand design  ap. 57-69.  aAs the promiscuous partner of heterodimeric associations, retinoid X receptors (RXRs) play a key role within the Nuclear Receptor (NR) superfamily. Some of the heterodimers (PPAR/RXR, LXR/RXR, FXR/RXR) are “permissive” as they become transcriptionally active in the sole presence of either an RXR-selective ligand (“rexinoid”) or a NR partner ligand. In contrast, “non-permissive” heterodimers (including RAR/RXR, VDR/RXR and TR/RXR) are unresponsive to rexinoids alone but these agonists superactivate transcription by synergizing with partner agonists. Despite their promiscuity in heterodimer formation and activation of multiple pathways, RXR is a target for drug discovery. Indeed, a rexinoid is used in the clinic for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In addition to cancer RXR modulators hold therapeutical potential for the treatment of metabolic diseases. The modulation potential of the rexinoid (as agonist or antagonist ligand) is dictated by the precise conformation of the ligand–receptor complexes and the nature and extent of their interaction with co-regulators, which determine the specific physiological responses through transcription modulation of cognate gene networks. Notwithstanding the advances in this field, it is not yet possible to predict the correlation between ligand structure and physiological response. We will focus on this review on the modulation of PPARγ/RXR and LXR/RXR heterodimer activities by rexinoids. The genetic and pharmacological data from animal models of insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity demonstrate that RXR agonists and antagonists have promise as anti-obesity agents. However, the treatment with rexinoids raises triglycerides levels, suppresses the thyroid hormone axis, and induces hepatomegaly, which has complicated the development of these compounds as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The discovery of PPARγ/RXR and LXR/RXR heterodimer-selective rexinoids, which act differently than PPARγ or LXR agonists, might overcome some of these limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aagonists 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3adrugs 3agenes 3ainsulin resistance 3alymphoma 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aphysiological response 3areceptors 3athyroid hormones 3atranscription (genetics) 3atriacylglycerols1 aBourguet, William1 aGronemeyer, H.q(Hinrich),1 ade Lera, Angel R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Jan., v. 1821, no. 1 p.57-69dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011500168520104200283592002801325650001801353650001201371650001701383650001701400650001601417650001701433650001901450650001701469650001401486650001901500650001601519650001501535650001301550650001001563650001701573650001401590650001201604653001801616653002301634653002501657653002001682653002501702700001601727700001701743700001701760700001601777700001801793700001301811700001501824773010001839856008701939852000902026655001202035IND60727616320221119162033.0220606e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072761632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1292172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shutian10aPhenolic profiles and antioxidant activities of free, esterified and bound phenolic compounds in walnut kernel  aThe free, esterified and bound forms of 37 phenolic compounds (including hydroxybenzoic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavanols, flavonols and flavones) from walnut kernel (Juglans regia L.) were investigated in this study. Results showed that the majority of walnut phenolics were presented in the free form (51.1%–68.1%), followed by bound (21.0%–38.0%) and esterified forms (9.7%–18.7%). Ellagic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid and caffeic acid were widely distributed in three forms. Differently, jeuglone, kaempferol, quercetin-7-o-β-d-glucoside and dihydroquercetin were only found in free phenolics. Among the three forms, free phenolics had the highest radical scavenging activity (IC₅₀: DPPH, 15.5 µg/ml; ABTS, 13.6 µg/ml). The correlation coefficients between the antioxidant activities of phenolics and their corresponding contents were 0.82–0.92. More soluble phenolics (free and esterified forms) could be extracted by acetone, while methanol was better at extracting insoluble bound phenolics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuglans regia 3aacetone 3aantioxidants 3acaffeic acid 3acorrelation 3aellagic acid 3aesterification 3aferulic acid 3aflavanols 3afood chemistry 3agallic acid 3akaempferol 3amethanol 3aseeds 3asinapic acid 3ataxifolin 3awalnuts 0aWalnut kernel 0aSolvent extraction 0aEsterified phenolics 0aBound phenolics 0aAntioxidant activity1 aShen, Danyu1 aWang, Ruohui1 aLi, Qingyang1 aMo, Runhong1 aZheng, Yuewen1 aZhou, Ye1 aLiu, Yihua0 tFood chemistry.g2021 July 15, v. 350 p.129217-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1292173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245006300161300002000224520100400244592002801248650001201276650001101288650001301299650002101312650002201333650000901355650001101364650001401375650001101389650001401400700002301414773013401437856007801571852000901649655001201658IND60579704520221122190458.0170830e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057970452DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b050582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dengchao10aElectron-Transfer Gated Ion Transport in Carbon Nanopipets  ap. 11654-11657.  aCoating the inner wall of a quartz nanopipet with a thin layer of carbon yields a nanopore with tunable surface charge and chemical state for resistive-pulse and rectification sensing. Herein we report the experimental study and modeling of the electron-transfer gated ion transport processes in carbon nanopipets. The potential of the unbiased carbon layer can be tuned by adding very low (sub-nM) concentrations of redox species to the solution via bipolar electrochemistry. The potential of the carbon layer determines the electrical double-layer structure that, in turn, affects the ionic transport processes. The ion current rectification decreased when redox species with a relatively positive formal potential (e.g., Fe(CN)₆³/⁴–) were added to the solution and increased upon adding redox species with a negative formal potential (e.g., Ru(NH₃)₆³/²⁺). Additionally, the ion current displays high sensitivity to redox species, suggesting the possibility of trace-level analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acarbon 3acoatings 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3airon 3amodels 3ananopores 3aquartz 3aruthenium1 aMirkin, Michael V.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Aug. 30, v. 139, no. 34 p.11654-11657dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b050583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245010100207300001400308520087500322592002801197650001801225650002101243650001101264650001301275650002301288650001501311650001101326651001401337653001301351653001501364653001401379653000901393653001901402700001701421700006001438700002101498700002001519773012301539856008401662852000901746655001201755IND60544508920221120080544.0190417e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054450892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.swaqe.2014.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuwarno, Djoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3566-878614aThe effects of dams in rivers on N and P export to the coastal waters in Indonesia in the future  ap. 55-66.  aWe used Global NEWS to analyze the effects of dams in large rivers on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs to the coastal waters of Indonesia for the period 1970–2050. We model N and P export by rivers, taking into account nutrient retention on land, during river transport and in dammed reservoirs. Our results indicate that N and P export by rivers to coastal seas may increase over time. In the past the N and P inputs to coastal waters of Indonesia were low and have increased relatively fast since 1970 as a result of human activities. For the coming decades we calculate that P inputs to coastal waters in Indonesia may double while N inputs may increase by up to 20%. Damming may slow down these increases to some extent. Our study illustrates that it is important in river nutrient export models to appropriately account for nutrient retention in dam waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal water 3adams (hydrology) 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient retention 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3aIndonesia 0aNitrogen 0aPhosphorus 0aIndonesia 0aDams 0aCoastal waters1 aLöhr, Ansje1 aKroeze, Carolien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8954-66291 aWidianarko, Budi1 aStrokal, Maryna0 tSustainability of water quality and ecology.g2014 Oct., v. 3-4 p.55-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23297x2212-61397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.swaqe.2014.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245007900161520140300240592002801643650002801671650001401699650002101713650001401734650001201748650001901760650001301779650001701792650002601809650001901835650001501854650002801869650001301897650003001910650001301940700001901953773012701972856007902099852000902178655001202187IND60760579320221119135713.0211223e20211125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076057932DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox101218812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tae Woo14aThe Herbal Formula JI017 Induces ER Stress via Nox4 in Breast Cancer Cells  aChemotherapy is a powerful anti-tumor therapeutic strategy; however, resistance to treatment remains a serious concern. To overcome chemoresistance, combination therapy with anticancer drugs is a potential strategy. We developed a novel herbal extract, JI017, with lower toxicity and lesser side effects. JI017 induced programmed cell death and excessive unfolded protein response through the release of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium in breast cancer cells. JI017 treatment increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, including p-PERK, p-eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP, via the activation of both exosomal GRP78 and cell lysate GRP78. The ROS inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium and N-acetyl cysteine suppressed apoptosis and excessive ER stress by inhibiting Nox4 in JI017-treated breast cancer cells. Furthermore, in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7R and MDA-MB-231R, a combination of JI017 and paclitaxel overcame paclitaxel resistance by blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes, such as the downregulation of E-cadherin expression and the upregulation of HIF-1α, vimentin, Snail, and Slug expression. These findings suggested that JI017 exerts a powerful anti-cancer effect in breast cancer and a combination therapy of JI017 and paclitaxel may be a potential cancer therapy for paclitaxel resistant breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acadherins 3acalcium 3acancer therapy 3acysteine 3adrug therapy 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aneoplasm cells 3apaclitaxel 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 3aunfolded protein response 3avimentin1 aKo, Seong-Gyu 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox101218813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014600168520104000314592002801354650002801382650001601410650001601426650001601442650001501458650001301473650002101486650002601507650001901533650003001552650001701582650001601599650001601615650001501631650001101646650001201657650001601669653002101685653002401706653001501730653001001745653001901755700002001774700001501794700001901809700001601828773010601844856008701950852000902037655001202046IND60730529320221119090608.0220326e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073052932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1249152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dekui10aAltering bacterial community: A possible way of lactic acid bacteria inoculants reducing CO2 production and nutrient loss during fermentation  aCO₂ production during ensiling is a source of greenhouse gases emissions and a cause of nutrient loss of silage. To investigate the influence of additives on CO₂ production and relevant bacterial communities, stylo and rice straw were ensiled with sucrose and Lactobacillus plantarum (LP). After 30 days fermentation, LP reduced CO₂ production (from 66.2 to 0 mL/100 g fresh matter in stylo, from 83.7 to 16.6 mL/100 g fresh matter in rice straw) and weight loss (from 2.71 to 1.72% in stylo, from 2.75 to 2.40% in rice straw). CO₂ production was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with Lactococcus (0.99), Leuconostoc (0.55), Lachnoclostridium (0.45), Prevotella (0.23) and was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with Serratia (-0.66), Sphingobacterium (-0.58), Pediococcus (-0.36). LP decreased the relative abundance of genera positively correlated with CO₂ production and increased that of genera negatively correlated. In conclusion, LP could reduce CO₂ production by altering bacterial community during ensiling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactococcus 3aLeuconostoc 3aPediococcus 3aPrevotella 3aSerratia 3aSphingobacterium 3abacterial communities 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3afermentation 3agreenhouses 3alactic acid 3arice straw 3asilage 3asucrose 3aweight loss 0aGreenhouse gases 0aBacterial community 0aRice straw 0aStylo 0aSilage quality1 aZheng, Mingyang1 aGuo, Xiang1 aChen, Xiaoyang1 aZhang, Qing0 tBioresource technology.g2021 June, v. 329 p.124915-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1249153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013900162520146400301592002801765650001901793650002701812650002801839650001401867650001901881650001701900650001101917650002301928650001701951650002701968650001401995650002202009650001502031650001402046650002802060700002002088700001902108700002102127700002002148700002002168700002002188700001902208773012702227856007902354852000902433655001202442IND60760579420221119135647.0211223e20211125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076057942DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox101218832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yen-Po 10aPardaxin Activates Excessive Mitophagy and Mitochondria-Mediated Apoptosis in Human Ovarian Cancer by Inducing Reactive Oxygen Species  aMost ovarian cancer (OC) patients are diagnosed with stage III or higher disease, resulting in a poor prognosis. Currently, paclitaxel combined with carboplatin shows the best treatment outcome for OC. However, no effective drug is available for patients that do not respond to treatment; thus, new drugs for OC are needed. We evaluated the antimicrobial peptide, pardaxin, in PA-1 and SKOV3 cells. Pardaxin induced apoptosis as determined by MTT and TUNEL assays, as well as activation of caspases-9/3, Bid, t-Bid, and Bax, whereas Bcl-2 was downregulated. The IC₅₀ values for pardaxin were 4.6–3.0 μM at 24 and 48 h. Mitochondrial and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were overproduced and associated with disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory capacity. Additionally, the mitochondrial network was fragmented with downregulated fusogenic proteins, MFN1/2 and L-/S-OPA1, and upregulated fission-related proteins, DRP1 and FIS1. Autophagy was also activated as evidenced by increased expression of autophagosome formation-related proteins, Beclin, p62, and LC3. Enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagy indicate that mitophagy was activated. ROS-induced cytotoxicity was reversed by the addition of N-acetylcysteine, confirming ROS overproduction as a contributor. Taken together, pardaxin demonstrated promising anticancer activity in OC cells, which warrants further preclinical development of this compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcysteine 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3aautophagosomes 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amitophagy 3aovarian neoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3aprognosis 3areactive oxygen species1 aShih, Po-Chang 1 aFeng, Jianwei,1 aWu, Chang-Cheng 1 aTsui, Kuan-Hao 1 aLin, You-Hsien 1 aKuo, Hsiao-Mei 1 aWen, Zhi-Hong 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox101218833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245011100210300001200321506007600333520085900409592002801268506003701296650002201333650004401355650001401399650002201413650002501435650002001460650002801480650003301508650001501541650001201556650001401568700001901582700002201601700002101623773010901644856008201753852000901835655001201844IND60595035620221207070928.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059503562DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-018-1293-02doi7 aPMC59710182pmcid7 a298683092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSango, Chakarvati10aBacterial cellulase treatment for enhancing reactivity of pre-hydrolysed kraft dissolving pulp for viscose  ap. 271.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo improve the process economy of reactivity improvement, crude cellulase from Bacillus subtilis was employed for the treatment and significant dissolving pulp properties were analyzed.

The most suitable cellulase dose for reactivity improvement with lowering of viscosity was 0.25 U/g o.d. pulp. With increases in enzyme dose, alkali solubilities (S10 and S18) of dissolving pulp showed continuous increment, while alpha-cellulose of pulp showed reduction due to chain scission of long cellulose fiber fraction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adissolving pulp 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3aviscose 3aviscosity1 aPrabhjot Kaur,1 aBhardwaj, NishiK.1 aSharma, Jitender0 t3 Biotech.g2018 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.271-271dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-018-1293-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010000174300001800274520134800292592002801640650001801668650001601686650002501702650001901727650001201746650001701758650001201775650001401787650001901801650001001820650001401830650001001844653002701854653002001881653003401901653001401935653001401949653001801963700002101981700002002002773009002022856008102112852000902193655001202202IND60081086420221119064628.0170418e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008108642DNAL7 a10.2478/s11535-014-0330-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzafrańska, Katarzyna10aInvolvement of melatonin applied to Vigna radiata L. seeds in plant response to chilling stress  ap. 1117-1126.  aThe impact of melatonin (50 µM L−1) applied to Vigna radiata seeds by hydro-priming on phenolic content, L-phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL) activity, MEL level, antioxidant properties of ethanol extracts as well as electrolyte leakage from chilled and re-warmed Vigna radiata roots of seedlings were examined. Seedlings obtained from non-primed seeds, hydro-primed and hydro-primed with MEL were investigated after 2 days of chilling and 2 days of re-warming. At 25°C, the level of MEL in roots derived from seeds hydro-primed with MEL was 7-fold higher than in roots derived from non-primed seeds. However, the content of MEL significantly decreased in all variants investigated after re-warming, in contrast to PAL activity and phenolic levels, which reached the highest values. The antioxidant capacity of ethanol extracts from chilled and re-warmed roots, determined by ABTS+· assay, was correlated with phenolic content while the reducing ability of these extracts, determined by the FRAP method, correlated with PAL activity. However, both were the highest in rewarmed roots with applied MEL, which was accompanied by a significant decline in electrolyte leakage. Taken together, results may indicate that MEL can play a positive role in plant acclimation to stressful conditions and activation of phenolic pathway by this molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna radiata 3aacclimation 3aantioxidant activity 3acold treatment 3acooling 3aelectrolytes 3aethanol 3amelatonin 3aplant response 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aseeds 0aAntioxidant properties 0aChilling stress 0aL-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 0aMelatonin 0aPhenolics 0aVigna radiate1 aSzewczyk, Rafał1 aJanas, Krystyna0 tOpen life sciences.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 9, no. 11 p.1117-1126dVersitax2391-54127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-014-0330-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007900168300001800247520071800265536011500983592002801098596000701126650002501133650003101158650003601189650001001225650001101235650001201246650002101258650001301279650002101292653001101313653002001324653001301344653001701357700001901374700002101393700001401414700001701428700001501445700001301460700001601473773012501489856008601614852000901700655001201709IND60752173120221118043818.0220130e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075217312DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16935682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, De-Tao10aLignans and phenylpropanoids from the liquid juice of phyllostachys edulis  ap. 3241-3247.  aSeven lignans and eight phenylpropanoids, including one new lignan, 7S,8R,8'R-5,5′-dimethoxyariciresinol-4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), were isolated from the liquid juice of Phyllostachys edulis.

The causative pathogen has been identified as the giant salamander iridovirus (GSIV). In this study, the immunological responses and protection in Chinese giant salamander immunized with β-propiolactone inactivated GSIV are reported. Red and white blood cell counting and classification, phagocytic activity, neutralizing antibody titration, immune-related gene expression and determination of the relative percent survival were evaluated after vaccination. The red and white blood cell counts showed that the numbers of erythrocytes and leukocytes in the peripheral blood of immunized Chinese giant salamanders increased significantly on days 4 and 7 post-injection (P<0.01). Additionally, the differential leukocyte count of monocytes and neutrophils were significantly different compared to the control group (P<0.01); the percentage of lymphocytes was 70.45±7.52% at day 21. The phagocytic percentage and phagocytic index was 38.78±4.33% and 3.75±0.52, respectively, at day 4 post-immunization which were both significantly different compared to the control group (P<0.01). The serum neutralizing antibody titer increased at day 14 post-immunization and reached the highest titer (341±9.52) at day 21. The quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the immunization significantly up-regulated the expression of immune related genes TLR-9 and MyD88 the first two weeks after immunization. The challenge test conducted at day 30 post-injection demonstrated that the immunized group produced a relative survival of 72%. These results indicate that the inactivated GSIV could elicit significant non-specific and specific immunological responses in Chinese giant salamander that resulted in significant protection against GSIV induced disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrias 3aIridovirus 3ablood serum 3aerythrocytes 3afinancial economics 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahemorrhage 3aimmune response 3ainfectious diseases 3aleukocyte count 3alymphocytes 3amonocytes 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aneutrophils 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalamanders and newts 3atitration 3avaccination 3aChina 0aChinese giant salamander 0aIridovirus 0aInactivated vaccine 0aImmunological responses 0aEfficacy of protection1 aXu, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0766-18081 aMa, Jie1 aLaPatra, Scott E.1 aMeng, Yan1 aFan, Yuding1 aZhou, Yong1 aYang, Xin1 aZeng, Lingbing0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Dec. 05, v. 174, no. 3-4 p.382-390dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245014700207300001200354506007600366520161300442592002802055506003702083650002302120650002302143650001102166650001902177650003002196650001302226650002102239650002102260650002102281650001002302650001102312650002102323650001902344650002702363650001802390650002502408650001002433650002602443650001102469650000902480650002102489650002502510650002502535651002102560651001002581700005502591700002002646700002002666700001702686773010902703856008202812852000902894655001202903IND60595035720221207071013.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059503572DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-018-1292-12doi7 aPMC59701032pmcid7 a298683052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Rupali10aAdaptive physiological response, carbon partitioning, and biomass production of Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal grown under elevated CO2 regimes  ap. 267.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWinter cherry or Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is an important medicinal plant used in traditional and herbal medicine system. Yet, there is no information available on response of this plant to changing climatic conditions particularly elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to examine the effect of elevated CO₂ concentrations (ECs) on Withania somnifera. The variations in traits of physiological adaptation, net primary productivity, carbon partitioning, morphology, and biomass in response to elevated CO₂ concentrations (ambient, 600 and 800 µmol mol⁻¹) during one growth cycle were investigated within the open top chamber (OTC) facility in the foothill of the Himalayas, Dehardun, India. ECs significantly increased photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, soil respiration, net primary productivity and the carbon content of plant tissues (leaf, stem, and root), and soil carbon. Furthermore, ECs significantly enhanced biomass production (root and shoot), although declined night leaf respiration. Overall, it was summarized that photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, leaf, and soil carbon and biomass increased under ECs rendering the physiological adaptation to the plant. Increased net primary productivity might facilitate mitigation effects by sequestering elevated levels of carbon dioxide. We advocate further studies to investigate the effects of ECs on the accumulation of secondary metabolites and health-promoting substances of this as well as other medicinal plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWithania somnifera 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acherries 3aclimatic factors 3ahealth promotion 3aherbal medicines 3ahills 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aplant tissues 3aprimary productivity 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3ashoots 3asoil 3asoil respiration 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aSingh, Hukum1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2112-61821 aKaushik, Monica1 aNautiyal, Raman1 aSingh, Ombir0 t3 Biotech.g2018 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.267-267dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-018-1292-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170300001800284520105600302536029701358592002801655650002801683650001701711650001101728650001301739650001501752650002201767650001801789653003101807653002901838653003101867653002301898700001701921700001301938700001301951700001501964700001501979700001401994700001202008773012502020856008602145852000902231655001202240IND60752173220221118043541.0220130e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075217322DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16935692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rongshen12aA new triterpenoid and other constituents with cytotoxic activity from the roots of Sanguisorba officinalis L  ap. 3341-3345.  aSanguisorba officinalis L. is a traditional herbal plant that belongs to the genus Sanguisorba and the family Rosaceae. A new ursane-type triterpenoid, 3-oxo-urs-11, 13(18)-dien-19, 28-olide (1), two known ursane-type triterpenoids (3 − 4) and three known oleanane-type triterpenoids (2, 5 − 6) were isolated from the roots of S. officinalis by silica gel column and MPLC. Their structures were identified by interpretation of spectroscopic data (1 D NMR, 2 D NMR, HR-ESI-MS) and comparison with those reported in the literature. Compound 2 was isolated from the Rosaceae family, compounds 3–5 were obtained from the genus Sanguisorba, and compound 6 was obtained from the S. officinalis for the first time. Additionally, all of the isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against three human cancer cells.

Immunosuppressive pharmaceuticals are currently the only experimentally established triggers for recurrent ocular CHV-1 infection in dogs; however, ocular CHV-1 shedding has been reported clinically following strontium-90 beta radiotherapy of the ocular surface and it has been speculated that radiotherapy can directly induce viral reactivation. Strontium-90 is used as a beta radiation source for the treatment of a variety of neoplastic and immune-mediated canine ocular surface diseases. In the present study, the effects of ocular surface strontium-90 beta radiotherapy in dogs latently infected with CHV-1 were evaluated. Ten mature dogs with experimentally induced latent CHV-1 infections were randomly divided into two groups: one group received a single fraction 50Gy radiation dose in one application from a strontium-90 ophthalmic applicator and the second group received sham radiotherapy. Dogs were then monitored for 45 days for recurrent ocular CHV-1 infection using clinical and virological outcome measures. Clinical ophthalmic examinations, ocular sample CHV-1 PCR assays, and serum CHV-1 virus neutralizing antibody assays were performed at specified intervals. No abnormalities suggestive of recurrent CHV-1 ocular disease were observed on clinical examination in any dog during the study. Ocular viral shedding was not detected and CHV-1 virus neutralizing titers remained stable in all dogs. A single fraction 50Gy radiation dose administered to the ocular surface by strontium-90 beta radiotherapy did not result in detectable recurrent ocular CHV-1 infection in mature dogs with experimentally induced latent infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutralization 3ablood serum 3aclinical examination 3adog diseases 3adrugs 3adogs 3aimmunosuppression 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aviral shedding 3aadministered dose 3aCanid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aeye diseases 3aradiotherapy 0aDog 0aStrontium-90 radiotherapy 0aCanine herpesvirus-1 0aBeta radiation 0aRecrudescent disease 0aCanid herpesvirus 11 aMcEntee, Margaret C.1 aLedbetter, Eric C.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Dec. 05, v. 174, no. 3-4 p.433-437dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245004000210300001600250506007600266520135600342592002801698506003701726650003401763650001901797650000901816650001501825700002501840700002001865773012501885856007902010852000902089655001202098IND60312872620221207122714.0150714e20140718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031287262DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12558602doi7 aPMC51019332pmcid7 a250354782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, Francis S.10aNIH Roadmap/Common Fund at 10 years  ap. 274-276.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA fundamental challenge facing all institutions of science, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is whether their structures and disciplines, inherited from the past, continue to reflect the reality of current science and the needs of future science. Without an explicit process of adaptation to changes that often transcend established scientific structures and disciplines, the risk of missing emerging opportunities grows. This is why, 10 years ago, NIH launched an approach to the support of science that transcended all Institutes and Centers, known as the “NIH Roadmap” (1). The NIH Director and the Director of each of the NIH Institutes engaged in a broad priority-setting exercise, informed by extramural and intramural NIH scientists, public representatives, and leaders from other government agencies and the private sector. We asked three questions: What are today's most pressing scientific challenges? What are the roadblocks to progress and what must be done to overcome them? Which efforts are beyond the mandate of one or a few institutes, but are the responsibility of NIH as a whole? Each of the initial Roadmap programs that emerged was designed to achieve defined goals or transition to other sources of support within 10 years. As we have reached the 10th anniversary of these programs, a look back is in order.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Institutes of Health 3aprivate sector 3arisk 3ascientists1 aWilder, Elizabeth L.1 aZerhouni, Elias0 tScience.g2014 July 18, v. 345, no. 6194 p.274-276dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12558603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245008300176300001600259520106900275592002801344650001501372650001801387650002601405650001701431650001901448650003101467650002001498650003301518650001301551653002001564653002701584653001501611653003101626700002101657773011801678856008701796852000901883655001201892IND50060165320221122041241.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006016532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMireei, Seyed Ahmad10aDetecting bunch withering disorder in date fruit by near infrared spectroscopy  ap. 397-403.  aThis study introduces the application of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRs) to detect bunch withering disorder in date fruit (cv. Mazafati). The samples included intact as well as infected date fruits at different stages of ripening. Chemometric evaluation of the data was performed by soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and principal components analysis combined with artificial neural networks (PCA–ANN). The PLS-DA algorithm was able to provide models with the best classification performance, followed by SIMCA and then PCA–ANN. The maturity stage of samples influenced the performance of the classification methods. The classification accuracy for the late harvested samples was better than those harvested at normal time and the combined data set in all classification analyses. The total accuracies of 82%, 93% and 86%, respectively for normal, late and combined data sets demonstrate that NIRs with PLS-DA has a strong potential to detect the bunch withering disorder in date fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adates (fruit) 3adiscriminant analysis 3aharvest date 3amaturity stage 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneural networks 3aprincipal component analysis 3aripening 0aBunch withering 0aClassification methods 0aDate fruit 0aNear infrared spectroscopy1 aSadeghi, Morteza0 tJournal of food engineering.g2013 Feb., v. 114, no. 3 p.397-403dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017300168500002200341520134900363592002801712650002201740650001701762650001501779650001101794650001801805650002101823650001501844650002401859650001601883650001801899650001101917650002301928650001701951700001701968700001301985700001701998700001402015700001802029700001502047700001902062700001802081773005102099856008402150852000902234655001202243IND60573326920221122070107.0170724s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057332692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Linjing10aNickel nanoparticles partially embedded into carbon fiber cloth via metal-mediated pitting process as flexible and efficient electrodes for hydrogen evolution reactions  aPre-press version  aSunlight-driven electrolytic splitting of water is a promising route to hydrogen production, and widespread implementation has called for the development of inexpensive, robust and large-scale electrodes. Here, nickel nanoparticles partially embedded into carbon fiber cloth (NiΦCFC) is prepared on a large scale (e.g., 40 cm × 40 cm) via a metal-mediated pitting process, which is adopted to fabricate hydrogen evolution reaction electrode for the first time. The partially embedded structure is beneficial for regulating the electron density state of carbon, exposing the nickel catalytic sites and improving the catalytic stability. The two kinds of electrochemical area and density functional theory results confirm that the interface effect between nickel and defective carbon leads into a low Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption. The NiΦCFC as flexible and efficient electrodes require a small overpotential of 131.5 mV to achieve −10 mA cm−2. Note that the two-electrode electrolyzer composed of FeNi layered double hydroxide loaded on CFC (NiFe-LDH/CFC) (+)//NiΦCFC (−) possesses a voltage of 1.54 V at −10 mA cm−2, which can also be powered by a solar cell. The facile and large-scale preparation of NiΦCFC as flexible electrodes could be adapted for the industrial hydrogen production powered by solar energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen production 3amethodology 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asolar energy1 aZhou, Weijia1 aJia, Jin1 aXiong, Tanli1 aZhou, Kai1 aFeng, Chunhua1 aZhou, Jian1 aTang, Zhenghua1 aChen, Shaowei0 tCarbon.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010400165300001600269520212900285592002802414650001302442650001302455650000902468650001102477650002602488650001402514650001802528650001102546650001802557650002402575650001102599650001102610651001802621653001802639653001502657653001202672653004702684653001102731700001802742773017902760856008302939852000903022655001203031IND60544509420221121004410.0190417e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054450942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2013.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Helen W.10aChanges in the Energy and Sodium Content of Main Entrées in US Chain Restaurants from 2010 to 2011  ap. 209-219.  aThe food environment shapes individual diets, and as food options change, energy and sodium intake may also shift. Understanding whether and how restaurant menus evolve in response to labeling laws and public health pressures could inform future efforts to improve the food environment.To track changes in the energy and sodium content of US chain restaurant main entrées between spring 2010 (when the Affordable Care Act was passed, which included a federal menu labeling requirement) and spring 2011.Nutrition information was collected from top US chain restaurants' websites, comprising 213 unique brands. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis evaluated change across main entrées overall and compared entrées that were added, removed, and unchanged. Tests of means and proportions were conducted for individual restaurant brands to see how many made significant changes. Separate analyses were conducted for children's menus.Mean energy and sodium did not change significantly overall, although mean sodium was 70 mg lower across all restaurants in added vs removed menu items at the 75th percentile. Changes were specific to restaurant brands or service model: family-style restaurants reduced sodium among higher-sodium entrées at the 75th percentile, but not on average, and entrées still far exceeded recommended limits. Fast-food restaurants decreased mean energy in children's menu entrées by 40 kcal. A few individual restaurant brands made significant changes in energy or sodium, but the vast majority did not, and not all changes were in the healthier direction. Among those brands that did change, there were slightly more brands that reduced energy and sodium compared with those that increased it.Industry marketing and pledges may create a misleading perception that restaurant menus are becoming substantially healthier, but both healthy and unhealthy menu changes can occur simultaneously. Our study found no meaningful changes overall across a 1-year time period. Longer-term studies are needed to track changes over time, particularly after the federal menu labeling law is implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3achildren 3adiet 3aenergy 3afast food restaurants 3amarketing 3amenu planning 3amodels 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3asodium 3aspring 3aUnited States 0aMenu labeling 0aRestaurant 0aObesity 0aPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act 0aSodium1 aSturm, Roland0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2014 Feb., v. 114, no. 2 p.209-219dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2013.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245008900179520197800268592002802246650001802274650001002292650001902302650002402321650002502345650001302370650002802383650002102411650001302432650002202445650001702467650001402484650002402498650001002522650001202532651000902544653002002553653004002573653001102613653001302624653001302637653001002650700002002660700001502680700002002695700001902715700005802734773011902792856008802911852000902999655001203008IND60681456420221117222616.0211227e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068145642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1366222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhamirchi, Ramezanali10aMaternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and cortisol level in cord blood  aExposure to air pollution has been associated with disorders of the endocrine system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; however, the available evidence on these associations is still scarce. This study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the association of exposure to PM₁, PM₂.₅, and PM₁₀, as well as traffic indicators (distance to major roads and total street length in different buffers around maternal residential address) during pregnancy with cortisol level in cord blood samples. This cross-sectional study was carried out based on 150 mother-newborn pairs in Sabzevar, Iran (2018). Land use regression models were applied to estimate air pollution exposure during the entire pregnancy at maternal residential addresses. Multiple linear regression models were applied to estimate the association of exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and cord blood cortisol levels, controlled for relevant covariates. There was a significant positive association between exposure to PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ and cortisol levels in cord blood (β = 2.55, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.57, 4.52, P-value = 0.01, and β = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.28, 4.90, P-value < 0.01, respectively). Moreover, there was a significant positive association between total street length in a 100 m buffer around maternal residence and cortisol level. Each one interquartile range (IQR) increase in distance from home to major roads was associated with a −2.58 (95% CI: −4.85, −0.30, P-value = 0.03) decrease in cord blood cortisol level. The median (IQR) of the cord blood cortisol levels for the first and fourth quartiles of distance to major roads were 50.7 (19.5) and 38.2 (20.4) ng/mL, respectively. The associations for total street length in 300 m and 500 m buffers and PM₁ exposure were not statistically significant. Our findings suggest a direct association of exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and cortisol levels at cord blood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3aconfidence interval 3aconservation buffers 3acortisol 3across-sectional studies 3aendocrine system 3aland use 3amaternal exposure 3aparticulates 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3aroads 3atraffic 3aIran 0aCorticosteroids 0aHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 0aStress 0aPrenatal 0aNeonatal 0aBirth1 aMoslem, Alireza1 aAgah, Jila1 aPozo, Óscar J.1 aMiri, Mohammad1 aDadvand, Payam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2325-10270 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 713 p.136622-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1366223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008400170300001600254500001500270520126400285592002801549650000901577650001301586650002601599650001901625650001501644650002801659650001101687650001101698650001601709650001801725650001501743650001501758653001101773653002401784653003301808653002701841700002401868700001901892700002201911773010601933856008702039852000902126655001202135IND60552971620221119002924.0180830e20161005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055297162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Tingting10aUse of optical interferometry to measure gold nanoparticle adsorption on silica  ap. 383-392.  a2019-12-06  aAdsorption of metal nanoparticles is at the heart of many chemical and biosensor techniques, but there are few approaches that can provide quantitative characterisation of individual nanoparticle films fabricated at different times and/or under different conditions. Using synthesised gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) as a model, the nanoparticle films were investigated using an optical interferometry technique known as fringes of equal chromatic order (FECO), which was further systematically validated against both in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The results indicate that the FECO wavelengths has a quantifiable red shift with increasing particle densities, making it possible to quantify the degree of surface coverage via the analysis of the fringe shift at a fixed fringe order. Moreover, the calculated formula between the FECO shifts and the surface coverage allows quantitative analysis of the whole adsorption kinetics investigated. Particularly, the as-proposed FECO technique can successfully monitor the Au NP adsorption in situ, which could be a new versatile technology platform for ⿿online⿿ monitoring method, for example in biosensor applications using Au NP-tagged analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3ananogold 3aquantitative analysis 3ainterferometry 3amonitoring 3aatomic force microscopy 3amodels 3aquartz 3awavelengths 3ananoparticles 3abiosensors 3aadsorption 0asilica 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aGold nanoparticle adsorption 0aOptical interferometry1 aMartin, Lisandra L.1 aHorn, Roger G.1 aGreene, George W.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Oct. 05, v. 506 p.383-392dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245007200164300001800236500002000254500000900274520208300283592002802366650001902394650001902413650002002432650001302452650002102465650001402486650001102500650001502511650002402526650001502550650001302565650001902578650000902597650001102606650001502617650002002632650001802652651001302670651001302683651001902696651001302715700002102728700002302749700002602772700002102798700002302819700002002842773021902862856008003081961001303161852000903174655001203183IND60666324320221117232522.0220811e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066632432DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2017.03.01022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShober, Amy L.10aAssessing Coastal Plain Risk Indices for Subsurface Phosphorus Loss  ap. 1270-1286.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aPhosphorus (P) Index evaluations are critical to advancing nutrient management planning in the United States. However, most assessments until now have focused on the risks of P losses in surface runoff. In artificially drained agroecosystems of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, subsurface flow is the predominant mode of P transport, but its representation in most P Indices is often inadequate. We explored methods to evaluate the subsurface P risk routines of five P Indices from Delaware, Maryland (two), Virginia, and North Carolina using available water quality and soils datasets. Relationships between subsurface P risk scores and published dissolved P loads in leachate (Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina) and ditch drainage (Maryland) were directionally correct and often statistically significant, yet the brevity of the observation periods (weeks to several years) and the limited number of sampling locations precluded a more robust assessment of each P Index. Given the paucity of measured P loss data, we then showed that soil water extractable P concentrations at depths corresponding with the seasonal high water table (WEPWT) could serve as a realistic proxy for subsurface P losses in ditch drainage. The associations between WEPWT and subsurface P risk ratings reasonably mirrored those obtained with sparser water quality data. As such, WEPWT is seen as a valuable metric that offers interim insight into the directionality of subsurface P risk scores when water quality data are inaccessible. In the long term, improved monitoring and modeling of subsurface P losses clearly should enhance the rigor of future P Index appraisals. CORE IDEAS: We evaluated subsurface P routines of five P Indices in artificially drained soils. Subsurface P ratings mostly accorded with P loads in leachate and ditch drainage. Water extractable P at the seasonal high water table was a proxy for ditch P loss. Useful P Index predictions hinged on accurate depictions of subsurface water flux. Increased monitoring and modeling of subsurface P loss is needed to test P Indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acoastal plains 3adata collection 3adrainage 3ahigh water table 3aleachates 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anutrient management 3aphosphorus 3aplanning 3apollution load 3arisk 3arunoff 3asoil water 3asubsurface flow 3awater quality 3aDelaware 3aMaryland 3aNorth Carolina 3aVirginia1 aBuda, Anthony R.1 aTurner, Kathryn C.1 aFiorellino, Nicole M.1 aAndres, A.

CPPs can also be used as an ideal transfection tool whereby biomacromolecules can be transferred as cargo into recipient cells. Here, a synthesized cell-penetrating peptide (R9)-mediated DNA-free transfection is presented. DNA sequences of nine tandem arginine (R9), one cysteine (cys), reporter mCherry, and histidine label were sequentially constructed into pET-45b(+) expression vector and transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain. The R9-cys-mCherry fusion protein was obtained by prokaryotic expression. The Arabidopsis root tips, Chinese cabbage microspores, and 3-wk-old microspore embryos (MDEs) were used as transfected recipients. With a working concentration of R9-cys-mCherry ranging from 10 to 100 μg mL⁻¹ and overnight incubation, R9-cys-mCherry protein can be translocated into the recipient mentioned above. The transfection efficiency of root tips reached 100%, and that of microspores and MDEs was 8.13% and 94.79%, respectively. A CPP-mediated DNA-free transfection system was built in dicots providing a technical basis for DNA-free CRISPR RNP (ribonucleoprotein) intracellular delivery in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a201608210147cchina scholarship council  a2020-BS-037cdoctoral start-up foundation of liaoning province  a2021M693846cpostdoctoral research foundation of china 3aArabidopsis 3aChinese cabbage 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aarginine 3acysteine 3agenetic vectors 3ahistidine 3apeptides 3aribonucleoproteins 3atransfection1 aZhang, Zhipeng1 aZhu, Kai1 aWang, Yanqiu1 aKe, Fulai1 aZhang, Fei1 aZhao, Ying1 aZhang, Yun1 aFeng, Hui0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2022 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.28-34dSpringer USwJournal:jnl47889x1054-54767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-021-10221-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245007600214300001600290506007600306520160200382592002801984506003702012650002802049650002202077650001802099650001302117650001902130650001502149650002002164650002002184650001902204650002002223650002102243650002002264650002202284650001602306650000902322650001102331650002502342650003302367650002002400653002102420653002102441653001602462653002402478653001802502653003602520700002602556773011402582856008602696852000902782655001202791IND60584353220221207054513.0181012e20171228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058435322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.10.0192doi7 aPMC58317192pmcid7 a290543712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, Md.

Extensive chemical processing ensures allergen-free pollen microcapsules that can be loaded with vaccine antigens. Successful oral vaccine delivery has been previously demonstrated by us in a mouse model. However, the underlying mechanisms that help the processed PGs to achieve this goal were not fully understood. In this study, we wanted to understand the effects of chemically processed ragweed pollen (Ambrosia elatior) on the innate immune system. Intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells all bridge the innate and adaptive immunity. This study has shown that in response to ragweed pollen all these cells release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Scanning electron microscopy imaging revealed that macrophages can engulf ragweed pollen. In addition, in the presence of ragweed, mouse dendritic cells upregulated their activation markers, that is, CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II molecules. Ragweed pollens did not cause significant cell membrane damage as compared to similarly sized poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) particles. Moreover, ragweed did not affect the integrity of the intestinal epithelial cells. Ragweed pollens were also found in the subepithelial region of the small intestine 24h after pollens were gavaged to mice. Our current findings lead to the conclusion that besides transporting the vaccine cargo, ragweed pollen shells have additional immunomodulatory properties that help the orally delivered antigen to effectively induce an immune response.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmbrosia artemisiifolia 3aadaptive immunity 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3acell membranes 3achemokines 3adendritic cells 3aedible vaccines 3aimage analysis 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulators 3ainnate immunity 3aintestinal mucosa 3amacrophages 3amice 3apollen 3aprocessing chemistry 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmall intestine 0aMucosal adjuvant 0aOral vaccination 0aPersorption 0aPollen phagocytosis 0aPollen uptake 0aRagweed pollen vaccine delivery1 aGill, Harvinder Singh0 tJournal of controlled release.g2017 Dec. 28, v. 268 p.416-426dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012800165300001600293520165700309650001501966650001701981650002401998650002702022650001302049650001202062650001302074650001802087650001602105650001502121650001102136650002302147650000902170650003702179650001202216650001202228650004802240650001302288650001302301700001802314700001902332700002802351700001702379700002102396700001802417700002002435773015802455856004702613852000902660655001202669IND60520348220221119193433.0160520e20160203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052034822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b055772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Ching-Shu10aBisdemethoxycurcumin Inhibits Adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes and Suppresses Obesity in High-Fat Diet-Fed C57BL/6 Mice  ap. 821-830.  aObesity is caused by excessive accumulation of body fat and is closely related to complex metabolic diseases. Adipogenesis is a key process that is required in adipocyte hypertrophy in the development of obesity. Curcumin (Cur) has been reported to inhibit adipocyte differentiation, but the inhibitory effects of other curcuminoids present in turmeric, such as demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), on adipogenesis have not been investigated. Here, we investigated the effects of curcuminoids on adipogenesis and the molecular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation. Among three curcuminoids, BDMC was the most effective suppressor of lipid accumulation in adipocytes. BDMC suppressed adipogenesis in the early stage primarily through attenuation of mitotic clonal expansion (MCE). In BDMC-treated preadipocytes, cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase was found after initiation of adipogenesis and was accompanied by downregulation of cyclin A, cyclin B, p21, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The protein levels of the adipogenic transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP)α were also reduced by BDMC treatment. Furthermore, 0.5% dietary BDMC (w/w) significantly lowered body weight gain and adipose tissue mass in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The results of H&E staining showed that dietary BDMC reduced hypertrophy in adipocytes. These results demonstrate for the first time that BDMC suppressed adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and prevented HFD-induced obesity. Our results suggest that BDMC has the potential to prevent obesity. 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3abody weight changes 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acurcumin 3acyclins 3afat body 3ahigh fat diet 3ahypertrophy 3ainterphase 3alipids 3ametabolic diseases 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitosis 3aobesity 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3astaining 3aturmeric1 aChen, Ying-Yi1 aLee, Pei-Sheng1 aKalyanam, Nagabhushanam1 aHo, Chi-Tang1 aLiou, Wen-Shiung1 aYu, Roch-Chui1 aPan, Min-Hsiung0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Feb. 3, v. 64, no. 4 p.821-830dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05577  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008900168300001300257520118500270592002801455650001701483650001101500650001401511650001401525650001901539650001601558651001201574651001801586653001801604653001101622653002001633653002201653653001501675653002101690653001601711653001601727653002401743700002201767773012101789856008201910852000901992655001202001IND60526385920221120211913.0190405e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052638592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2015.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakobek, Lidija10aAncient apple varieties from Croatia as a source of bioactive polyphenolic compounds  ap. 9-15.  aSeveral ancient apple varieties and a wild apple variety grown in Croatia were analysed for the polyphenol content and compared to two varieties grown in USA. In the flesh, flavanols, dihydrochalcones and phenolic acids (24 to 137, 23 to 109, 3 to 238mgkg−1 of fresh weight (FW), respectively) were found. Peel contained flavanols, dihydrochalcones, phenolic acids, flavonols and anthocyanins (65 to 690, 21 to 141, 0 to 107, 205 to 1223, 0 to 213mgkg−1 FW, respectively). The wild apple was characterized by much higher flavanol and phenolic acid content in the flesh (301 and 734mgkg−1 FW, respectively) while the peel was similar to other apples. The polyphenol profile was similar to apples from USA. The varieties Zimnjara, Lještarka and Adamova zvijezda could be highlighted as sources of polyphenols. Varieties are categorized by the content of dihydrochalcones and flavanols in the flesh (whether that content is high or low), and by the relative portion of phenolic acids and flavanols in the flesh (high phenolic acid proportion, lower flavanol proportion and vice versa). There was not observed to be as strong a pattern for categorizing differences in the peel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aapples 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3aphenolic acids 3apolyphenols 3aCroatia 3aUnited States 0aFood analysis 0aApples 0aMalus domestica 0aAncient varieties 0aWild apple 0aFood composition 0aPolyphenols 0aRP-HPLC-PDA 0aBioactive compounds1 aBarron, Andrew R.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2016 Feb., v. 45 p.9-15dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2015.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011200165520192200277592002802199650003402227650002402261650002502285650001602310650002302326650001802349650001702367650004102384650001002425650003302435650001102468650001602479650001202495650001002507650000702517650002402524650002302548650000902571650001802580650001102598650001402609650001102623653002802634653001002662700001602672700001702688700001802705700001702723700005802740773009502798856008302893852000902976655001202985IND60753825620221123002815.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075382562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1014142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Yanrong10aScreening and evaluation of suitable non-Saccharomyces yeast for aroma improvement of fermented mango juice  aA total of 101 yeast strains were isolated through the enrichment culture of various mango peels and soil. Twenty-six (26) strains of non-Saccharomyces yeast were identified using lysine identification medium and re-screened by fermentation performance. Three strains, namely, Pichia kudriavzevii HDX1, P. kudriavzevii HDA2, and P. kudriavzevii HDY1, were selected and identified by the internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Angel aroma-producing yeast was used as a control, and the physicochemical indexes of Pichia kudriavzevii HDX1 fermented mango juice (FMJ) were analyzed. After 36 h of fermentation at 30 °C, the pH, total soluble solids, total phenol content, and the number of viable yeasts of mango juice (MJ) were measured. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) free-radical scavenging capability and total antioxidant capacity were used to characterize their antioxidant capacity. The results showed that P. kudriavzevii HDX1 grew well in MJ with the smallest pH change and strongest antioxidant properties; its total acid content increased to 15.28 mg/mL, whereas the total sugar content decreased to 36.28 g/L after fermentation. The total acid of MJ fermented by Angel aroma-producing yeast (MJFA) increased to 17.10 mg/mL, and the total sugar decreased to 81.03 g/L, further proving the high sugar utilization rate of P. kudriavzevii HDX1. Compared with MJFA, which produced a low alcohol content and contained more phenylethyl alcohol with rose and honey fragrance, more ethyl acetate with fruity aroma, and more beta-ionone with fruity, floral, and sweet flavor, the aroma of MJ fermented by P.kudriavzevii HDX1 (MJFP) improved as shown by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The MJFP exhibited the highest overall acceptability via sensory analysis. On the whole, P. kudriavzevii HDX1 has an enhanced effect on FMJ aroma.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPichia kudriavzevii 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-ionone 3aenrichment culture 3aethyl acetate 3afermentation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahoney 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alysine 3amango juice 3amangoes 3aodors 3apH 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3asensory evaluation 3asoil 3asugar content 3asugars 3asweetness 3ayeasts 0aNon-Saccharomyces yeast 0aAroma1 aZhang, Ming1 aChen, Wenxue1 aChen, Haiming1 aChen, Weijun1 aZhong, Qiuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2864-39240 tFood bioscience.g2021 Dec., v. 44 p.101414-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1014143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011500166300001600281520121200297592002801509650001401537650001301551650001401564650001401578650001001592650001401602650003101616650001701647650002501664650001701689650002201706650002001728650002401748650001701772650001201789650001601801653001401817653001201831653001001843653001601853653001201869700001701881700001501898700001901913773013701932856008302069852000902152655001202161IND60622062320221119202533.0181123e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062206232DNAL7 a10.1106/6A9R-DKEV-ADV7-Y30X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscriche, I.10aEffect of Ozone Treatment and Storage Temperature on Physicochemical Properties of Mushrooms (Agaris bisporus)  ap. 251-258.  aThe aim of this paper was to determine the effect of ozone, storage time and temperature on postharvest quality of mushroom (Agaris bisporus var. Gurelan 55). Mushrooms, treated with ozone (100 mg/h) during 0, 15 or 25 minutes, were packed in polystyrene packs, overwrapped with PVC plastic film, and stored at 5, 15 or 25 °C for seven days. Internal and external lightness (L*) texture properties, maturity index and weight loss were analyzed during storage. Ozone treatment on mushrooms prior to packaging caused an increase in external browning rate and a reduction of the internal browning rate. The ozone treatment exhibited no significant differences in terms of texture, maturity index and weight loss of mushrooms. Increased storage time and temperatures meant an increase in browning, senescence and weight loss, as well as a decrease in firmness, following, in all cases, a zero-order reaction kinetics. Temperature dependence of the reaction rates coule be described by Arrhenius equation. Among all the quality parameters assessed in this research, weight loss was the most affected by temperature increase (Ea = 17.60 kcal/mol). The lowest storage temperature (5 °C) favored the best quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3afirmness 3amushrooms 3aozonation 3aozone 3apackaging 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplastic film 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolystyrenes 3areaction kinetics 3astorage quality 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atexture 3aweight loss 0amushrooms 0astorage 0aozone 0atemperature 0aquality1 aSerra, J.

Moderate to severe acute migraine attacks can be treated with dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE), an ergot derivative that is especially effective in non-responders to triptan derivatives. To overcome limitations of current DHE formulations in subcutaneous injection and nasal spray such as pain, adverse side effects and poor bioavailability, a new approach is needed for DHE delivery enabling painless self-administration, quick onset of action, and high bioavailability. In this study, we developed a dissolving microneedle patch (MNP) made of polyvinylpyrrolidone, due to its high aqueous solubility and solubility enhancement properties, using a MNP design previously shown to be painless and simple to administer. DHE-loaded MNPs were shown to have a content uniformity of 108±9% with sufficient mechanical strength for insertion to pig skin ex vivo and dissolution within 2min. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies were carried out on hairless rats, and DHE plasma levels were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The area under curve (AUC) value after DHE delivery by MNP (1259±917ng/mL min) was not significantly different (p>0.05) as compared to subcutaneous injection, with a relative bioavailability of 97%. Also, appreciable plasma levels of DHE were seen within 5min for both delivery methods and tmax value of MNPs (38±23min) showed no significant difference (p>0.05) compared to subcutaneous injection (24±13min). These results suggest that DHE-loaded MNPs have promise as an alternative DHE delivery method that can be painlessly self-administered with rapid onset and high bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3anose 3apain 3apharmacokinetics 3abioavailability 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3amigraine 3astrength (mechanics) 3asubcutaneous injection 3aswine 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aquality of life 3anervous system diseases 3asolubility 3aliquid chromatography 3aadverse effects 3arats 0aDihydroergotamine mesylate 0aPolyvinylpyrrolidone 0aLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 0aBioavailability 0aRapid onset 0aMigraine 0atherapeutics 0aMicroneedle patch1 aJoyce, Jessica C.1 aNguyen, Hiep X.1 aEangoor, Padmanabhan1 aKnaack, Jennifer S.1 aBanga, Ajay K.1 aPrausnitz, Mark R.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2017 Dec. 28, v. 268 p.159-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012800173520167400301592002801975650001802003650002002021650002802041650001702069650001402086650002902100650001402129650001902143650002502162650001402187650001502201650002302216650001502239650001602254650002402270650001102294650001302305650001102318650001102329650002202340651001402362653002302376653002502399653002702424653002802451653001702479653003102496700002002527700002202547700002002569773011902589856008802708852000902796655001202805IND60681456820221117222617.0211227e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068145682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1366292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTracey, Sean R.10aHome range, site fidelity and synchronous migrations of three co-occurring, morphologically distinct estuarine fish species  aDetermining the movement behaviours of animals is essential for understanding population dynamics. This is fundamental for developing effective spatial management strategies and in assessing the response of species to anthropogenic disturbance. This study uses a Bayesian state-space model applied to acoustic transmitter data to describe the temporal and spatial movement patterns of three estuarine fish species commonly targeted by recreational anglers in southeast Australia: Black Bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri), Sand Flathead (Platycephalus bassensis), and Brown Trout (Salmo trutta). Despite morphological differences between the three species, several common traits were observed in their movement and behaviour. Of the 50 individuals across all three species that were tracked, the vast majority remained within the estuary where they were tagged for the duration of the study. While the home ranges of the three species differed in size, all individuals remained resident around the mid-estuary where the majority of fish were tagged were released. Each of the species also displayed seasonal migrations, presumably linked to spawning. The timing of the beginning of these migrations was well synchronised both within and among species, starting in late spring/early summer. This suggests that environmental factors such as water temperature and day length may play an important role in cueing spawning behaviour for each of the species. These migratory behaviours suggest adverse changes to estuarine conditions such as reduced river flows may have potential consequences for spawning success for some species and hence implications for fisheries management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthopagrus 3aBayesian theory 3aPlatycephalus bassensis 3aSalmo trutta 3aacoustics 3aanthropogenic activities 3aestuaries 3aestuarine fish 3afisheries management 3afishermen 3ahome range 3amigratory behavior 3aphilopatry 3aphotoperiod 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3aspawning 3aspring 3asummer 3awater temperature 3aAustralia 0aAcoustic telemetry 0aRecreational fishing 0aAcanthopagrus butcheri 0aPlatycephalus bassensis 0aSalmo trutta 0aBayesian state-space model1 aHartmann, Klaas1 aMcAllister, Jaime1 aLyle, Jeremy M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 713 p.136629-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1366293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01943naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245007300163300001400236520075100250592002801001650002801029650001701057650001101074650001501085650001001100650001001110650003101120650001001151650001401161653001001175653002101185653001201206653001401218700001601232700001501248700001601263700001501279773013501294856008301429852000901512655001201521IND60622062520221119202300.0181123e200102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062206252DNAL7 a10.1106/7CAF-U2DW-BBH2-VUQV2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanga, A.10aCell-Wall Degrading Enzymes in the Release of Grape Aroma Precursors  ap. 83-87.  aThe potential use of cell-wall degrading enzymes, such as xylanase and endoglucanase, for the release of nonvolatile aroma precursors during maceration of Chenin grapes was evaluated.

The latex (part of the plant used for this purpose) is mixed with water and taken as treatment; but this matrix contains toxic potential related to the presence of some phorbol type diterpenes. So the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the crude extract of the bark of E. umbellata and its fractions (Hex, CHCl3, EtOAc and MeOH) using in vitro assay (applying Jurkat cells line). A preliminary cytotoxic study (MTT reduction, trypan blue exclusion and DNA quantification assays) was executed to identify the most active material. The CHCl3 fraction displayed the highest activity and was selected for further investigation of any cytotoxic mechanism and evaluation of chemical composition; flow cytometry, Acridine orange and Hoechst 33342 staining experiments and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis were applied to achieve these results. This fraction demonstrated the best cytotoxic results against Jurkat cells line with IC50 of 29.00±1.49, 10.06±1.48 and 4.83±2.25μg/ml for 24, 48 and 72h of experiment, respectively (trypan blue exclusion). The mechanism responsible for this action can be associated with the promotion of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The two main classes of compounds present in the CHCl3 fraction are steroids and triterpenes. Further, phytochemical studies with this fraction need to be evaluated, to try isolating these substances and establishing a more detailed cytotoxic study against Jurkat cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEuphorbia 3aacridine orange 3aapoptosis 3abark 3acell cycle checkpoints 3achemical composition 3achloroform 3acytotoxicity 3aditerpenoids 3aethyl acetate 3aflow cytometry 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ain vitro studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alatex 3amethanol 3aneoplasms 3astaining 3asteroids 3atraditional medicine 3atriterpenoids 3aBrazil 0aLeukemia 0aCellular viability 0aFolk medicine 0aGC–MS 0aSterols 0aTriterpenes1 aLeffers, Talissa1 aCruz, Luiza S.1 aLuz, Lívia E.C.1 aCrisma, Amanda R.1 aWang, Mei1 aAvula, Bharathi1 aKhan, Ikhlas A.1 aBeltrame, Flávio L.0 tRevista Brasileira de Farmacognosia.g2017 Mar.,  Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.206-213dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de FarmacognosiawJournal:23273x0102-695X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjp.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007800170300001600248520130800264592002801572650001101600650002201611650002801633650002101661650002201682650002101704650001301725650003901738650001401777650002501791650002501816650001101841650002701852650002001879700002001899700002301919700001801942700001701960773009701977856008502074852000902159655001202168IND60086072720221119082511.0141101e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008607272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrueba, Ana F.10aEffects of psychosocial stress on the pattern of salivary protein release  ap. 841-849.  aPrevious research suggests that acute stress can increase the release of immune-relevant proteins in saliva. However, no attempts have been made to examine a wider range of salivary proteins in response to stress. In this study, we identified and quantified changes in the pattern of salivary protein release in a 45min time period following the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in 12 asthmatic and 13 healthy participants. Proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The relative protein amounts were quantified using the Image J software (NIH), and identified and characterized using mass spectroscopy. Negative affect was increased immediately after stress in both groups. The results showed that alpha amylase, cystatin S and light chain IgA were increased after the TSST and significant increases in glutathione S-transferase and prolactin inducible protein were also observed. Asthma patients showed responses similar to healthy controls, but had a tendency toward overall lower alpha amylase levels. Our findings suggest that a variety of proteins relevant to mucosal immunity are elevated following acute psychosocial stress, including glutathione S-transferase and prolactin inducible protein, which had not been characterized in this context before.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3acomputer software 3aglutathione transferase 3aimmunoglobulin A 3amass spectrometry 3amucosal immunity 3apatients 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprolactin 3apsychological stress 3apsychosocial factors 3asaliva 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3astress response1 aMizrachi, Dario1 aAuchus, Richard J.1 aVogel, Pia D.1 aRitz, Thomas0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 105, no. 3 p.841-849dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008600170506010400256506007600360520136900436592002801805506003701833650001201870650001101882650002001893650002301913650001901936650001301955650001901968650001701987650001102004650001102015650001702026650001802043650002302061650002502084651001602109653002902125653002402154653003002178700001502208700001902223700001702242700002102259700002002280700002002300700002402320773010102344856008302445852000902528655001202537IND60753826020221207101845.0220423e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075382602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.1009452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAminjafari, Saeid10aDrivers and extent of surface water occurrence in the Selenga River Delta, Russia  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSelenga River Delta (SRD), Russia. How is water occurrence changing in the SRD, and what are the hydroclimatic drivers behind these changes? The presence of water on the surface in river deltas is governed by land use, geomorphology, and the flux of water to and from the Delta. We trained an accurate image classification of the Landsat satellite imagery during the last 33 years to quantify surface water occurrence and its changes in the SRD. After comparing our estimations with global-scale datasets, we determined the hydrological drivers of these changes. We find mild decreases in water occurrence in 51% of the SRD's surface area from 1987–2002 to 2003–2020. Water occurrence in the most affected areas decreased by 20% and in the most water-gaining areas increased by 10%. We find a significant relationship between water occurrence and runoff (R² =0.56) that does not exist between water occurrence and suspended sediment concentration (SSC), Lake Baikal's water level, and potential evapotranspiration. The time series of water occurrence follows the peaks in the runoff but not its long-term trend. However, the extremes in SSC do not influence surface water occurrence (R² <0.1), although their long-term trends are similar. Contrary to expected, we find that the Delta has a relatively stable long-term water availability for the time being.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLandsat 3aRussia 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3aimage analysis 3aland use 3aremote sensing 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3arunoff 3asurface area 3asurface water 3asuspended sediment 3atime series analysis 3aLake Baikal 0aSurface water occurrence 0aSelenga River Delta 0aSupervised classification1 aBrown, Ian1 aChalov, Sergey1 aSimard, Marc1 aLane, Charles R.1 aJarsjö, Jerker1 aDarvishi, Mehdi1 aJaramillo, Fernando0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 38 p.100945-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.1009453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011800169300001500287520107100302592002801373650001501401650002101416650001601437650001101453651001101464651001201475700001901487773009001506856008701596852000901683655001201692IND60086146820221117111142.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008614682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolak, Omer10aCan a small artificial reef reduce diving pressure from a natural coral reef? Lessons learned from Eilat, Red Sea  ap. 94-100.  aPart of the decline of coral reefs is attributed to the physical damage caused by divers. Consequently, active efforts are being invested to mitigate the diving pressure on and around natural reefs. We measured the effect of artificial reef (AR) placement on the diving behaviors of divers in training in the Red Sea’s Gulf of Eilat on the southern tip of Israel. Dive groups were followed, and their diving times in an adjacent marine protected area (MPA) and surrounding natural coral outcrops were recorded. Time spent inside the MPA did not change. However, in-training divers reduced their times in the MPA and at two adjacent coral outcrops following AR deployment, but they did not alter other elements of their dives; coral transplantation did not affect diving behavior. A dive entry point located at least 90-m from the border of the MPA was sufficient to reduce dive time in the MPA. The AR had only a partial impact on diver behavior. Accordingly, future projects should take into account location, size, aesthetics, and the target visitors of the ARs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aartificial reefs 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aIsrael 3aRed Sea1 aShashar, Nadav0 tOcean & coastal management.g2012 Jan., v. 55 p.94-100dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03831naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013000172300001600302520192700318592002802245650001802273650001302291650002102304650002102325650001902346650001902365650001002384650001802394650001002412650001602422650001302438650001202451650001002463650002302473650001402496650001802510650001302528650002002541650001402561650001402575650001702589653003502606653002202641653002502663653002602688653001302714653003202727653003902759653001502798700001802813700002102831700002302852700002502875700006102900700002302961773011402984856008603098852000903184655001203193IND60584353720221122171227.0181012e20171228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058435372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurato, Cristian10aNew molecular targets for functionalized nanosized drug delivery systems in personalized therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 184-197.  aHepatocellular carcinoma, the most frequent solid tumor of the liver, has a very poor prognosis, being the second most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The incidence and mortality of this liver tumor are increasing in most areas of the world as a consequence of aging and the emerging of new risk factors such as the metabolic syndrome, beside the recognized role of hepatitis B and C viral infections and alcohol abuse. Despite the increasing knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic carcinogenesis, effective therapeutic strategies are still an unmet clinical need. Efforts have been made to develop selective drugs as well as effective targeted drug delivery systems. The development of novel drug carriers for therapeutic molecules can indeed offer a valuable strategy to ameliorate the efficacy of HCC treatment. In this review, we discuss recent drug delivery strategies for HCC treatment based on the exploitation of targeted nanoparticles (NPs). Indeed, a few of these platforms have achieved an advanced stage of preclinical development. Here, we review the most promising drug nanovehicles based on both synthetic and natural polymers, including polysaccharides that have emerged for their biocompatibility and biodegradability. To maximize site-selectivity and therapeutic efficacy, drug delivery systems should be functionalized with ligands which can specifically recognize and bind targets expressed by HCC, namely cell membrane associated antigens, receptors or biotransporters. Cell surface and intracellular molecular targets are exploited either to selectively deliver drug-loaded nanovehicles or to design novel selective therapeutics. In conclusion, the combination of novel and safe drug delivery strategies based on site-specific targeted drug nanovehicles with therapeutic molecular targets may significantly improve the pharmacological efficacy for the treatment of HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol abuse 3aantigens 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acarcinogenesis 3acell membranes 3adeath 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatoma 3aligands 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3amortality 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3aprognosis 3areceptors 3arisk factors 0aHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 0aMolecular targets 0aPolymer therapeutics 0aDrug delivery systems 0aSerpinB3 0aLysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 0aMitotic checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) 0aDNA damage1 aBalasso, Anna1 aCarloni, Vinicio1 aTiribelli, Claudio1 aMastrotto, Francesca1 aMazzocca, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0940-73521 aPontisso, Patrizia0 tJournal of controlled release.g2017 Dec. 28, v. 268 p.184-197dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245006900179300001600248520156300264592002801827650001901855650002301874650002201897650001201919650001001931650001901941650001001960650001901970650001601989650001402005650000902019650000902028700002902037700002802066700002502094700002402119773009702143856008502240852000902325655001202334IND60086072820221119082630.0141101e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008607282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, Marcelo Alves10aPrenatal stress produces sex differences in nest odor preference  ap. 850-855.  aPrenatal stress (PS) and early postnatal environment may alter maternal care. Infant rats learn to identify their mother through the association between maternal care and familiar odors. Female Wistar rats were exposed to restraint stress for 30min, 4 sessions per day, in the last 7days of pregnancy. At birth, pups were cross-fostered and assigned to the following groups: prenatal non-stressed mothers raising non-stressed pups (NS:NS), prenatal stressed mothers raising non-stressed pups (S:NS), prenatal non-stressed mothers raising stressed pups (NS:S), prenatal stressed mothers raising stressed pups (S:S). Maternal behaviors were assessed during 6 postpartum days. On postnatal day (PND) 7, the behavior of male and female pups was analyzed in the odor preference test; and noradrenaline (NA) activity in olfactory bulb (OB) was measured. The results showed that restraint stress increased plasma levels of corticosterone on gestational day 15. After parturition, PS reduced maternal care, decreasing licking the pups and increasing frequency outside the nest. Female pups from the NS:S, S:NS, S:S groups and male pups from the S:S group showed no nest odor preference. Thus, at day 7, female pups that were submitted to perinatal interventions showed more impairment in the nest odor preference test than male pups. No changes were detected in the NA activity in the OB. In conclusion, repeated restraint stress during the last week of gestation reduces maternal care and reduces preference for a familiar odor in rat pups in a sex-specific manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorticosterone 3agender differences 3amaternal behavior 3amothers 3anests 3anorepinephrine 3aodors 3aolfactory bulb 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3apups 3arats1 aSzawka, Raphael Escorsim1 aCentenaro, Lígia Aline1 aDiehl, Luisa Amália1 aLucion, Aldo Bolten0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 105, no. 3 p.850-855dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010500164300001600269520098700285650001901272650001301291650001601304650001701320650001401337650001601351650001101367650001701378650001701395650001501412650002501427650001001452650001401462650001001476700001701486700002401503700002101527700001901548700002401567773015801591856004701749852000901796655001201805IND60520348720221119193323.0160520e20160203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052034872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b051582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuklje, Katja10aBerry Shriveling Significantly Alters Shiraz (Vitis vinifera L.) Grape and Wine Chemical Composition  ap. 870-880.  aBerry shriveling is an often reported occurrence in the Shiraz (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivar. This study investigated the effect of berry shriveling occurring in a high yielding (18.6 ± 1.6 kg/vine) Shiraz vineyard in relation to a temporal investigation of grape and wine composition using three harvest dates. Berry shriveling resulted in delayed total soluble solids and amino acid accumulation into the berry, however differences between treatments diminished or became smaller by the third harvest date. Similarly, ethyl esters of fatty acids and higher alcohol acetates were lower in wines from shriveled berries from the first two harvests; anthocyanins were reduced in wines from shriveled berries at all harvest dates, whereas terpenes were unaltered. Wines made from shriveled berries had higher γ-nonalactone and β-damascenone concentrations. This study provides novel information on the chemical alterations of grapes and wines made from grapes affected by shriveling. 3aVitis vinifera 3aacetates 3aamino acids 3aanthocyanins 3acultivars 3afatty acids 3agrapes 3aharvest date 3asmall fruits 3aterpenoids 3atotal soluble solids 3avines 3avineyards 3awines1 aZhang, Xinyi1 aAntalick, Guillaume1 aClark, Andrew C.1 aDeloire, Alain1 aSchmidtke, Leigh M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Feb. 3, v. 64, no. 4 p.870-880dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05158  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245007100206300001400277520141600291592002801707650002001735650002401755650001801779650001401797650002001811650004401831651001001875651001801885653003301903653003501936653005101971653006002022653001402082653002902096653001302125653001102138653001702149653000902166653001802175653002102193700002402214700007502238700002502313700002102338700007102359773012202430856008202552852000902634655001202643IND60526386520221122041246.0190405e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052638652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2015.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerezo, Ana B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9290-253510aQuality control and determination of melatonin in food supplements  ap. 80-86.  aMelatonin supplements are used widely in Europe and the United States (US) to alleviate jet-lag and other sleep-delay disorders. Recently, the European Commission authorized two health claims for food containing melatonin, with a minimum dose per quantified portion. This study aimed to determine the dose of melatonin in food supplements marketed in Europe (Spain) and the US by validating a liquid chromatography method with diode array detection (LC-DAD). Additionally, contaminants present in melatonin supplements were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to an orbitrap mass spectrometer.We tentatively identified 8 tryptophan-related contaminants in melatonin supplements, suggesting tighter impurity control in melatonin supplements is necessary. The LC-DAD validated method achieved reliable results regarding recovery, precision, repeatability, limit of detection, limit of quantitation and linearity. Label melatonin dose varied from 1–1.95mg/unit and 0.3–5mg/unit for supplements marketed in Europe (Spain) and the US, respectively. Four out of seventeen supplements showed significant deviations from melatonin content declared on the label (from −60% to −20%). Regarding health claims, three out of the ten supplements purchased in Spain should not include the claim “reduction of time taken to fall asleep”, as their melatonin content is lower than 1mg.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adietary supplements 3ahealth claims 3amelatonin 3aquality control 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aSpain 3aUnited States 0aMelatonin (PubChem CID: 896) 0aTryptophan (PubChem CID: 6305) 0a3-(Phenylamino)alanine (PubChem CID: 22062824) 0a1,1′-Ethylidenebis(tryptophan) (PubChem CID: 3905118) 0aMelatonin 0aFood/dietary supplements 0aOrbitrap 0aLC-DAD 0aHealth claim 0aDose 0aFood analysis 0aFood composition1 aLeal, A.q(Angela),1 aÁlvarez-Fernández, M.

In work reported here, cDOP was destarched (DOP, 90% yield) and separated into two subfraction polysaccharides, DOPa and DOPb, which were characterized by monosaccharide composition and methylation analyses and spectral analyses (FT-IR and 1H and 13C NMR). Both are composed of mannose and glucose at similar ratios and have a similar structure with a backbone of 1,4-linked β-d-mannopyranosyl and β-d-glucopyranosyl residues. Significant differences were observed only in their molecular weights. Bioassay using mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 indicated that DOP and its two subfractions enhance cell proliferation, TNF-α secretion, and phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. They also induced the proliferation of lymphocytes alone and with mitogens. DOPa and DOPb are thus proven to be major, active polysaccharide markers of D. officinale. 3aDendrobium officinale 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3acell proliferation 3adose response 3aglucose 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3amannose 3amethylation 3amice 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphagocytosis 3apolysaccharides 3asecretion 3aspectral analysis 3atea 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aAsia1 aFeng, Lei1 aBao, Wan-Rong1 aMa, Dik-Lung1 aLeung, Chung-Hang1 aNie, Shao-Ping1 aHan, Quan-Bin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Feb. 3, v. 64, no. 4 p.881-889dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05180  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245005000167300001400217520070000231592002800931650001000959650000900969650000900978650003300987650001201020650001001032650001401042650000901056650001001065650002301075651001101098653001601109653002001125653001601145653000801161653001901169653002901188700002601217700002001243773011001263856008701373852000901460655001201469IND60559674120221119225025.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055967412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvner, Uzi10aSymbolism of the ibex motif in Negev rock art  ap. 35-43.  aThe male ibex is the dominant zoomorphic motif in rock art of the Negev desert, Israel. It recurs in thousands of petroglyphs, either alone or in association with several recurring images; commonly with dogs or other predators but also with hunters. These associations occur in all chronological phases of Negev rock art, implying that they had an enduring symbolic significance. Here we address only some aspects of ibex iconography, focusing on its association with dogs, hunters and astral symbols. We discuss the possible meaning of these associations with regard to the ritual hunting of ibex and connection to deities associated with rainfall, seasonal cycles and celestial constellations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra 3aarts 3adogs 3adry environmental conditions 3ahunters 3amales 3apredators 3arain 3arocks 3aseasonal variation 3aIsrael 0aPetroglyphs 0aRock engravings 0aNubian ibex 0aDog 0aRitual hunting 0aCelestial constellations1 aHorwitz, Liora Kolska1 aHorowitz, Wayne0 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 Aug., v. 143 p.35-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012200175300001600297520206800313592002802381596006702409650001902476650001802495650001402513650000902527650001902536650001402555650002202569650001002591650002102601650001402622650001302636650001402649650001302663650002002676650001202696650001802708650001602726650001902742650001302761700002402774700002802798700002002826700003602846700005902882773013002941856008303071852000903154655001203163IND60768111820221116231701.0220225e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076811182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-021-10207-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheerawitaya, Cattarin10aShoot meristem culture eliminates bacterial and fungal infections from elite varieties of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.)  ap. 146-154.  aTurmeric (Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae)) is a rich source of medicinally important chemical compounds obtained from both pseudostem (aboveground part) and rhizome (underground part). However, the availability of disease-free elite varieties of the plant is highly restricted. Leaf spot caused by Colletotrichum curcumae Butler & Bisby and bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum Safni have been reported as major diseases responsible for reduced rhizome productivity in the turmeric plant. Meristem culture is a well-known alternative for production of disease-free mother rhizome. The aim of this investigation was to eradicate bacterial and fungal disease instances through culturing of meristematic tissue pretreated with 1.44 to −2.88 μM GA (gibberellic acid) followed by detection of disease contamination using PCR amplification and chemical assay. Meristem (0.5 to 2.0 mm) was identified as a good material for initiating tissue culture, as it exhibited 100% survival rate and absence of R. pseudosolanacearum and C. curcumae when tested with SPA (sucrose peptone agar), TZC (Kelman’s tripheny tetrazolium chloride), and PDA (potato dextrose agar) selective media. Plantlets derived from meristematic tissues of size 2.0 mm were healthy and displayed rapid recovery and uniformity in size. Disease-free status of plantlets (derived from meristem culture) was confirmed by PCR products of specific primers, RP1F/RP1R and RP3F/RP3R for R. pseudosolanacearum and CCactF/CCactR and CChisF/CChisR for C. curcumae. Moreover, shoot elongation using supplemented GA in the culture medium was successfully induced for meristem cutting. All meristem cultures pretreated with GA were confirmed to be contamination-free through TZC, SPA, and PDA media as well as PCR amplification. Based on this study, the 1.0 to 2.0 mm in size of meristem cutting and pretreatment with 1.44 to 2.88 μM GA for shoot elongation were successfully identified in addition to confirming the disease-free status of the plantlets using chemical assay and PCR products.  aPublisher supplied data  aP-18-52840cNational Science and Technology Development Agency 3aColletotrichum 3aCurcuma longa 3aRalstonia 3aagar 3abacterial wilt 3achlorides 3adisease detection 3afungi 3agibberellic acid 3aleaf spot 3apeptones 3aplantlets 3arhizomes 3ashoot meristems 3asucrose 3asurvival rate 3atetrazolium 3atissue culture 3aturmeric1 aKyaw, Myo Myat Myat1 aSamphumphuang, Thapanee1 aPinruan, Umpawa1 aWiriyathanawudhiwong, Natthawut1 aCha-um, Suriyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7662-363X0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2022 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.146-154dSpringer USwJournal:jnl47889x1054-54767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-021-10207-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003200153245009200185300001600277520148100293592002801774650001201802650002801814650001101842650002901853650001101882650002801893650002801921650001301949650000901962650001301971650001801984651001002002700002702012700002802039700003202067773009102099856008702190852000902277655001202286IND60086147120221117110009.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008614712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalomino de Dios, Alejandro10aEnvironmental quality of Sitges (Catalonia, NE Spain) beaches during the bathing season  ap. 128-134.  aSitges is an important tourist attraction to local (especially from the Barcelona metropolitan area), national and international visitors. Beaches are one of the main resources used and, therefore, human pressure on them is high. The number of beach management issues is large and we focus here on the use of several coastal environmental indicators (coastline evolution, submarine and dune phytoindicators, microbiological quality of sand and water, and beach litter) to assess beach quality. Beach surface has considerably increased since 1956 by the construction of breakwaters and ports, but some beaches are still prone to erosion. An adequate management of the, nowadays fragile, underwater prairies and dune vegetation could increase their coastal protection function and other environmental values. The quality of water and sand is in general excellent, but some of the beaches close to the compact City Centre have shown some microbial contamination events in the past. The surface density, distribution and composition of beach litter provide useful information to study visitor behaviour. We concluded that, during the bath season, the mean available surface is about 9 m²/user, but important differences exist amongst beaches. Beach occupancy depends on factors such as beach length and surface, and distance to the City Centre. This multiparametric and integrated approach can be useful to promote strategies for better beach management in Sitges and worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3aenvironmental indicators 3ahumans 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobiological quality 3aprairies 3asand 3atourists 3awater quality 3aSpain1 aCabrera Salvat, Marcel1 aMartinez Garrido, Enric1 aSanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert0 tOcean & coastal management.g2012 Jan., v. 55 p.128-134dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245008600178300001600264520156400280592002801844650001601872650001901888650001401907650002301921650002101944650001501965650001301980650001301993650001602006653001702022653002102039653003402060700002102094700002402115700006002139773010602199856008702305852000902392655001202401IND60552972520221119002718.0180830e20161005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055297252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartenstein, Julia E.10aStability of polymersomes prepared by size exclusion chromatography and extrusion  ap. 739-746.  aIn this work, stability of poly(butadiene)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PBD-PEO) polymersomes, self-assembled from two polymers with different molecular weights (PBD32-PEO21 and PBD125-PEO80) in either pure H2O or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), is studied. Polymersome dispersions usually show large polydispersity, and it is thus desirable to separate different-sized vesicles if a narrow size distribution is required, e.g. for model systems in certain applications. This is typically achieved by extrusion through a membrane with a designated pore size or, less commonly, by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Here, we find that both extrusion and SEC of polymersome dispersions with vesicle sizes ranging from 100 to 5000nm and polydispersity index (PDI)=1, can yield smaller vesicles with PDIs<0.35. With SEC, it is possible to separate fractions of polymersomes with different sizes. However, the SEC polymersome size and particularly the spread in the size increase significantly over time, whereas the extruded polymersomes are shown to be more stable. We attribute this to possible dilution of the polymersome dispersion during the SEC elusion process. The effects of temperature and the PBD-PEO molecular weight on the stability of the extruded polymersomes against dilution in pure water and phosphate buffer are further studied. It is found that the polymersomes show higher stability when stored at lower temperature, undiluted, and prepared in phosphate buffer, whereas the polymer molecular weight does not have a large influence on the stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispersions 3aethylene oxide 3aextrusion 3agel chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aphosphates 3apolymers 3aporosity 3atemperature 0aPolymersomes 0aPolymer vesicles 0aSize exclusion chromatography1 aRobertson, James1 aBattaglia, Giuseppe1 aBriscoe, Wuge H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8025-960X0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Oct. 05, v. 506 p.739-746dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245009900209300001400308520086400322592002801186650002101214650000901235650001801244650003301262650001901295650001401314650001001328651001701338773011001355856008701465852000901552655001201561IND60559674220221119225125.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055967422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3855-157214aThe vultures of Kalabasput: On the interpretation of a series of unusual Karoo rock engravings  ap. 44-49.  aA rock engraving site at Kalabasput in the Upper Karoo, South Africa, includes an unusual set of engravings featuring vultures. In relation to the ‘frequently depicted’ subject matter of South African rock art – such as eland and ostrich – images of vultures are rare. The site provides an opportunity for considering these unusual images relative to a background of “shared, transcending beliefs and values”, showing how they may have acted as metaphors for altered states of consciousness. But the paper points further to the possible ways in which the contingencies of particular places and histories may have influenced the production of unique or uncommon images. The art, it is suggested, was not merely the passive reflection of a cultural or rock art tradition but, given particular contexts, was part of its dynamic, on-going elaboration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTragelaphus oryx 3aarts 3aconsciousness 3adry environmental conditions 3aimage analysis 3aostriches 3arocks 3aSouth Africa0 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 Aug., v. 143 p.44-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245011300211300001200324506007600336520198400412592002802396506003702424650001602461650001602477650001802493650002902511650001102540650001102551650002402562650002102586650002602607650001302633650000702646650001802653650002402671650001302695650002302708650001102731650001102742650001102753651001002764651001202774700002702786700002202813773013402835856008102969852000903050655001203059IND60439513920221207103825.0160124e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043951392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4874-y2doi7 aPMC46110072pmcid7 a264078622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNassar, Mohamed Z.10aPhytoplankton variability in relation to some environmental factors in the eastern coast of Suez Gulf, Egypt  ap. 648.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWater samples were seasonally collected from 12 stations of the eastern coast of Suez Gulf during autumn of 2012 and winter, spring, and summer of 2013 in order to investigate phytoplankton community structure in relation to some physicochemical parameters. The study area harbored a diversified phytoplankton community (138 species), belonging to 67 genera. Four algal groups were represented and classified as Bacillariophyceae (90 species), Dinophyceae (28 species), Cyanophyceae (16 species), and Chlorophyceae (4 species). The results indicated a relative high occurrence of some species namely.; Pleurotaenium trabecula of green algae; Chaetoceros lorenzianus, Proboscia alata var. gracillima, Pseudosolenia calcar-avis, and Pseudo-nitzschia pungens of diatoms; Trichodesmium erythraeum and Pseudoanabaena limnetica of cyanophytes. Most of other algal species were fairly distributed at the selected stations of the study area. The total abundance of phytoplankton was relatively low (average of 2989 unit/L) in the eastern coast of Suez Gulf, as compared its western coast and the northern part of the Red Sea. The diversity of phytoplankton species was relatively high (2.35–3.82 nats) with an annual average of 3.22 nats in the present study. The results concluded that most of eastern coast of Suez Gulf is still healthy, relatively unpolluted, and oligotrophic area, which is clearly achieved by the low values of dissolved phosphate (0.025–0.3 μM), nitrate (0.18–1.26 μM), and dissolved ammonium (0.81–5.36 μM). Even if the occurrence of potentially harmful algae species was low, the study area should be monitored continuously. The dissolved oxygen ranged between 1.77 and 8.41 mg/L and pH values between 7.6 and 8.41. The multiple regression analysis showed that the dissolved nitrate and pH values were the most effective factors that controlled the seasonal fluctuations of phytoplankton along the eastern coast of Suez Gulf during 2012–2013.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChaetoceros 3aDinophyceae 3aPleurotaenium 3aTrichodesmium erythraeum 3aautumn 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3anitrates 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3aregression analysis 3asampling 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aEgypt 3aRed Sea1 aEl-Din, Nihal G.

M.10aImpact of aging on heat shock protein expression in the substantia nigra and striatum of the female rat  ap. 43-54.  aMany heat shock proteins are chaperones that help refold or degrade misfolded proteins and battle apoptosis. Because of their capacity to protect against protein misfolding, they may help keep diseases of aging at bay. A few reports have examined heat shock proteins (eg. Hsp25, Hsp60, Hsp70, and heat shock cognate 70 or Hsc70) as a function of age in the striatum and nigra. In the present study, we examined the impact of aging on Hsp25, heme oxygenase 1 (HO1 or Hsp32), Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsc70, Hsc/Hsp70 interacting protein (Hip), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), Hsp90, and ubiquitinated proteins in the nigra and striatum of the female rat by infrared immunoblotting. Female animals are not typically examined in aging studies, adding further to the novelty of our study. Striatal HO1 and Hsp40 were both higher in middle-aged females than in the oldest group. Hsp60 levels were also highest in middle age in the nigra, but were highest in the oldest animals in the striatum. Striatal levels of Hsc70 and the co-chaperone Hip were lower in the oldest group relative to the youngest animals. In contrast, Hsp25 rose with advancing age in both regions. Hsp25 was also colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase in nigral neurons. Ubiquitinated proteins exhibited a trend to rise in the oldest animals in both regions, and K48 linkage-specific ubiquitin rose significantly from 4–6 to 16–19 months in the striatum. Our study reveals a complex array of age-related changes in heat shock proteins.

However, relevant studies concerning this critical problem, particularly in the Tibet area has not been found. Therefore, this study investigated the soil contamination and the spatial distribution of the trace elements in the areas surrounding the Tibetan landfill sites (LS) and geothermal sites (GS) through several pollution evaluation models. In addition, the possible sources of trace elements and their potential impact on public health were also investigated. Results showed that the trace elements in soils nearby LS and GS had moderate to high contamination risk. In soils surrounding LS, mercury had the highest concentration of 0.015 mg/kg and was 6 times higher than the background value of 0.008 mg/kg while in GS, arsenic had the highest concentration of 66.55 mg/kg, and exceeded the soil contamination risk value of 25 mg/kg. Maizhokunggar LS was the most polluted site with an average pollution load index value of 2.95 compared to Naqu, Nyingchi, Shigatse, and Lhasa. 42% of LS were with considerable ecological risk, and all GS had low ecological risk. Both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk for children and adults (male, female) were within the acceptable range. According to the source analysis, unscientific anthropogenic activities including accumulated MSW, industrial discharges, and vehicle emissions significantly contributed 51.83% to soil trace element contamination. Considering that Tibet is an environment-ecologically vulnerable region with very weak self-adjustment ability, accumulated municipal solid waste in the landfill sites should be well disposed of, and even soil remediation should be well implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3acarcinogenicity 3achildren 3aenvironmental assessment 3afemales 3ageothermal energy 3agroundwater 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3alandfills 3amales 3amercury 3amunicipal solid waste 3aparticulate emissions 3apollution load 3apublic health 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3asoil remediation 3aChina 0aTibet 0aSoil contamination 0aTrace element 0aEcological risk 0aLandfill1 aDan, Zeng1 aCui, Xiaoqiang1 aZhang, Ruixue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8933-10491 aZhou, Shengquan1 aWenga, Terrence1 aYan, Beibei1 aChen, Guanyi1 aZhang, Qiangying1 aZhong, Lei0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 May 01, v. 715 p.136639-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1366393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010400172300001800276520142300294592002801717650001701745650003501762650002001797650001301817650001401830650003501844650001401879650001701893650001601910650001501926653002001941653001301961653001701974653001801991653001102009653002102020700002002041773008302061856008402144852000902228655001202237IND60546720320221119124926.0160903e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054672032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Feo, Giovanni,10aUsing MCDA and GIS for hazardous waste landfill siting considering land scarcity for waste disposal  ap. 2225-2238.  aThe main aim of this study was to develop a procedure that minimizes the wasting of space for the siting of hazardous waste landfills as part of a solid waste management system. We wanted to tackle the shortage of land for waste disposal that is a serious and growing problem in most large urban regions. The procedure combines a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach with a geographical information system (GIS). The GIS was utilised to obtain an initial screening in order to eliminate unsuitable areas, whereas the MCDA was developed to select the most suitable sites. The novelty of the proposed siting procedure is the introduction of a new screening phase before the macro-siting step aimed at producing a “land use map of potentially suitable areas” for the siting of solid waste facilities which simultaneously takes into consideration all plant types. The issue of obtaining sites evaluations of a specific facility was coupled with the issue of not wasting land appropriate to facilitate other types of waste management options. In the developed case study, the use of an innovative criteria weighting tool (the “Priority Scale”) in combination with the Analytic Hierarchy Process was useful to easier define the priorities of the evaluation criteria in comparison with other classic methods such as the Paired Comparison Technique in combination with the Simple Additive Weighting method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ageographic information systems 3ahazardous waste 3aland use 3alandfills 3amulti-criteria decision making 3ascreening 3asolid wastes 3aurban areas 3awastelands 0aHazardous waste 0aLandfill 0aLand use map 0aLand shortage 0aSiting 0aWaste management1 aGisi, Sabino De0 tWaste management.g2014 Nov., v. 34 p.2225-2238dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007600170300001800246520109200264592002801356650002401384650001301408650002101421650001201442650001501454650001501469650001601484650001101500650001501511650002401526650001201550650001501562650001401577650001901591650001001610650001901620650002001639650001401659650002501673650001601698650002501714653001001739653003101749653001101780653002501791653001501816653001501831700001801846700001701864773008301881856008401964852000902048655001202057IND60546720420221119124637.0160903e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054672042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassos, Fabiana10aAnaerobic digestion of microalgal biomass after ultrasound pretreatment  ap. 2098-2103.  aHigh rate algal ponds are an economic and sustainable alternative for wastewater treatment, where microalgae and bacteria grow in symbiosis removing organic matter and nutrients. Microalgal biomass produced in these systems can be valorised through anaerobic digestion. However, microalgae anaerobic biodegradability is limited by the complex cell wall structure and therefore a pretreatment step may be required to improve the methane yield. In this study, ultrasound pretreatment at a range of applied specific energy (16–67MJ/kgTS) was investigated prior to microalgae anaerobic digestion. Experiments showed how organic matter solubilisation (16–100%), hydrolysis rate (25–56%) and methane yield (6–33%) were improved as the pretreatment intensity increased. Mathematical modelling revealed that ultrasonication had a higher effect on the methane yield than on the hydrolysis rate. A preliminary energy assessment indicated that the methane yield increase was not high enough as to compensate the electricity requirement of ultrasonication without biomass dewatering (8% VS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3acell walls 3adewatering 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3ahydrolysis 3amathematical models 3amethane 3amicroalgae 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aponds 3asolubilization 3aspecific energy 3asymbiosis 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awastewater treatment 0aAlgae 0aAnaerobic biodegradability 0aBiogas 0aHigh rate algal pond 0aMicroalgae 0aWastewater1 aAstals, Sergi1 aFerrer, Ivet0 tWaste management.g2014 Nov., v. 34 p.2098-2103dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011300167300001800280506011700298506007600415520062100491592002801112506003701140650001201177650001701189650001701206650001501223653002001238653001801258653001101276653001101287653002201298653001401320653002301334700001701357700001601374773009501390856008501485852000901570655001201579IND60753826920221207103106.0220425s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075382692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValiakos, E.10aInorganic substances and their uses in Nikolaos Myrepsos’ Dynameron.

Habitat requirements and development optima are different for species belonging to the commonly recorded genus Cladophora. The majority Cladophora species are distributed throughout the world, in both the moderate and tropical zones. Of the species noted from Europe, only 15 are characterized for freshwaters, both flowing and standing. In small water bodies, these green algae are very common and occur almost everywhere: in lakes, dam reservoirs, large rivers occur mainly in the coastal littoral zone. A commonly occurring species of macroscopic green algae is Cladophora glomerata. Habitat parameters have shown that the distribution pattern of filamentous green algae taxa is determined by two different gradients: (i) depth—temperature, light availability, oxygen concentration; and (ii) trophy—nitrate and orthophosphate concentration. A fast growth rate of Cladophora is very effective under good light condition and high concentration of nutrients. Species of the genera Cladophora have been determined to be early spring or summer organisms. The biomass of Cladophora can be successfully applied as a raw material for production of value-added products. In this review, Cladophora species are discussed in terms of their chemical composition, as well as potential applications in many areas, for example human and animal health, agriculture (organic fertilizers, biostimulants of plant growth, feed additives), environmental protection (bioindicator of pollution/contamination, sorbent of pollutants from wastewater), renewable source of energy (biogas, bioethanol), and high-tech composite materials.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015/18/E/NZ9/00607cNarodowe Centrum Nauki  a2014/13/B/NZ8/04690cNarodowe Centrum Nauki  a2019/33/B/NZ9/01844cNarodowe Centrum Nauki  a2018/31/B/NZ8/00280cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3aCladophora glomerata 3aalgology 3aanimal and human health 3abioethanol 3abiogas 3abiomass 3achemical composition 3acommunity structure 3aenergy 3aenvironmental protection 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3aorthophosphates 3aoxygen 3aplant growth 3apollution 3araw materials 3asorbents 3aspring 3asummer 3ataxonomy 3avalue added 3awastewater 3aEurope1 aMessyasz, Beata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4371-35910 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 Feb., v. 33, no. 1 p.133-166dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-020-02211-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012900170520130500299592002801604650001101632650002501643650001401668650001401682650001101696650002301707650001401730651001001744651001901754651002001773651001501793653002201808653002801830653002601858653003201884700001501916700001901931700001801950700001501968700001701983773011902000856008802119852000902207655001202216IND60681457820221117222550.0211227e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068145782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1366412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Daomin10aAnalysis on the relationship between fisheries economic growth and marine environmental pollution in China's coastal regions  aThe rapid development of China's fisheries economy is accompanied by intensified marine environmental pollution over the period covered by this study. Based on data from multiple sources, this paper attempts to measure the relationship between fisheries economic growth and marine environmental pollution among China's coastal regions over the past 17 years. For this purpose, it firstly quantifies changes in fisheries economy and fisheries population. It then goes onto comparing the degree of changes in fisheries economy and marine environment. Finally, it depicts the relationship between fisheries added value (FAV) and polluted marine area (PMA) and between per capita net income of fishermen (PCNIF) and PMA ratio. Results suggest thati)the compound annual growth rate of FAV, FAV per capita, and fisheries population are 8.35%, 8.61%, and −0.24%, respectively;ii)the difference of FAV per capita increases significantly over time, while that of PMA and PMA ratio decreases moderately;iii)the relationship between FAV and PMA and between PCNIF and PMA ratio in all China's Seas and in the East China Sea show the same inverted N-shape while in the South China Sea inverted U-shape. In the Bohai and Yellow Sea, the former's relationship exhibits inverted U-shape, with the latter's N-shape.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aeconomic development 3afisheries 3afishermen 3aincome 3amarine environment 3apollution 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 3aSouth China Sea 3aYellow Sea 0aFisheries economy 0aEnvironmental pollution 0aVariation coefficient 0aEnvironmental Kuznets curve1 aYang, Qian1 aYang, Hyun-Joo1 aLiu, Honghong1 aZhu, Yugui1 aMu, Yongtong0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 713 p.136641-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1366413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01643naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008300167300001600250500001900266520046800285592002800753650001700781650001800798650002200816650001600838650001900854650002200873650001400895650001600909653001500925653002600940653002100966700002300987700001801010773013601028856008401164852000901248655001201257IND60692693320221122002232.0200503e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069269332DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2014.8778322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Tiezheng10aEffects of various emulsification methods on the oxidation of methyl linoleate  ap. 147-150.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of mechanical stress during emulsification on the oxidation of methyl linoleate were investigated by four methods (high-pressure homogenization, high-speed stirring, ultrasonic homogenization, and membrane emulsification).

Although much research has investigated whether neighbourhood attachment is influenced by the urban design characteristics of high density contexts, there is little evidence of the impact of such characteristics in suburban environments with lower population densities, such as the types of low-density suburbs that ring Australian cities. Surveys were conducted in Victoria, Australia, to examine how these five groups of characteristics might impact residents’ neighbourhood attachment in three suburbs with equivalent socioeconomic profiles. Questionnaires were delivered to eight streets of different layout in each suburb, and via on-street face-to-face surveys in public spaces adjacent to neighbourhood libraries. The results of five separate regression models indicated that all five groups of physical neighbourhood characteristics significantly predicted neighbourhood attachment. Home ownership, length of residence and age were also found to have strong correlation with neighbourhood attachment. When length of residency is controlled for, it was found that five physical variables were the best predictors of neighbourhood attachment: provision of open spaces, street type, trees coverage, sidewalk provision and number of community spaces. Only the provision of open spaces had greater impact on attachment than length of residency. Hence, the study findings suggest that both social and physical factors should be considered in the planning of suburban neighbourhoods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3afences 3ahome ownership 3aopen space 3aplanning 3apopulation density 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asuburban areas 3asurveys 3atrees 3aAustralia 0aNeighbourhood attachment 0aNeighbourhood design 0aSocioeconomic factors 0aUrban design characteristics 0aAustralia 0aLow density1 aTucker, Richard0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2018 Feb., v. 170 p.231-240dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245004500177300001400222520142900236592002801665650002701693650001201720650001501732650001201747650003301759650001101792650002201803650001001825650001201835650002201847650001501869650002201884650001901906650001101925650001301936650001401949650001501963650001001978651001201988653001202000653001902012653002702031653001202058653002102070653002402091700002202115700002002137700002302157700002002180773011002200856008702310852000902397655001202406IND60559674720221119225214.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055967472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStromberg, Juliet C.10aRiparian vegetation of ephemeral streams  ap. 27-37.  aEphemeral streams are abundant in drylands, yet we know little about how their vegetation differs from surrounding terrestrial zones and about their projected response to regional warming and drying. We assessed plant communities at seven ephemeral streams (and terrestrial zones) distributed among three climatic settings in Arizona. Compared to terrestrial zones, riparian zones had similar herbaceous cover but greater woody vegetation volume. They supported more plant species, with several woody taxa restricted to the ephemeral zone (consistent with the idea that herbaceous plants are rain-dependent while riparian trees rely on runoff stored in stream sediments). Their herbaceous communities had high compositional overlap with terrestrial zones and may sustain regional diversity as droughts intensify. Presumably owing to periodic flood disturbance, riparian plant communities had greater evenness than terrestrial zones, many of which were dominated by Eragrostis lehmanniana. Patterns along the climatic gradient suggest that increasing aridity will reduce the number of herbaceous (and total) plant species within riparian zones (110 species per stream in semihumid settings, 88 in semiarid, 48 in arid) and drive compositional shifts from perennials grasses and forbs to annuals. Hotter and drier conditions will drive sharp declines in herbaceous cover, converting riparian savanna to xeroriparian scrubland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEragrostis lehmanniana 3aannuals 3aarid lands 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3adrying 3aephemeral streams 3aforbs 3agrasses 3aherbaceous plants 3aperennials 3aplant communities 3ariparian areas 3arunoff 3asavannas 3asediments 3ashrublands 3atrees 3aArizona 0aAridity 0aClimate change 0aEragrostis lehmanniana 0aSavanna 0aSpecies richness 0aRiparian vegetation1 aSetaro, Danika L.1 aGallo, Erika L.1 aLohse, Kathleen A.1 aMeixner, Thomas0 tJournal of arid environments.g2017 Mar., v. 138 p.27-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245015300172300001200325520108600337592002801423650002001451650002201471650001701493650002501510650002301535650001201558650001001570650002301580651001101603700002101614773008701635856008701722852000901809655001201818IND60086147720221117105820.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008614772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStithou, Mavra10aCollective versus voluntary payment in contingent valuation for the conservation of marine biodiversity: An exploratory study from Zakynthos, Greece  ap. 1-9.  aThis paper explores the determinants of foreign visitors’ participation in a conservation scheme for marine biodiversity. It also sheds light on respondents’ behaviour when confronted with collective and voluntary payment modes in the context of Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). The elicited conservation values concern two endangered species; the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta and the monk seal Monachus monachus. The findings of this pilot study indicate that the main reasons for respondents’ participation are prior knowledge of species and attitude to management options. More importantly, they show evidence of sensitivity to the method of payment. Despite respondents state a lower Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) when a collective mechanism is used in place of a voluntary one, they are more likely to participate in the scheme with a higher certainty. Finally, the elicited WTP values of the two marine endangered species confirm that there is potential for internal funding which could sustain the operation of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos (NMPZ) in Greece.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3aMonachus monachus 3abiodiversity 3acontingent valuation 3aendangered species 3afunding 3aseals 3awillingness to pay 3aGreece1 aScarpa, Riccardo0 tOcean & coastal management.g2012 Feb., v. 56 p.1-9dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008500164300001400249520172500263592002801988650001702016650002602033650003602059650002102095650002302116650001602139650001102155650001502166650001102181650001202192650002202204650001802226650001602244650001502260651001302275653002002288653001502308653003602323653001702359653003602376653002602412700002202438700002402460700002802484773011502512856008202627852000902709655001202718IND60544506020221122133819.0190417e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054450602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wrr.2014.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebel, Louis10aBenefit sharing from hydropower watersheds: Rationales, practices, and potential  ap. 12-28.  aHydropower dams typically produce benefits for their developers. At the same time, large dams have various negative environmental and social consequences, in particular, upon those who must be resettled or whose livelihoods are disrupted. The anticipated and actual revenue earned by hydropower plants from the production and sale of electricity could be shared with residents of hydropower watersheds, to help offset these adverse impacts of construction and operation. The purpose of this paper is to examine the different ways in which such benefits have been shared in the Sirikit Dam hydropower watershed in Northern Thailand. Four different models for benefit sharing, each with a history in the case study site, were identified: compensation for resettlement; corporate social responsibility; community development funds; and payments for ecosystem services. The earliest program on resettlement was of limited effectiveness, because short-term compensation was insufficient to improve livelihoods or alleviate poverty. The corporate social responsibility program has been ad hoc, with achievements not always geared toward priority needs. The recently launched Power Development Fund is a promising framework, as it involves long-term sharing of revenues from the sale of electricity for projects proposed by local communities and agencies. A pilot exploration of watershed fund, based on payments for ecosystem services concepts, looked likely to falter from lack of interests among potential buyers and other institutional barriers. The case study demonstrates that different benefit sharing models have their merits and limitations which vary as a project matures – a lesson important for the Mekong Region.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acommunity development 3acorporate social responsibility 3adams (hydrology) 3aecosystem services 3aelectricity 3aincome 3alivelihood 3amodels 3apoverty 3arural development 3asocial impact 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aThailand 0aBenefit sharing 0aHydropower 0aCorporate social responsibility 0aCompensation 0aPayments for ecosystem services 0aCommunity development1 aLebel, Phimphakan1 aChitmanat, Chanagun1 aSriyasak, Patcharawalai0 tWater resources and rural development.g2014 Oct., v. 4 p.12-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23296x2212-60827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wrr.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010100171300001800272520109800290592002801388650004401416650002401460650001601484650002501500650001701525650002001542650003301562650001201595650001501607700002701622700002801649700002501677700002601702700002601728773011601754856008201870852000901952655001201961IND60595032620221116192232.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059503262DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-018-1202-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Manuella10aExploratory Analysis Applied for the Evaluation of Yerba Mate Adulteration (Ilex paraguariensis)  ap. 2035-2041.  aAttenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was used to evaluate the potential to detect different sucrose concentrations added as adulterants in yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis). For this purpose, the data acquired from 15 yerba mate samples were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Sucrose solutions from 5 to 30% of the total yerba quantity were added to each sample and analyzed in conjunction with the raw yerba mate sample. The fingerprint region (1300–800 cm⁻¹) was extracted from the resulted spectra, smoothed by the Savitzky Golay method, normalized, average spectra of the triplicates and first derivative. Discrimination between the different sucrose concentrations in the samples was achieved by the exploratory analysis, demonstrating a sucrose concentration gradient in the PC1 × PC2 score plot. In this way, the results suggest a potential industrial use of ATR-FTIR alongside with chemometrics to avoid a frequent sugar adulteration in a simple, fast, and reliable methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aIlex paraguariensis 3aadulterants 3aadulterated products 3achemometrics 3adata collection 3aprincipal component analysis 3asucrose 3ayerba mate1 aSchneider, RosanaC.

One service that is an increasingly important feature of climate change mitigation policies, and with other potential benefits, is biological carbon storage. 2. We examine the quantities and spatial patterns of above‐ground carbon stored in a typical British city, Leicester, by surveying vegetation across the entire urban area. We also consider how carbon density differs in domestic gardens, indicative of bottom‐up management of private green spaces by householders, and public land, representing top‐down landscape policies by local authorities. Finally, we compare a national ecosystem service map with the estimated quantity and distribution of above‐ground carbon within our study city. 3. An estimated 231 521 tonnes of carbon is stored within the above‐ground vegetation of Leicester, equating to 3·16 kg C m−2 of urban area, with 97·3% of this carbon pool being associated with trees rather than herbaceous and woody vegetation. 4. Domestic gardens store just 0·76 kg C m−2, which is not significantly different from herbaceous vegetation landcover (0·14 kg C m−2). The greatest above‐ground carbon density is 28·86 kg C m−2, which is associated with areas of tree cover on publicly owned/managed sites. 5. Current national estimates of this ecosystem service undervalue Leicester’s contribution by an order of magnitude. 6. Synthesis and applications. The UK government has recently set a target of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, from 1990 levels, by 2050. Local authorities are central to national efforts to cut carbon emissions, although the reductions required at city‐wide scales are yet to be set. This has led to a need for reliable data to help establish and underpin realistic carbon emission targets and reduction trajectories, along with acceptable and robust policies for meeting these goals. Here, we illustrate the potential benefits of accounting for, mapping and appropriately managing above‐ground vegetation carbon stores, even within a typical densely urbanized European city.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahome gardens 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3apublic lands 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3aUnited Kingdom1 aEdmondson, Jill L.1 aHeinemeyer, Andreas1 aLeake, Jonathan R.1 aGaston, Kevin J.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2011 Oct., v. 48, no. 5 p.1125-1134dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02021.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245006100187300001800248520105700266592002801323650001901351650001301370650001301383650002101396650001401417650001301431650001101444650002401455650004701479650001601526650002301542650001601565650002601581650001801607650002601625650003501651650002501686650002401711650002701735650003501762700001801797700001601815700001601831700002001847773009801867856008601965852000902051655001202060IND4457703220221123015509.0141110e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445770322DNAL7 a215076262pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.03.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yongguang10aNitrogen removal performance of a hybrid anammox reactor  ap. 6650-6656.  aThe anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process has attracted considerable attention in recent years as an alternative to conventional nitrogen removal technologies. In this study, an innovative hybrid reactor combining fluidized and fixed beds for anammox treatment was developed. The fluidized bed was mechanically stirred and the gaseous product could be rapidly released from the anammox sludge to prevent washout of the sludge caused by floatation. The fixed bed comprising a non-woven biomass carrier could efficiently catch sludge to reduce washout. During the operation, nitrogen loading rates to the reactor were increased to 27.3kgN/m³/d, with total nitrogen removal efficiencies of 75%. The biomass concentration in the fluidized bed reached 26-g VSS/L. Anammox granules were observed in the reactors, with settling velocities and sludge volumetric index of 27.3±6.5m/h and 23mL/g, respectively. Quantification of extracellular polymeric substances revealed the anammox granules contained a significant amount of extracellular proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluidized beds 3agranules 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxidation 3aproteins 3asludge 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBioreactors 2aCloning, Molecular 2aColorimetry 2aComputational Biology 2aDNAxanalysis 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16S 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods1 aHira, Daisuke1 aLi, Zhigang1 aChen, Cheng1 aFurukawa, Kenji0 tBioresource technology.g2011 June, v. 102, no. 12 p.6650-6656dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.03.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245004800168300001600216520070600232592002800938650001600966650001700982650002000999650001001019650001001029650003301039650001401072650003001086650001801116650001901134653002201153653002101175653001801196653002001214700001601234700001801250700002101268700002201289700002001311773013901331856008201470852000901552655001201561IND60543680120221121143202.0190411e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054368012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.myc.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItagaki, Tadashi10aRNase T2 of Mortierella (phylum Zygomycota)  ap. 523-529.  aThe gene encoding the RNase T2 family enzyme, RNMel36, was cloned from Mortierella elongata (Zygomycota, Mortierellales) by polymerase chain reaction.

Herein, plasmonic Ag doped urea-derived graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) composites were fabricated via in-situ photo-deposition at room temperature as the visible-light photocatalyst. Scan electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed the uniform dispersion of Ag nanoparticles on the surface of g-C₃N₄ sheet, which facilitated the synergistic effect of antibacterial performance from Ag and photocatalytic property from Ag/g-C₃N₄ composites. Photocatalytic water disinfection against Escherichia coli with visible light was performed to demonstrate the improved photocatalytic property with assistance of Ag. The 3-Ag/g-C₃N₄ exhibited the best bactericidal performance by inactivating all bacteria within 120 min with damaged cell membranes of Escherichia coli observed by scan electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images. Photoluminescence spectra, steady-state surface photovoltage spectra, photocurrent response, and electrochemical impedance spectra results revealed that Ag nanoparticles inhibited the recombination of photo-generated e⁻ and h⁺ pairs and further reinforced the photocatalytic performance of g-C₃N₄. Scavenger experiments indicated that h⁺ produced on valence band of g-C₃N₄ dominated the photocatalytic disinfection process against Escherichia coli. This work further proved Ag/g-C₃N₄ showed great potential in photocatalytic water disinfection under visible-light irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3acarbon nitride 3acell membranes 3adisinfection 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3airradiation 3ananosilver 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoluminescence 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater purification 0aAg/g-C3N4 0aVisible light irradiation 0aSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) 0aDisinfection performance1 aLi, Jiadong1 aDong, Changchang1 aBi, Yajun1 aHan, Xiaojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8571-61870 tChemosphere.g2020 Mar., v. 242 p.125201-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002200172245009700194300001600291520099300307592002801300650002001328650001301348650002301361650002001384650002801404650002101432650001101453650001801464650001201482650001001494650001201504650001701516650003801533650005701571650002301628700001701651700003001668773012001698856008901818852000901907655001201916IND4468671720221123015504.0141111e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446867172DNAL7 a221192662pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimopoulou, Maria10aExploration of phenomena contributing to the diversity of Oenococcus oeni exopolysaccharides  ap. 114-122.  aMany food-grade bacteria produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) that may modify the food texture or affect their survival rate during food processing. This is the case of O. oeni, a bacterial species who drives malolactic fermentation in wine. The five strains analyzed in the present study all display both isolated genes dedicated to homopolysaccharide synthesis and gene clusters potentially associated with heteropolysaccharide synthesis. The number of isolated glycosyltransferase gene present and the gene composition of one of the operons change from one strain to the other. The soluble EPS yields and the EPS monomer composition vary depending on the strain and or the medium composition. O. oeni appears as a bacterium able to synthesize both homo and heteropolysaccharides. This unique property has rarely been described. Moreover, the abundance of the genetic determinants associated with EPS metabolism suggests that it is very important for the adaptation of the bacteria to wine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOenococcus oeni 3abacteria 3aexopolysaccharides 3afood processing 3amalolactic fermentation 3amultigene family 3aoperon 3asurvival rate 3atexture 3awines 2aAnimals 2aFermentation 2aOenococcusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aWinexmicrobiology1 aHazo, Lenaig1 aDols-Lafargue, Marguerite0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 153, no. 1-2 p.114-122dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010000170300001600270520109700286536023301383592002801616650001901644650001201663650001401675650001601689650001301705651001801718651001501736653001201751653002601763653001901789653002101808653001301829700001901842773011201861856008501973852000902058655001202067IND60752170320221118043648.0211001e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075217032DNAL7 a10.1080/13235818.2021.19417262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirenko, Boris10aCaribbochiton guadeloupensis n. gen et n. sp.

Caribbochiton guadeloupensis n. gen. et n. sp. is unlike other genera in the family Callistoplacidae: it has no ribs on end valves or on lateral areas of intermediate valves. According to other morphological features (thick shell, relatively narrow valves, noticeably raised lateral areas, similar slit formula, insertion plate teeth thickened at edges of slits, dorsal scales), this genus is closest to the family Callistoplacidae. Given that a number of species of the family do not have at a young age the ribs which appear later, we hypothesise that the new genus could have evolved as a result of paedomorphosis. An emended diagnosis of the family Callistoplacidae is hereby proposed.

A total of 2678 students completed the survey. Gender, age, previous food safety training, college major, and ethnicity have a significant impact on students’ food safety knowledge. White (non-Hispanic) students had a higher knowledge score (7.68) than Asian (6.19) or Hispanic (6.57) students. Similarly, students in biology-focused majors had higher scores (7.78) than those not in biology-focused majors (7.11). Most students (65%) did not know that meat and poultry should not be washed under running water. Many students failed to practice food safety recommendations, such as using food thermometers, even if they knew it was the correct thing to do. Most students (57%) believed they did a better job of keeping the kitchen clean than their roommates (23%). As the number of roommates in the house increased, participants were 1.60 times more likely to believe that their kitchen would be in better condition if they did not have any roommates. Future food safety education programs should be developed to fill the knowledge gaps and address challenges facing young adults especially when living with roommates. Educators can create food safety materials for those who are entering university which will prepare them for ahead of time. Materials can also target current university students, those who are not in biology-focused majors, and those from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3afood safety education 3afoodborne illness 3agender 3aknowledge 3ameat 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apoultry 3arisk 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3awater 3ayoung adults 3aIndiana 0aUniversity students 0aFood safety 0aKnowledge 0aPractices 0aRoommate1 aThomas, Merlyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3182-48921 aFeng, Yaohua0 tFood control.g2021 Aug., v. 126 p.108055-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1080553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245013300178300001600311520178000327592002802107650002202135650001302157650001202170650001502182650001302197650001602210650000902226650003802235650001302273650001002286650003202296650001502328650001402343650004302357651001202400651001102412653002202423653001302445653002602458653001102484653001802495653002402513700002002537700001902557700001802576700002602594700002302620700002402643700002202667700002302689700001702712700001802729773011902747856008502866852000902951655001202960IND60535243220221116213620.0190403e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053524322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBielawska-Drózd, Agata10aPrevalence of Coxiella burnetii in environmental samples collected from cattle farms in Eastern and Central Poland (2011–2012)  ap. 600-606.  aCoxiella burnetii is the etiologic agent of Q fever. It may occur as two different morphological forms, a large cell variant (LCV) and a small cell variant (SCV). The SCV is characterized by unique resistance to physical and chemical factors and may survive in the environment for many months.The objective of this study was to examine environmental samples for the presence of C. burnetii using real-time PCR in areas where Q fever was previously reported and in randomly selected animal farms where Q fever was not reported. The samples were collected in the following provinces in Poland: Lublin, Subcarpathian and Masovian. Monitoring was performed with real-time PCR and serological methods. Of the 727 environmental samples, 33 (4.54%) contained the multi-copy insertion sequence IS1111, which is specific for C. burnetii. Subsequently, the presence of C. burnetii antibodies was determined using serological tests in selected herds in which positive genetic results were obtained. Serological analyses of 169 serum samples using CFT and ELISA were performed on Polish black-and-white Holstein-Friesian cows and one cow imported from Denmark. Using the CFT method, 11 samples were positive for phase I antibodies and six were positive for phase II antibodies. Moreover, in two cases, the presence of antibodies specific for both phase I and phase II antigens of C. burnetii was detected. However, of the 169 examined serum samples, 20 were positive by ELISA test, of which six were also positive by CFT. Additionally, multi spacer typing (MST) of isolated C. burnetii strains was performed. The MST results identified two new genotypes in Poland, ST3 and ST6. The results indicate that continued research regarding spread of this pathogen within a country is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aHolstein 3aQ fever 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3acows 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenotype 3aherds 3alivestock and meat industry 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aDenmark 3aPoland 0aCoxiella burnetii 0aZoonosis 0aEnvironmental samples 0aIS1111 0aReal-time PCR 0aMulti spacer typing1 aCieślik, Piotr1 aMirski, Tomasz1 aGaweł, Jerzy1 aMichalski, Aleksander1 aNiemcewicz, Marcin1 aBartoszcze, Michał1 aŻakowska, Dorota1 aLasocki, Krzysztof1 aKnap, Józef1 aKocik, Janusz0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Dec. 05, v. 174, no. 3-4 p.600-606dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.09.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245006900162300001600231520169400247592002801941650001201969650001001981650001801991650001802009650002602027650001302053650001702066650001702083650002002100650001102120650002002131650002002151650001502171651001502186700002102201700002302222700002002245773009602265856007102361852000902432655001202441IND60518840120221120063357.0160419e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051884012DNAL7 a10.2307/19402572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenslow, Julie Sloan10aGrowth Responses of Tropical Shrubs to Treefall Gap Environments  ap. 165-179.  aTo investigate the effects of differences in light and nutrient availability on growth, we planted seven species of shrubs in two genera, Miconia (Melastomataceae) and Piper (Piperaceae), into the centers, edges, and adjacent forest understory of four natural treefall gaps (275—3355 m²) in the tropical premontane rain forest of Costa Rica. We used rooted cutting of species typical of forest understory environments on the one hand and large clearings or disturbed areas on the other. We also compared growth rates of three Miconia species grown in shade houses under 2, 20, and 40% full sunlight. Both light and nutrient availability in newly formed gaps of these sizes were strongly buffered by the canopy and root systems of the surrounding forest. Total incident radiation was higher in gap centers (9—23% full sunlight) than in gap—forest edges (3—11%) or under intact forest canopy (.04—2%), but varied among similar microhabitats from different sites. Relative stem growth rates (RGRₛ) of all field—grown plants were significantly greater in gap centers than at edges or beneath forest understories. Fertilization did not significantly affect growth rate in any light environment. Light appears to be the most critical resource limiting growth at these gap sizes. In general, shade—tolerant species were less plastic than light—demanding species, but at these gap sizes grew as fast or faster in the gap centers. In shade—houses, the shade—tolerant species grew faster at 20% full sunlight and light—demanding species grew faster at 40% full sunlight. We found no evident of a trade—off between growth and foliar phenolic concentration in these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiconia 3aPiper 3aforest canopy 3amicrohabitats 3anutrient availability 3aplanting 3arain forests 3aroot systems 3ashade tolerance 3ashrubs 3asolar radiation 3astem elongation 3aunderstory 3aCosta Rica1 aSchultz, Jack C.1 aVitousek, Peter M.1 aStrain, Boyd R.0 tEcology.g1990 Feb., v. 71, no. 1 p.165-179dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19402573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245013200175300001800307520111300325592002801438650001901466650001201485650001701497650002101514650002001535650001801555650001201573650001801585650001601603650001101619650001601630650002301646650004401669650001801713650001301731650002201744650001101766650001701777700003401794700002901828700002501857700002101882700002701903700002501930773011601955856008202071961001202153852000902165655001202174IND60595033120221116191843.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059503312DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-017-1104-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatumura, PedroHenrique10aChemometric Analysis of 1H NMR Fingerprints of Coffea arabica Green Bean Extracts Cultivated under Different Planting Densities  ap. 1906-1914.  aHigh planting density has been used to increase coffee production but there are few studies related to the variations it provokes in metabolite compositions. The use of ¹H NMR data associated with chemometric techniques allows the determination of metabolic fingerprints and verification of metabolic changes when coffee is subjected to high planting densities. The aim of this work is to investigate ¹H NMR spectral data of green bean extracts of Coffea arabica cv. IAPAR 59 grown in a square pattern at two planting densities, 6000 and 10,000 plants ha⁻¹. Thirty extracts were obtained using a simplex centroid design with four solvents (ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane, and hexane). The lyophilized extracts were dissolved in DMSO-d₆ to obtain the ¹H NMR spectra. The spectral data were analyzed with principal component (PCA) and cluster analyses (CA). Significant differences between ethanolic and non-ethanolic extracts were found by PCA. Only the ethanolic mean spectrum showed characteristic chemical shifts of sugars and trigonelline. Acetone extracts were separated by cluster analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aacetone 3achemometrics 3acluster analysis 3acrop production 3adata analysis 3aethanol 3afreeze drying 3agreen beans 3ahexane 3ametabolites 3amethylene chloride 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant density 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis 3asugars 3atrigonelline1 ade Oliveira, GuilhermeSantana1 aMarcheafave, GustavoGalo1 aRakocevic, Miroslava1 aBruns, RoyEdward1 aScarminio, IedaSpacino1 aTerrile, AmeliaElena0 tFood analytical methods.g2018 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.1906-1914dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-017-1104-y3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle04755naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002300174245013800197300001400335520219800349592002802547650002602575650002102601650001802622650001302640650001602653650001502669650001802684650001502702650002602717650001202743650002002755650001802775650001602793650001702809650002802826650001502854650000802869650001102877650001802888650001302906650002502919650003002944650001802974650001302992650001803005650001503023650001303038650002203051650001703073650001703090650001203107650001503119650001503134650001203149650004003161650001603201650003103217650008403248650003103332650002303363650003203386650004103418650003403459650003103493650001703524653001603541653002603557653002503583653002603608700002103634700002303655773013603678856009003814852000903904655001203913IND50066055420221118100204.0190318e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006605542DNAL7 a235581912pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusarrat Jahān̲,10aAntimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a PCR-based rapid screening method  ap. 89-95.  aEnterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. Their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. Conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. This work reports the development of a PCR-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16S rRNA sequence. Published 16S rRNA sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (EntF and EntR). The primers were able to amplify a 678bp target region from Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11 different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Listeria) or species of Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The PCR positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by API 20 Strep panels and sequencing. When dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 Enterococcus strains (15 E. faecalis, 13 E. faecium, and one E. gallinarum) were identified. When susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). None was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. Most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. The molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant Enterococcus species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aListeria 3aPediococcus 3aSalmonella 3aStreptococcus 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abatters 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3aclindamycin 3aerythromycin 3agastrointestinal system 3agentamicin 3aham 3ahumans 3amanufacturing 3aneomycin 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3araw meat 3aribosomal RNA 3asanitation 3asausages 3aspecies diversity 3astreptomycin 3atetracycline 3atylosin 3avancomycin 3avegetation 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aDNA Primers 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aEnterococcusxclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFood Microbiologyxmethods 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxstandards 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTetracycline 0aEnterococci 0aFermented cured meats 0aPCR detection method 0aMulti-drug resistance1 aKrause, Denis O.1 aHolley, Richard A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 May 15, v. 163, no. 2-3 p.89-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245009200174520105300266592002801319650001801347650002001365650001701385650001501402650001901417650001701436650000901453650002601462650001701488650000901505650001501514653001001529653001501539653001801554653000801572653001901580700001901599773009101618856009001709852000901799655001201808IND60674830420221117102301.0200103e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067483042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadei, Mostafa10aCardiovascular effects of airborne particulate matter: A review of rodent model studies  aIn recent year, animal models have been growingly used to increase our knowledge about the toxicity of PM and underlying mechanisms leading to cardiovascular diseases. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge and findings of studies investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in rats and mice. The six main areas covered in this review include: I) nature of particulate matter and toxicity mechanisms, II) systemic inflammation, III) heart rate and heart rate variability, IV) histopathological effects, V) atherosclerosis, VI) thrombosis, and VI) myocardial infarction. This review showed that animal model studies have been successful to bring new insights into the mechanisms underlying PM-induced cardiovascular diseases. However, there are some areas that the exact mechanisms are still unclear. In conclusion, investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in vivo or interpreting the results should attempt to justify the role of different PM compositions, which may vastly affect the overall cytotoxicity of particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aatherosclerosis 3acytotoxicity 3aheart rate 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3aparticulates 3arats 3athrombosis 0aPM2.5 0aToxicology 0aAir pollution 0aRat 0aHeart diseases1 aNaddafi, Kazem0 tChemosphere.g2020 Mar., v. 242 p.125204-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013200211300001600343520170500359592002802064650002002092650002802112650002102140650001702161650001802178650001302196650000902209650002002218650001702238650003802255650001002293650002802303650003002331650004302361650001402404653000802418653000802426653000802434653001302442653000702455653000902462653000902471653000902480653002802489653001402517653000802531653001602539653001502555653001302570700001902583700002302602700002302625700002402648773011902672856008502791852000902876655001202885IND60535243420221116213924.0190403e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053524342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinamoto, Yasushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2711-920710aPrevalence of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and dysbiosis in fecal samples of dogs with diarrhea  ap. 463-473.  aClostridium perfringens has been suspected as an enteropathogen in dogs. However, its exact role in gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in dogs remains unknown. Recent studies suggest the importance of an altered intestinal microbiota in the activation of virulence factors of enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between diarrhea, dysbiosis, and the presence of C. perfringens and its enterotoxin (CPE). Fecal samples were collected prospectively from 95 healthy control dogs and 104 dogs with GI disease and assessed for bacterial abundances and the presence of CPE using quantitative PCR and ELISA, respectively. C. perfringens was detected in all dogs. Potentially enterotoxigenic C. perfringens were detected in 33.7% (32/95) of healthy control dogs and 48.1% (50/104) diseased dogs, respectively. CPE was detected by ELISA in 1.0% (1/95) of control dogs and 16.3% (17/104) of diseased dogs. Abundances of Fusobacteria, Ruminococcaceae, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium were significantly decreased in diseased dogs, while abundances of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Escherichia coli were significantly increased compared to control dogs. The microbial dysbiosis was independent of the presence of the enterotoxigenic C. perfringens or CPE. In conclusion, the presence of CPE as well as fecal dysbiosis was associated with GI disease. However, the presence of C. perfringens was not indicative of GI disease in all cases of diarrhea, and the observed increased abundance of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens may be part of intestinal dysbiosis occurring in GI disease. The significance of an intestinal dysbiosis in dogs with GI disease deserves further attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEscherichia coli 3aFusobacteria 3aLactobacillus 3adiarrhea 3adogs 3aenteropathogens 3aenterotoxins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3avirulence 0aRNA 0aAHD 0aCPE 0acpe gene 0aGI 0aqPCR 0aRPLA 0aSCFA 0aClostridium perfringens 0aDysbiosis 0aDog 0aEnterotoxin 0aMicrobiota 0aPathogen1 aDhanani, Naila1 aMarkel, Melissa E.1 aSteiner, Jörg M.,1 aSuchodolski, Jan S.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Dec. 05, v. 174, no. 3-4 p.463-473dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245012700158300002000285520127300305592002801578650001401606650002101620650002201641650001001663650001601673650001301689650001101702650001801713650001901731650000701750650002601757650001901783650002801802653002101830653003101851653001601882653002701898653001501925700001501940700001501955700001101970700001401981773012601995856008002121852000902201655001202210IND60579702620221120105349.0170830e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057970262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b105642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Lei10aFast Preparation of Polydopamine Nanoparticles Catalyzed by Fe2+/H2O2 for Visible Sensitive Smartphone-Enabled Cytosensing  ap. 28339-28345.  aIt is highly desired to develop facile methods for fast preparation of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDANS) for intensive promising applications. Considering the system of Fe²⁺/H₂O₂ can generate reactive oxygen species efficiently, which can accelerate the self-oxidative polymerization of dopamine, a new time-saving method has been proposed to prepare PDANS catalyzed by Fe²⁺/H₂O₂. Thereafter, a novel kind of colorimetric nanoprobe for sensitive detection of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cell) based on the obtained PDANS-loaded pH indicator molecules (thymolphthalein) has been developed successfully. The loading capacity of PDANS toward thymolphthalein molecules can reach as high as 165.40 mg/g, which will be a great help to enhancing the sensitivity. Following the color change principle of pH indicators, once simply triggered by basic water, the developed cytosensor offers a visible sensitive smartphone-enabled cytosensing of human breast cancer cells. It has been proved that the rational designed cytosensor is favorable to sensitive detection of cancer cells. By the virtue of its easy use, the proposed smartphone-enabled strategy can provide a novel testing approach for point-of-care bioassay beyond cytosensing in remote areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3abreast neoplasms 3achemical elements 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adopamine 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3apoint-of-care systems 3apolymerization 3areactive oxygen species 0afast preparation 0apolydopamine nanoparticles 0acytosensing 0acolorimetric nanoprobe 0asmartphone1 aXu, Zijian1 aDu, Wenwen1 aLi, He1 aYin, Miao0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Aug. 30, v. 9, no. 34 p.28339-28345dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b105643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014300169300001600312520148400328592002801812650001301840650001101853650002101864650001701885650001601902650002201918650001601940650001801956650002601974650002302000650001302023650001902036700002002055700001802075773007302093856008402166852000902250655001202259IND60573323920221122085543.0170724e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057332392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.04.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Junghwan10aOpto-mechanical behavior and interfacial characteristics of crosslinked liquid crystalline polymer composites with carbon nanotube fillers  ap. 181-192.  aAzobenzene-containing crosslinked liquid crystalline polymer (CLCP) exhibits macroscopic deformation through irradiation with light, and recently, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were inserted to improve the efficiency of the photo-mechanical energy conversion. We conducted molecular dynamics simulations to study the effects of the arrangement of the single-walled CNT (SWCNT) and photo-isomerization of the photochromic moieties on the opto-mechanical properties of the composite. We characterized the composites in terms of the interfacial shear strength (IFSS), photostrain, and elastic modulus according to the isomerization ratio. The SWCNT-CLCP composite enables 19–29% larger photostrain and 20–41% higher modulus compared to those of neat azo-PRP. As the angle between the CNT axis and the nematic director increases, mechanical reinforcing effect decreases. Nevertheless, the applicable photo-shrinkage increases because more space for polymer diffusion is made by the nematic defects in the interphase. The isomerization of azobenzene weakens the interfacial adhesion due to the decrease in the π-π interaction. However, changes in the elastic stiffness of the composite can be modulated by adjusting the arrangement between the SWCNT and matrix. These results provide insight into the mechanism of changes in the interfacial and opto-mechanical properties of the CNT-PRP composite caused by photo-isomerization and the mechanical design of a photo-responsive actuator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3aenergy conversion 3airradiation 3aisomerization 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3ashear strength1 aChoi, Joonmyung1 aCho, Maenghyo0 tCarbon.g2017 Sept., v. 121 p.181-192dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.04.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245014800191300001600339520148800355592002801843650002701871650001301898650002401911650001801935650001701953650001001970650001201980650002001992650001302012650004402025650004302069650001302112650002802125650002402153650002402177650001002201650003102211650002302242700001902265700002002284700001802304700002202322773011002344856005502454852000902509655001202518IND4466834320221118095751.0120308e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446683432DNAL7 a220707612pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02635.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorňák, Karel10aSuboptimal light conditions negatively affect the heterotrophy of Planktothrix rubescens but are beneficial for accompanying Limnohabitans spp.  ap. 765-778.  aWe examined the effect of light on the heterotrophic activity of the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens and on its relationship with the accompanying bacteria. In situ leucine uptake by bacteria and cyanobacteria was determined in a subalpine mesotrophic lake, and natural assemblages from the zone of maximal P. rubescens abundances were incubated for 2 days at contrasting light regimes (ambient, 100× increased, dark). Planktothrix rubescens from the photic zone of the lake incorporated substantially more leucine, but some heterotrophic activity was maintained in filaments from the hypolimnion. Exposure of cyanobacteria to increased irradiance or darkness resulted in significantly lower leucine incorporation than at ambient light conditions. Highest abundances and leucine uptake of Betaproteobacteria from the genus Limnohabitans were found in the accompanying microflora at suboptimal irradiance levels for P. rubescens or in dark incubations. Therefore, two Limnohabitans strains (representing different species) were co‐cultured with axenic P. rubescens at different light conditions. The abundances and leucine incorporation rates of both strains most strongly increased at elevated irradiance levels, in parallel to a decrease of photosynthetic pigment fluorescence and the fragmentation of cyanobacterial filaments. Our results suggest that Limnohabitans spp. in lakes might profit from the presence of physiologically stressed P. rubescens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlanktothrix rubescens 3abacteria 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3aeuphotic zone 3afluorescence 3alakes 3aleucine 3alight intensity 3apigments 2aComamonadaceaexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCyanobacteriaxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDarkness 2aHeterotrophic Processes 2aLakesxmicrobiology 2aLeucinexmetabolism 2aLight 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aWater Microbiology1 aZeder, Michael1 aBlom, Judith F.1 aPosch, Thomas1 aPernthaler, Jakob0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2012 Mar., v. 14, no. 3 p.765-778dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02635.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012400167300001600291520124500307592002801552650001801580650002201598650001801620650001301638650001901651650000901670650001301679650001601692650001901708650001901727650002601746650001901772650002801791650003501819650002301854653002601877653001201903653001801915653002601933700002101959700002101980700001802001773011902019856008502138852000902223655001202232IND60535243720221116214047.0190403e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053524372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jie-Long12aA monoclonal antibody recognizes a highly conserved neutralizing epitope on hemagglutinin of H6N1 avian influenza virus  ap. 333-341.  aNeutralizing antibodies on the globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA) of avian influenza virus (AIV) are crucial for controlling this disease. However, most neutralizing antibodies lack cross reaction. This report describes the identification of a hemagglutinin epitope on the globular head near the receptor binding site of the H6N1 AIV. A monoclonal antibody named EB2 was prepared against the H6N1 AIV HA. Flow cytometry of AIV-infected chicken embryo fibroblast, DF-1 cells and specific-pathogen-free embryonated eggs were used to verify the neutralizing activity of this mAb. To narrow down the binding region, partially overlapping HA fragments and synthetic peptides were used to map the epitope by immune-blotting. The linear motif RYVRMGTESMN, located on the surface on the globular head of the HA protein, was identified as the epitope bound by EB2 mAb. Alignment of the EB2-defined epitope with other H6 AIVs showed that this epitope was conserved and specific to H6. We propose that this motif is a linear B-cell epitope of the HA protein and is near the receptor binding site. The identified epitope might be useful for clinical applications and as a tool for further study of the structure and function of the AIV HA protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aInfluenza A virus 3abinding sites 3achickens 3across reaction 3aeggs 3aepitopes 3afibroblasts 3aflow cytometry 3ahemagglutinins 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3asynthetic peptides 0aAvian influenza virus 0aH6 AIVs 0aHemagglutinin 0aNeutralizing antibody1 aHsieh, Ming-Shou1 aJuang, Rong-Huay1 aWang, Jinghe,0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Dec. 05, v. 174, no. 3-4 p.333-341dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245011900169520157800288592002801866650001501894650000801909650002001917650001501937650002201952650001201974650002301986650000902009650001802018650002102036650001102057650002002068650001802088700002802106700002202134700002902156700002902185700002302214700001902237700002302256700002002279700002502299700002402324700003002348700001902378773012702397856007902524852000902603655001202612IND60760577220221119135717.0211223e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076057722DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox101220202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValentijn, Floris A.10aCCN2 Aggravates the Immediate Oxidative Stress–DNA Damage Response following Renal Ischemia–Reperfusion Injury  aAKI, due to the fact of altered oxygen supply after kidney transplantation, is characterized by renal ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI). Recent data suggest that AKI to CKD progression may be driven by cellular senescence evolving from prolonged DNA damage response (DDR) following oxidative stress. Cellular communication factor 2 (CCN2, formerly called CTGF) is a major contributor to CKD development and was found to aggravate DNA damage and the subsequent DDR–cellular senescence–fibrosis sequence following renal IRI. We therefore investigated the impact of CCN2 inhibition on oxidative stress and DDR in vivo and in vitro. Four hours after reperfusion, full transcriptome RNA sequencing of mouse IRI kidneys revealed CCN2-dependent enrichment of several signaling pathways, reflecting a different immediate stress response to IRI. Furthermore, decreased staining for γH2AX and p-p53 indicated reduced DNA damage and DDR in tubular epithelial cells of CCN2 knockout (KO) mice. Three days after IRI, DNA damage and DDR were still reduced in CCN2 KO, and this was associated with reduced oxidative stress, marked by lower lipid peroxidation, protein nitrosylation, and kidney expression levels of Nrf2 target genes (i.e., HMOX1 and NQO1). Finally, silencing of CCN2 alleviated DDR and lipid peroxidation induced by anoxia-reoxygenation injury in cultured PTECs. Together, our observations suggest that CCN2 inhibition might mitigate AKI by reducing oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and the subsequent DDR. Thus, targeting CCN2 might help to limit post-IRI AKI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aRNA 3acell senescence 3aepithelium 3akidney transplant 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3anitrosylation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3astress response 3atranscriptome1 aKnoppert, Sebastiaan N.1 aPissas, Georgios 1 aRodrigues-Diez, Raúl R.1 aMarquez-Exposito, Laura 1 aBroekhuizen, Roel 1 aMokry, Michal 1 aKester, Lennart A.1 aFalke, Lucas L.1 aGoldschmeding, Roel 1 aRuiz-Ortega, Marta 1 aEleftheriadis, Theodoros 1 aNguyen, Tri Q.0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox101220203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001800144245015900162300001600321500001500337520088100352536011401233592002801347650003001375650002001405650003001425650001901455650001501474653004001489653003301529653002501562653004901587700002501636700002401661773013201685856008101817852000901898655001201907IND4470179820221122235518.0181016e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447017982DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387114275782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Shan-Chia10aComparison of a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay with a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of Gallid herpesvirus 1  ap. 138-141.  a2019-12-06  aA TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay were developed to detect Gallid herpesvirus 1 (GaHV-1, formerly Infectious laryngotracheitis virus). The standard curve of real-time PCR was established, and the sensitivity reached 10 copies/μl. In the current study, the conversion between viral titer and GaHV-1 genomic copy number was constructed. Six primers for LAMP assay amplified target gene at 65°C within 45 min, and the detection limit was 60 copies/μl. The 6 primers were highly specific, sensitive, and reproducible for detection of GaHV-1. Although the sensitivity of LAMP was lower than that of real-time PCR, LAMP was faster, less expensive, and did not require a thermocycler. The LAMP assay would be a viable alternative assay in diagnostic laboratories that do not employ real-time PCR technology.  aThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 1 3adetection limit 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agene targeting 3aviral load 0areal-time polymerase chain reaction 0ainfectious laryngotracheitis 0aGallid herpesvirus 1 0aloop-mediated isothermal amplification assay1 aGiambrone, Joseph J.1 aMacklin, Kenneth S.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 24, no. 1 p.138-141dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387114275783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013700170300001800307520231800325592002802643650001302671650001202684650002402696650002802720650003102748650002502779650001102804650001002815650001602825653002102841653002302862653003002885653002602915653001702941653002802958700001802986700002103004700002103025773011103046856008603157852000903243655001203252IND60752171220221118043616.0211202e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075217122DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2021.19506022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiklaß, Malte10aConcept of climate-charged airspaces: a potential policy instrument for internalizing aviation's climate impact of non-CO₂ effects  ap. 1066-1085.  aApproximately 50–75% of aviation's climate impact is caused by non-CO₂ effects, like the production of ozone and the formation of contrail cirrus clouds, which can be effectively prevented by re-routing flights around highly climate-sensitive areas. Here, we discuss options how to incentivize re-routing approaches and apply multicriteria trajectory optimizations to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept of climate-charged airspaces (CCAs). We show that although climate-optimized re-routing results in slightly longer flight times, increased fuel consumption and higher operating costs, it is more climate-friendly compared to a cost-optimized routing. In accordance to other studies, we find that the averaged temperature response over 100 years (ATR) of a single flight can be reduced by up to 40%. However, if mitigation efforts are associated with a direct increase in costs, there is a need for climate policies. To address the lack of incentivizing airlines to internalize their climate costs, this study focuses on the CCA concept, which imposes a climate charge on airlines when operating in highly climate-sensitive areas. If CCAs are (partly) bypassed, both climate impact and operating costs of a flight can be reduced: a more climate-friendly routing becomes economically attractive. For an exemplary North-Atlantic network, CCAs create a financial incentive for climate mitigation, achieving on average more than 90% of the climate impact reduction potential of climate-optimized trajectories (theoretical maximum, benchmark). Key policy insights Existing climate policies for aviation do not address non- effects, which are very sensitive to the location and the timing of the emission. By imposing a temporary climate charge for airlines that operate in highly climate-sensitive regions, the trade-off between economic viability and environmental compatibility could be resolved: Climate impact mitigation of non- effects coincides with cutting costs. To ensure easy planning and verification, climate charges are calculated analogously to en-route and terminal charges. For climate mitigation it is therefore neither necessary to monitor emissions (, etc.) nor to integrate complex non- effects into flight planning procedures of airlines. Its implementation is feasible and effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaviation 3aclimate 3aeconomic incentives 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental policy 3aflight 3aozone 3atemperature 0aTransport policy 0aaviation emissions 0aclimate change mitigation 0acost-benefit analysis 0anon- effects 0atrajectory optimization1 aGrewe, Volker1 aGollnick, Volker1 aDahlmann, Katrin0 tClimate policy.g2021 Sept. 14, v. 21, no. 8 p.1066-1085dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19684x1752-74577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2021.19506023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245014500214520163700359592002801996650001402024650001402038650001902052650001302071650002502084650001202109650001802121650001902139650002602158650001602184650000902200650001702209653003402226653001802260653002202278653002502300653002902325700001602354700001602370700001602386700001602402773009102418856009002509852000902599655001202608IND60674831020221117102136.0200103e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067483102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kwangheon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2477-667410aDevelopment of a carbamate-conjugated catechol ligand and its application to Cs extraction from contaminated soil by using supercritical CO2  aExtraction of radioactive Cs from contaminated soil is a crucial aspect of remediation after nuclear accidents. For this purpose, we have developed a new type of ligand, carbamate-conjugated catechol, to assist in metal extraction by using supercritical CO₂ (SCCO₂). The synthesis process for this ligand is relatively simple, and the carbamate-conjugated catechol ligand dissolves well in SCCO₂. The measured ligand distribution coefficient increased according to a power law with an exponent of 1.7 as the ligand concentration increased, indicating that approximately two ligand molecules are needed to extract one Cs ion. The roles of additives (ligand, co-ligand, and water) were limited when they were used separately, but the combination of these additives was important. We tested 27 combinations of these three additives for extracting Cs from artificially contaminated sea sand. A quantitative analysis indicated that the ligand had the strongest influence on Cs extraction, followed by water, and the co-ligand. The carbamate-conjugated catechol ligand was then used for Cs extraction from artificially contaminated real soil. Three types of soil were prepared: coarse soil (particle size = 0.5–1 mm), medium soil (particle size = 0.2–0.5 mm), and fine soil (particle size < 0.2 mm). The Cs fractions extracted from the coarse, medium, and fine soils were measured to be 95%, 91% and 70% of the Cs fraction extracted from sea sand, respectively, which indicates the existence of a surface area effect. Additionally, we suspect that Cs undergoes chemical interaction on the surface of real soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aadditives 3acarbon dioxide 3acatechol 3acesium radioisotopes 3aligands 3aparticle size 3apolluted soils 3aquantitative analysis 3aremediation 3asand 3asurface area 0aCarbamate-conjugated catechol 0aCs extraction 0aSupercritical CO2 0aSoil decontamination 0aDistribution coefficient1 aKim, Taehun1 aPark, Jihey1 aYan, Xinhao1 aKim, Hakwon0 tChemosphere.g2020 Mar., v. 242 p.125210-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01608naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245005600133300001200189520074500201592002800946650001000974650002000984650001301004650001101017650002101028650001301049650001501062650002201077650001601099650001501115651001801130773012501148852000901273655001201282IND60312871520221122053018.0150714e20140718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031287152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnderwood, Emily10aResearchers aim for an electrical memory prosthesis  ap. 250.  aMore than 270,000 U.S. military service members are currently diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries that can cause memory loss. Last fall, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) asked neuroscientists to do something extraordinary: Develop an implantable device that can repair that damage and restore memory.

Exposure to these extreme thermal conditions increases the heat stress of people in cities considerably. In this context, the present study aims to investigate the urban thermal environment of the large coastal metropolitan city of Athens, in a human-biometeorologically significant way, utilizing the thermo-physiological assessment index PET. The analysis was based on three hour measurements derived from three-year datasets (2006–2009), at 12 monitoring sites located in the urban complex of Athens, on its boundaries and beyond them. The differences of PET values have been investigated in order to attribute urban and exurban thermal characteristics to the considered sites. The frequency and spatial distribution of PET as well as the urban/rural differences of PET have also been analyzed. Finally, a trend analysis has been applied in order to detect possible PET trends by employing long-term recording data (1985–2008). In terms of thermal human-biometeorological conditions, the analysis reveals that among the considered stations, those located inside the urban complex and the industrialized area present urban thermal characteristics, regardless the fact that they are installed either in a park and on a hill or at an open field. The spatial distribution of PET, at 0200 LST, shows a difference of about 3 to 4°C, on the main axis of the city (SSW–NNE) in the summer period, while the difference exceeds 2.5°C in the winter period. In general, cooler (less warm) thermal perception is observed at the north/northeast sites of the city as well as at the areas beyond the eastern boundaries of it. The PET differences between urban and rural sites hold a positive sign, except of those at 0500 LST and at 0800 LST. The highest differences are noted at 1400 LST and the most intense of them is noticed in the summer period (exceeds 5°C). The trend analysis reveals statistically significant increasing heat stress for certain stations and months.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adata collection 3aheat stress 3ahills 3aindustrialization 3amonitoring 3apeople 3asummer 3athermal properties 3aurbanization 0aThermal human-biometeorological conditions 0aUrban thermal environment 0aThermal comfort 0aPET index 0aUrban/rural areas 0aAthens1 aGeorgiou, Giorgos K.1 aAsimakopoulos, Dimosthenis N.0 tAtmospheric research.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 152 p.82-92dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2013.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245006200154300001800216500002000234520182000254592002802074650001702102650001502119650002402134650002402158650000902182650001302191700002002204700002102224700002202245773009702267856007302364852000902437655001202446IND60523634220221123005304.0160623e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052363422DNAL7 a10.1890/11-1077.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaari, Gur10aConsistent scaling of persistence time in metapopulations  ap. 1214-1227.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent theory and experimental work in metapopulations and metacommunities demonstrates that long‐term persistence is maximized when the rate at which individuals disperse among patches within the system is intermediate; if too low, local extinctions are more frequent than recolonizations, increasing the chance of regional‐scale extinctions, and if too high, dynamics exhibit region‐wide synchrony, and local extinctions occur in near unison across the region. Although common, little is known about how the size and topology of the metapopulation (metacommunity) affect this bell‐shaped relationship between dispersal rate and regional persistence time. Using a suite of mathematical models, we examined the effects of dispersal, patch number, and topology on the regional persistence time when local populations are subject to demographic stochasticity. We found that the form of the relationship between regional persistence time and the number of patches is consistent across all models studied; however, the form of the relationship is distinctly different among low, intermediate, and high dispersal rates. Under low and intermediate dispersal rates, regional persistence times increase logarithmically and exponentially (respectively) with increasing numbers of patches, whereas under high dispersal, the form of the relationship depends on local dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the forms of these relationships, which give rise to the bell‐shaped relationship between dispersal rate and persistence time, are a product of recolonization and the region‐wide synchronization (or lack thereof) of population dynamics. Identifying such metapopulation attributes that impact extinction risk is of utmost importance for managing and conserving the earth's evermore fragmented populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aextinction 3amathematical models 3apopulation dynamics 3arisk 3atopology1 aBen-Zion, Yossi1 aShnerb, Nadav M.1 aVasseur, David A.0 tEcology.g2012 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1214-1227dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-1077.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013500169300001600304520067900320592002800999650001901027650001401046650001301060651001101073651001801084653002001102653002401122653002301146653001601169700002101185700002001206700001901226700002201245700006601267773013801333856008201471852000901553655001201562IND60543681120221120214349.0190411e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054368112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.myc.2015.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas-Isla, Ruby10aRelationship between Panus lecomtei and P. strigellus inferred from their morphological, molecular and biological characteristics  ap. 561-571.  aPanus strigellus was first recorded in Amazonas State of Brazil.

Cases were retrieved from the records of horses submitted for necropsy to the University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory over a 15-year period (1993-2007). Five hundred thirteen horses were diagnosed with periparturient arterial rupture, representing 1.5% of the total equine necropsy cases. Arterial rupture was diagnosed predominately in older mares, with 78% of the horses being ≥15 years of age. Ruptures occurred most commonly during parturition but also were diagnosed before and after parturition. Additionally, during a consecutive 3-year period within this time interval, an extensive workup of cases was performed. In these 71 cases, the area of the arterial rupture was carefully dissected, and the location, size, and appearance of the arterial tear were determined. The uterine artery was the most commonly affected vessel. Although there was overlap, mares with uterine artery rupture tended to be older than those with rupture of other arteries. There was no predilection for the left or right sides, and the uterine artery rupture occurred most often in the first 20 cm from the origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarteries 3amares 3anecropsy 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3auniversities 3aKentucky1 aBryant, Uneeda K.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2012 May, v. 32, no. 5 p.281-284dElsevier Inc.x0737-08067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2011.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006900155245007800224520113600302592002801438650001701466650001601483650001101499650001901510650001301529650000901542650001101551650002401562650001501586650002201601650001801623650001201641650001401653650002901667650001701696650004401713653001501757653000801772653001201780653002201792653002001814700002901834700006101863700002401924700002401948700002001972700002401992700002602016700002402042700002902066700002902095700002402124700002202148700002702170700002502197700002702222773009102249856009002340852000902430655001202439IND60674831120221117102221.0200103e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067483112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonon, Luciane A.Chimetto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6505-936X10aNew tetrodotoxin analogs in Brazilian pufferfishes tissues and microbiome  aWhile tetrodotoxin (TTX) is commonly found in pufferfish tissues, it is unclear if bacterial symbionts isolated from pufferfish tissues can produce TTX. In this investigation, UPLC qTOF-MS/MS analysis of tissue extracts obtained from Sphoeroides spengleri and Canthigaster figuereidoi identified TTX in their composition, indicating their consumption is unsafe. UPLC qTOF-MS/MS analysis coupled with Molecular Networking indicated new TTX analogs (methyl-TTX, TTX-acetate, hydroxypropyl-TTX and glycerol-TTX). Bacterial extracts from sixteen strains revealed a compound with a [M+H]⁺ ion at m/z 320.1088, identical to TTX. However, TTX itself was not detected in these cultures by UPLC-MS/MS. Neurotoxicity of Vibrio A665 purified fraction 2 (with precursor [M+H]⁺ ion at m/z 320.1088) was significant in human neural stem cells (hNSCs), but the Naᵥ blockage activity was not confirmed by the veratridine/ouabain essays, indicating a possible difference in the mechanism of action between the bacterium A665 purified fraction 2 and TTX. Vibrios symbionts of pufferfish point out involving in the production of TTX precursors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanthigaster 3aSphoeroides 3aVibrio 3aanimal tissues 3abacteria 3afish 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amicrobiome 3aneural stem cells 3aneurotoxicity 3aouabain 3asymbionts 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atetrodotoxin 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aPufferfish 0aTTX 0aVibrios 0aMolecular network 0aUPLC qTOF-MS/MS1 ade Azevedo, Gustavo P.R.1 aMonteiro, Afif F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6710-61391 aBernardi, Darlon I.1 aGubiani, Juliana R.1 aIóca, Laura P.1 aMattsson, Hannah K.1 aMoreira, Ana Paula B.1 aGomes, Alexandre F.1 aPires Junior, Osmindo R.1 ada S G Pedrosa, Carolina1 aSouza, Leticia R.Q.1 aRehen, Stevens K.1 aThompson, Cristiane C.1 aThompson, Fabiano L.1 aBerlinck, Roberto G.S.0 tChemosphere.g2020 Mar., v. 242 p.125211-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011400163520159500277592002801872650002501900650001401925650001601939650001301955650000901968650001401977650001601991650001102007650001702018650002302035650002102058650001602079650002202095650001302117650001402130650001302144650002902157700002602186700001802212700001902230773012702249856007902376852000902455655001202464IND60760577620221119135559.0211223e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076057762DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox101220232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarawsha, Aya 14aThe Protective Effect of Carotenoids, Polyphenols, and Estradiol on Dermal Fibroblasts under Oxidative Stress  aSkin ageing is influenced by several factors including environmental exposure and hormonal changes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which mediate many of the effects of these factors, induce inflammatory processes in the skin and increase the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in dermal fibroblasts, which leads to collagen degradation. Several studies have shown the protective role of estrogens and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables on skin physiology. Previous studies have shown that dietary carotenoids and polyphenols activate the cell’s antioxidant defense system by increasing antioxidant response element/Nrf2 (ARE/Nrf2) transcriptional activity and reducing the inflammatory response. The aim of the current study was to examine the protective effect of such dietary-derived compounds and estradiol on dermal fibroblasts under oxidative stress induced by H₂O₂. Human dermal fibroblasts were used to study the effect of H₂O₂ on cell number and apoptosis, MMP-1, and pro-collagen secretion as markers of skin damage. Treatment of cells with H₂O₂ led to cell death, increased secretion of MMP-1, and decreased pro-collagen secretion. Pre-treatment with tomato and rosemary extracts, and with estradiol, reversed the effects of the oxidative stress. This was associated with a reduction in intracellular ROS levels, probably through the measured increased activity of ARE/Nrf2. Conclusions: This study indicates that carotenoids, polyphenols, and estradiol protect dermal fibroblasts from oxidative stress-induced damage through a reduction in ROS levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acarotenoids 3acollagen 3adiet 3aestradiol 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ametalloproteinases 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3aprotective effect 3arosemary 3asecretion 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aTrachtenberg, Aviram 1 aLevy, Joseph 1 aSharoni, Yoav 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox101220233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245009000169300001600259520096600275592002801241650002701269650000801296650002201304650002001326650002001346650002501366650003001391650001801421650002201439700002301461700001301484700001701497773009701514856005701611852000901668655001201677IND4468528520221118100224.0120727e199406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446852852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2338.1994.tb01403.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGIORGI, C.10aIdentification of plant‐parasitic nematodes by PCR amplification of DNA fragments1   ap. 447-451.  aA study concerning the detection and characterization of a DNA fragment from plant‐parasitic nematodes to be used as a molecular marker for the identification of different nematodes is described. A fragment of DNA, which is known to consist of a variable region flanked by two conserved regions, has been studied by using PCR amplification. A portion of about 600 nucleotides at the 5’end of the larger rRNA gene has been amplified in different nematodes, using heterologous primers which hybridize with the conserved regions. The results obtained clearly indicate that the same primers can be used for the amplification of this segment in nematodes of different species and of different genera: Meloidogyne artiellia, M. incognita, Xiphinema index, X. diversicaudatum and Globodera pallida. The amplified regions have been partially sequenced. The nucleotide sequences have been analysed by comparison with the published sequence of Caenorhabditis elegans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDNA 3aGlobodera pallida 3aXiphinema index 3agenetic markers 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis1 aSIALER, M.

Freshwater ecosystems may receive higher amounts of subsidies (i.e., resources produced outside the focal ecosystem) than terrestrial ecosystems, potentially leading to increased secondary production in freshwaters. Here we used a meta‐analytic approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of subsidy inputs across the freshwater–land interface and to determine subsequent responses in recipient animals. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems differed in the magnitude of subsidies they received, with aquatic ecosystems generally receiving higher subsidies than terrestrial ecosystems. Surprisingly, and despite the large discrepancy in magnitude, the contribution of these subsidies to animal carbon inferred from stable isotope composition did not differ between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, likely due to the differences in subsidy quality. The contribution of allochthonous subsidies was highest to primary consumers and predators, suggesting that bottom‐up and top‐down effects may be affected considerably by the input of allochthonous resources. Future work on subsidies will profit from a food web dynamic approach including indirect trophic interactions and propagating effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3acarbon 3aenergy 3afood webs 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3apredators 3asecondary productivity 3astable isotopes 3asubsidies 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aCucherousset, Julien1 aSteger, Kristin1 aEklöv, Peter1 aTranvik, Lars J.1 aHillebrand, Helmut0 tEcology.g2012 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1173-1182dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-1210.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024001900113024005700132040001800189100001700207245009000224300001600314520050300330592002800833650002000861650002200881650001800903650001900921650001500940650002300955650002100978650003600999650001201035650001801047650003301065650001101098650000901109650003001118650001001148650003301158650002701191650004001218651002601258651001201284651002701296651002601323651003901349700001801388773011901406856011201525856011701637961001301754852000901767655001201776IND2206652020221121041316.0151126e200006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220665202DNAL7 a10113/490832hdl7 a108642652pmid7 a10.1645/0022-3395(2000)086[0622:SOTGIR]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, J.

Although NRs might affect physical activity (PA), no previous study has simultaneously examined compositional and contextual associations of NRs with PA. In this study, we examined whether individual- and community-level NRs were independently associated with PA. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 8592 (4340 men and 4252 women) non-disabled residents aged 65–84 years from all 18 districts of Ota City, Tokyo. PA was assessed by using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. In addition, we calculated moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), its components (vigorous PA [VPA], moderate PA [MPA], and walking time [WT]), and sitting time (ST). Individual-level NRs were categorized as “visiting each other,” “standing and chatting,” “exchange of greetings,” or “none.” Community-level NRs were defined as the proportions of residents with active NRs (i.e., those in the categories visiting each other and standing and chatting) in the 18 districts. Using multilevel regression analyses, we examined independent associations of individual- and community-level NRs with PA variables and adjusted for important confounders. RESULTS: Individual-level NRs were consistently positively associated with MVPA and its components (VPA, MPA [in men], and WT) in both sexes, and the dose–response relationships were significant (all P < 0.041 for trend). In men, community-level NRs (by 1% estimation) were positively associated with individual MVPA (2.1 metabolic equivalent-hours/week, 95% confidence interval: 0.7–3.4), VPA (8.6 min/week, 2.7–14.4), and WT (11.6 min/week, 2.2–20.9), regardless of the degree of individual-level NRs. Significant cross-level interactions of NRs with MVPA and VPA were observed among men, and the dose–response relationships were significant (both P < 0.037 for trend). Neither individual- nor community-level NRs were associated with ST in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Men and women with inaccessible neighbors engaged in less MVPA, while men living in communities with active NRs engaged in more MVPA, regardless of individual-level NRs. NRs at the individual and community level might help prevent physical inactivity among men.  aPublisher supplied data  a16K16615cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aconfidence interval 3amen 3ametropolitan areas 3aregression analysis 3awalking 3awomen1 aKitamura, Akihiko1 aNishi, Mariko1 aTomine, Yui1 aTanaka, Izumi1 aTaniguchi, Yu1 aYokoyama, Yuri1 aAmano, Hidenori1 aNarita, Miki1 aIkeuchi, Tomoko1 aFujiwara, Yoshinori1 aShinkai, Shoji0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2018 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.46-46dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-018-0679-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245019800172520176600370592002802136650001102164650001802175650001102193650002002204650001302224650002702237650001402264650002102278650001102299650002402310650001402334650001702348650001502365650001702380650002202397650000902419650001102428650001902439650001102458650001602469650001502485650001102500651001002511653002002521653002902541653001102570653001602581653002302597700001602620700005602636700001702692700001902709700002002728700005602748700001502804773009102819856009002910852000903000655001203009IND60674831320221117102151.0200103e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067483132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Bianbian10aPhthalate esters in atmospheric PM2.5 and PM10 in the semi-arid city of Xi’an, Northwest China: Pollution characteristics, sources, health risks, and relationships with meteorological factors  aPM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ samples were collected in the semi-arid city of Xi’an in Northwest China from November 2016 to November 2017 and analyzed to assess pollution characteristics, sources, health risks, and influencing factors of 6 priority phthalate esters (PAEs). The results showed that the sum of the 6 PAEs (Σ₆PAEs) was 85.5 ng m⁻³ in PM₂.₅ and 94.5 ng m⁻³ in PM₁₀, being higher at the suburban site than the urban site and winter > spring > summer > autumn. The most abundant PAE was bis(2-ethylhexyl phthalate) (DEHP). PM₂.₅- and PM₁₀-bound PAEs were associated mainly with the use of plasticizers plus the uses of cosmetics and personal care products, construction materials, and home furnishings. Temperature, relative humidity, and visibility had stronger influences on the concentrations of PM and PM-bound PAEs than pressure and wind speed. Pressure and relative humidity were positively correlated with the concentrations of PM and most of the PM-bound PAEs, while temperature, visibility and wind speed had negative correlations with the concentrations of PM and PM-bound PAEs. The non-carcinogenic risks of human inhalation exposure to PM-bound PAEs were in the range of 10⁻⁷ to 10⁻³, suggesting low non-cancer risks, which were higher at the suburban site than the urban site and higher to children than adults. The cancer risks of human inhalation exposure to PM-bound DEHP and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) were in the range of 10⁻¹² to 10⁻¹⁰, suggesting low carcinogenic risks, being in the order of the suburban site > the urban site and DEHP > BBP. Special attention should be paid to long-term low dose exposure to PAEs in the suburb, especially in winter and spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aair pollution 3aautumn 3acarcinogenicity 3achildren 3aconstruction materials 3acosmetics 3ahome furnishings 3ahumans 3ainhalation exposure 3aneoplasms 3aparticulates 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3arelative humidity 3arisk 3aspring 3asuburban areas 3asummer 3atemperature 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina 0aPhthalate ester 0aPollution characteristic 0aSource 0aHealth risk 0aParticulate matter1 aWang, Lijun1 aTao, Wendong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3893-13131 aLiu, Mengmei1 aZhang, Panqing1 aZhang, Shengwei1 aLi, Xiaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9702-81271 aLu, Xinwei0 tChemosphere.g2020 Mar., v. 242 p.125226-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1252263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01543naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002900112245002600141300001600167520078100183592002800964650001200992650002201004650002501026650001001051650001301061650001601074650001201090650001701102773012501119852000901244655001201253IND60312871720221122031454.0150714e20140718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031287172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouzin-Frankel, Jennifer14aThe elusive heart fix  ap. 252-257.  aThirteen years ago, cardiologists began testing a radical new treatment in people: infusing a mix of bone marrow cells, collected from a patient, into his or her heart.

In addition to a mix of cells drawn from marrow, researchers are considering mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and more. Even doubters hope that some type of cell therapy will eventually make a difference for many heart patients.

Endocytosis and recycling processes play important roles in regulating PIN protein distribution and abundance at the PM. Two subunits (SEC8, EXO70A1) of exocyst, an octameric vesicle-tethering complex, have been reported to be involved in PIN protein recycling in Arabidopsis. However, the function of exocyst complex in PIN protein recycling and polar auxin transport remains incompletely understood. In this study, we utilized two SEC6 down-regulation mutants (PRsec6-1 and PRsec6-2) to investigate the role of exocyst subunit SEC6 in the primary root development, polar auxin transport and PIN proteins recycling. We found that in PRsec6 mutants: 1. Primary root growth was retarded, and lateral root initiation were compromised. 2. Primary roots were sensitive to exogenous auxin 1-napthalene acetic acid (NAA) but not 2,4-dichlorophenoxy (2.4-D). 3. Recycling of PIN1 and PIN2 proteins from the Brefeldin A (BFA) compartment to the PM was delayed. 4. Vesicles accumulated in the primary root tip cells, especially accumulated in the cytosol closed to the PM. These results further demonstrated that the exocyst complex plays an important role in PIN protein recycling and polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis primary root.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aacetic acid 3ablood proteins 3abrefeldin A 3acytosol 3aendocytosis 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3amutants 3amutation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein metabolism 3aroot growth 3aroots 0aABRC 0aBFA 0aCLSM 0aDAG 0aGUS 0aIAA 0aNAA 0aPM 0aTEM 0a2,4-D 0aExocyst 0aSEC6 0aPIN proteins recycling 0aPolar auxin transport1 aFung, Y.

In woodland caribou, human disturbances are associated with higher predation risk. Between 2004 and 2011, we investigated if habitat selection strategies of female caribou towards disturbances influenced their calf’s survival in managed boreal forest with varying intensities of human disturbances. Calf survival was 53 % and 43 % after 30 and 90 days following birth, respectively, and 52 % of calves that died were killed by black bear. The probability that a female lose its calf to predation was not influenced by habitat composition of her annual home range, but decreased with an increase in proportion of open lichen woodland within her calving home range. At the local scale, females that did not lose their calf displayed stronger avoidance of high road density areas than females that lost their calf to predation. Further, females that lost their calf to predation and that had a low proportion of ≤5-year-old cutovers within their calving home range were mostly observed in areas where these young cutovers were locally absent. Also, females that lost their calf to predation and that had a high proportion of ≤5-year-old cutovers within their calving home range were mostly observed in areas with a high local density of ≤5-year-old cutovers. Our study demonstrates that we have to account for human-induced disturbances at both local and regional scales in order to further enhance effective caribou management plans.

The metalloid was only present in consumer paints of a speciality (e.g. artistic) nature, but was common in old household paints as an anti-chalking agent and in brightly-coloured contemporary exterior paints (on roads, street furniture and playground equipment, for example) as a colour fastener with concentrations ranging from a few hundred to about 25,000 μg g⁻¹. Antimony was also found in contemporary container glass and ceramic products as an additive or opacifier and as a colour fastener in enamels at concentrations up to a few thousand μg g⁻¹. Overall, the yellow pigment, lead antimonate, was only evident in two ceramic products analysed, with Sb concentrations exceeding 62,800 μg g⁻¹. Available data in the literature suggests that, while Sb concentrations up to 30 μg g⁻¹ are bioaccessible in exterior paints and that concentrations of up to 20 mg L⁻¹ are migratable in some ceramicware, no relevant regulations are currently in place. Given our lack of understanding of the health impacts of Sb, more studies on its toxicity and mobility from commonly encountered products are called for.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aantimony 3aceramics 3acolor 3aequipment 3afurniture 3aglass 3alead 3apaints 3aroads 3atoxicity 0aAntimony 0aPaints 0aEnamels 0aCeramics 0aGlass 0aXRF1 aFilella, Montserrat0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 713 p.136588-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1365883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013400170300001600304520161900320592002801939650001001967650001501977650001101992650001302003650001502016650001802031650001102049650001102060650001302071650002102084650001402105650002602119650001502145650001602160650002902176650001202205653002302217653002102240653002702261653002902288653002202317700001602339700001902355700001602374700001602390773012302406856008702529852000902616655001202625IND60584351720221122171206.0190318e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058435172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Junjie10aWavelet-based coupling of leaf and canopy reflectance spectra to improve the estimation accuracy of foliar nitrogen concentration  ap. 306-315.  aThe leaf or canopy reflectance spectra of vegetation have been widely employed in estimating foliar nitrogen (N) concentration; however, they alone may not actually reflect the spectral and detailed information at a sampling plot. In this study, the potential spectral details of Carex (C. cinerascens) at a plot scale were derived using discrete wavelet transform, in which a simple operation of addition was employed to combine the reconstructed leaf and canopy reflectance at the fourth decomposition level (named “leaf-canopy d4 reflectance”). Partial least squares regression (PLSR), successive projections algorithm-based multiple linear regression (SPA-MLR) and random forest regression (RFR) models with leaf, canopy and leaf-canopy d4 reflectance were established and validated for foliar N estimation, respectively. The results showed that the PLSR (R2CV=0.718, determination coefficient of cross-validation; R2Val=0.743, determination coefficient of independent validation; RPD=1.91, residual prediction deviation), SPA-MLR (R2CV=0.709, R2Val=0.747, RPD=1.97) and RFR (R2CV=0.714, R2Val=0.783, RPD=2.16) models with leaf-canopy d4 reflectance outperformed their corresponding models with leaf or canopy reflectance. We conclude that the wavelet-based coupling of leaf and canopy reflectance spectra has great potential in the accurate estimation of foliar N concentration. This proposed strategy helps to understand the spectral details of vegetation at a plot scale, providing the potential for improving the plot-based estimation of plant nutrients in grassland, precision agriculture or forestry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3aforestry 3agrasslands 3aleast squares 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aprecision agriculture 3aprediction 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3awavelet 0aCanopy reflectance 0aLeaf reflectance 0aNitrogen concentration 0aRandom forest regression 0aWavelet transform1 aChen, Yiyun1 aChen, Fangyuan1 aShi, Tiezhu1 aWu, Guofeng0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 248 p.306-315dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04291naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094024002200140024001900162040001800181100001800199245021700217300001600434506007600450520254000526592002803066506003703094650001803131650001503149650000903164650002703173650002003200650001003220650002103230650001203251650001803263650001203281650002203293650004303315650002003358653003103378653002403409653000803433653002303441653002003464700002403484700001703508700001603525700001803541773010003559856009303659852000903752655001203761IND60559671520221207094211.0190318e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055967152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.12.0062doi7 aPMC53251552pmcid7 a281669732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSongsasen, N.10aShort-term hypertonic exposure enhances in vitro follicle growth and meiotic competence of enclosed oocytes while modestly affecting mRNA expression of aquaporin and steroidogenic genes in the domestic cat model  ap. 228-236.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUsing the domestic cat as a non-rodent, larger animal model, the objective was to determine the impact of a brief incubation in a hypertonic microenvironment on (1) ovarian follicle and oocyte growth in vitro, (2) developmental capacity of the resident oocyte, and (3) expression of aquaporin (AQP) genes in parallel with genes involved in regulation of folliculogenesis. In Study 1: Secondary or early antral follicles encapsulated in 0.5% alginate were allocated to one of three treatment groups: 1) culture in standard medium at 290 mOsm for 15 d (Control); 2) incubation in 350 mOsm medium for 1 h followed by culture in standard medium for 15 d (Hypertonic-1h); or 3) incubation in 350 mOsm medium for 24 h followed by incubation in standard medium for additional 14 d (Hypertonic-24h). After measuring follicle and oocyte diameters on Day 15, in vitro-grown oocytes were incubated for 24 h before assessing nuclear status. In Study 2: secondary or early antral follicles were subjected to one of the three treatments: 1) culture in standard medium at 290 mOsm for 48 h; 2) incubation in 350 mOsm medium for 1 h followed by culture in standard medium for additional 47 h; or 3) incubation in 350 mOsm medium for 24 h followed by culture in standard medium for additional 24 h. At the end of the culture period, all follicles were assessed for mRNA level of Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1, Star, Aqp1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 as well as Fshr using qPCR. Freshly collected follicles also were subjected to gene expression analysis and served as the ‘Non-cultured control’. Hypertonic-24h follicles grew larger (P < 0.05) than the control, whereas those in Hypertonic-1h group exhibited intermediate growth, especially when the culture started at the early antral stage. Oocytes in the Hypertonic-24h group were larger and resumed meiosis at a higher rate than in the other treatments. In vitro culture affected (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of Cyp19a1, Star, Aqp1, and Aqp7 in both the secondary and early antral stage while Fshr was only affected in the former compared to the non-cultured control. Pre-incubating follicles in 350 mOsm medium for 24 h enhanced (P < 0.05) Star and Aqp7 while decreasing (P < 0.05) Aqp1 expression compared to the control in secondary follicles, but not in the early antral stage. In summary, short-term hypertonic exposure promoted cat follicle development in vitro (including the meiotic competence of the enclosed oocyte) possibly through a mechanism that does not involve water transport genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aaquaporins 3acats 3afollicular development 3agene expression 3agenes 3ain vitro culture 3ameiosis 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3aovarian follicles 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asteroidogenesis 0aIn vitro follicle culture 0aHypertonic exposure 0aCat 0aMeiotic maturation 0aGene expression1 aThongkittidilok, C.1 aYamamizu, K.1 aWildt, D.E.1 aComizzoli, P.0 tTheriogenology.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 90 p.228-236dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017600168300001400344520133800358592002801696650002301724650001701747650001801764650001201782650002301794650001701817650001001834650002401844650001001868650001101878650001901889650001401908650001701922650002301939650000901962650002901971650002202000650001302022653001702035653002302052653002502075653003502100653002202135653000802157653000802165653000902173653000802182653000802190700002202198700002002220700002302240700001902263773012402282856008302406852000902489655001202498IND60526384220221121204151.0190405e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052638422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2016.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishizawa, Yoko10aMolecular and cellular analysis of the biotrophic interaction between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae – Exploring situations in which the blast fungus controls the infection  ap. 70-76.  aBiotrophic pathogens need to contend with host defense mechanisms to develop within living host cells. To understand the biotrophic interactions between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungus causing rice blast disease, we studied molecular mechanisms of rice susceptibility using transgenic rice plants overexpressing a transcriptional repressor, OsWRKY76. In addition, we analyzed host cellular dynamics during the biotrophic interaction using live-cell fluorescence imaging systems. The overexpression of OsWRKY76 caused the transcriptional suppression of a specific set of defense-responsive genes and generation of phytoalexins after fungal infection. The invasive hyphae were surrounded by the host central vacuole without disruption of the vacuolar membrane. Moreover, high-resolution imaging of the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) revealed that the host cytosol accumulates at the BIC together with host-derived membranes excluding the vacuolar membrane. A symplastic effector was detected in a punctate localization pattern enclosed by the membranes. These results imply that the down-regulation of phytoalexin synthesis and the maintenance of host vacuolar membranes constitute part of the infection strategy of M. oryzae, and that vesicle budding is involved in the effector internalization into the host cytoplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aOryza sativa 3ablast disease 3acytosol 3adefense mechanisms 3afluorescence 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahyphae 3aimage analysis 3apathogens 3aphytoalexins 3arepressor proteins 3arice 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 3avacuoles 0aOryza sativa 0aMagnaporthe oryzae 0aTranscription factor 0aLive-cell fluorescence imaging 0aVacuolar membrane 0aBIC 0aBTH 0aEIHM 0adpi 0ahpi1 aMochizuki, Susumu1 aYokotani, Naoki1 aNishimura, Takeshi1 aMinami, Eiichi0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2016 July, v. 95 p.70-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2016.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245014100207300001400348520152600362592002801888596006601916596006601982596008802048650001202136650001702148650001702165650001202182650002302194650002402217650002002241650002602261650003002287650001902317650001302336650001202349650001102361651001602372700002602388700002102414700001802435773014102453856008202594852000902676655001202685IND60632516220221120224403.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063251622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-018-0111-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilić, Dubravka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8828-148914aThe importance of hidden diversity for insect conservation: a case study in hoverflies (the Merodon atratus complex, Syrphidae, Diptera)  ap. 29-44.  aCryptic species represent a large component of hidden biodiversity. Some cryptic taxa require specific climate and habitat conditions and have limited dispersal abilities. In order to assess the importance of cryptic species and to minimize future loss of biodiversity, we modelled the current and future distribution of the Merodon atratus (Oldenberg, 1919) species complex, once thought to be a single species, and compared it with species distribution models for each of the three cryptic species within the complex (M. atratus, M. balkanicus Šašić, Ačanski et Vujić, 2016, M. virgatus Vujić et Radenković, 2016). Additionally, we compared environmental niche models for each cryptic species. We then tested the capability of nationally designated protected areas to encompass the species complex and each cryptic species of the complex. We conclude that although cryptic species of the M. atratus complex exhibit high levels of morphological similarity, they will respond differently to global climate change, requiring tailored particular conservation strategies. Overall, the species complex will drastically decrease its range and retreat to the Alps. More specifically, each cryptic species requires specific environmental conditions and will react differently to climate change. These results contribute to the establishment of a conservation status for these newly discovered species and their conservation management, particularly for M. balkanicus that is projected to go extinct due to global warming.  aPublisher supplied data  aOI173002cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  aIII43002cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  a142-451-2591/2017cProvincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development 3aMerodon 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aconservation areas 3aconservation status 3acryptic species 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical distribution 3aglobal warming 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3amodels 3aAlps region1 aRadenković, Snežana1 aAčanski, Jelena1 aVujić, Ante,0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2019 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.29-44dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870062x1366-638X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-018-0111-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245011800182300001800300520109100318592002801409650002601437650001701463650002301480650001301503650002401516650001801540650002101558650001901579650002701598650001401625650003701639650003201676650002901708650002301737650002101760650003901781700002001820700001601840700001301856700001601869773009901885856008101984852000902065655001202074IND50069586620221120064654.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006958662DNAL7 a237088762pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-013-1245-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chengyi10aSynthesis of poly(ε-caprolactone) by an immobilized lipase coated with ionic liquids in a solvent-free condition  ap. 1623-1630.  aPolycaprolactone (PCL) was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone through two different enzymatic processes. The lipase from Candida antarctica B, immobilized on macroporous acrylic acid beads, was employed either untreated or coated with small amounts of ionic liquids (ILs). Monocationic ionic liquids, [C ₙ MIm][NTf₂] (n = 2, 6, 12), as well as a dicationic ionic liquid, ([C₄(C₆Im)₂][NTf₂]₂), were used to coat the immobilized lipase and also as the reaction medium. In both methods, the polarity, anion of the ILs concentration and viscosity strongly influenced the reaction. Coating the immobilized enzyme with ILs improved catalytic activity and less ILs was required to produce PCL with a higher molecular weight and reaction yield. At 60 °C and ILs/Novozyme-435 coating ratio of 3:1 (w/w) for 48 h, the highest M w and reaction yield of PCL were 35,600 g/mol and 62 % in the case of [C₁₂MIm][NTf₂], while the M w and reaction yield of PCL was 20,300 g/mol and 54 % with [C₁₂MIm][NTf₂] and catalyzed by untreated lipase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aacrylic acid 3acatalytic activity 3acoatings 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aionic liquids 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aviscosity 2aEnzymes, Immobilizedxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aIonic Liquidsxchemistry 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aMolecular Weight 2aPolyestersxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aZhang, Zongyong1 aChen, Chong1 aHe, Feng1 aZhuo, Renxi0 tBiotechnology letters.g2013 Oct., v. 35, no. 10 p.1623-1630dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-013-1245-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245013800217300001400355520132200369592002801691650002201719650001401741650002301755650001201778650001901790650001301809650001301822650001201835650002101847650001101868650002101879650002801900650001701928650000901945650001701954650001701971653001701988653001502005653001202020653001802032653001102050700005802061773010702119856008602226852000902312655001202321IND60525872420221116162959.0190319e20160216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052587242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiné-Bordonaba, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8514-533710aEffect of deficit irrigation and methyl jasmonate application on the composition of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) fruit and leaves  ap. 63-70.  aDrought stress is among the most severe environmental risks threatening strawberry production. In the present study, the effect of deficit irrigation (DI; 50mL/day) and/or elicitation with methyl jasmonate (MeJA; 0.1mM) on the composition of secondary fruit and leaves from three strawberry pre-commercial cultivars (253/29, 279/4 and 279/5) was investigated and compared to plants kept at or near field capacity (200mL/day). For certain cultivars (253/29), DI applied at green stage of fruit development resulted in a considerable reduction in berry size (1.7-fold). In other cultivars (279/4 and 279/5), fruit size was comparable in DI-treated and fully irrigated plants. Changes in the major sugars and organic acids of strawberry leaves and fruit were cultivar and organ dependent and were associated to an osmotic adjustment strategy within the plant to counteract the effects of drought. Overall, elicitation with MeJA had a minimal effect on plant growth and morphological traits. Nevertheless, MeJA increased fructose content of DI-treated leaves and palliated the differences in glucose content of fruit from different water treatments. The most pronounced effect of MeJA was related to an enchance synthesis and accumulation of pelargonidin-3-glucoside (nearly 2-fold) in red-ripe fruit from cultivar 279/5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought 3afield capacity 3afructose 3afruiting 3aglucose 3airrigation rates 3aleaves 3amethyl jasmonate 3aorganic acids and salts 3aplant growth 3arisk 3astrawberries 3awater stress 0aAnthocyanins 0aBerry size 0aDrought 0aOrganic acids 0aSugars1 aTerry, Leon A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5677-023X0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Feb. 16, v. 199 p.63-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245016500175300001400340500001400354520192500368592002802293650002502321650001702346650002402363653002102387653002402408653001502432653001602447653001802463653001802481653002302499653004702522700006002569700002202629700002402651700002502675773008902700856009002789852000902879655001202888IND60724274620221123030638.0210212e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072427462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2020.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsamil, Ali M.10aComparison of consistency and complementarity of reporting biosimilar quality attributes between regulatory and scientific communities: An adalimumab case study  ap. 30-37.  aNAL-light  aBiosimilar approval relies on the comparability of quality attributes (QAs), for which information can be derived from regulatory or scientific communities. Limited information is known about whether these sources are consistent with or complementary to each other. The consistency and complementarity of QA reporting in biosimilarity assessments for adalimumab biosimilars approved by the European Medicines Agency in European public assessment reports (EPARs) and scientific publications was assessed. A classification of 77 different QAs (53 structural and 24 functional attributes) was used to assess the types of and information on QAs reported. Six adalimumab biosimilars were analyzed, for which the number of QAs reported in EPARs and publications varied (range = 47 [61%]–60 [78%]). The proportion of QAs consistently reported in both sources varied (range = 28%–75%) among biosimilars; functional QAs (mean = 21 QAs [88%]; range = 19–23) were more consistently reported than structural QAs (mean = 33 QAs [62%]; range = 27–34). The EPARs frequently reported biosimilarity interpretation without providing test results (9–57 QAs in EPARs versus 0–8 QAs in publications), whereas publications frequently reported both test results and interpretations (13–40 QAs in publications versus 0–3 QAs in EPARs). Both sources provided information on the biosimilarity of QAs in a complementary manner and the same biosimilarity interpretation of test results for reported QAs (mean = 90%; range = 78%–100%), with a small discrepancy in biosimilarity interpretations of a few clinically relevant QAs related to post-translation modifications and biological activity. Comprehensive reporting of QAs can contribute to an improved understanding of the role of structural and functional attributes in establishing biosimilarity and the mechanism of action of biological substances in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acase studies 3amechanism of action 0aBiological drugs 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aAdalimumab 0aBiosimilars 0aBiosimilarity 0aComparability 0aQuality attributes 0aEuropean public assessment reports (EPARs)1 aGiezen, Thijs J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4087-033X1 aEgberts, Toine C.1 aLeufkens, Hubert G.1 aGardarsdottir, Helga0 tBiologicals.g2021 Jan., v. 69 p.30-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2020.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245014000173300001400313520181600327592002802143650002002171650001502191650002502206650001902231650003802250650002502288650002302313650002102336650001902357650002002376650001302396650001902409650003902428650002602467650001302493650001302506650001502519650002202534650002302556650001102579650001102590651001002601651001302611653001702624653002402641653003902665653001802704653001802722653003702740700002002777700002502797773010402822856008402926852000903010655001203019IND60530699820221118173227.0180905e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053069982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Ashis K.12aA proteomic analysis of Pakistan Daboia russelii russelii venom and assessment of potency of Indian polyvalent and monovalent antivenom  ap. 73-86.  aTo address the dearth of knowledge on the biochemical composition of Pakistan Russell's Viper (Daboia russelii russelii) venom (RVV), the venom proteome has been analyzed and several biochemical and pharmacological properties of the venom were investigated. SDS-PAGE (reduced) analysis indicated that proteins/peptides in the molecular mass range of ~56.0–105.0kDa, 31.6–51.0kDa, 15.6–30.0kDa, 9.0–14.2kDa and 5.6–7.2kDa contribute approximately 9.8%, 12.1%, 13.4%, 34.1% and 30.5%, respectively of Pakistan RVV. Proteomics analysis of gel-filtration peaks of RVV resulted in identification of 75 proteins/peptides which belong to 14 distinct snake venom protein families. Phospholipases A2 (32.8%), Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors (28.4%), and snake venom metalloproteases (21.8%) comprised the majority of Pakistan RVV proteins, while 11 additional families accounted for 6.5–0.2%. Occurrence of aminotransferase, endo-β-glycosidase, and disintegrins is reported for the first time in RVV. Several of RVV proteins/peptides share significant sequence homology across Viperidae subfamilies. Pakistan RVV was well recognized by both the polyvalent (PAV) and monovalent (MAV) antivenom manufactured in India; nonetheless, immunological cross-reactivity determined by ELISA and neutralization of pro-coagulant/anticoagulant activity of RVV and its fractions by MAV surpassed that of PAV.The study establishes the proteome profile of the Pakistan RVV, thereby indicating the presence of diverse proteins and peptides that play a significant role in the pathophysiology of RVV bite. Further, the proteomic findings will contribute to understand the variation in venom composition owing to different geographical location and identification of pharmacologically important proteins in Pakistan RVV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaboia russelii 3aantivenoms 3achemical composition 3across reaction 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amedicinal properties 3ametalloproteinases 3amolecular weight 3aneutralization 3apathophysiology 3apeptides 3aphospholipases 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asequence homology 3aserine proteinases 3asnakes 3avenoms 3aIndia 3aPakistan 0aESI-LC-MS/MS 0aSnake venom enzymes 0aSnake venom non-enzymatic proteins 0aPro-coagulant 0aAnticoagulant 0aVenom-antivenom cross-reactivity1 aKalita, Bhargab1 aMackessy, Stephen P.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2016 July 20, v. 144 p.73-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245003500165300001400200520167900214592002801893650002101921650001601942650001601958650001301974650001401987653001902001653001602020653002102036653001602057653002802073700006702101773011702168856008302285852000902368655001202377IND60776535220221118220405.0220614e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077653522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2022.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShlush, Eden10aBioplastics for food packaging  ap. 66-80.  aBackground. Packaging materials are responsible for approximately 40% of the produced plastics while food packaging is the number one end user of such materials. Due to the diverse and extensive deleterious effects of conventional plastics on the environment, the food packaging industry is constantly seeking for new alternatives for such materials. Scope and approach. In an attempt to replace petroleum-based plastics and formulate a sustainable solution, new generation of plastic materials termed ‘bioplastics’ have been developed. The term bioplastic is mostly used to define plastics that can be either bio-based, biodegradable, or both.

The fruits of a new trifoliate (tf) mutant (tf‐5) were firmer and had higher °Brix values and higher folate and carotenoid contents. The transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome profiling of tf‐5 reflected a broad‐spectrum change in cellular homeostasis. The tf‐5 allele enhanced the fruit firmness by suppressing cell wall softening‐related proteins. tf‐5 fruit displayed a substantial increase in amino acids, particularly γ‐aminobutyric acid, with a parallel reduction in aminoacyl‐tRNA synthases. The increased lipoxygenase protein and transcript levels seemingly elevated jasmonic acid levels. In addition, increased abscisic acid hydrolase transcript levels coupled with reduced precursor supply lowered abscisic acid levels. The upregulation of carotenoids was mediated by modulation of methylerythreitol and plastoquinone pathways and increased the levels of carotenoid isomerization proteins. The upregulation of folate in tf‐5 was connoted by the increase in the precursor p‐aminobenzoic acid and transcript levels of several folate biosynthesis genes. The reduction in pterin‐6‐carboxylate levels and γ‐glutamyl hydrolase activity indicated that reduced folate degradation in tf‐5 increased folate levels. Our study delineates that in addition to leaf development, MYB117 also influences fruit metabolism. The tf‐5 allele can be used to increase γ‐aminobutyric acid, carotenoid, and folate levels in tomato.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/COE/34/SP15209/2015cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India  aBT/PR/7002/PBD/16/1009/2012cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India  aBT/PR11671/PBD/16/828/2008cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabscisic acid 3aalleles 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3acell walls 3afolic acid 3afruit quality 3afruits 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrolases 3aisomerization 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaf development 3alipoxygenases 3ameristems 3ametabolome 3amutants 3ap-aminobenzoic acid 3aplastoquinones 3aproteome 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome1 aSunkum, Anusha1 aRai, Meenakshi1 aYadav, Amita1 aSircar, Sanchari1 aSreelakshmi, Yellamaraju1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3468-91361 aSharma, Rameshwar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8775-89860 tplant journal.g2022 Oct., v. 112, no. 1 p.38-54dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.159253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245010200152300001600254500002000270520152500290592002801815650001601843650001901859650002501878650001201903650001201915650001801927650001601945650001501961650001201976650001901988650001902007650002402026650001202050650001302062650002202075650002202097650002302119650001202142700001802154700001402172700002002186700002102206700002102227700002102248773011602269856007302385852000902458655001202467IND60587352520221121023148.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058735252DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.145502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ping10aVector and nonvector insect feeding reduces subsequent plant susceptibility to virus transmission  ap. 699-710.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe interactions of vector–virus–plant have important ecological and evolutionary implications. While the tripartite interactions have received some attention, little is known about whether vector infestation affects subsequent viral transmission and infection. Working with the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, begomovirus and tobacco/tomato, we demonstrate that pre‐infestation of plants by the whitefly vector reduced subsequent plant susceptibility to viral transmission. Pre‐infestation by the cotton bollworm, a nonvector of the virus, likewise repressed subsequent viral transmission. The two types of insects, with piercing and chewing mouthparts, respectively, activated different plant signaling pathways in the interactions. Whitefly pre‐infestation activated the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, leading to deposition of callose that inhibited begomovirus replication/movement. Although cotton bollworm infestation elicited the jasmonic acid (JA) defense pathway and was beneficial to virus replication, the pre‐infested plants repelled whiteflies from feeding and so decreased virus transmission. Experiments using a pharmaceutical approach with plant hormones or a genetic approach using hormone transgenic or mutant plants further showed that SA played a negative but JA played a positive role in begomovirus infection. These novel findings indicate that both vector and nonvector insect feeding of a plant may have substantial negative consequences for ensuing viral transmission and infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBegomovirus 3aBemisia tabaci 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3acallose 3ainsects 3ajasmonic acid 3amastication 3amouthparts 3amutants 3aplant hormones 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3atobacco 3atomatoes 3atransgenic plants 3avirus replication 3avirus transmission 3aviruses1 aShu, Yan‐Ni1 aFu, Shuai1 aLiu, Yin‐Quan1 aZhou, Xue‐Ping1 aLiu, Shu‐Sheng1 aWang, Xiao‐Wei0 tnew phytologist.g2017 July, v. 215, no. 2 p.699-710dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.145503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01397naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001600147245006900163500001500232520050200247592002800749650003300777650002000810650002500830650001500855650001000870653001700880773011700897852000901014856008401023655001201107IND4380602520221118062825.0181128s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438060252DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2003-1113-02-RV2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, X.

C–R curve was modeled for xylose, tagatose, erythritol, sucralose, and stevia. Five concentrations of each sweetener corresponding to the sweetness of 1%, 2%, 3.5%, 5%, and 7% sucrose were calculated by the sweetness potency value obtained from a previous study. Three types of sensory evaluation method were compared for their accuracy in modeling the C–R curve. Traditional method measured the sweetness intensities of 5 concentration levels of a specific sweetener in one test set (eg. xylose 1.6%, 3.2%, 5.6%, 7.9%, 11.1%). Hetero sample-equi concentration method measured the sweetness of 6 types of sweeteners having similar sweetness intensity level in one test set (eg. set 1: sucrose 1%, xylose 1.6%, tagatose 1.2%, erythritol 1.7%, sucralose 0.002%, stevia 0.04%; set 2: sucrose 2%, xylose 3.2%, tagatose 2.4%, erythritol 3.3%, sucralose 0.004%, stevia 0.08%, etc.). Sucrose-sweetener combined method measured the sweetness of 5 levels of specific sweetener as well as the 5 levels of sucrose in one test set. All samples were evaluated by 10 trained panelists. Reference standards for sweetness intensities were provided in all methods. To identify the most accurate sensory evaluation protocol, the concentrations of each sweetener corresponding to the sweetness levels of 1.5% and 4.5% sucrose were interpolated from the C–R curve modeled for each sweetener measured by the 3 methods. The actual sweetness intensities of the interpolated concentrations of each sweetener were validated with the sweetness intensities of 1.5% and 4.5% sucrose levels. The result showed that the sucrose-sweetener combined method was the most accurate protocol. Traditional method tended to overestimate the sweetness potency value of sweeteners in low concentration range whereas hetero sample-equi concentration method tended to underestimate the value. Another significant finding was that the sweetness potency value of each sweetener changed as the concentration changed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aerythritol 3amodels 3areference standards 3asensory evaluation 3askim milk 3asucralose 3asucrose 3asweetness 3atagatose 3axylose 0aSweetener 0aConcentration–response curve 0aSweetness potency 0aSensory analysis 0aRating method1 aChung, Seo-jin0 tFood research international.g2014 Aug., v. 62 p.886-893dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245008000215300001600295520144600311592002801757650002101785650001501806650001501821650001901836650001101855650001201866650001401878650000901892650001701901650001001918653001901928653003101947653002501978653001202003653001702015700002402032700001902056700001902075700002602094700006502120773008802185856008502273852000902358655001202367IND60782022220221120151343.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078202222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.06.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrente, Nicholas J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5765-180610aModeling adsorption of simple fluids and hydrocarbons on nanoporous carbons  ap. 526-533.  aPredicting adsorption on nanoporous carbonaceous materials is important for developing various adsorption and membrane separations, as well as for oil and gas recovery from shale reservoirs. Here, we explore the capabilities of 3D molecular models of disordered carbon structures to reproduce the morphological and adsorption features of practical adsorbents.

We show that structure A reproduces the morphological properties of commercial Norit R1 Extra activated carbon and demonstrates outstanding agreement between the simulated and experimental adsorption isotherms reported in the literature for all adsorbates considered. Good agreement is also found for simulated and measured isosteric heats. Taking into account inherent variability of structural properties of commercial carbons and experimental adsorption data from different literature sources, the correlations with experiments are truly amazing. This work provides a new insight into the specifics of structural and adsorption properties of nanoporous carbons and demonstrates the advantages of using 3D molecular models for predicting adsorption hydrocarbons and other chemicals by MC simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3ahexane 3amethane 3ananopores 3aoils 3aporous media 3ashale 0aGas adsorption 0aPore size characterization 0aNanoporous materials 0aCarbons 0aHydrocarbons1 aHinks, Elizabeth L.1 aKasera, Aastha1 aGough, Raleigh1 aRavikovitch, Peter I.1 aNeimark, Alexander V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3443-03890 tCarbon.g2022 Sept., v. 197 p.526-533dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.06.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002500156245011900181300001600300520134600316592002801662650001301690650001501703650001901718650001801737650001701755650002001772650001401792700001801806700002201824700002101846773009401867856009001961990002302051852000902074655001202083IND60095824320221118012142.0141104e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009582432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFredrick, Daniela M.10aElectric field activated combustion synthesis in the Ti+Al system under terrestrial and reduced gravity conditions  ap. 843-852.  aThe electric field-activated combustion reaction between Ti and Al was investigated under terrestrial and microgravity conditions with different ignition modes. Samples were reacted with and without an igniter layer and the effects of pre-ignition heating and convective heat transfer on combustion wave velocity were investigated for both cases. The contribution of these effects relative to the effect of the electric field was found to depend on the strength of the field, being less significant at high applied fields. The threshold level of the electric field for the formation of stable combustion waves was higher under reduced gravity conditions and increased further in the top ignition experiments; these observations were attributed to the decrease of preheating to the sample due to the reduction of gravity driven convection effects. Observations on the distribution of the molten reactant (aluminum) in quenched and self-extinguished samples were analyzed in terms of the contribution of forces of gravity, surface tension, and viscosity through calculations of the Bond (Bo) and Capillary (Ca) numbers. The results showed the dominance of the surface tension contribution even under microgravity conditions. Marangoni flows are influenced by concentration gradients due to differences in the Ti content in the molten aluminum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acombustion 3aelectric field 3aheat transfer 3amicrogravity 3asurface tension 3aviscosity1 aUnuvar, Cosan1 aShaw, Benjamin D.1 aMunir, Zuhair A.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2013 Apr., v. 160, no. 4 p.843-852dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.01.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010500173500001900278520160900297592002801906650001601934650001801950650001601968650001101984650001401995650001302009650001002022650000902032650001602041650000902057650001002066650001002076650001002086653001002096653002102106700001902127700002302146700001802169700001602187700002302203773010602226856008702332852000902419655001202428IND60684174220221116223520.0200509e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068417422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1025362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiquier-Coll, J.10aEffects of exposure to high temperatures on serum, urine and sweat concentrations of iron and copper  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this research was to determine the acute effect of a maximum test until exhaustion in normothermia and hyperthermia, and after repeated exposure to heat at high temperatures on the homeostasis of Fe and Cu.The sample was composed of twenty-nine male university students. The participants were divided into a control group (CG) and an experimental group (EG). All of them underwent an incremental test until exhaustion in normothermia and hyperthermia before and after the repeated exposure of EG to heat at high temperatures, consisting of 9 heat acclimatisation sessions in the sauna. Samples of urine and blood were taken before and after each test. Additionally, sweat samples were collected in the hyperthermia test. The samples were frozen at −80 °C for further analysis by ICP-MS.None of the metal concentrations in serum were affected by hyperthermia or exposure to heat. Urinary Fe increased in CG in the hyperthermia test before Heat exposure at High Temperature (HEHT)(p < 0.05) and in both groups after HEHT (p < 0.05). In EG there was an increase in the urinary excretion of Cu after HEHT (p < 0.01) in both trials. Fe suffered a decrease in sweat in EG after exposure to heat (p < 0.05).The concentrations of Fe and Cu in serum were not affected by acute exercise and exposure to high temperatures. However, there was a decrease in excretion of Fe in sweat due to HEHT, and an increase in urinary excretion in both. Therefore, we think that in conditions of high temperatures for long periods of time, attention should be paid to the body levels of these metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aacute effects 3ablood serum 3acopper 3aexcretion 3aexercise 3afever 3aheat 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3amales 3asweat 3aurine 0aSerum 0aHeat acclimation1 aBartolomé, I.1 aPerez-Quintero, M.1 aGrijota, F.J.1 aMuñoz, D.,1 aMaynar-Mariño, M.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2020 Apr., v. 89 p.102536-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1025363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245017000169520140400339592002801743650001701771650001501788650001301803650003101816650001101847650001001858650002001868650001201888650001501900650001301915650002601928653002501954653001801979653001401997653001202011653001902023700001602042700001502058700001702073700001602090700001802106700001302124700001602137700001202153700001502165700001602180700002002196700001802216700001902234700001902253700001802272773011902290856009002409852000902499655001202508IND60776535620221118220227.0220523e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077653562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2022.1119582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei10aEthylene and polyamines form a negative feedback loop to regulate peach fruit ripening via the transcription factor PpeERF113 by regulating the expression of PpePAO1  aEthylene and polyamines (PAs) have antagonistic roles during fruit ripening. PAs affect both ethylene biosynthetic and signal transduction pathways, but the regulatory effects of ethylene on PA metabolism during fruit ripening have remained largely unknown. Here, we found that ethylene enhanced PA catabolism by regulating expression of a peach PA oxidase gene, PpePAO1. Knocking out PpePAO1 delayed peach fruit ripening, whereas PpePAO1 overexpression promoted tomato fruit ripening. Both in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that an ethylene response factor (ERF), PpeERF113, activated PpePAO1 by direct binding to the promoter. PA levels were significantly increased and ripening was delayed in PpeERF113 knockdown peach fruit. Correspondingly, PA levels were significantly decreased when PpeERF113 was overexpressed in peach. PpeERF113 was also found to be upregulated in PpePAO1 knockdowns, indicating that PA catabolism has a regulatory function in ethylene signal transduction. Together, our results suggest that ethylene accelerates peach fruit ripening in part by promoting PA catabolism through PpeERF113-mediated regulation of PpePAO1 expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report related to the regulatory mechanism of ethylene in PA catabolism during fruit ripening. This study contributes new understanding of the crosstalk between ethylene and PAs during fruit ripening.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3acatabolism 3aethylene 3aethylene signaling pathway 3afruits 3agenes 3aoxidoreductases 3apeaches 3apolyamines 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 0aPolyamine catabolism 0aFeedback loop 0aPpeERF113 0aPpePAO1 0aFruit ripening1 aLiu, Shihao1 aCheng, Xin1 aCui, Zhenguo1 aJiang, Yabo1 aZheng, Xianbo1 aTan, Bin1 aZheng, Run,1 aYe, Xia1 aLi, Jidong1 aLi, Zhiqian1 aZhang, Langlang1 aWang, Xiaobei1 aZhang, Haipeng1 aLian, Xiaodong1 aFeng, Jiancan0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2022 Aug., v. 190 p.111958-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2022.1119583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009300178300001600271520091200287592002801199650001101227650001201238650000901250650003101259650002501290650001601315651001601331653000901347653003101356653001701387653001901404653001701423700001501440700001801455700002501473700002701498700001701525700002301542773011001565856008601675852000901761655001201770IND60543230420221120085521.0190410e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054323042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuck-Pezzei, Verena A.10aAlps food authentication, typicality and intrinsic quality by near infrared spectroscopy  ap. 984-990.  aAlpine agriculture is increasingly pressurized by market liberalization offering huge amounts of cheap produced food stuff. Therefore, it is extremely important pointing out the added value of those products from alpine agriculture and to give confidence to consumers. In the present contribution the efficiency of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for Alps food authentication, typicality and intrinsic quality is assessed, summarized and discussed for three typical products including apple, meat and cheese. The methods developed so far are described in detail and discussed exhaustively. The sample set consisted of well selected and defined 415 apples, 85 meat and 19 cheese samples. Multivariate analytical approaches resulted in the formation of cluster plots giving substantial optimism that this technique will be employed for the non-destructive, fast, cheap and potent identification of Alps food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acheeses 3ameat 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3atrade liberalization 3avalue added 3aAlps region 0aFood 0aNear infrared spectroscopy 0aChemometrics 0aAuthentication 0aTypification1 aSeitz, Ina1 aKarer, Regina1 aSchmutzler, Matthias1 aDe Benedictis, Lorenzo1 aWild, Birgit1 aHuck, Christian W.0 tFood research international.g2014 Aug., v. 62 p.984-990dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009700170520146400267592002801731650001701759650001101776650001301787650002101800650001901821650002801840650001101868650002001879650001501899650001101914650001501925650003201940650001301972650003801985653001502023653000902038653001302047653002702060653001602087653002102103700001502124700001502139700001102154700001402165700001402179700001702193700001402210700001502224700002102239773012002260856009002380852000902470655001202479IND60776535720221118220033.0220621e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077653572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2022.1119592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xuejin10aShort-term high oxygen pre-stimulation inhibits browning of fresh-cut watercored Fuji apples  aIn this study, short-term high oxygen pre-stimulation (SHOP) was used to prevent the browning of fresh-cut watercored Fuji apples. Browning index (BI), relative electrical conductivity, malondialdehyde (MDA), total phenol content (TPC), soluble quinone content (SQC), as well as the multiple enzymes (namely polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL)) were successively investigated to evaluate the anti-browning capacity of SHOP (with oxygen at 21%, 55%, 75%, or 95% as normal, medium, high, and ultra-high levels) for fresh-cut apple. Furthermore, ratio₁ and ratio₂ between POD or CAT and PPO respectively were developed as a potential new parameter to consider the effect of SHOP on the browning-related enzymes. The cellular damage was evaluated by a new cell membrane damage rate approach based on the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images. As a result, the SHOP at 75% and 95% effectively delayed the browning of apple slices, but not at 55%. The POD, CAT, PAL, TPC, ratio₁, and ratio₂ increased after SHOP at 75% and 95%, whereas the PPO and SQC were inhibited. Stored at 4 °C for 10 days, the cell membrane damage rates in non-watercored tissues of SHOP at 75% and 95% were 37.41% and 31.28%, lower than that of SHOP at 21%. The influence of SHOP on active oxygen metabolism of apples, the antioxidant system, and sensory attributes (especially flavor) will be further explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapples 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3acell membranes 3aelectrical conductivity 3aflavor 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3aoxygen 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aquinones 3atransmission electron microscopes 0aWatercored 0aFuji 0aBrowning 0aShort-term stimulation 0aHigh oxygen 0aEnzymatic ratios1 aLiu, Ziyun1 aRan, Yalin1 aLi, Lu1 aChen, Lan1 aLin, Qing1 aLiang, Fuhao1 aLi, Jixin1 aLi, Xihong1 aThong, Chan Kei,0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2022 Sept., v. 191 p.111959-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2022.1119593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245008500195300001800280500002000298520149600318592002801814596008301842596007701925596004802002596006202050596006902112650001102181650002502192650001502217650001302232650001502245651001102260700005602271700005502327700001502382773013102397856007702528852000902605655001202614IND60789620820221121063132.0220822e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078962082DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0122632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Yuqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1732-306310aImpact of mesoscale eddies on Kuroshio intrusion variability northeast of Taiwan  ap. 3021-3040.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAbundant mesoscale eddies propagate to the east of Taiwan and affect the Kuroshio Current and its onshore intrusion northeast of Taiwan. But the dynamical process of how eddy activities modulate the Kuroshio intrusion is still unclear. In this study, in situ ocean velocity observations, drifter trajectories, tide gauge measurements, satellite sea surface height data, and assimilative Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) reanalysis outputs were used to analyze a cyclonic eddy‐induced large Kuroshio onshore intrusion during late autumn 2008. Along with nine anticyclonic eddy events and seven cyclonic eddy events extracted from long‐term HYCOM reanalysis outputs, the variability of the eddy‐induced intrusion was quantified. The impacts of the cyclonic eddy and the anticyclonic eddy were opposite. Under the impact of cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy, the total onshore intrusion between 122°E and 124°E across the 200 m isobaths was decreased (increased) by 15.7% (7.3%), while the onshore intrusion west of 122.6°E and the northeastward current on the outer shelf were increased (decreased) by 30.6% (4.7%) and 31% (10.1%), respectively. The arrival of cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy brought positive (negative) potential vorticity (PV) flux and modulated the local ocean vertical stratification, which weakened (enhanced) the cross‐slope PV gradient and the shelf slope constraint on the upper layer current and, therefore, favored (inhibited) the Kuroshio onshore intrusion.  aPublisher supplied data  a41506021, 41476018, and 41421005cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGASI‐IPOVAI‐01‐06cGlobal Change and Air‐Sea Interaction Project  aXDA11020101cCAS Strategic Priority Project  a2015217cPostdoctoral Applied Research Project of Qingdao  a2013CB956202cChina's National Basic Research Priorities Program 3aautumn 3aenvironmental models 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aTaiwan1 aLin, Xiaopei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6413-44791 aHe, Ruoying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6158-22921 aHou, Yijun0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Apr., v. 122, no. 4 p.3021-3040dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC0122633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04394naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012800166300001400294520260300308592002802911650001702939650002502956650001902981650002403000650001603024650001903040650000903059650001103068650001203079650001603091650001003107650001303117650001503130650001703145650001103162650002103173650002203194650003603216650001503252650001403267650002403281650001503305650001803320650002003338653001003358653002003368653001003388653001503398700001803413700001303431700001903444700001603463700001703479700001603496700001703512700001703529773010503546856008403651852000903735655001203744IND60530700420221119053153.0180905e20160902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053070042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoyu10aiTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis reveals new metabolic pathways responding to chilling stress in maize seedlings  ap. 14-24.  aTo date, transcriptome profile analysis of maize seedlings in response to cold stress have been well documented; however, changes in protein species abundance of maize seedlings in response to cold stress are still unknown. Herein, leaves from the maize inbred line W9816 (a cold-resistance genotype) were harvested at three-leaf stage, and were used to identify the differential abundance protein species (DAPS) between chilling stress (4°C) and control conditions (25°C). iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic were used in this study. As a result, 173 DAPS were identified after chilling stress. Bioinformatic analysis showed that 159 DAPS were annotated in 38 Gene Ontology functional groups, 108 DAPS were classified into 20 clusters of orthologous groups of protein categories, 99 DAPS were enrichment in KEGG pathways. Antioxidants assays validated that the iTRAQ results were reliable. Based on functional analysis, we concluded that the adaptive response of maize seedlings to chilling stress might be related to alleviation of photodamage caused by the over-energized state of thylakoid membrane, more energy produced through glycolysis, increased abundance of stress-responsive protein species, and improvement in the overall ability to scavenge ROS. Posttranscriptional regulation and posttranslational modifications also play important roles for maize to adapt to chilling stress.The major challenge for maize breeders is the complexity of the response to chilling stress. Although extensive researches have been focus on maize chilling stress using segregating populations, epigenetics, transcriptomics, molecular biology, however, the molecular mechanism of chilling stress in maize remains to be further elucidated. In the present paper, a differential proteomic analysis was performed and the results revealed the adaptive response of maize seedlings to chilling stress might be related to alleviation of photodamage caused by the over-energized state of thylakoid membrane, more energy produced through glycolysis, increased abundance of stress-responsive protein species, improvement in the overall ability to scavenge ROS, including detoxifying enzymes and antioxidants. Posttranscriptional regulation and posttranslational modifications also play important roles for maize to adapt to chilling stress. This approach identified new protein species involved in posttranslational modifications, signal transduction, lipid metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism and other biological processes that were not previously known to be associated with chilling stress response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3acold shock response 3acold stress 3acold treatment 3acorn 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3agenotype 3aglycolysis 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3alipid metabolism 3amolecular biology 3apost-translational modification 3aproteomics 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 3athylakoids 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aMaize 0aChilling stress 0aiTRAQ 0aProteomics1 aShan, Xiaohui1 aWu, Ying1 aSu, Shengzhong1 aLi, Shipeng1 aLiu, Hongkui1 aHan, Junyou1 aXue, Chunmei1 aYuan, Yaping0 tJournal of proteomics.g2016 Sept. 02, v. 146 p.14-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01741naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245004700201300001800248500002000266520072800286592002801014596002101042650001501063650001801078650001301096650001101109650001901120650001301139650001501152650001901167773013101186856007701317852000901394655001201403IND60789620920221121063123.0220822e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078962092DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0129612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDohan, Kathleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0032-290210aOcean surface currents from satellite data  ap. 2647-2651.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe atmosphere drives entire ocean motions, and yet the exchange of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean occurs in the thin layer where they meet, involving the smallest scales of turbulence.

In this paper, a new “turn-off” model based on carbon dots (CDs) from black tea was established to analyze the two kinds of bisphosphonate drugs, pamidronate disodium and zoledronic acid. Through the new sensor, both of drugs can be quantitative, respectively, with the limit of detection of 5 × 10⁻⁹ mol·L⁻¹ and 6 × 10⁻⁹ mol·L⁻¹. In addition, the fluorescence of newly prepared CDs can be quenched by two drugs with various degrees via photoinduced electron transfer, which can be perfectly used to distinguish them. Most importantly, this turn-off method has been employed to analyze the two drugs under the influence of foreign interference factors. This method provides a new view and guidance for the rapid analysis and recognition of drugs for bone metastases in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data  a12JCYBJC16400cNatural Science Foundation of Tianjin City  a15KG124 12KG121cTianjin Municipal Health Bureau Fund Project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablack tea 3acarbon quantum dots 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3ametastasis 3amodels 3arapid methods1 aHu, Yongcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9559-76360 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2018 Mar. 13, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/36312493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245009200166300001600258500002000274520136000294592002801654596008901682596008901771596004601860596004601906650002701952650001701979650001401996650001002010650001602020650001302036650001602049650001702065650001202082700004102094700002802135700002002163700006002183773011402243856007402357852000902431655001202440IND60795300720221118002830.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079530072DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.159292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarquez‐Molins, Joan12aA circular RNA vector for targeted plant gene silencing based on an asymptomatic viroid  ap. 284-293.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGene silencing for functional studies in plants has been largely facilitated by manipulating viral genomes with inserts from host genes to trigger virus‐induced gene silencing (VIGS) against the corresponding mRNAs. However, viral genomes encode multiple proteins and can disrupt plant homeostasis by interfering with endogenous cell mechanisms. To try to circumvent this functional limitation, we have developed a silencing method based on the minimal autonomously‐infectious nucleic acids currently known: viroids, which lack proven coding capability. The genome of Eggplant latent viroid, an asymptomatic viroid, was manipulated with insertions ranging between 21 and 42 nucleotides. Our results show that, although larger insertions might be tolerated, the maintenance of the secondary structure appears to be critical for viroid genome stability. Remarkably, these modified ELVd molecules are able to induce systemic infection promoting the silencing of target genes in eggplant. Inspired by the design of artificial microRNAs, we have developed a simple and standardized procedure to generate stable insertions into the ELVd genome capable of silencing a specific target gene. Analogously to VIGS, we have termed our approach viroid‐induced gene silencing, and demonstrate that it is a promising tool for dissecting gene functions in eggplant.  aPublisher supplied data  aPID2019‐104126RB‐I00cAgencia Estatal de Investigacion (co‐supported by FEDER)  aPID2020‐115571RB‐I00cAgencia Estatal de Investigacion (co‐supported by FEDER)  aACIF‐2017‐114cGeneralitat Valenciana  aACIF‐2021‐202cGeneralitat Valenciana 3aEggplant latent viroid 3acircular RNA 3aeggplants 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3amicroRNA 3anucleotides 3aviral genome 3aviroids1 aHernandez‐Azurdia, Andrea Gabriela1 aUrrutia‐Perez, María1 aPallas, Vicente1 aGómez, Gustavo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3715-77920 tplant journal.g2022 Oct., v. 112, no. 1 p.284-293dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.159293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245018400173300001400357520177500371592002802146650001502174650002702189650001102216650003002227650000902257650001402266650001202280650001602292650001202308650003102320650001402351650001602365650001502381650001602396650002002412650001602432651001402448653002102462653002002483653001502503700002102518700001502539700002602554700002502580773011202605856008502717852000902802655001202811IND60743033920221121034048.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074303392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSupartha, I.

The studies were carried out at the Laboratory of Integrated Pest Management (IPMLab), Faculty of Agriculture Udayana University in Denpasar and Greenhouse Owned-Farmer in Pancasari Buleleng, Bali (1200 m asl; average temperature 23.67 ± 5.69 °C and average RH of 64 ± 17.69%). The results showed that G. micromorpha has a strong preference towards the 3rd instar larvae of L. huidobrensis. The pre-oviposition period was 0.4 ± 0.67ᵈ, oviposition was 12.5 ± 2.0ᵈ and post-oviposition period was 1 ± 0.0ᵈ while the peak oviposition occurred on the 4th day. Meanwhile, all the offsprings produced were females which indicated that parthenogenesis thelytokous was present in G. Micromorpha and the fecundity was 29 ± 3.77 per female adult. Furthermore, the average life span for the adult was 13 ± 1.42 days with an oviposition period of 12.5 ± 2.01 days. The average post-oviposition period was 1 ± 0.0 days and average development period of egg to adult was 32.03 ± 0.98 days. Meanwhile, the breeding potential was high with an average daily percentage of 2.27 ± 0.27 fecundity and a maximum spawning occurred on day 4. The functional response was type-2 and it is the rate at which parasitism increase with increase in population of the host density. Hence, the biological characteristics and mode of functional response by the parasitoid showed its potential as a biological pesticide for pea leafminer L. huidobrensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucoilidae 3aLiriomyza huidobrensis 3aadults 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3agreenhouses 3ainstars 3aintegrated pest management 3alongevity 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aparthenogenesis 3atemperature 3aIndonesia 0aBiocontrol agent 0aCrop protection 0aParasitoid1 aSusila, I Wayan,1 aYoḥanes,1 aYudha, I.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), many of which are diet-related, account for 70% of mortality in Europe and a growing share of healthcare costs. While eating habits have an important role to play in NCD prevention, consumption patterns across the EU are diverging significantly from recommended diets. There is growing consensus on the solution: a series of coordinated and wide-ranging policy interventions to build healthy ‘food environments’.This article argues that EU governance structures remain ill-adapted to the systemic nature of this and other challenges in food systems (e.g. climate change, biodiversity loss, food poverty): conflicting objectives and missed synergies are identified between different policy areas (agriculture, trade, health, environment, etc.) and between different levels of governance (EU, national, local). An integrated food policy framework – a ‘Common Food Policy’ – is therefore required to meet the EU’s public health and sustainability objectives. It identifies four distinct aspects of the governance shift required to promote healthy diets and build sustainable food systems in Europe: (i) coherence across policy areas; (ii) coherence across governance levels; (iii) governance for transition; and (iv) food democracy. Blueprints for a Common Food Policy are already emerging, and are ripe for consideration, development, and implementation by the European institutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3afood policy 3agovernance 3amortality 3aoverweight 3apoverty 3atrade 3aEurope 0aPolicy integration 0aCommon food policy 0aFood and agriculture 0aHealth1 aJacobs, Nick1 aClement, Chantal,0 tFood policy.g2020 Oct., v. 96 p.101849-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2020.1018493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001500183245011600198506007600314520152700390592002801917506003701945650002101982650001502003650003102018650002102049650002902070650002602099650001202125650001102137650002102148650001102169650002402180650001902204650001902223650001402242650002202256650002802278650005202306650002302358700002002381700002102401700005802422700005902480700005602539773009002595856007702685852000902762655001202771IND60624007920221207095721.0181203e20180131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062400792DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/37597042doi7 aPMC58319202pmcid7 a296667082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Rahul10aNonphotodynamic Roles of Methylene Blue: Display of Distinct Antimycobacterial and Anticandidal Mode of Actions  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSignificance of methylene blue (MB) in photodynamic therapy against microbes is well established. Previously, we have reported the antifungal potential of MB against Candida albicans. The present study attempts to identify additional antimicrobial effect of MB against another prevalent human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). We explored that MB is efficiently inhibiting the growth of Mycobacterium at 15.62 μg/ml albeit in bacteriostatic manner similar to its fungistatic nature. We uncovered additional cell surface phenotypes (colony morphology and cell sedimentation rate) which were impaired only in Mycobacterium. Mechanistic insights revealed that MB causes energy dependent membrane perturbation in both C. albicans and Mycobacterium. We also confirmed that MB leads to enhanced reactive oxygen species generation in both organisms that could be reversed upon antioxidant supplementation; however, DNA damage could only be observed in Mycobacterium. We provided evidence that although biofilm formation was disrupted in both organisms, cell adherence to human epithelial cells was inhibited only in Mycobacterium. Lastly, RT-PCR results showed good correlation with the biochemical assay. Together, apart from the well-established role of MB in photodynamic therapy, this study provides insights into the distinct antimicrobial mode of actions in two significant human pathogens, Candida and Mycobacterium, which can be extrapolated to improve our understanding of finding novel therapeutic options.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aDNA damage 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3abiofilm 3aenergy 3aepithelial cells 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amethylene blue 3amicroorganisms 3aphenotype 3aphotochemotherapy 3areactive oxygen species 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asedimentation rate1 aAnsari, Moiz A.1 aSaibabu, Venkata1 aDas, Shrayanee1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0529-89021 aFatima, Zeeshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5084-44501 aHameed, Saif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6477-18700 tJournal of pathogens.g2018 Jan. 31, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:21571x2090-30657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/37597043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245006600159520089600225592002801121650004401149650002201193650001601215650002301231650001901254650001901273650002201292650001201314650001201326650001401338650001401352650001601366653001901382653002201401653001401423653003201437700001801469700002101487700001901508700001201527773012401539856008301663852000901746655001201755IND60695371820221121234629.0201202e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069537182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ya10aThermal treatment of Shengli lignite and subsequent oxidation  aShengli lignite (SL) was thermally treated at 150 °C–650 °C. SL and each residue (RTT) from the thermal treatment (TT) were oxidized using aqueous hydrogen peroxide (AHPO)/acetic acid (AA) to afford a soluble portion (SP). SL and each RTT were characterized with a X-ray diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and 11 typical benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCAsᴵ) in the SPs were analyzed with a high-performance liquid chromatograph. The results show that the condensation degree (CDARₛ) of aromatic rings (ARs) in each RTT is higher than that of SL and increases with raising the TT temperature, while the oxidation of a RTT resulting from lower-temperature TT produces BPCAsᴵ, especially mellitic acid, in higher yields. HOO· produced in AHPO/AA could play an crucial role in oxidizing AR-containing macromolecular species in SL and each RTT to BPCAsᴵ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetic acid 3aaromatic compounds 3achromatography 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alignite 3aliquids 3aoxidation 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aShenli lignite 0aThermal treatment 0aOxidation 0aBenzenepolycarboxylic acids1 aZong, Zhi-Min1 aZhang, Yang-Yang1 aWei, Xian-Yong1 aZhu, Yu0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2020 Nov., v. 152 p.104810-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012200168300001800290520104300308592002801351596009801379596007701477596009401554596008201648596008401730596009501814650002801909650002201937650001101959650001401970700001501984700001701999700001802016700005502034700001202089700001702101700005302118773011302171856008502284852000902369655001202378IND60778889220221121232539.0220601e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077888922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c007922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Guangwu10aEmbedding SnO₂ Thin Shell Protected Ag Nanowires in SnO₂ ETL to Enhance the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 6752-6760.  aThe energy level mismatching between SnO₂ and perovskite and the nonradiative recombination at SnO₂-perovskite interface severely degrade the extraction of carriers, reducing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on SnO₂ electron transfer layer (ETL). In the present work, a reinforced SnO₂ ETL was successfully developed by embedding SnO₂ thin shell protected Ag nanowires (Ag/SnO₂ NWs) in traditional planar SnO₂ film, which was proved to not only lower the conduction band of SnO₂ to adjust the energy level matching, but also significantly reduce the interfacial carrier recombination. Moreover, Ag/SnO₂ NWs improved the electrical conductivity of SnO₂ ETL, and effectively promoted carrier transport. Benefiting from the use of Ag/SnO₂ NWs, our newly designed PSC achieved a significantly increased champion PCE of 19.78%, which is 7% higher than the traditional PSC without Ag/SnO₂ NWs embedding, indicating its great application potential in PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data  a21403302cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a19-6-2-20-cgcQingdao Applied Basic Research Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA  a22133006cKey Program of National Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/NA  ats201712019cTaishan Scholar program of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA  atsnq201909069cTaishan Scholar program of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA  aYKKJ2019AJ05JG-R60cYankuang Group 2019 Science and Technology Programdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3ananowires1 aLi, Xinmei1 aZhao, Baohua1 aLiu, Chengben1 aZhang, Teng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6555-91771 aLi, Zhi1 aLiu, Zhaobin1 aLi, Xiyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2548-20530 tLangmuir.g2022 May 20, v. 38, no. 21 p.6752-6760dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c007923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005100152245008300203300001800286520110400304592002801408650004401436650001501480650001601495650002201511650001501533650003101548650002901579650001301608650001901621650001901640650000701659650003401666650003301700650001601733653002201749653001601771653001301787653001501800653001501815700001501830700001201845700001701857700002001874700001901894773013401913856008702047852000902134655001202143IND60619153820221119055901.0190606e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061915382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8696-738010aMineralized calcium carbonate/xanthan gum microspheres for lysozyme adsorption  ap. 2175-2179.  aCalcium carbonate/xanthan gum (Ca2CO3/XG) microspheres were prepared using biomimetic mineralization method for lysozyme (Ly) adsorption. The morphology of Ca2CO3/XG microspheres was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The Ly adsorption behavior was verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and in situ fluorescence microscope images. The effects of pHs on lysozyme adsorption were investigated as well. It was revealed that CaCO3/XG microspheres could immobilize lysozyme efficiently via electrostatic interactions with adsorption rate and adsorption quantity of 58.55 ± 0.56% and 18.7 ± 1.2 μg/mg as the pH was 7.0. Comparatively, the values markedly improved to 80.97 ± 0.15% and 24.3 ± 0.1 μg/mg respectively as the pH was 9.0 (p < 0.05). Additionally, UV and fluorescence spectrum showed that Ly maintained its original secondary structure during the adsorption/desorption process. The study therefore demonstrated that CaCO3/XG microspheres can be used as a practical and efficient support for Ly adsorption and desorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abiomimetics 3acalcium carbonate 3adesorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence microscopes 3alysozyme 3amicroparticles 3amineralization 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3axanthan gum 0aCalcium carbonate 0aXanthan gum 0aLysozyme 0aAdsorption 0aDesorption1 aLou, Yucui1 aXu, Bin1 aLi, Yingying1 aXiong, YongZhao1 aJing, Junxiang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Dec., v. 120 p.2175-2179dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245021400166520122400380592002801604650001801632650003001650650001001680650000801690650001501698650000901713650000901722650000901731650001501740650001501755650001901770650002101789650001901810650004801829650001201877650001501889653002101904653002301925653001301948700001801961700001901979773011701998856008502115852000902200655001202209IND60743034220221121013843.0210812e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074303422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1017712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuu, Aya10aSeroprevalence of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus in animals in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, and development of Gaussia luciferase immunoprecipitation system to detect specific IgG antibodies  aWe conducted a seroprevalence investigation of the healthy population of animals in Kagoshima Prefecture, an area in which severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is endemic. Of 104 domestic cat and 114 dog samples, 2 (1.9%) and 11 (9.6%) were positive for anti-SFTS virus (SFTSV) IgG by indirect ELISA, respectively. Viral RNA was detected in one dog (0.9%) by RT-PCR. Of the 102 wild boar (Sus scrofa) and 107 deer (Cervus nippon) samples tested, 55 (53.9%) and 37 (34.7%) were positive for anti-SFTSV IgG, respectively. Only one wild boar (1.0%) was positive for viral RNA. Although symptomatic SFTSV infections in domestic cats have increased in this area, the seroprevalence of the healthy population of domestic cats tends to be lower than those of other animals. We developed a Gaussia luciferase immunoprecipitation system (GLIPS) using mammalian cells expressing a recombinant SFTSV nucleoprotein (SFTSV-rNP) for the detection of SFTSV-specific antibodies in samples from various animal species. The sensitivity of the assay was highly consistent with that of indirect ELISA, indicating that it could serve as a useful tool for a large-scale surveillance of SFTSV across multiple species of animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus nippon 3aHuaiyangshan banyangvirus 3aJapan 3aRNA 3aSus scrofa 3acats 3adeer 3adogs 3aluciferase 3amonitoring 3anucleoproteins 3aprecipitin tests 3aseroprevalence 3asevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome 3aviruses 3awild boars 0aCompanion animal 0aGaussia luciferase 0aWildlife1 aHamakubo, Emu1 aYabuki, Mihoko0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2021 Sept., v. 12, no. 5 p.101771-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1017713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06632naa a2201861 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003900149245015800188300001400346520244600360592002802806650002602834650001802860650002502878650001502903650001302918650002502931650002802956650001002984650001902994650001803013650002403031650004303055650001103098650001703109650001803126650001203144650001303156650001403169650001303183650001503196650001403211650002003225650001503245650003203260653000803292653000803300653000903308653000803317653000803325653001103333653000903344653000803353653000903361653000903370653000803379653000803387653000903395653001003404653000903414653001203423653000803435653000903443653001003452653000903462653001103471653000903482653001003491653000903501653000803510653001203518653000703530653000903537653000903546653001003555653001003565653000803575653000803583653001003591653000803601653000803609653000803617653001303625653000903638653000903647653000803656653000803664653000903672653000803681653000803689653000803697653000903705653000803714653001003722653000903732653001103741653000803752653000903760653001003769653000803779653001403787653001103801653001103812653001103823653001203834653000803846653001103854653000803865653000803873653000803881653001103889653000903900653000703909653000803916653000703924653000803931653001103939653000803950653000803958653001003966653000803976653001003984653001103994653000804005653000804013653000804021653000804029653000804037653000904045653000804054653001004062653001104072653001004083653000904093653000904102653001004111653000804121653001204129653001404141653000804155653000904163653000704172653000804179653000704187653000804194653001004202653002604212653002604238653001804264653002604282700003204308700003804340700002204378700004504400700002304445700002404468700001904492700002204511700002804533773010404561856008404665852000904749655001204758IND60530700920221119053426.0180905e20170116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053070092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeves, Gabriela Westerlund Peixoto10aModifications to the composition of the hyphal outer layer of Aspergillus fumigatus modulates HUVEC proteins related to inflammatory and stress responses  ap. 83-96.  aAspergillus fumigatus, the main etiologic agent causing invasive aspergillosis, can induce an inflammatory response and a prothrombotic phenotype upon contact with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). However, the fungal molecules involved in this endothelial response remain unknown. A. fumigatus hyphae produce an extracellular matrix composed of galactomannan, galactosaminogalactan and α-(1,3)-glucan. In this study, we investigated the consequences of UGM1 gene deletion in A. fumigatus, which produces a mutant with increased galactosaminogalactan production. The ∆ugm1 mutant exhibited an HUVEC-hyperadhesive phenotype and induced increased endothelial TNF-α secretion and tissue factor mRNA overexpression in this “semi-professional” immune host cell. Using a shotgun proteomics approach, we show that the A. fumigatus ∆ugm1 strain can modulate the levels of proteins in important endothelial pathways related to the inflammatory response mediated by TNF-α and to stress response pathways. Furthermore, a purified galactosaminogalactan fraction was also able to induce TNF-α secretion and the coincident HUVEC pathways regulated by the ∆ugm1 mutant, which overexpresses this component, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. This work contributes new data regarding endothelial mechanisms in response to A. fumigatus infection.Invasive aspergillosis is the main opportunistic fungal infection described in neutropenic hematologic patients. One important clinical aspect of this invasive fungal infection is vascular thrombosis, which could be related, at least in part, to the activation of endothelial cells, as shown in previous reports from our group. It is known that direct contact between the A. fumigatus hyphal cell wall and the HUVEC cell surface is necessary to induce an endothelial prothrombotic phenotype and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, though the cell surface components of this angioinvasive fungus that trigger this endothelial response are unknown. The present work employs a discovery-driven proteomics approach to reveal the role of one important cell wall polysaccharide of A. fumigatus, galactosaminogalactan, in the HUVEC interaction and the consequent mechanisms of endothelial activation. This is the first report of the overall panel of proteins related to the HUVEC response to a specific and purified cell wall component of the angioinvasive fungus A. fumigatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aaspergillosis 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aetiology 3aextracellular matrix 3afluorescence microscopy 3afungi 3agalactomannans 3agene deletion 3agene overexpression 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahyphae 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asecretion 3astress response 3athrombosis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAiP 0aAKT 0aASK1 0aBAD 0aBAX 0aCD-142 0acFOS 0aCID 0acJUN 0aCRAF 0aDAG 0aECM 0aEIF2 0aELISA 0aELK1 0aERK 1/2 0aFDR 0aFWHM 0aFOX01 0aGalf 0aGalNAc 0aGalp 0aGAPDH 0aGFAP 0aGAG 0aGlu-Fib 0aGO 0aGRB2 0aHDMS 0aHDMSE 0aHMGB1 0aHPF 0aHsp 0aHUVEC 0aIAA 0aIAP 0aIgG 0aI-kappaB 0aIL-6 0aIL-8 0aILK 0aIPA 0aIRF3 0aJNK 0akDa 0aLBL 0aLKB1 0aLPS 0aM-199 0aMAPK 0aMEK1/2 0aMSE 0amTOR 0aMyD88 0aNAF 0aNF-kappaB 0aNF-κB 0aoa-TOF 0aP13K-1 0aP27KIP1 0aP73 0ap90RSK 0aPI3 0aPKC 0aPLC 0aPRAS40 0apyrG 0aRF 0aRNA 0aRP 0aRTK 0aRT-PCR 0aSBL 0aSEM 0aSNCα 0aSRC 0aSRPK2 0aSTRADA 0aTAU 0aTFG 0aTh1 0aTh2 0aTLR 0aTLR4 0aTNF 0aTNFR1 0aTNF-α 0aTRAF2 0aTreg 0aTRIF 0aTRITC 0aTSC 0aTUBULIN 0aT-Wave™ 0aUDP 0aUPLC 0aUR 0aVIM 0aWT 0aYAP 0aHUVEC 0aAspergillus fumigatus 0aInflammatory response 0aΔugm1 mutant 0aGalactosaminogalactan1 aCurty, Nathália de Andrade1 aKubitschek-Barreira, Paula Helena1 aFontaine, Thierry1 aSouza, Gustavo Henrique Martins Ferreira1 aCunha, Marcel Lyra1 aGoldman, Gustavo H.1 aBeauvais, Anne1 aLatgé, Jean-Paul1 aLopes-Bezerra, Leila M.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2017 Jan. 16, v. 151 p.83-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012700177300001800304520144000322592002801762650004401790650001401834650001601848650003601864650002401900650002201924650001001946650002201956650002201978650001702000650002002017650001102037650001902048650001502067650001302082650002402095650001602119650001402135650001302149650003702162653001702199653002002216653002002236653002502256653001902281700002002300700002002320700001802340700002202358773013402380856008702514852000902601655001202610IND60619153920221119055801.0190606e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061915392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.08.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZia, Mohammad Khalid10aExploring the interaction of anti-androgen drug-bicalutamide with human alpha-2-macroglobulin: A biophysical investigation  ap. 2285-2292.  aBicalutamide (BCT), a drug used in the treatment of prostate cancer, antagonises the actions of androgens, at the receptor level, thereby inhibiting the growth of prostate tumours. Alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M), a pan-proteinase inhibitor, inhibits proteinase, regardless of specificity and catalytic mechanism. α2M is deficient in patients of advanced prostate cancer with bone metastases. Our studies explored the interaction of BCT with α2M and analysed the BCT induced structural alteration to the α2M. The result suggests that BCT decreases the antiproteolytic potential and causes structural and functional change in human α2M. UV–visible absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of α2M-BCT complex. Fluorescence analysis shows significant quenching in fluorescence intensity of α2M upon binding with BCT. Synchronous fluorescence result suggests the interaction of BCT with α2M changed the microenvironment around tyrosine residues. Secondary structure of α2M also undergoes a slight change upon complexation with the drug as evident by shift in negative ellipticity in far UV CD spectroscopy. FTIR results confirm the alteration in secondary structure of α2M upon drug interaction. Molecular docking studies show that BCT bind to a monomer of α2M primarily through hydrophobic force. Thermodynamics parameters were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry found that the binding was exothermic in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aandrogens 3acalorimetry 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomputer simulation 3adrug interactions 3adrugs 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afluorescence 3aheat production 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3ametastasis 3apatients 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aproteinases 3atitration 3atyrosine 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aBicalutamide 0aAnticancer drug 0aProstate cancer 0aAlpha-2-acroglobulin 0aAntiproteinase1 aSiddiqui, Tooba1 aAli, Syed Saqib1 aAhsan, Haseeb1 aKhan, Fahim Halim0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Dec., v. 120 p.2285-2292dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.08.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01604naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245004500211300001600256520079300272592002801065650002101093650001501114650002401129773010401153856008401257852000901341655001201350IND60782023120221120131357.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078202312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2022.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeiman, Maxwell G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2557-649010aWhen is a neuron like an epithelial cell  ap. 161-164.  aNeurons and epithelia are viewed as fundamentally different cell types, yet some sensory neurons exhibit hallmarks of epithelial cells. For example, they use tight junctions to form a diffusion barrier continuous with the skin or other epithelia and they exhibit bona fide apical-basal polarity, with an outward-facing apical surface that is biochemically and functionally distinct from their inward-facing basolateral surface. Yet they are unmistakeably neurons with axon-dendrite polarity. Examples include olfactory receptor neurons and photoreceptors. In this review, I highlight how viewing these neurons as specialized epithelial cells informs our understanding of their development and raises intriguing questions about the establishment of apical-basal and axon-dendrite polarity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aolfactory receptors0 tDevelopmental biology.g2022 Sept., v. 489 p.161-164dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2022.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01741naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245004500166520084300211592002801054650001701082650001601099650002101115650002301136650001501159650001901174650001601193650002001209773011701229852000901346856008401355655001201439IND4380602820221118062741.0181128s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438060282DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2003-1113-05-RV2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Gareth14aThe Maximum Pest Limit Concept Explained  aThe maximum pest limit (MPL) concept was developed as a practical method of implementing quarantine security measures against the import of invasive pest species of plants. The MPL itself is simply a threshold upper limit, above which the pest species in question is deemed capable of establishing a population if imported in a consignment of fruit or vegetables. This limit depends on various biological and ecological characteristics of the pest species in question. Important aspects of implementation relate to how treatment and sampling may be combined to reduce the probability that the MPL will be exceeded. If a specified level of treatment efficacy is required (for example, probit nine level), then choice of an appropriate sample size becomes the main problem for regulatory authorities seeking to maintain quarantine security.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3ainvasive species 3aintroduced species 3aquarantine 3ainsect control 3afruit crops 3avegetable crops0 tPlant health progress.g2003, v. 4, no. 1dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2003-1113-05-RV3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02577naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011300162300001600275500002000291520134300311592002801654650002201682650001701704650002301721650000901744650001101753650001201764650001401776650001001790651001001800651001801810700002501828700002101853700002201874700006001896773014101956856007302097852000902170655001202179IND60747821020221116231130.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074782102DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.130752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulgarini, Giacomo10aSearching for new predators of the invasive Halyomorpha halys: the role of the black garden ant Lasius niger  ap. 799-806.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn recent years, Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae, Cappaeini) has become an invasive pest in North America and Europe, where it caused extensive damage to agriculture, resulting in great economic losses. Evaluating the potential of native predators in the invaded areas, ants might represent good candidates thanks to their biology, ecology, and behavior. In Italy, H. halys proved to be the top key pest in pear orchards, where the black garden ant, Lasius niger (L.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae, Lasiini), is the most abundant ant species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predatory ability of L. niger on the eggs and on all the juvenile instars of H. halys under laboratory conditions. The results indicate that L. niger significantly reduces the survival of the second and third nymphal instars by 56 and 58%, respectively, but it is unable to reduce the egg hatching and the survival of the first, fourth, and fifth instars. Our preliminary results obtained in laboratory conditions suggest a possible role of the ant L. niger in controlling H. halys invasion mainly acting on the smaller and more mobile nymphal stages. The effective role of this species as potential biocontrol agents of H. halys in fruit orchards in association with other ant species as well as with other predatory insects is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalyomorpha halys 3aLasius niger 3abiological control 3aeggs 3afruits 3ainstars 3ajuveniles 3apears 3aItaly 3aNorth America1 aCastracani, Cristina1 aMori, Alessandra1 aGrasso, Donato A.1 aMaistrello, Lara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2996-89930 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2021 Sept., v. 169, no. 9 p.799-806dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.130753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245010800173500001400281520185200295592002802147650002202175650001702197650001502214650002002229650001602249650001702265650002002282650001302302650001702315650001202332650001102344650001602355650000902371650000902380650001602389650002002405650003302425650002002458650001202478650001702490653001702507653002102524653002402545700005802569700002702627700001702654773010502671856009002776852000902866655001202875IND60707411820221121022915.0201209e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070741182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1278662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelliti, Emna10aEffect of Fe2+ ions on gypsum precipitation during bulk crystallization of reverse osmosis concentrates  aNAL-light  aIn reverse osmosis desalination, the concentrate is a saline solution that may become supersaturated. Heterogeneous nucleation of salts occurs at the membrane surface, resulting in the buildup of inorganic deposits on the membrane. The inorganic nucleation process, however, is complex in natural waters. Most studies focused primarily on single salt fouling of membranes, and related treatment for single solute systems. However, scale formation, especially gypsum, is affected by the presence of different salts and metals. In this wok, for the first time, we investigate the mixed precipitation of iron oxides and gypsum. The role of citric acid in the inhibition of precipitation was studied for different concentrations in both the absence and the presence of Fe²⁺. Conductivity and ion concentration measurements were used to estimate the formation time of gypsum. Scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XDR) analysis, and Infra-Red spectroscopy analysis were used to provide structural information. Collected data showed that the presence of Fe²⁺ accelerates gypsum precipitation and shortens its induction time. Analytic results showed that gypsum crystals are greatly affected by the presence of Fe²⁺ ions, which generated needle shaped crystals. Citric acid can delay the induction time of gypsum precipitation. It also affects the morphology of gypsum crystals through adsorption mechanism. XDR diagrams revealed that the presence of citric acid (20 mg/L) can stabilize the bassanite phase (CaSO₄·½H₂O) for much longer periods. In the presence of Fe²⁺ ions, citric acid extends the induction time of calcium sulfate and minimizes the acceleration effect of Fe²⁺ ions. SEM images showed that the presence of ferrous ions during the chemical inhibition generates the β-hemihydrate form of calcium sulfate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacceleration 3aadsorption 3acalcium sulfate 3acitric acid 3aconcentrates 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adesalination 3afouling 3agypsum 3ainformation 3aions 3airon 3airon oxides 3areverse osmosis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3aspectroscopy 0aFerrous ions 0aCo-precipitation 0aChemical inhibition1 aTouati, Khaled1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8546-21961 aBruggen, Bart van der,1 aElfil, Hamza0 tChemosphere.g2021 Jan., v. 263 p.127866-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1278663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03799naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008200167300001400249520237900263592002802642650001202670650001302682650002802695650002002723650002602743650001202769650002402781650001602805650001302821650001302834650001502847650002502862650001802887650001302905653002102918653000902939653001102948653001802959653001302977700001702990700001103007700001703018700001903035700001603054700001403070773010403084856008403188852000903272655001203281IND60530701020221119052917.0180905e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053070102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Chuan-li10aIn-depth proteomic analysis of the byssus from marine mussel Mytilus coruscus  ap. 87-98.  aMussels attach to various submerged surfaces by using the byssus, which contains different proteins and is a promising source of water-resistant bio-adhesives for potential use in biotechnological and medical applications. The protein composition of the byssus has not yet been fully understood although at least eleven byssal proteins were characterized previously. In order to increase genomic resources and identify new byssal proteins from mussel Mytilus coruscus, high-throughput Illumina sequencing was undertaken on the foot, and 79,997,776 paired-ends reads were generated, yielding a library containing 88,825ft unigenes. The M. coruscus byssus was divided into three parts, the proximal thread, the distal thread, and the plaque. Byssal proteins from each part of the byssus were analyzed by shotgun-LTQ analysis. The MS/MS spectra were searched against the foot unigenes dataset and 48 byssal proteins were identified from the M. coruscus byssus. From the whole set, 17, 5, and 11 proteins were exclusive to the proximal thread, the distal thread, and the plaque, respectively. These data can be used as a resource for further studies on the roles of byssal proteins in the deposition of different byssus parts (thread vs. plaque) or in the different mechanical properties (tenacity vs. adhesion).Byssal proteins are the major component that controls different aspects of the byssal formation process and thus a source of bioactive molecules that would offer interesting perspectives in biomaterials and bio-adhesive fields. In this paper, we characterized the protein set from different partsof Mytilus coruscus byssus by a combination of transcriptome/proteome technical. A whole set of 48 byssal proteins were described here, including proteins of collagen-like, C1q domain-containing, protease inhibitor-like, tyrosinase-like, SOD, and others. Thread (the distal portion and the proximal portion) and plaque showed distinct protein composition. Of the whole byssal protein set, 11 are exclusive to the plaque, 17 are exclusive to the proximal thread, and 5 are exclusive to the distal thread. Only four proteins are shared by all the three parts of the byssus. The new byssal proteins reported here represent a significant expansion of the knowledge base of Mytilus byssal proteins, and are important for further exploring the mechanism of adhesion in mussel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus 3aadhesion 3abiocompatible materials 3adata collection 3amechanical properties 3amussels 3aprotein composition 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 0aMytilus coruscus 0afoot 0abyssus 0atranscriptome 0aproteome1 aPan, Qi-dong1 aQi, Qi1 aFan, Meihua,1 aSun, Jing-jing1 aLi, Nan-nan1 aLiao, Zhi0 tJournal of proteomics.g2016 July 20, v. 144 p.87-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012200153300001600275500002000291520135900311592002801670650002101698650002901719650002601748650002801774650001201802650001301814650002401827650001001851650001701861650003301878650002201911650001101933650001701944650001101961650000901972650001201981650001401993650001302007650000902020700001702029700001602046700001402062700002102076700001702097773011602114856007302230852000902303655001202312IND60587353620221121100601.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058735362DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.146222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huan10aHeavy metal ATPase 3 (HMA3) confers cadmium hypertolerance on the cadmium/zinc hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola  ap. 687-698.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCadmium (Cd) is highly toxic to most organisms, but some rare plant species can hyperaccumulate Cd in aboveground tissues without suffering from toxicity. The mechanism underlying Cd detoxification by hyperaccumulators is interesting but unclear. Here, the heavy metal ATPase 3 (SpHMA3) gene responsible for Cd detoxification was isolated from the Cd/zinc (Zn) hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola. RNA interference (RNAi)‐mediated silencing and overexpression of SpHMA3 were induced to investigate its physiological functions in S. plumbizincicola and a nonhyperaccumulating ecotype of Sedum alfredii. Heterologous expression of SpHMA3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed Cd‐specific transport activity. SpHMA3 was highly expressed in the shoots and the protein was localized to the tonoplast. The SpHMA3‐RNAi lines were hypersensitive to Cd but not to Zn, with the growth of shoots and young leaves being severely inhibited by Cd. Overexpressing SpHMA3 in the nonhyperaccumulating ecotype of S. alfredii greatly increased its tolerance to and accumulation of Cd, but not Zn. These results indicate that elevated expression of the tonoplast‐localized SpHMA3 in the shoots plays an essential role in Cd detoxification, which contributes to the maintenance of the normal growth of young leaves of S. plumbizincicola in Cd‐contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSedum plumbizincicola 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acadmium 3aecotypes 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahyperaccumulators 3aleaves 3arare species 3ashoots 3asoil 3atissues 3atonoplast 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aZhao, Haixia1 aWu, Longhua1 aLiu, Anna1 aZhao, Fang‐Jie1 aXu, Wenzhong0 tnew phytologist.g2017 July, v. 215, no. 2 p.687-698dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.146223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011300167300001800280520095900298592002801257650002501285650002101310650001201331650001301343650000901356650002101365650002201386650001301408650002301421650001501444650002101459653002501480653002901505653001901534653002001553653001401573700001501587700001201602700001701614700001401631700001201645700001801657700001701675700001601692773011201708856008601820852000901906655001201915IND60543231020221120095634.0190410e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054323102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xiang10aPostfertilization changes in conformation of egg yolk phosvitin and biological activities of phosphopeptides  ap. 1008-1014.  aEgg yolk-derived phosvitin phosphopeptides (PPPs) are considered to have a huge potential in nutraceutical and cosmetic industries for their high Ca2+ binding capacity and antioxidant activity. This work aimed to obtain information on effect of fertilization on conformation of phosvitin (PSV) and bioactivities of PPPs. After 12days of incubation, a significant decrease was seen in phosphorus content of PSV. The conformational and thermal analyses indicated that PSV underwent a conformational change during incubation, and the PSV on day 12 possessed a much more unfolded structure. Correspondingly, the PPPs derived from fertilized egg PSV exhibited stronger Ca2+ binding capacity (18.4ppm at 600mg/L) and antioxidant activities against DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical and lipid peroxidation than that of PPPs from unfertilized egg PSV. These results suggested that fertilized egg could be explored as a potential source of bioactive phosphopeptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abinding capacity 3acalcium 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3afunctional foods 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aindustry 3alipid peroxidation 3aphosphorus 3athermal analysis 0aAntioxidant activity 0aCalcium-binding capacity 0aFertilized egg 0aPhosphopeptides 0aPhosvitin1 aZhou, Yuyi1 aLi, Mei1 aWu, Fengfeng1 aYang, Ne,1 aXu, Jin1 aChen, Haiying1 aJin, Zhengyu1 aXu, Xueming0 tFood research international.g2014 Aug., v. 62 p.1008-1014dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245012200217300001800339520101800357592002801375650001501403650001301418650002301431650001101454650001901465650002301484650002101507650002201528650001401550650001201564653002601576653001501602653001901617653003401636653002001670653002301690700002401713700002101737700002101758773013401779856008701913852000902000655001202009IND60619154020221119061539.0190606e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061915402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezakazemi, Mashallah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9980-668210aQuantum chemical calculations and molecular modeling for methylene blue removal from water by a lignin-chitosan blend  ap. 2065-2075.  aA comprehensive analysis of the molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculation methods for methylene blue removal by adsorption were carried out.

The physical description of the mechanical responses due to oral processing is required for a more effective prediction in product (re)formulation. The aim of this work is to derive such an adequate and relevant methodology. For this purpose a tribological and rheological study of polysaccharide solutions was employed using a set of different rubbers that mimic different soft (oral) surfaces and to relate these measurements to material surface properties, as roughness, hydrophobicity and elasticity. The polysaccharides chosen, locust bean gum, pectin and xanthan, represent important components in food products.It is shown that the nature (hardness or roughness) of a surface under good lubrication conditions is not that important. Therefore, in developing new food products it may be of prime importance to control the lubrication properties rather than focus on adaptation to oral surface characteristics, like the consequences of human aging. Xanthan is more effective as lubricant than the negatively charged pectin, while locust bean gum is the worst lubricant that was tested. No clear relation with the apparent contact angle could be made between friction and the aqueous solutions tested.The presence of hard particles on friction is predominantly observed at relatively low entrainment speed (below about 50mm/s) and is most explicitly detectable when lubrication is poor (as for locust bean gum). The MCC particles used in this study may not fit in the surface asperities and thereby enhance surface roughness, which results in extended boundary regime of the Stribeck-curve. Tribology is shown to be useful to detect particles dispersed in a solution, but the better the lubricant the more difficult the detection of such particles will be. Alternatively, this work shows that food products characterized by low friction coefficient can be mixed with elongated particles without large influence on their lubrication properties. This insight might provide openings in reformulation-strategies not only in food but also in pharmacy applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acontact angle 3adispersions 3afoods 3afriction 3ahardness 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3alocust bean gum 3alubricants 3amastication 3amouth 3apectins 3aprediction 3aroughness 3asurface roughness 3axanthan gum 0aSurface roughness 0aSurface elasticity 0aContact angle 0aSilicone 0aNeoprene 0aTeflon 0aPolysaccharide 0aParticles 0aLubrication1 ade Jongh, Harmen.H.J.0 tFood research international.g2014 Aug., v. 62 p.1020-1028dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245015800199300001800357500002000375520161100395592002802006596007702034596007302111596005802184650001402242650001202256650001802268650001402286650002602300650001102326700006802337700006602405700006502471700006102536700006202597773012302659856007302782852000902855655001202864IND60747821220221116231213.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074782122DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.175362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatesanz, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0060-613610aPhenotypic integration does not constrain phenotypic plasticity: differential plasticity of traits is associated to their integration across environments  ap. 2359-2370.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding constraints to phenotypic plasticity is key given its role on the response of organisms to environmental change. It has been suggested that phenotypic integration, the structure of trait covariation, could limit trait plasticity. However, the relationship between plasticity and integration is far from resolved. Using a database of functional plasticity to drought of a Mediterranean shrub that included 20 ecophysiological traits, we assessed environmentally‐induced changes in phenotypic integration and whether integration constrained the expression of plasticity, accounting for the within‐environment phenotypic variation of traits. Furthermore, we provide the first test of the association between differential trait plasticity and trait integration across an optimum and a stressful environment. Phenotypic plasticity was positively associated with phenotypic integration in both environments, but this relationship was lost when phenotypic variation was considered. The similarity in the plastic response of two traits predicted their integration across environments, with integrated traits having more similar plasticity. Such variation in the plasticity of traits partly explained the lower phenotypic integration found in the stressful environment. We found no evidence that integration may constitute an internal constraint to plasticity. Rather, we present the first empirical demonstration that differences in plastic responses may involve a major reorganization of the relationships among traits, and challenge the notion that stress generally induces a tighter phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data  aGYPSEVOL (CGL2016‐75566‐P)cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aPGC2018‐099115‐B‐I00cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aTE‐CM: S2018/EMT‐4338cMadrid Regional Government 3adatabases 3adrought 3aecophysiology 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3ashrubs1 aBlanco‐Sánchez, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9379-49271 aRamos‐Muñoz, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5491-60041 ade la Cruz, Marcelino1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9080-45251 aBenavides, Raquel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2328-53711 aEscudero, Adrián,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1427-54650 tThe new phytologist.g2021 Sept., v. 231, no. 6 p.2359-2370dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.175363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012700161300002000288520130600308592002801614596009801642596009801740596005801838650001501896650002601911650001401937650003001951650001101981650001901992650002402011650001102035653001702046653003102063653002402094653002102118653001902139653003402158700001802192700005402210700005502264773014202319856007902461852000902540655001202549IND60785827320221118064932.0220728e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078582732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c089912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pengju10aTransition-Metal Interlink Neural Network: Machine Learning of 2D Metal–Organic Frameworks with High Magnetic Anisotropy  ap. 33726-33733.  aTwo-dimensional (2D) metal–organic framework (MOF) materials with large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) are important candidates for high-density magnetic storage. The MAE-targeted high-throughput screening of 2D MOFs is currently limited by the time-consuming electronic structure calculations. In this study, a machine learning model, namely, transition-metal interlink neural network (TMINN) based on a database with 1440 2D MOF materials is developed to quickly and accurately predict MAE. The well-trained TMINN model for MAE successfully captures the general correlation between the geometrical configurations and the MAEs. We explore the MAEs of 2583 other 2D MOFs using our trained TMINN model. From these two databases, we obtain 11 unreported 2D ferromagnetic MOFs with MAEs over 35 meV/atom, which are further demonstrated by the high-level density functional theory calculations. Such results show good performance of the extrapolation predictions of TMINN. We also propose some simple design rules to acquire 2D MOFs with large MAEs by building a Pearson correlation coefficient map between various geometrical descriptors and MAE. Our developed TMINN model provides a powerful tool for high-throughput screening and intentional design of 2D magnetic MOFs with large MAE.  aPublisher supplied data  a11874097cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a91961204cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a202002AB080001-1cYunnan Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanisotropy 3acoordination polymers 3adatabases 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aferromagnetism 3ainformation storage 3amodels 0a2D materials 0ametal−organic frameworks 0amagnetic anisotropy 0amachine learning 0aneural network 0afirst-principles calculations1 aXing, Jianpei1 aJiang, Xue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4700-06411 aZhao, Jijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3263-71590 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 July 13, v. 14, no. 29 p.33726-33733dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c089913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013500172520169300307592002802000650001902028650001702047650001402064650001702078650001902095650001202114650002402126650002202150650001302172650001902185650003202204650001002236650000902246650001402255650001502269650001902284650002002303653001802323653001602341653002302357653002102380700002102401700002002422700002602442700001802468700003002486773011802516856008602634852000902720655001202729IND60776536520221118220221.0220726e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077653652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1149842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkatesha, K.T.10aRecent developments, challenges, and opportunities in genetic improvement of essential oil-bearing rose (Rosa damascena): A review  aRosa damascena Mill is a popular Rosa species cultivated for industrial rose oil production in the world. Besides its major application in aroma and cosmetic industries, rose essential oil has been reported with valuable pharmacological properties such as antibacterial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities. Poor oil yield, short flowering period, and low oil content are the major constraints in the prevailing damask rose varieties. Plant breeders are being encouraged to develop new damask rose cultivars with improved oil content and higher flower yield qualities due to rising market demand. The aforementioned qualities can be improved using traditional breeding methods such as clonal selection and intra-specific hybridization. But, through the convention breeding method creation of genetic variation is time taking, and the preservation of the authentic scent and quality of the rose oil is very difficult. Recent breakthroughs in molecular-markers techniques, genomics, and transcriptomics, have resulted in large volumes of data being generated in damask rose. It will be feasible to discover genes/pathways that are responsible for essential characteristics if this data is combined with phenotypic information. Several attempts have been undertaken to accelerate the breeding of R.damascena using molecular technologies. However, due to the species' high heterozygosity and polyploidy nature, translating the findings of such studies to practical breeding remains a significant challenge. This review paper outlines recent advances in conventional and modern molecular breeding procedures, as well as their potential uses and limitations in improving the oil-bearing rose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa damascena 3aantioxidants 3acultivars 3acytotoxicity 3aessential oils 3aflowers 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3aheterozygosity 3aintraspecific hybridization 3aodors 3aoils 3aphenotype 3apolyploidy 3asupply balance 3atranscriptomics 0aEssential oil 0aDamask rose 0aMolecular breeding 0aClonal selection1 aGupta, Abhilasha1 aRai, Archana N.1 aJambhulkar, Sanjay.J.1 aBisht, Rashmi1 aPadalia, Rajendra Chandra0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 184 p.114984-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1149843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014400162300001600306500002000322520144300342592002801785650002501813650002301838650001501861650001101876650001801887650001601905650002201921650001001943650001801953650001301971650002001984650002702004650000902031650002002040650002602060650003502086650001302121650003102134700002302165700002002188700002002208700001702228700002202245700002102267700002402288700002202312700001902334700002002353700002002373700002102393773011602414856007302530852000902603655001202612IND60587353820221121100542.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058735382DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.146152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauchet, Guillaume10aIdentification of major loci and genomic regions controlling acid and volatile content in tomato fruit: implications for flavor improvement  ap. 624-641.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant metabolites are important to world food security due to their roles in crop yield and nutritional quality. Here we report the metabolic profile of 300 tomato accessions (Solanum lycopersicum and related wild species) by quantifying 60 primary and secondary metabolites, including volatile organic compounds, over a period of 2 yr. Metabolite content and genetic inheritance of metabolites varied broadly, both within and between different genetic groups. Using genotype information gained from 10 000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, we performed a metabolite genome‐wide association mapping (GWAS) study. We identified 79 associations influencing 13 primary and 19 secondary metabolites with large effects at high resolution. Four genome regions were detected, highlighting clusters of associations controlling the variation of several metabolites. Local linkage disequilibrium analysis and allele mining identified possible candidate genes which may modulate the content of metabolites that are of significant importance for human diet and fruit consumption. We precisely characterized two associations involved in fruit acidity and phenylpropanoid volatile production. Taken together, this study reveals complex and distinct metabolite regulation in tomato subspecies and demonstrates that GWAS is a powerful tool for gene‐metabolite annotation and identification, pathways elucidation, and further crop improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3achromosome mapping 3acrop yield 3aflavor 3afood security 3afruit acids 3afruit consumption 3agenes 3agenome mining 3agenotype 3ahuman nutrition 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3anutritive value 3asecondary metabolites 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atomatoes 3avolatile organic compounds1 aGrenier, Stéphane1 aSamson, Nicolas1 aSegura, Vincent1 aKende, Aniko1 aBeekwilder, Jules1 aCankar, Katarina1 aGallois, Jean‐Luc1 aGricourt, Justine1 aBonnet, Julien1 aBaxter, Charles1 aGrivet, Laurent1 aCausse, Mathilde0 tnew phytologist.g2017 July, v. 215, no. 2 p.624-641dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.146153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245006900174520121900243592002801462650002701490650001301517650000901530650001101539650001701550650002201567650002201589653002701611653001901638653001701657653001801674653002101692700002101713700002001734700002301754700001301777773010301790856008801893852000901981655001201990IND60782023620221120135107.0220719e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078202362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1041002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKidron, Giora J.10aMechanisms for biocrust-modulated runoff generation – A review  aThe complex interactions between biocrust properties and rainfall characteristics give rise to partitioning of infiltration and runoff. In this review we examine primary mechanisms for runoff generation due to water repellency (WR), pore clogging (PC), soil texture and structural features including surface roughness. The primary hypothesis is that while WR plays an important role in runoff generation in humid regions, PC is a dominant process for runoff in arid and semiarid regions even under moderate rainfall intensities. Evidence suggests that the amount and properties of biocrust extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) dictate the rheological properties and swelling characteristics of the biocrust, which, in turn, govern the degree of pore clogging (due to surface swelling) and the resulting surface saturation. Changes in species composition of the main photoautotrophic component of the biocrust control the amount and properties of the embedded EPS. Disturbance or warmer climate may affect runoff generation via changes in biocrust species composition. These changes may not be necessarily long-lived when the disturbance is ceased or climate conditions revert to ‘original’ long term state.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological soil crusts 3apolymers 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil texture 3aspecies diversity 3asurface roughness 0aBiological soil crusts 0aHydrophobicity 0aInfiltration 0aPore clogging 0aWater repellency1 aLichner, Lubomir1 aFischer, Thomas1 aStarinsky, Abraham1 aOr, Dani0 tEarth-science reviews.g2022 Aug., v. 231 p.104100-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1041003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100002300168245013200191300001600323500000900339520092700348592002801275650001601303650001301319650002601332650001801358650002301376650002301399650001201422650002301434650001901457650001901476700001601495700002301511700002001534700002301554700002101577700002001598773012001618852000901738856011201747856008401859961001301943655001201956IND4421279420221120040923.0191228e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442127942DNAL7 a10113/326812hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2008.06.03352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Nanda10aMapping and Confirmation of a New Allele at Rpp1 from Soybean PI 594538A Conferring RB Lesion–Type Resistance to Soybean Rust  ap. 783-790.  aepub  aSoybean rust, caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi (H.

Our research objectives were to map and confirm the location of resistance gene(s) in PI 594538A using a population of 98 F₃:₄ lines from a cross between PI594538A (reddish-brown [RB] lesions) and the susceptible cultivar Loda (tan [TAN] lesions). The lines were inoculated with the P. pachyrhizi isolate ZM01-1 from Zimbabwe. The RB resistance in PI 594538A mapped on linkage group G as a single dominant gene. This gene is likely an allele of Rpp1 or a new closely linked gene because it mapped within 1 cM of Rpp1 and ZM01-1 produced RB lesions on PI 594538A and TAN lesions on PI 200492, the original source of Rpp1 The mapping of the new Rpp1 allele, named Rpp1-b, was confirmed in a second population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aPhakopsora pachyrhizi 3arust diseases 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3alinkage groups 3adominant genes1 aCurley, Joe1 aFrederick, Reid D.1 aHyten, David L.1 aNelson, Randall L.1 aHartman, Glen L.1 aDiers, Brian W.0 tCrop science.g2009 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.783-790dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/326813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2008.06.03353Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03125naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245014100214300001600355520176900371592002802140650002002168650002502188650002602213650002202239650002502261650003602286650001802322650002002340653001902360653001902379653003602398653002402434700002402458700002702482700001902509773010502528856008502633852000902718655001202727IND60628306420221120201212.0200228e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062830642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamali, Mohammadreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1591-960510aSustainability criteria for assessing nanotechnology applicability in industrial wastewater treatment: Current status and future outlook  ap. 261-276.  aApplication of engineered nanomaterials for the treatment of industrial effluents and to deal with recalcitrant pollutants has been noticeably promoted in recent years. Laboratory, pilot and full-scale studies emphasize the potential of this technology to offer promising treatment options to meet the future needs for clean water resources and to comply with stringent environmental regulations. The technology is now in the stage of being transferred to the real applications. Therefore, the assessment of its performance according to sustainability criteria and their incorporation into the decision-making process is a key task to ensure that long term benefits are achieved from the nano-treatment technologies. In this study, the importance of sustainability criteria for the conventional and novel technologies for the treatment of industrial effluents was determined in a general approach assisted by a fuzzy-Delphi method. The criteria were categorized in technical, economic, environmental and social branches and the current situation of the nanotechnology regarding the criteria was critically discussed. The results indicate that the efficiency and safety are the most important parameters to make sustainable choices for the treatment of industrial effluents. Also, in addition to the need for scaling-up the nanotechnology in various stages, the study on their environmental footprint must continue in deeper scales under expected environmental conditions, in particular the synthesis of engineered nanomaterials and the development of reactors with the ability of recovery and reuse the nanomaterials. This paper will aid to select the most sustainable types of nanomaterials for the real applications and to guide the future studies in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aecological footprint 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental law 3aindustrial effluents 3aindustrial wastewater treatment 3ananomaterials 3awater resources 0aSustainability 0aNanotechnology 0aIndustrial wastewater treatment 0aFuzzy-Delphi method1 aPersson, Kenneth M.1 aCosta, Maria Elisabete1 aCapela, Isabel0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Apr., v. 125 p.261-276dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245019600172300001600368520203300384592002802417650002402445650001102469650002202480650002402502650001302526650002002539650001402559650001902573650002102592650001102613650002602624650001302650650001002663650002102673653000902694653006802703653002902771653002502800653003002825653002102855700001802876700006102894773010002955856008603055852000903141655001203150IND60611118320221122032517.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061111832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Phi Long10aElevated temperature behaviour of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer applied by hand lay-up (M-CFRP) under simultaneous thermal and mechanical loadings: Experimental and analytical investigation  ap. 103-117.  aCarbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP), a polymer matrix composite material, has been increasingly used in industry, science, daily use equipment and engineering in recent decades. In civil engineering, when a construction structure reinforced with external bonded CFRP is subjected to fire, both the structure and CFRP reinforcement are concurrently affected by the elevated temperature and mechanical load. In Eurocode, the evolution of the mechanical properties of concrete and steel are described as decreasing with increasing temperature, while the performance of CFRP has not been clearly mentioned. In civil engineering, there are two common types of CFRP: one that is fabricated in a factory before installation (pultruded CFRP) and one that is fabricated on site during the installation with hand lay-up methods. In the literature, several experimental datasets focus on the first type of CFRP considering different aspects, such as performance under different testing conditions, different temperature levels, etc. This paper focuses on the thermo-mechanical performance of the second type of CFRP with a fire application purpose. The material is tested for mechanical performance at temperature levels varying from 20 °C to 600 °C and for thermal resistance at different tensile stress ratios from 10% to 75% of the material's ultimate tensile stress at ambient temperatures. The results show that the mechanical performance of the tested material decreased as the temperature increased, the ultimate strength decreased by 50% at 350 °C, and the Young's modulus only decreased by 30% at 600 °C. The results also confirm that the mechanical status has an influence on the thermal performance of the material and vice versa. A new analytical model has been proposed for the thermo-mechanical performance of the tested material and fits well with other experimental data obtained from similar testing conditions. The outcome of the proposed analytical model is applicable to fire design in civil engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbon 3acivil engineering 3acomposite materials 3aconcrete 3adata collection 3aequipment 3aheat tolerance 3amechanical loads 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolymers 3asteel 3atensile strength 0aCFRP 0aCarbon fibre-reinforced polymer applied by hand lay-up (M-CFRP) 0aManually fabricated CFRP 0aElevated temperature 0aThermo-mechanical loading 0aAnalytical model1 aVu, Xuan Hong1 aFerrier, Emmanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8982-71480 tFire safety journal.g2018 Sept., v. 100 p.103-117dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017000169300002000339520142400359592002801783596009801811596009801909596009802007650001502105650001102120650002102131650001302152650001102165650002402176650002002200650001202220650002202232650001502254650001402269650001802283650001102301653001902312653002902331653002002360653001602380653000802396700001302404700005302417700001702470700002102487700001702508700001802525700001702543700001902560700005702579700005802636700005702694773014702751856008602898852000902984655001202993IND60787265720221116205239.0220808e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078726572DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c019322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng-Chao10aFabrication of Cubic and Porous Carbon Cages with In-Situ-Grown Carbon Nanotube Networks and Cobalt Phosphide for High-Capacity and Stable Lithium–Sulfur Batteries  ap. 10223-10233.  aLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high specific capacity, low cost, and eco-friendly raw material. However, the insulating property of sulfur and dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) lead to rapid capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiency. In this work, we smartly synthesized a composite material as the host material of active S by a facile one-step pyrolysis method. It was composed of in-situ-grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and CoP particles inside the porous carbon cages (denoted as CoP-CNT@C). The CNT networks in porous carbon cages can improve the conductivity of the cathode, while the CoP particles are capable of enhancing the adsorption of LiPSs, thereby effectively mitigating the “shuttle effect”. Moreover, the porous structure of the carbon cages could effectively store the elemental sulfur. As a matter of fact, the Li–S battery based on the CoP-CNT@C/S cathode exhibited an ultrahigh initial specific capacity of 1456.8 mAh g–¹ at 0.1C and superior performance (663.3 mAh g–¹) at a high current rate of 3C. It is worth mentioning that a capacity of 473.9 mAh g–¹ has been retained after 750 cycles tested at 0.5C, indicating the outstanding stability of the Li–S battery based on the CoP-CNT@C/S cathode. Overall, the CoP-CNT@C composite prepared is promising for the application of Li–S batteries as the host material.  aPublisher supplied data  a51762032cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a52062033cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a61904075cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acathodes 3acobalt 3acomposite materials 3agreen chemistry 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aphosphides 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3asulfur 0aenergy storage 0alithium−sulfur battery 0acarbon nanotube 0acarbon cage 0aCoP1 aLiu, Zhi1 aTan, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5361-89291 aZhou, Qun-Yi1 aZhang, Jing-Jian1 aHou, Pei-Pei1 aJin, Xin-Jian1 aLv, Tong-Bao1 aZhao, Zhi-Qing1 aZeng, Zheling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7762-48721 aDeng, Shuguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2892-35041 aDai, Gui-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9208-99940 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 July 27, v. 10, no. 31 p.10223-10233dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c019323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014400172300001400316520101400330592002801344650001501372650001001387650002301397650002301420650001201443650001301455650001701468650001401485650001101499650001301510653002301523653003401546653002201580653001501602653001801617653002701635700001601662700001701678700002401695700001701719773009101736856008601827852000901913655001201922IND60628958420221119050527.0201125e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062895842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAspromonte, Juan10aCharacterization of mesoporous silica used for drug delivery by sorptive interaction – multiple headspace extraction–gas chromatography  ap. 35-39.  aA multiple headspace extraction experiment coupled to gas chromatography (MHE-GC) is used for the classification and qualification of different mesoporous silica (MPSi) materials used for drug delivery. In this MHE experiment, a pure liquid solvent probe is fully evaporated in a sealed headspace vial in the presence of the MPSi sample, leading to a gas-solid partitioning that is theoretically described. The obtained results matched with the known characteristics of the studied samples, such as adsorption capacity due to differences in porosity and passivation treatments. Moreover, it proves the effectiveness of a poly dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) coating treatment over a thermal one in reducing the specific interactions of the MPSi. In addition, it evidences the important role of confinement effects when the pore diameter is close to the microporosity range. Finally, a simple experiment for fast screening is proposed by comparison of the results obtained for four different probes used as a mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adrugs 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aliquids 3aporosity 3aporous media 3ascreening 3asilica 3asolvents 0aGas chromatography 0aMultiple headspace extraction 0aMesoporous silica 0aAdsorption 0aDrug delivery 0aSolid characterization1 aWolfs, Kris1 aKahsay, Getu1 aSchepdael, Ann Van,1 aAdams, Erwin0 tTalanta.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 187 p.35-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001900174245013300193300001400326520143600340592002801776650002101804650002701825650001101852650001001863650002201873650001601895650001401911650003001925650001801955650003701973650001802010650000902028650001402037650002202051650001402073650001402087650002502101650002802126650003902154650003302193650002202226650001102248650007902259650003002338650001502368650003202383700002002415700002302435700002002458773011602478856008902594852000902683655001202692IND60112723720221120194040.0141111e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011272372DNAL7 a231416482pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLomonaco, Sara10aDetection of virulence-associated genes and epidemic clone markers in Listeria monocytogenes isolates from PDO Gorgonzola cheese  ap. 76-79.  aFifty-three Listeria monocytogenes isolates obtained from Gorgonzola cheese and previously characterized with biochemical typing, serotyping and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), were analyzed in this study. Seven virulence-associated genes were selected (actA, inlC, inlJ, plcA, prfA, hlyA and iap) and their presence was investigated using PCR. All virulence-associated genes were detected in 51 isolates. One isolate did not show amplification of the inlC gene and one other isolate, previously mis-identified as L. monocytogenes probably due to atypical phenotypes, resulted negative by PCR for all virulence genes and was identified as Listeria innocua by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. A multiplex PCR assay was used to evaluate the presence of markers specific for epidemic clones (ECs) of L. monocytogenes. The marker specific for the recently identified epidemic clone V (ECV) was detected in 38 of 43 (88%) of serotype 1/2a isolates. These findings suggest that Gorgonzola cheese can represent a significant source of L. monocytogenes and potential health risk for listeriosis as almost all isolates (94%) could be potentially virulent and that 38 (~72%) were presumptive positive ECV. PCR screening for both virulence-associated genes and EC markers may be useful for rapidly evaluating the epidemic potential and public health risk posed by L. monocytogenes in PDO Gorgonzola cheese and other dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aclones 3agenes 3agorgonzola cheese 3alisteriosis 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3avirulence 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSerotyping 2aVirulence Factorsxgenetics1 aPatti, Rossella1 aKnabel, Stephen J.1 aCivera, Tiziana0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 160, no. 1 p.76-79dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245014300176300002000319500001500339520093900354592002801293650001401321650001801335650001801353650001701371650001301388650001201401650002401413650001101437650001201448650001201460650001601472650001501488650003501503650004201538650003301580650001601613650003101629650002301660650002001683650004301703653002001746653002201766653002901788653001001817700001801827700002001845700001401865700001501879700001901894773013501913852000902048856007502057655001202132IND4477908620221120065312.0160905e20131030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790862DNAL7 a240795182pmid7 a10.1021/jf40298592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Changfeng10aPrediction Model for Cadmium Transfer from Soil to Carrot (Daucus carota L.) and Its Application To Derive Soil Thresholds for Food Safety  ap. 10273-10282.  a2019-12-05  aAt present, soil quality standards used for agriculture do not fully consider the influence of soil properties on cadmium (Cd) uptake by crops. This study aimed to develop prediction models for Cd transfer from a wide range of Chinese soils to carrot (Daucus carota L.) using soil properties and the total or available soil Cd content. Path analysis showed soil pH and organic carbon (OC) content were the two most significant properties exhibiting direct effects on Cd uptake factor (ratio of Cd concentration in carrot to that in soil). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis also showed that total soil Cd, pH, and OC were significant variables contributing to carrot Cd concentration, explaining 90% of the variance across the 21 soils. Soil thresholds for carrot (cultivar New Kuroda) cropping based on added or total Cd were then derived from the food safety standard and were presented as continuous or scenario criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3alinear models 3aDaucus carota 3asoil quality 3avariance 3acadmium 3aregression analysis 3acarbon 3asoil pH 3acarrots 3afood safety 3aprediction 2aCadmiumxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDaucus carotaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Safety 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aModels, Biological 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 0asoil thresholds 0aprediction models 0atransfer characteristics 0acrops1 aZhang, Taolin1 aWang, Xingxiang1 aZhou, Fen1 aYang, Yiru1 aHuang, Guifeng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Oct. 30, v. 61, no. 43 p.10273-10282dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf40298593Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02601naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007500174300001400249520138000263592002801643650001601671650002801687650001101715650001501726650001001741650002001751650001601771653001801787653001901805653002901824653003201853653000901885653003601894653001901930700002401949700002501973773009801998856008602096852000902182655001202191IND60611118420221122032700.0180911e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061111842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHantouche, Elie G.10aModeling creep of steel under transient temperature conditions of fire  ap. 67-75.  aThis paper presents a methodology for explicit modeling of the time-dependent behavior or creep of structural steel in the Abaqus finite element (FE) models under transient temperature conditions representative of building fires. In this methodology, available creep models based on conventional creep tests under constant or steady-state temperature conditions were used to predict the time-dependent or creep behavior of steel under variable or transient-state temperature conditions. Specifically, user-defined CREEP subroutines were created in Abaqus to define time-dependent or viscoplastic deformation of structural steel under changing temperatures. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methodology, the time-dependent behavior of structural steel at elevated temperatures was modeled under three distinct conditions. These were: steady-state temperature conditions, stepwise steady-state temperature conditions, and transient-state temperature conditions. This paper further presents and discusses the application of the methodology in studying the creep behavior of a shear tab connection assembly under the transient temperature conditions of a fire. Through this application, the importance of explicit consideration of creep in predicting the response of connection assemblies at different stages in the evolution of a structural-fire is also emphasized.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3aprediction 3asteel 3astructure fires 3atemperature 0aThermal creep 0aTime-dependent 0aSteady-state temperature 0aTransient-state temperature 0aFire 0aShear tab connection assemblies 0aFinite element1 aAl Khatib, Karim K.1 aMorovat, Mohammed A.0 tFire safety journal.g2018 Sept., v. 100 p.67-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245015600208300001600364520166200380592002802042650001502070650000902085650001702094650001702111650002002128650001302148650002402161650001802185650002002203650001702223650001902240650003202259650001002291650001902301650001502320650002302335650001702358653002002375653001802395653001902413653001702432653001902449653001502468700002302483773010902506856008602615852000902701655001202710IND60525869420221116162509.0190319e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052586942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Swati1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2841-186X10aImpact of staggered treatments of novel molecules and ethylene absorbents on postharvest fruit physiology and enzyme activity of ‘Santa Rosa’ plums  ap. 242-248.  aThe present investigation was conducted to study the effect of staggered removal of cold stored (2°C) plums at 7, 14 and 21 days interval and their subsequent treatment with salicylic acid (SA), nitric oxide (NO) and ethylene absorbent (EA) sachets. The fruit were then stored at supermarket conditions (20±1°C and 90±5% RH) with the objective to know whether delayed EA, SA and NO treatments still have significant beneficial effects on the plum fruit quality. The observations on different physiological and biochemical parameters were taken at 2 days interval. The results showed that staggered treatments enhanced postharvest life and maintained fruit quality. We observed that SA-treated plums showed the highest fruit firmness and lowest decay losses when plums were either removed on 7th, 14th or 21st days of cold storage. Furthermore, SA-treated fruit exhibited lowest rates of respiration and ethylene evolution; phenylalanine ammonia lyase and pectin methyl esterase activities; minimum malondialdehyde content and lowest electrolyte leakage in comparison to those treated either with NO or packed with EA sachets or control fruit. In conclusion, ‘Santa Rosa’ plum removed after 7th (staggered-I), 14th (staggered-II) and 21st day (staggered-III) from cold storage maintained a shelf life of 10, 6 and 4 days, respectively at subsequent supermarket storage conditions. The overall results submit that even if the plums are not treated immediately or within few days after harvest and placed as such in cold store, they can be still treated with SA, NO or in-package ethylene absorbent (EA) treatment for beneficial postharvest influences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3acold 3acold storage 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afruit quality 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3apectinesterase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aplums 3asalicylic acid 3ashelf life 3astorage conditions 3asupermarkets 0aEnzyme activity 0aFruit quality 0aJapanese plums 0aNitric oxide 0aSalicylic acid 0aShelf life1 aSharma, Ram Roshan0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 198 p.242-248dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013800170300002000308520127500328592002801603596009801631596009601729596010501825596010401930596010402034596010302138596010502241596010302346650001302449650002202462650002102484650002202505650001102527650002002538650002402558650001302582650001502595653003102610653001402641653000902655653002302664653003202687700001602719700001702735700001802752700001802770700001702788700005702805700005602862773014702918856008603065852000903151655001203160IND60787265920221116205056.0220808e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078726592DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c019752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingrui10aNovel Inorganic–Organic Hybrid Cathode for Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries: V₂O₅ Pillared with Diethylenetriamine like a Double-Stud  ap. 10243-10251.  aZinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for advanced energy storage. However, poor stability of cathode materials, such as V₂O₅, is a stumbling block in the commercialization of aqueous ZIBs. Here, we develop a novel inorganic–organic cathode of a V₂O₅-diethylenetriamine (DETA) ultrathin nanosheet via a simple hydrothermal method. DETA as a structure-directing agent pillars between the V₂O₅ layers. Combined with the first-principles calculation, the orientation and bonding type of DETA inside the V₂O₅ host structures are confirmed. Double hydrogen bonds at the two amino end groups provide the stable anchoring of DETA similar to that in a double-stud. The unique structure of the V₂O₅-DETA hybrid with an expanded interlayer spacing (0.95 nm) and a narrower band gap (0.72 eV) accelerates the electron transportation. It affords a high storage capacity of 235 mA h g–¹ at 0.1 A g–¹ and remains stable for over 1000 cycles at 4 A g–¹. DETA contributes to the promotion of the electrochemical kinetics and weakens the electrostatic interactions. This study employing multifunctional pillars may provide more applicable approaches for improving the structural stability during the intercalation exfoliation of energy storage materials.  aPublisher supplied data  a22101300cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aZD2019-184-001cChina National Petroleum Corporationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002886  aZR2019MEM005cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007129  aZR2020ME053cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007129  aZR2020QB027cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007129  a20CX05010AcCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  a22CX01002A-1cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  a22CX03010AcCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594 3acathodes 3acommercialization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen 3ananosheets 0aaqueous zinc-ion batteries 0aH-bonding 0aV2O5 0adiethylenetriamine 0ainorganic−organic hybrids1 aLiu, Siyuan1 aZhou, Sainan1 aLiu, Huanhuan1 aDing, Ruidong1 aWei, Shuxian1 aWang, Zhaojie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6476-64491 aLu, Xiaoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7553-71310 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 July 22, v. 10, no. 31 p.10243-10251dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c019753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003000149245012900179300001200308520170600320592002802026650001902054650000902073650001702082650001202099650002302111650000902134650001502143650002102158650001502179650001602194650001602210700002202226773008802248856008502336852000902421655001202430IND4471165520221123004646.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447116552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstop-Aragonés, Cristian10aEffects of experimental drying intensity and duration on respiration and methane production recovery in fen peat incubations  ap. 1-9.  aDrying and rewetting to a variable extent influence the C gas exchange between peat soils and the atmosphere. We incubated a decomposed and compacted fen peat and investigated in two experiments 1) the vertical distribution of CO₂ and CH₄ production rates and their response to drying and 2) the effects of temperature, drying intensity and duration on CO₂ production rates and on CH₄ production recovery after rewetting. Surface peat down to 5 cm contributed up to 67% (CO₂) and above 80% (CH₄) of the depth-aggregated (50 cm) production. As CO₂ production sharply decreased with depth water table fluctuations in deeper peat layers are thus not expected to cause a substantial increase in soil respiration in this site. Compared to anaerobic water saturated conditions drying increased peat CO₂ production by a factor between 1.4 and 2.1. Regarding the effects of the studied factors, warmer conditions increased and prolonged drying duration decreased CO₂ production whereas the soil moisture level had little influence. No significant interactions among factors were found. Short dry events under warmer conditions are likely to result in greatest peaks of CO₂ production rates. Upon rewetting, CH₄ production was monitored over time and the recovery was standardized to pre-drying levels to compare the treatment effects. Methane production increased non-linearly over time and all factors (temperature, drying intensity and duration) influenced the pattern of post-drying CH₄ production. Peat undergoing more intense and longer drying events required a longer lag time before substantial CH₄ production occurred and warmer conditions appeared to speed up the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3afens 3agas exchange 3amethane 3amethane production 3apeat 3apeat soils 3asoil respiration 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater table1 aBlodau, Christian0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2012 Apr., v. 47 p.1-9dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009300165300001600258500001400274520112300288592002801411650001501439650001301454650001601467650001501483650001401498650001201512653001401524653001401538653001901552653001501571653001601586653001001602653001601612653001401628700002201642700001901664773007901683856008001762852000901842655001201851IND60711056520221120092036.0200916s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071105652DNAL7 a10.1163/15685410428435592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldwin, James10aRevised hypotheses for phylogenetic homology of the stomatostylet in tylenchid nematodes  ap. 623-632.  aNAL-light  aMolecular phylogenetic systematics suggest that Tylenchida share an immediate ancestor with Cephalobina. This relationship has implications, contradicting classical views, for evolution of the stomatostylet and homology with the cephalobid stoma. Emerging evidence from comparative TEM and 3D modelling is the basis for hypothesising that the tylenchid stylet, specifically the cone and shaft, is homologous with cuticle associated with arcade syncytia of the cephalobid gymnostom; furthermore, the stylet knobs and associated m1 protractors, are prostegostom. The guiding apparatus through which the stylet moves is lined by epidermal syncytia and is homologous with the cephalobid cheilostom. Junctional complexes associated with the epidermal syncytia of the cheilostom and adjacent gymnostom arcade cells occur in both cephalobids and tylenchids, but in the latter the membrane complexes are folded and modified as the guide ring. Testing of the hypothesis requires clearer phylogenetic resolution as well as additional ultrastructural and developmental observations of representatives of tylenchids and outgroups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTylenchida 3aancestry 3agiant cells 3anematology 3aphylogeny 3astylets 0aGYMNOSTOM 0aEVOLUTION 0aFINE STRUCTURE 0aCHEILOSTOM 0aCEPHALOBINA 0aSTOMA 0aDEVELOPMENT 0aSTEGOSTOM1 aBumbarger, Daniel1 aRagsdale, Erik0 tNematology.g, v. 6, no. 5 p.623-632dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685410428435593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100001600175245013200191300001800323520171500341592002802056650002402084650002002108650001102128650001802139650001802157650001302175650002702188650001302215650001002228650001202238650001002250650001002260650001602270650001102286650001702297650001202314650001102326650002602337650003002363650002702393650000902420650004502429650002802474650002802502700001302530700001602543700001302559700001602572700001702588773009102605856009202696852000902788655001202797IND4478102120221120081354.0141111e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447810212DNAL7 a217190892pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Naib, A.10aEffect of duration of storage at ambient temperature on fertilizing ability and mucus penetration ability of fresh bovine sperm  ap. 1070-1075.  aAlthough the use of fresh semen in the Irish dairy AI industry only accounts for 5% of total AI usage, this may peak to over 25% during the spring breeding season due to the increased demand for Irish proven sires of high genetic merit. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of storage of fresh semen for up to 7 d at ambient temperature on fertilization and embryo development in vitro, and on the ability of sperm to penetrate artificial mucus in vitro. In vitro matured bovine oocytes were inseminated with fresh semen stored in a caprogen-based diluent, with or without prior Percoll separation. Irrespective of sire, storage of fresh semen at ambient temperature for up to 7 d post collection had no effect on cleavage rate or blastocyst development after IVF. In addition, blastocyst quality, as assessed by the proportion of blastocysts hatching from the zona, was not affected by semen storage. Higher numbers of fresh sperm migrated through artificial mucus on Day 0 (day of semen collection) compared with frozen-thawed sperm. On Day 1 and 2 postcollection there was no difference in the number of sperm migrating through the mucus, but storage of sperm at ambient temperature for longer than 2 d resulted in a significant decline in their ability to penetrate mucus compared with frozen sperm from the same ejaculate. In conclusion, bovine sperm retain the ability to fertilize oocytes in vitro for up to 7 d following storage at ambient temperature. However, the ability of sperm to migrate through artificial mucus in vitro is severely depressed after 2 d storage which may have significant implications for the ability of these sperm to reach the site of fertilization in vivo after AI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abreeding season 3acattle 3aembryogenesis 3agenetic merit 3ahatching 3ain vitro fertilization 3aindustry 3amucus 3aoocytes 3asemen 3asires 3aspermatozoa 3aspring 3astorage time 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aEmbryonic Development 2aFertilizationxphysiology 2aFertilization in Vitro 2aMale 2aSemen Preservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSperm-Ovum Interactions 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology1 aWard, F.1 aKelly, A.K.1 aWade, M.1 aMarti, J.I.1 aLonergan, P.0 tTheriogenology.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 76, no. 6 p.1070-1075dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245010600175300001600281520155400297592002801851650002201879650002001901650002501921650002701946650001401973650001601987650001602003650001602019650001302035650001402048650001902062650001302081653002902094653003102123653003002154653002702184653001702211653001402228700001502242700001702257700001302274700001502287700001902302700001202321700001702333700001302350700001602363773010202379856008702481852000902568655001202577IND60539223920221122090634.0190214e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053922392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlnaggar, Mohammed10aCryoprotective therapy for huge hepatocellular carcinoma: A study of 14 patients with a single lesion  ap. 457-461.  aPercutaneous cryoablation is a potential cure for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study reviewed retrospectively clinical data from 14 patients who underwent cryoablation of huge HCC (long diameter >7cm). The side effects of cryosurgeries and liver function reverse were recorded and compared everyday. All the patients survived cryosurgery and none died before leaving hospital 2weeks later. Despite liver-protective treatment before cryosurgery, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were increased significantly, but returned to preoperative levels 2weeks post-cryosurgery. Before cryosurgery, mean total bilirubin (T.BIL) and direct bilirubin (D.BIL) levels were normal; 8–10days after cryosurgery, they increased more than two-fold, but returned to the preoperative level 2weeks post-cryosurgery. Serum transaminase and bilirubin levels were compared between hepatitis B positive and negative patients. The hepatitis B negative group’s AST level increased significantly 1day post-cryosurgery (mean, 186U/L) and decreased to the preoperative level at day 14. In the hepatitis B positive group, means transaminase and bilirubin reached peak values at different days post-cryosurgery. Overall, ALT and AST are valuable indicators of liver function impairment following cryosurgery. In patients with hepatitis B virus, close attention to the serum bilirubin level should be paid 8–10days after cryosurgery. Liver-protective treatment may alleviate liver function impairment caused by cryosurgery of huge HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aadverse effects 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3acryosurgery 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatoma 3ahospitals 3aliver function 3apatients 0aHepatocellular carcinoma 0aHepatic functional reserve 0aPercutaneous cryoablation 0aLiver-protective agent 0aTransaminase 0aBilirubin1 aNiu, Lizhi1 aLi, Jialiang1 aYao, Fei1 aWang, Yuan1 aZeng, Jianying1 aYe, Jin1 aChen, Jibing1 aMu, Feng1 aXu, Kecheng0 tCryobiology.g2014 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.457-461dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001900157245009200176300001400268520167500282592002801957650002301985650001102008650001502019650001502034650002202049650002102071650003502092650002302127650001702150650001102167650001202178650001702190650001102207651001002218653004302228653001802271653002702289653002102316653002302337700001702360700001402377700001702391700001702408700001902425773010502444856009202549852000902641655001202650IND60775789720221123004821.0220430e20220420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077578972DNAL7 a10.3897/natureconservation.48.799022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hongxiao10a﻿A rare shrub species as flagship for conserving desert steppe in arid Inner Mongolia  ap. 83-93.  a﻿AbstractThe rare species Amygdalus pedunculata Pall. (Rosaceae) in arid northern China is endangered to the point of extinction. Determined to save it, the local government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region encouraged the herdsmen to limit grazing activities. Here, we are testing if this species could be considered as a conspicuous flagship for restoring and conserving wind-sensitive arid lands as desert steppe in northern China. We examined statistically the growing states and environmental roles of A. pedunculata populations under the comparative conditions of free and limited grazing in winter since the year 2001. This species was observed to play a critical role in preventing wind erosion and stabilising the lands, as was indicated by the formation of micro-dunes under the shrubs. This role can be attributed mainly to the crown diameters or cover from the shrubs. Under the grazing limitation condition, accompanying species and plants around the shrubs increased significantly. Regardless of free or limited grazing conditions, the shrubs were not observed to inhibit the occurrence or growth of other plants. The grazing limitation over a period of 20 years has caused the effective revival of the rare A. pedunculata species, with statistically larger and taller A. pedunculata individuals than under the free grazing condition, as well as a slightly higher population density and total crown cover. The grazing limitation policy for saving A. pedunculata is believed to be effective and the rare A. pedunculata shrub is a conspicuous flagship for helping to conserve wind-sensitive desert steppe in terms of ecosystem integrity and authenticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus pedunculata 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation density 3arare species 3ashrubs 3asteppes 3awind erosion 3awinter 3aChina 0aAmygdaluspedunculata Pall.

From fortnightly visits to 1ha of forest over a period of 14 months, 331 EcM species were documented. The family Cortinariaceae (particularly the genus Cortinarius) dominated the EcM communities, with the youngest plot (72 yr since the last wildfire) having the greatest number of EcM species. Each plot was divided up into 25 10×10m subplots, and both unconstrained and constrained ordination procedures showed a significant association between the woody perennial plant community of the subplots and their EcM assemblages, reflecting the co-variation of plant and fungal communities. The study provides benchmark knowledge of EcM communities in a specific forest type in Tasmania, serving as a good basis for further studies in those forests and in similar forest types elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCortinarius 3aEucalyptus obliqua 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest types 3afungal communities 3aperennials 3aplant communities 3awildfires 3aTasmania1 aMohammed, Caroline1 aRatkowsky, David A.1 aWardlaw, Tim1 aDavidson, Neil J.0 tFungal ecology.g2011 Aug., v. 4, no. 4 p.290-298dElsevier Ltdx1754-50487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012300165300001600288500001500304520171600319592002802035650001302063650002502076650001002101650001902111650001002130650001602140650002802156650002002184650002202204650002302226650003102249650001102280650002602291650002302317650002502340650001902365650001702384650001202401650001602413650002202429650001802451650001402469653001502483653001302498653002302511653002502534653003002559700001402589700001302603700001702616700001302633700001802646700001502664773010902679856008602788852000902874655001202883IND60525869820221116162453.0190319e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052586982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Qing12aA glutathione S-transferase gene from Lilium regale Wilson confers transgenic tobacco resistance to Fusarium oxysporum  ap. 370-378.  a2019-12-06  aGlutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional proteins that are encoded by a large gene family. Plant GSTs are involved in host defense against both biotic and abiotic stresses as well as are involved in some physiological processes under normal conditions. In the present study, a novel tau GST gene, LrGSTU5, was isolated from Lilium regale Wilson. The deduced protein LrGSTU5 shared a high identity with AcGSTU1 from Allium cepa. In addition, there was relatively high gene expression of LrGSTU5 in the roots but the only minimal expression in both the stem and leaf of L. regale under normal conditions. The gene expression of LrGSTU5 was obviously up-regulated after treatment with signaling molecules including salicylic acid and ethylene as well as after inoculation with Fusarium oxysporum. Furthermore, in order to verify the function of LrGSTU5, a constitutive plant expression vector of LrGSTU5 was constructed and transferred into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi). Compared to the wild type (WT), several diseases resistance-related genes, including osmotin, PR1b, chitinase, and MnSOD, were up-regulated in the transgenic lines. Moreover, three important antioxidant enzymes, GST, superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidase, exhibited significantly higher activities in the T1 transgenic lines than in the WT after inoculation with F. oxysporum. Meanwhile, the rate of superoxidate anion production in the transgenic tobacco lines was significantly lower than in the WT. The antifungal activity of three LrGSTU5 transgenic tobacco lines was estimated through in vivo inoculation, and the results showed that the transgenic tobacco plants enhanced the resistance to F. oxysporum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3aascorbate peroxidase 3agenes 3asalicylic acid 3aroots 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 3aantifungal properties 3aFusarium oxysporum 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidants 3atobacco 3aAllium cepa 3atransgenic plants 3aLilium regale 3achitinase 0aResistance 0aproteins 0aTransgenic tobacco 0aLilium regale Wilson 0aGlutathione S-transferase1 aChen, Rui1 aYang, Ye1 aCui, Xiuming1 aGe, Feng1 aChen, Chaoyin1 aLiu, Diqiu0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 198 p.370-378dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245015200180300001600332520058600348592002800934650001600962650001500978650002900993650001501022650001201037650002301049650001701072651001101089653001801100653001701118653002501135653002501160653001801185653002201203700003101225700003201256700002401288700003301312773013201345856008601477852000901563655001201572IND60775789920221123004949.0220430e20220420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077578992DNAL7 a10.3897/neotropical.17.e818242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Diego Floriano da10a﻿Record of occurrence of Nasua nasua (Linnaeus, 1766) (Carnivora, Procyonidae) in a densely urbanized area of the city of Canoas, southern Brazil  ap. 111-116.  a﻿AbstractThe South American coati is a carnivore with a wide distribution in South America.

It also highlights the relevance of green spaces in urban areas for wildlife conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNasua nasua 3aNeotropics 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarnivores 3aforests 3athreatened species 3aurbanization 3aBrazil 0adeforestation 0ahabitat loss 0amedium sized mammals 0aSouth American coati 0aurban ecology 0aurban green space1 aRosario, Thaís Brauner do1 aMaciel, Ana Carolina Pontes1 aAlves, Duana Suelem1 aCademartori, Cristina Vargas0 tNeotropical Biology and Conservation.g2022 Apr. 20, v. 17, no. 2 p.111-116dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27346x2236-37777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neotropical.17.e818243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012400165300001400289520171800303592002802021650002802049650001302077650002102090650002302111650001702134650002502151650001102176650002402187650001502211650001902226650000902245650001402254650001002268650001802278650001702296650001902313650001302332650002502345650002202370650001102392650001602403651001302419653001602432653001902448653001902467653001602486653001802502653002702520700001602547773016802563856008202731852000902813655001202822IND60611118920221120040158.0180830e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061111892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2016.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHann, Brenda10aPatterns in the crustacean zooplankton community in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba: Response to long-term environmental change  ap. 80-90.  aChanges in the crustacean zooplankton community composition and abundance in Lake Winnipeg (1969–2006) provide a rare opportunity to examine their response to environmental changes in the largest naturally eutrophic lake on the Canadian prairies. Since 1929, zooplankton species composition in Lake Winnipeg has changed little except for the addition of the invasive cladoceran, Eubosmina coregoni in 1994. The dominant taxa in the lake in summer include: Leptodiaptomus ashlandi, Acanthocyclops vernalis, Diacyclops thomasi, Daphnia retrocurva, Daphnia mendotae, Diaphanosoma birgei, Eubosmina coregoni, and Bosmina longirostris. Climate-accelerated nutrient loading to southern Lake Winnipeg over the last two decades has led to increased phytoplankton abundance and higher frequency of cyanobacterial blooms especially in its northern basin. Crustacean zooplankton have likewise increased especially in the North Basin, but less so in the more nutrient rich South Basin, possibly as a consequence of higher densities of pelagic planktivorous fish and light-limited primary production compared with the more transparent North basin (Brunskill et al., 1979, 1980). Calanoid copepods play a larger role in the South basin food web in contrast to cyclopoid copepods and Cladocera in the North basin. The study begins to fill the recognized gap in understanding of Lake Winnipeg's food web structure and provides a baseline for evaluating ongoing changes in the zooplankton community with the arrival of new non-indigenous taxa, e.g. Bythotrephes longimanus and Dreissena polymorpha. It reinforces previous work demonstrating that zooplankton provide valuable indices toward evaluating the health of an ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBythotrephes longimanus 3aCopepoda 3aDaphnia mendotae 3aDaphnia retrocurva 3aDiaphanosoma 3aDreissena polymorpha 3abasins 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3afish 3afood webs 3alakes 3aphytoplankton 3aplanktivores 3apollution load 3aprairies 3aprimary productivity 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3azooplankton 3aManitoba 0aZooplankton 0aClimate change 0aEutrophication 0aLarge lakes 0aLake Winnipeg 0aNon-indigenous species1 aSalki, Alex0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2017 Feb., v. 43, no. 1 p.80-90dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Great Lakes ResearchwJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2016.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013600169300001800305520093900323592002801262650002301290650001501313650002001328650002201348650001301370650001701383650003501400650001301435650001701448650001401465650001301479650001701492650001801509650001701527700001201544700001701556773011001573856008601683852000901769655001201778IND60530396320221120135653.0160721e20160517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053039632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b000482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wen-Hui10aRedox-Mediated Indirect Fluorescence Immunoassay for the Detection of Disease Biomarkers Using Dopamine-Functionalized Quantum Dots  ap. 5131-5136.  aHere, we report a redox-mediated indirect fluorescence immunoassay (RMFIA) for the detection of the disease biomarker α-fetoprotein (AFP) using dopamine (DA)-functionalized CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs). In this immunoassay, tyrosinase was conjugated with the detection antibody and acted as a bridge connecting the fluorescence signals of the QDs with the concentration of the disease biomarkers. The tyrosinase label used for RMFIA catalyzed the enzymatic oxidation of DAs on the surface of functionalized QDs and caused fluorescence quenching in the presence of the analyte. Using this technique, we obtained a limit of detection as low as 10 pM for AFP. This assay’s potential for clinical analysis was demonstrated by detecting the real sera of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study makes the first use of RMFIA for the rapid detection of AFP, opening up a new pathway for the detection of disease biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibody detection 3abiomarkers 3adetection limit 3adisease detection 3adopamine 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahepatoma 3aimmunoassays 3aoxidation 3apatients 3aquantum dots 3arapid methods 3azinc sulfide1 aMa, Wei1 aLong, Yi-Tao0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 May 17, v. 88, no. 10 p.5131-5136dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b000483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014700164300001800311520173200329592002802061650001902089650001602108650004102124650003402165700001902199700001902218700001802237700002302255773011002278856008602388852000902474655001202483IND60530396420170413000000.0160721e20160517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053039642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b000522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, M.10aPilot for Validation of Online Pretreatments for Analyses of Organics by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry: Application to Space Research  ap. 5137-5144.  aThe search for complex organic molecules in extraterrestrial environments, including important biomolecules such as amino and fatty acids, will require a space compatible sample handling system to enable their detection by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For the future Mars exploratory mission Exomars 2018 aimed at organic molecules detection, a dedicated laboratory pilot, called Device for Pretreatment of Sample (DPS), reproducing representative space operating conditions has been developed. After its optimization, it aimed at validating under development protocols and interpreting forthcoming in situ resulting data. The DPS, dedicated to organic compounds’ analysis, is discussed in terms of its technical features. The derivatization is carried out on a 50–100 mg mineral sample in a 4 mL reactor coupled with a GC-MS injector to simulate on line in situ derivatization–volatilization–transfer steps. Three derivatization reactions have been carried out with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) as silylating reagent, N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) as methylating agents. The performances are illustrated by comparison of conventional and in situ silylation, developed for space research applications, using terrestrial mineral matrix and Mars analog materials enriched with 25 nmol of each targeted organic molecule. The work presented in this rationale has established that the use of derivatization reactions widens the scope of targeted molecules but also clearly points out mineral matrix effect. Decreasing mineral influence on pretreatment will be the next scientific challenge in in situ analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3atetramethylammonium compounds1 aMusadji, N.-Y.1 aLabanowski, J.1 aSternberg, R.1 aGeffroy-Rodier, C.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 May 17, v. 88, no. 10 p.5137-5144dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b000523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03939naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002400174245007600198300001400274520167300288592002801961650004001989650002702029650002902056650001702085650002102102650001902123650001302142650001602155650002202171650001502193650001002208650001102218650001502229650001602244650002502260650001002285650001102295650001402306650001402320650001502334650001302349650001602362650001302378650001102391650002602402650001702428650002202445650003102467650005302498650002302551650004702574650004602621650006402667650001002731650004602741650003302787700001902820700002502839700002602864700002302890700002402913700001502937700002702952773011602979856008903095852000903184655001203193IND60112724320221122135127.0141111e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011272432DNAL7 a231416442pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArroyo-López, F.N.10aYeasts in table olive processing: Desirable or spoilage microorganisms?  ap. 42-49.  aYeasts are unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms isolated from many foods, and are commonly found in table olive processing where they can play a double role. On one hand, these microorganisms can produce spoilage of fruits due to the production of bad odours and flavours, the accumulation of CO₂ leading to swollen containers, the clouding of brines, the softening of fruits and the degradation of lactic acid, which is especially harmful during table olive storage and packaging. But on the other hand, fortunately, yeasts also possess desirable biochemical activities (lipase, esterase, β-glucosidase, catalase, production of killer factors, etc.) with important technological applications in this fermented vegetable. Recently, the probiotic potential of olive yeasts has begun to be evaluated because many species are able to resist the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and show beneficial effects on the host. In this way, yeasts may improve consumers' health by decreasing cholesterol levels, inhibiting pathogens, degrading non assimilated compounds, producing antioxidants and vitamins, adhering to intestinal cells or by maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Many yeast species, usually also found in table olive processing, such as Wicherhamomyces anomalus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia membranifaciens and Kluyveromyces lactis, have been reported to exhibit some of these properties. Thus, the selection of the most appropriate strains to be used as starters, alone or in combination with lactic acid bacteria, is a promising research line to develop in a near future which might improve the added value of the commercialized product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aPichia membranifaciens 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantioxidants 3abeta-glucosidase 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3acommercialization 3acontainers 3afoods 3afruits 3aintestines 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3aodors 3aolives 3apackaging 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3aspoilage 3avalue added 3avitamins 3ayeasts 2aEsterasesxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aKluyveromycesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aOleaxchemistryxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPichiaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSalts 2aYeastsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2abeta-Glucosidasexmetabolism1 aRomero-Gil, V.1 aBautista-Gallego, J.1 aRodríguez-Gómez, F.1 aJiménez-Díaz, R.1 aGarcía-García, P.1 aQuerol, A.1 aGarrido-Fernández, A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 160, no. 1 p.42-49dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013700162300001600299520110000315592002801415650002001443650002201463650002401485650001801509650001801527650001401545650001301559650001401572650003701586650001501623650002201638700001901660700001501679700001501694700001401709700001801723700001701741700001301758700001901771773011201790856004801902852000901950655001201959IND50065115920221120060420.0130416e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006511592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-012-0266-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing10aAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) using a sense mitogen-activated protein kinase gene (CsNMAPK)  ap. 269-277.  aThe objective of this study was to develop an efficient regeneration and transformation protocol for cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.).

However, the influence of subsurface tile drains as a source of P, especially in agricultural areas, has received limited attention. We examined the importance of tile drain effluent in the Macatawa Watershed; this watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture and drains into hypereutrophic Lake Macatawa, which connects to Lake Michigan. Our objectives were twofold: 1) assess the importance of tile drain effluent as a source of P in the Macatawa Watershed by measuring tile drain P concentrations spatially and temporally over a one-year period; and 2) assess the ability of tile drain effluent to stimulate algal blooms using bioassays with natural phytoplankton communities. During March 2015–February 2016, P concentrations varied significantly among sample sites (SRP: <0.005 to 0.447mg/L; TP: 0.010 to 0.560mg/L), and the highest P loads occurred during the non-growing season. Annual SRP yields from the tile drain sample sites ranged from 0.002kg/ha to 0.248kg/ha, and annual TP yields ranged from 0.003kg/ha to 0.322kg/ha. SRP, on average, accounted for 60% of TP, and the SRP:TP ratio measured at the tile drain outlets was positively correlated with area drained by the tile system. Algal bioassays failed to find a positive relationship between chlorophyll a and tile drain SRP; algal community structure was dominated by diatoms, not by cyanobacteria, as expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCyanobacteria 3aagricultural land 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3abioassays 3achlorophyll 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental impact 3afreshwater ecosystems 3alakes 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apollution load 3arowcrops 3atile drainage 3awatersheds 3aLake Michigan 3aMichigan 0aTile drain effluent 0aPhosphorus 0aEutrophication 0aAlgal blooms 0aBioassay1 aSteinman, Alan D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4886-43050 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2017 Feb., v. 43, no. 1 p.50-58dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Great Lakes ResearchwJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2016.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011200169300001800281520187600299592002802175650002102203650003002224650001102254650001302265650001302278650004402291650001202335700002202347700002502369700006102394700006202455773013502517856008002652852000902732655001202741IND60606074720180918000000.0180724e20180125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060607472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b112212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadj Mohamed, Slim10aAssessing the Structure of Octastate Molecular Switches Using 1H NMR Density Functional Theory Calculations  ap. 1800-1808.  aDensity functional theory calculations are used to reveal the relationships between the structures, energies, and NMR signatures of an octastate molecular switch composed of a dithienylethene (DTE) unit covalently linked to an indolino[2,1-b]oxazolidine (BOX) moiety through an ethylenic junction. Both the DTE and BOX moieties can adopt open or closed forms. The ethylenic junction can be Z or E, but the latter has been confirmed to be, by far, more stable than the former for all BOX/DTE combinations. In addition, when the DTE is open, the two thienyl units can fold to form parallel conformers, by opposition to the antiparallel or unfolded conformers. Usually parallel conformers present a higher energy than the antiparallel ones, but in the case of compound 2 having a bulky substituent (R = pPh-SMe) on the terminal thienyl group, the enthalpy of one conformer is very close (1–2 kJ mol–¹) to that of the most stable antiparallel one, making photocyclization less efficient. These conformational differences and the presence of parallel DTE forms have been substantiated by analyzing experimental ¹H NMR chemical shifts in light of their calculated values. These ¹H NMR chemical shift calculations led to the following statements: (i) Going from state I (DTE open, BOX closed) to state II (both DTE and BOX are open) the H₈ proton of compound 1 (R = Me) is deshielded by ∼0.15 ppm. (ii) The deshielding of H₈ proton of compound 2 is larger and attains 0.41 ppm whereas H₇ is more shielded by 0.11 ppm. (iii) Then, going from compound 1 to compound 2 leads to deshielding of both H₇ and H₈ protons. As a consequence, the difference of photochromism gating efficiency among compounds 1, 2, and 3 (R = pPh-OMe) can be attributed to the stabilization of parallel conformer due to an establishment of an intramolecular interaction with BOX opening.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotons1 aQuertinmont, Jean1 aDelbaere, Stéphanie1 aSanguinet, Lionel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4334-99371 aChampagne, Benoît1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3678-88750 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 25, v. 122, no. 3 p.1800-1808dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b112213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245011500177300001600292500002000308520142000328592002801748650002001776650002001796650001901816650002401835650002001859650001301879650002201892650001601914650000901930650002401939650001001963651001101973700002501984700001902009700003102028773012102059856009002180852000902270655001202279IND60682557920221118030243.0200130e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068255792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.1992.tb00193.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrennan, John P.10aEvaluating the economic impact of quality‐reducing, seed‐borne diseases: Lessons from Karnal bunt of wheat  ap. 345-352.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEstimates of aggregate disease costs can be used for assigning research resources or to evaluate control measures. Most diseases cause production losses, but others affect quality and marketability. Seed‐borne diseases also cause problems for the seed production and distribution industry. The aim in this paper is to examine issues relating to the economic impact of a quality‐reducing, seed‐borne disease, and to highlight differences compared to non‐seed‐borne diseases affecting yield only. Economic evaluation of quality‐reducing, seed‐borne diseases needs to incorporate impacts of trading restrictions such as quarantines or embargoes imposed by purchasers. The costs of measures taken to control diseases also represent part of the economic impact of the disease. Full economic costs of a disease include the direct (yield and quality) costs and costs of the control measures. The costs of Karnal bunt of wheat in Mexico were found to include many control costs that have often been overlooked. The optimal amount of resources to invest in controlling a disease depends on the likely annual costs of the disease and of control measures. Before implementing disease control policies, both the costs and the benefits of the policies need to be considered, taking the risks of each option into account, to ensure that the policy itself does not impose greater costs than the uncontrolled disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontrol methods 3adisease control 3aeconomic costs 3aeconomic evaluation 3aeconomic impact 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3akarnal bunt 3arisk 3aseed-borne diseases 3awheat 3aMexico1 aWarham, Elizabeth J.1 aByerlee, Derek1 aHernandez‐Estrada, Julio0 tAgricultural economics.g1992 Apr., v. 6, no. 4 p.345-352dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.1992.tb00193.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245014000181300001500321520187100336592002802207650001302235650001302248650001502261650002402276650002702300650001702327650002102344650001102365650002302376650001302399650002302412650001302435650002102448653002602469653003002495653001602525653002102541653002602562700002802588773009602616856008302712852000902795655001202804IND60775790220221121220308.0220430e20220420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077579022DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1097.804242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, G.

We examine how species richness, proportion of state and country endemic species, and proportion of species in a category of conservation concern using listings in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and the Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) in 27 of 32 Mexican states are related to environmental and human demographic and socioeconomic variables. Amphibian and reptile species richness were positively related to latitude range and number of physiographic regions and negatively related to latitude. The proportion of state endemic amphibian species in a state was negatively related to latitude whereas no variables influenced the proportion in reptiles. The proportion of country endemics in a state was positively related to human population density and the number of physiographic regions and negatively related to per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and latitude range for amphibians; it was positively related to human population density and elevation range and negatively related to latitude range for reptiles. The proportion of amphibian species in an IUCN category of concern in a state was positively related to human population density and negatively related to latitude; for reptiles, it was negatively related to human population density. The proportion of SEMARNAT-listed species in a state was positively related to human population density for both amphibians and reptiles and negatively related to latitude range for amphibians. Our analyses found that larger macroecological patterns (e.g., latitudinal species gradient, heterogeneity-richness relationships) and human population density play important roles in determining the richness and conservation status of Mexican amphibians and reptiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphibia 3aReptilia 3aamphibians 3aconservation status 3agross domestic product 3aherpetofauna 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3alatitude 3apopulation density 3areptiles 3aspecies richness 0aenvironmental factors 0ahuman demographic factors 0aIUCN status 0aSEMARNAT listing 0asocioeconomic factors1 aLemos-Espinal, Julio A.0 tZooKeys.g2022 Apr. 20, v. 1097 p.85-101dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1097.804243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245020800179300002000387500001500407520137700422592002801799650001601827650002501843650001901868650001901887650000901906650001301915650001601928650001601944650002301960650002501983650002202008650002102030650001702051650001802068650002502086650004002111650004102151650005902192650003902251650004202290650003302332650004202365653002502407653003702432653001902469700002202488700002702510700002502537700002002562700002302582700003102605773013502636852000902771856007502780655001202855IND4477909320221122122912.0160905e20131030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790932DNAL7 a241346702pmid7 a10.1021/jf40268442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo Scalzo, Roberto10aVariations in the Phytochemical Contents and Antioxidant Capacity of Organically and Conventionally Grown Italian Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. subsp. botrytis): Results from a Three-Year Field Study  ap. 10335-10344.  a2019-12-05  aA three-year field study (2009–2011) was performed to evaluate phytochemicals and antioxidant capacities of two genotypes (HF1 Emeraude and the local variety, Velox) of green cauliflower grown under organic and conventional management. The conventional system increased yield, but had little effect on the dry matter, whereas the organic system increased the soluble solids. Phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity showed significant year-to-year variability. During the third year, the scarce rainfall determined a significant increase of total glucosinolates and a general decrease of antioxidants in all samples. Interestingly, in the same year organic plants were less affected by the unfavorable climatic conditions, as they increased ascorbic acid, polyphenols, and carotenoids with respect to conventional ones. The overall results for the three years showed that the two genotypes responded differently. Compared to the conventional system, Velox showed 24, 21, 13, 48, and 44% higher content of ascorbic acid, polyphenols, carotenoids, volatiles, and antioxidant capacity, respectively. In contrast, no significant increase in the phytochemicals or the antioxidant potential was found in organic Emeraude, with the exception of total volatiles (+41%). These findings suggest that organic cultivation may be highly effective for particular cauliflower genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolyphenols 3atotal soluble solids 3aphytochemicals 3aglucosinolates 3arain 3agenotype 3acarotenoids 3acauliflower 3aorganic production 3aantioxidant activity 3aBrassica oleracea 3aclimatic factors 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aAscorbic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aBrassicaxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCarotenoidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aGlucosinolatesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOrganic Agriculturexmethods 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aantioxidant capacity 0aorganic and conventional farming 0asoluble solids1 aPicchi, Valentina1 aMigliori, Carmela Anna1 aCampanelli, Gabriele1 aLeteo, Fabrizio1 aFerrari, Valentino1 aDi Cesare, Luigi

In addition, managers of intensive production facilities need accurate, real-time information on system status and performance in order to maximize their potential. This work has developed and deployed low cost short-range modules of wireless sensor network based on ZigBee standard and virtual instruments technology in order to monitor and control an aquaculture system in real time. The system consists of smart sensor nodes, coordinator/gateway node and personal computer (PC). The smart sensor nodes monitor environmental parameters such as dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH and water level using relevant sensors, transmit this information to the coordinator/gateway node through ZigBee network and receive control signals for actuator control. The coordinator/gateway node receives data acquired and sends command to PC in order to achieve human–computer visualization interface. The graphical user interface (GUI) was designed by LabWindows/CVI software platform so that users can observe, investigate and analyze the related scientific and accuracy of parameters in aquaculture environment. We have implemented our method for two sensor network nodes deployed in fish ponds and monitored the results for six months indicating that the power management and networking solutions adopted to work in practice, lead to maximize monitoring, control as well as the recording of the aquaculture system. It effectively reduces the probability of high risk of fish mortality through enabling constant monitoring of the critical parameters in the aquaculture environment. This situation in effect increases economic benefit for aquaculture, consumer confidence and safety while reducing labor cost and energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy costs 3aenvironmental factors 3aequipment 3afish 3afish ponds 3alabor 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apH 3arisk 3auser interface 3awater temperature 0aAquaculture 0aEnvironmental parameters 0aWireless sensor network 0aLabWindows/CVI 0aMonitoring and control 0aZigBee1 aZhao, Jimin1 aYang, Shifeng0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2014 Mar., v. 102 p.31-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100003100174245013700205300001400342500001500356520123100371592002801602650001301630650002701643650001401670650000901684650001301693650001901706650001901725650001101744650003501755650002801790650001601818650004001834650003101874650003901905653006001944700001402004700002502018700002902043773011602072856008902188852000902277655001202286IND60112724520221120203814.0141111e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011272452DNAL7 a231416462pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCevallos-Cevallos, Juan M.10aAdhesion and splash dispersal of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium on tomato leaflets: Effects of rdar morphotype and trichome density  ap. 58-64.  a2019-12-04  aSalmonella enterica strains with rdar (red dry and rough) and saw (smooth and white) morphotypes have previously been associated with tomato outbreaks but the dispersal mechanisms of these morphotypes are still poorly understood. In this study, Salmonella adhesion was distinguished from attachment by comparing different contact periods. Initial adhesion of rdar and saw morphotypes of Salmonella was compared in relation to tomato plants with different leaf trichome densities. Trichome densities were increased or reduced by treatment with jasmonic or salicylic acid, respectively. The overall effect of Salmonella morphotype and trichome density on splash dispersal was assessed in a rain simulator and correlated to cell hydrophobicity and initial adhesion. The presence of the rdar morphotype increased initial adhesion at high trichome densities but not at low trichome densities. Attachment of the rdar strain occurred after 30s contact time regardless of trichome density. Splash dispersal was slightly further for the saw morphotype than the rdar morphotype of S. enterica at all trichome densities. Salmonella cells of both morphotypes survived significantly better on the surface of high trichome density leaflets.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3atrichomes 3arain 3aadhesion 3ahydrophobicity 3asalicylic acid 3aleaves 2aBacterial Adhesionxphysiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDesiccation 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxphysiology 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium1 aGu, Ganyu1 aDanyluk, Michelle D.1 avan Bruggen, Ariena H.C.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 160, no. 1 p.58-64dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010800165300001600273520049900289592002800788650001300816650001400829650001600843650001400859650001000873650001000883651001000893653001100903653001700914653001400931653001900945653002600964700001700990700002001007700002001027773009701047856008301144852000901227655001201236IND60775790320221121220334.0220430e20220420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077579032DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1097.791092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Lin-Zhe10a﻿A new species of the genus Ivela Swinhoe (Lepidoptera, Erebidae, Lymantriinae) from Guangdong, China  ap. 103-116.  a﻿AbstractIvela yini sp. nov., is described from Guangdong, China based on morphological characters and molecular data.

We investigated the protective mechanisms of the B-ext and L-ext against ultraviolet A (UVA)-induced retinal photoreceptor cell damage. Cultured murine photoreceptor (661W) cells were exposed to UVA following treatment with B-ext and L-ext and their main constituents (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, trans-resveratrol, and procyanidin). B-ext, L-ext, and constituents improved cell viability and suppressed ROS generation. Phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and protein kinase B (Akt) were analyzed by Western blotting. B-ext and cyanidin inhibited phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and B-ext also inhibited phosphorylation of JNK by UVA. L-ext, trans-resveratrol, and procyanidin alleviated the reduction of phosphorylated Akt levels by UVA. Finally, a cotreatment with B-ext and L-ext showed an additive effect on cell viability. Our findings suggest that both B-ext and L-ext endow protective effects against UVA-induced retinal damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3aWestern blotting 3aadditive effect 3acell viability 3acyanidin 3adelphinidin 3amalvidin 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aphotoreceptors 3aprotective effect 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aJNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aPhotoreceptor Cells, Vertebratexcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymologyxradiation effects. 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aProtective Agentsxpharmacology 2aUltraviolet Raysxadverse effects 2aVaccinium myrtillusxchemistry 2aVaccinium vitis-idaeaxchemistry 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 0aanthocyanin 0aresveratrol 0aprocyanidin 0aretinal photoreceptor 0aultraviolet A exposure1 aTsuruma, Kazuhiro1 aTanaka, Junji1 aKakino, Mamoru1 aKobayashi, Saori1 aShimazawa, Masamitsu1 aHara, Hideaki0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Oct. 30, v. 61, no. 43 p.10345-10353dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf402772h3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02008naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245005600173300001600229500002000245520102000265592002801285650001501313650001401328650002301342650002201365650001301387650001101400651001101411700001501422773012101437856009001558961001301648852000901661655001201670IND60682558120221118030308.0200130e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068255812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.1992.tb00191.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinar, Ariel10aAdoption and abandonment of irrigation technologies  ap. 315-332.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdoption and abandonment processes are analyzed for seven irrigation technologies. A procedure is developed to estimate the technology cycle and applied to data available for citrus groves in several regions of Israel, and Gaza. The technology cycle was used to estimate diffusion‐abandonment patterns for several irrigation technologies that have been abandoned. Results suggest that the technology cycle is unique to each technology and similar in length for all regions. Results predict the year of full abandonment of each technology. For modern technologies still in the diffusion phase, a logistic equation was fitted to the aggregated data. Results suggest that diffusion is significantly affected by economic variables such as water price, crop yield price, and subsidy for irrigation equipment. Use of the estimated equations for policy purposes suggest that water price and subsidy for irrigation equipment can be used to control the diffusion process (speed and ceiling) of the irrigation technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3aequations 3airrigation systems 3aissues and policy 3aorchards 3aprices 3aIsrael1 aYaron, Dan0 tAgricultural economics.g1992 Apr., v. 6, no. 4 p.315-332dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.1992.tb00191.x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ERS  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010000164300001600264500001500280520128400295592002801579650002801607650002301635650001301658650001301671650001401684650001601698650002101714650001301735650002501748650002401773650001801797650002601815650002501841650002501866650002001891650001401911650001101925650002301936650002701959650001301986653002201999653001302021653001702034653001702051653001202068700001602080700001702096700001302113773010902126856008602235852000902321655001202330IND60525870220221119115739.0190319e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052587022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhu10aEffect of foliar treatment of sodium selenate on postharvest decay and quality of tomato fruits  ap. 304-310.  a2019-12-06  aPostharvest decay and quality deterioration of fruits are responsible for significant economic losses in the tomato industry. Selenium (Se) is an important microelement due to its antioxidant properties that allows detoxifying various reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, the effect of a foliar treatment of Se prior to fruit development on the subsequent postharvest decay and quality of tomato fruits was investigated. Foliar treatment of 1mgL−1 sodium selenate at the time of fruit onset and development effectively controlled gray mold rot caused by Botrytis cinerea on both inoculated and naturally infected tomato fruit. Se treatment reduced lipid peroxidation, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, and increased the concentration of non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced ascorbate and reduced glutathione in the tomato fruits. Se also contributed to the maintenance of fruit quality during storage. The results suggested that Se stimulated the antioxidant defense system in tomato plants, thus making the fruits more resistant to postharvest decay caused by gray mold. Selenium treatment represents a promising strategy for managing postharvest decay and maintaining the quality of tomato fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3areactive oxygen species 3alipid peroxidation 3aselenium 3atomatoes 3aselenates 3aglutathione 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aindustry 3apostharvest diseases 3afinancial economics 3afruit quality 3apostharvest treatment 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzyme activity 3agray mold 3afruits 3afoliar application 3aglutathione peroxidase 3afruiting 0aPostharvest decay 0aSelenium 0aTomato fruit 0aantioxidants 0aQuality1 aChen, Yanli1 aZhang, Xueji1 aLi, Miao0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 198 p.304-310dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245010100212300002000313520149500333592002801828650001901856650002501875650001601900650001101916650002001927650000901947650001301956650002401969650001201993650002302005653001902028653001902047653001902066653002202085653002302107700003202130700002002162700002302182773014702205856008602352852000902438655001202447IND60787266820221116205052.0220808e20220729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078726682DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c029312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarajzadeh, Rouhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3497-052610aExergy Return on Exergy Investment and CO₂ Intensity of the Underground Biomethanation Process  ap. 10318-10326.  aThis paper presents an assessment of the life-cycle exergetic efficiency and CO₂ footprint of the underground biomethanation process. The subsurface formation, hosting microorganisms required for the reaction, is utilized to convert CO₂ and green (produced from renewable energy) hydrogen to the so-called “green” or synthetic methane. The net exergy gain and CO₂ intensity of the biomethanation process are compared to the alternative options of (1) green H₂ storage (no energy upgrading process to CH₄) and (2) fossil-based CH₄ with carbon capture and storage (CCS), i.e., blue CH₄. It is found that with the current state of the technology and within the assumptions of this study, the exergy return on the exergy invested for underground biomethanation does not outperform the direct storage and utilization of green H₂. The maximum exergetic efficiency of the biomethanation process is calculated to be 15–33% for electricity and 36–47% for heating, while the overall exergetic efficiency of the direct use of H₂ for electricity is estimated to be between 20 and 61%. Moreover, the energy produced from the underground biomethanation process has the largest CO₂ intensity among the studied options. Depending on the technology used in the CCS and hydrogen production stages, the CO₂ intensity of the electricity generated from synthetic CH₄ can be as large as 142 g CO₂/MJe, which is at least 56–73% larger than those of the two other studied cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aelectricity 3aexergy 3agreen chemistry 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3amethane production 0aenergy storage 0abiomethanation 0aclimate change 0asynthetic methane 0asubsurface reactor1 aLomans, Bartholomeus Petrus1 aHajibeygi, Hadi1 aBruining, Johannes0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 July 29, v. 10, no. 31 p.10318-10326dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c029313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013500167300001400302520156300316592002801879650002601907650001501933650001501948650002001963650001001983650001201993650002602005650002302031650001302054650001902067650002402086650002302110650001702133651001202150653002602162653002702188653001702215653003102232653002102263700002002284700001602304700001502320700001602335700001502351700001602366700001802382700001802400700001502418773012302433856008502556852000902641655001202650IND60541176920221119152616.0190318e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054117692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelaqziz, S.10aIrrigation scheduling of a classical gravity network based on the Covariance Matrix Adaptation – Evolutionary Strategy algorithm  ap. 64-72.  aIrrigation scheduling is an important task that significantly influences water conservation and crop production. For most gravity irrigation networks located in semi-arid areas, irrigation scheduling is based on available water regardless of crops water needs. The objective of this study is to propose a new approach for optimizing irrigation scheduling taking into account crops water demand, based on the Covariance Matrix Adaptation – Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) evolutionary strategy algorithm. The objective function, that must be minimized, of this optimization problem is defined as the sum of two terms. The first term is the Irrigation Priority Index (IPI) which characterizes the degree of imbalance between water stress and irrigation timing of the plot. The second one takes into account the various constraints that relate to canals capacity, tasks timing, geographical distances and canal flow rate variations. The approach was applied to an agricultural sector located at 40km from the city of Marrakech (Morocco). Optimal schedule for the third irrigation, of the 2011–2012 agricultural season, is provided and the comparisons between schedules before and after optimization are made. The obtained results demonstrate that such approach allows reducing the proportion of late irrigated plots (from 22% to 8%) and increasing the proportion of plots irrigated at an appropriate time (from 28% to 40%). We conclude that this approach can be considered as an efficient tool for planning irrigation schedules by considering crops water needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aalgorithms 3acovariance 3acrop production 3acrops 3agravity 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation systems 3aplanning 3asemiarid zones 3asystem optimization 3awater conservation 3awater stress 3aMorocco 0aIrrigation scheduling 0aEvolutionary algorithm 0aOptimization 0aGravity irrigation network 0aIrrigation round1 aMangiarotti, S.1 aLe Page, M.1 aKhabba, S.1 aEr-Raki, S.1 aAgouti, T.1 aDrapeau, L.1 aKharrou, M.H.1 aEl Adnani, M.1 aJarlan, L.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2014 Mar., v. 102 p.64-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245023600174300001600410520131700426592002801743650002301771650002001794650001601814650001201830650001601842650001401858650002701872650001601899650001601915650001101931650002301942650001301965650001401978650001501992650000902007650001302016650001602029650001302045653002002058653001202078653001502090653002002105653002402125653001602149700001802165700001802183773013702201856008202338852000902420655001202429IND60622070920221119203926.0181123e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062207092DNAL7 a10.1177/1082013200006005052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Granados, A.M.10aCalcium and phosphorus bioavailability in rats consuming oil from either raw sardines or sardines fried in olive oil Biodisponibilidad de calcio y fósforo en ratas alimentadas con grasa de sardina cruda o frita con aceite de oliva  ap. 387-397.  aThree diets were prepared containing 8% olive oil (OO), fresh sardine (Clupea pilchardus) oil (SO), and oil from sardines fried in olive oil (FSO), respectively. After in vitro digestion, soluble (dialyzed and nondialyzed) and insoluble Ca and P fractions were determined. In vitro Ca availability tended to be higher with SO, and even more so with FSO, than with OO, while that of P increased only slightly with FSO. Growing rats consumed the diets for 28 days. Food intake and body weight increased with FSO more than with OO, but decreased markedly with SO, due to an imbalance in the n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio. Absorption efficiencies of Ca and P were higher with SO than with the other diets during days 5-12. Because urinary Ca excretion was also greater with SO, apparent retention of both Ca and P was lower with this diet. With SO, carcass content of Ca and P was low but their concentrations were high. Apparent retention of these minerals and their carcass content were similar or higher with FSO than with OO. Therefore, although availability of Ca and P from raw and fried sardine oil diets was sufficient in vitro, consumption of raw sardine oil as the only dietary fat produced changes in calcium and phosphorus bioavailability, an effect of sardine oil which disappeared after frying in olive oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSardina pilchardus 3abioavailability 3abody weight 3acalcium 3adietary fat 3aexcretion 3afatty acid composition 3afood intake 3afried foods 3afrying 3ain vitro digestion 3aminerals 3aolive oil 3aphosphorus 3arats 3araw fish 3asardine oil 3asardines 0abioavailability 0acalcium 0aphosphorus 0an-3 fatty acids 0afrying in olive oil 0asardine oil1 aVaquero, M.P.1 aNavarro, M.P.0 tFood science and technology international.g2000 Oct., v. 6, no. 5 p.387-397dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013200006005053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015600165520142600321592002801747650001701775650003101792650001501823650001501838650002401853650001701877650002101894650001801915650001101933650001101944650001301955650003901968650002502007650001502032653000802047653002302055653002202078653001902100653002202119700001602141700002002157700001602177700002002193700001902213700001902232773012302251856008102374852000902455655001202464IND60644856520221118121450.0190711e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064485652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMudgil, Priti10aMolecular binding mechanism and identification of novel anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory bioactive peptides from camel milk protein hydrolysates  aCamel milk protein hydrolysates (CMPHs) were investigated for anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory activities using in-vitro assays. CMPHs with potent ACE inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities were subjected to peptide identification and their possible binding mechanism to ACE were depicted via molecular docking. Papain generated CMPHs showed higher degradation of proteins compared to bromelain and alcalase generated CMPHs as depicted in SDS-PAGE profile. Dramatic increase in ACE inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activity was demonstrated in CMPHs with highest activity for papain and alcalase generated hydrolysates, respectively. Based on peptide ranking score, a total of 20, 3 and 43 peptides were potentially regarded as bioactive peptides in hydrolysates A9, B9 and P9, respectively. Binding studies based on pepsite-2 modelling suggested that among 20 potential bioactive peptides in A9 hydrolysate, only 1 (AEWLHDWKL) showed high binding towards three catalytic sites of ACE. While, among 43 bioactive peptides of P9, 14 peptides were found to be potent binder to ACE catalytic sites. Further insight into molecular mechanism of binding revealed that 4 peptides were able to bind to active site of ACE with good docking scores and MM-GBSA binding energies. Overall, the current report remains among very few reports on identification and molecular docking of ACE inhibitory peptides from camel milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abromelains 3acamel milk 3acomputer simulation 3ahydrolysates 3ain vitro studies 3amilk proteins 3amodels 3apapain 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein hydrolysates 3asubtilisin 0aACE 0aCamel milk protein 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aNovel peptides 0aMolecular docking1 aBaby, Bincy1 aNgoh, Ying-Yuan1 aKamal, Hina1 aVijayan, Ranjit1 aGan, Chee-Yuen1 aMaqsood, Sajid0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Sept., v. 112 p.108193-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010900165300001600274520149700290592002801787650004401815650002301859650002501882650002301907650002201930650001101952650000701963650001001970650001601980650002001996650000902016650002102025700001502046700001902061700002402080700001802104773010202122856004802224852000902272655001202281IND50073059320221117170051.0140215e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007305932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-013-0608-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongling14aThe influence of thermal-hydro-mechanical processing on chemical characterization of Tsuga heterophylla   ap. 373-392.  aViscoelastic thermal compression (VTC) is a type of thermal-hydro-mechanical (THM) processing that requires only a short processing time. THM processing causes some chemical transformations, the nature and extent of hydro-thermolysis depends on the special treatment conditions and the chemical nature of wood species. In the present study, the chemical transformations of the cell wall components and wood extractives during VTC treatment were investigated, and correlation between chemical characterizations and observed property changes was analyzed. For this purpose, the content of extractives and pH values were determined, and FTIR analysis was performed on extractable substances, extract-free wood, holocellulose, α-cellulose and lignin. Two temperatures and two steam exposure times were adopted to determine the influence of processing conditions on chemical characterization of Tsuga heterophylla. The results revealed that THM treatment caused a series of chemical reactions in extractives. Treatment temperature and conditioning time have significant influence on chemical changes of extractives. For all of the VTC treatments used in this study, no significant changes occurred in the lignin and α-cellulose components. The only significant chemical changes occurred in the hemicelluloses, which were primarily reduction of carbonyl and acetyl functional groups. This study also confirmed that the chemical transformation of wood correlates with property changes of VTC wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aTsuga heterophylla 3acell wall components 3achemical reactions 3aexposure duration 3alignin 3apH 3asteam 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity 3awood 3awood extractives1 aShang, Jin1 aChen, Xianqing1 aKamke, Frederick A.1 aGuo, Kangquan0 tWood science and technology.g2014 Mar., v. 48, no. 2 p.373-392dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-013-0608-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014200171300001600313520188400329592002802213650000902241650000902250650001702259650002602276650001202302650002402314650001302338650001102351650001502362650002002377650002102397650001102418650001602429650002102445650001902466650001702485650002702502650001602529650001702545651001202562651001502574651001102589653002302600653002802623653001302651653001202664653002002676700002102696773015102717856008202868852000902950655001202959IND60680987620221121043808.0200113e20200108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068098762DNAL7 a10.2317/0022-8567-92.2.4682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCoshum, Shaun M.10aLand Conversion for Solar Facilities and Urban Sprawl in Southwest Deserts Causes Different Amounts of Habitat Loss for Ashmeadiella Bees  ap. 468-478.  aLand conversion for human use poses one of the greatest threats to terrestrial ecosystems and causes habitat loss for a myriad of species. The development of large solar energy facilities and urban sprawl are converting wild lands in the Southwest deserts of the USA for human use and resulting in habitat loss for desert species. This is in part due to the Southwest deserts being identified as having high renewable energy potential while urban areas expand into areas supporting high biodiversity. Previous studies have quantified development within some of these biodiversity hotspots, but none have investigated direct species-specific habitat loss for different species of pollinators. Native bees are poorly studied, and therefore it is difficult to know how much habitat has been lost. We quantified the amount of land conversion occurring between 2010 and 2015 in Clark County, NV, Mojave County, AZ, and San Bernardino County, CA to assess direct loss of potential-habitat for species in the Southwest deserts. Using Satellite images, we quantified the direct habitat loss to solar facilities and estimated other land conversion due to urban sprawl using USDA land cover data. We created eco-niche models in MaxENT for ten Ashmeadiella bees, to estimate the amount of direct, potential-habitat loss caused by solar development and urban expansion. Our data suggest species are not equally affected by land conversion in the Southwest deserts and direct, potential-habitat loss to urban sprawl is much greater than the loss due to solar facilities. Furthermore, our data show each species incurs different amounts of habitat loss to both solar development and urban expansion as well as between counties. These results should assist in pollinator conservation program development by illustrating land conversion can vary between local governments and pollinator species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3abees 3abiodiversity 3aconservation programs 3adeserts 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alocal government 3amodels 3apollinators 3aprogram planning 3aremote sensing 3asolar energy 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aArizona 3aCalifornia 3aNevada 0aSustainable energy 0apollinator conservation 0aland use 0aecology 0aland conversion1 aGeber, Monica A.0 tJournal of the Kansas Entomological Society.g2020 Jan. 8, v. 92, no. 2 p.468-478dKansas Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44728x0022-85677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2317/0022-8567-92.2.4683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008600176300001600262520180300278592002802081650002902109650002302138650002302161650002002184650001402204650001502218650001502233650001002248650002202258650001202280650002602292650001302318650001502331650000902346650002202355651001702377651001202394651001102406651001102417651001302428700001702441700001802458773010402476856008102580852000902661655001202670IND60112724920221122135049.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011272492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2012.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamirez-Villegas, Julian10aAnalysis of threats to South American flora and its implications for conservation  ap. 337-348.  aSouth America houses a significant proportion of the world's plant diversity and therefore merits conservation attention. However, ongoing habitat fragmentation, degradation and destruction of natural habitats threaten biodiversity. A set of seven threats to natural ecosystems derived from a previous study (Jarvis et al. 2010), combined with a dataset of occurrences from 16,339 species, and also with the World Database of Protected Areas were used to analyse the patterns of threats to flora in South America and its conservation. Species richness per ∼50km side cell ranged from 1 to 2149 taxa, but with most of the areas presenting between 1 and 58 taxa. Population accessibility, expansion of agriculture and grazing pressure were found to be the key drivers of immediate extinction risk. A considerable (78.4%) number of species presented at least one population under high threat due to the expansion and intensification of these anthropogenic activities. In addition, some 13.8% of the analysed species presented up to 80% of their populations at risk of extinction (high threat index). On the conservation side, 82.3% of the analysed taxa have at least one population occurring within a protected site. However, it is important to note that for a protected area system to be effective and efficient, the conservation of within-taxon genetic diversity is required. The expansion, monitoring and strengthening of 24 existing protected areas holding up to 70% of South American plant diversity is suggested; as is the revision of seven additional sites where up to 200 species not currently conserved are present. Critical areas to monitor, expand and strengthen are mainly located in the Ecuadorian and Colombian Andes, southern Paraguay, the Guyana shield, southern Brazil, and Bolivia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aat-risk population 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3aflora 3agenetic variation 3agrazing 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3amonitoring 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3aAndes region 3aBolivia 3aBrazil 3aGuyana 3aParaguay1 aJarvis, Andy1 aTouval, Jerry0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2012 Dec., v. 20, no. 6 p.337-348dElsevier GmbHx1617-13817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2012.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010500168300001400273520158100287592002801868650001401896650001001910650002501920650001101945650001601956650001201972650001001984650001101994650001202005650001402017650001902031650001102050650001502061650001802076650001902094650002502113650001402138650001802152650001502170651001402185653001402199653001202213653002102225653001702246653001502263653001802278700003202296700001702328773016802345856008202513852000902595655001202604IND60611119620221122231425.0180830e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061111962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2017.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrothers, Soren12aA decline in benthic algal production may explain recent hypoxic events in Lake Erie's central basin  ap. 73-78.  aSince the late 1990s, the central basin of Lake Erie has reputedly experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of hypoxic events. However, total phosphorus (TP) loading, in-lake TP concentrations, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) have all declined in the central basin since the 1970s. Water clarity in this basin has declined from the 1970s to 2000s despite the invasion of dreissenid mussels around 1990. In shallow lakes, declines in benthic primary production (PP) can generate positive feedback loops between the internal loading of nutrients/dissolved organic carbon and hypoxic/anoxic conditions in the water column. Such a hypoxia-inducing mechanism driven by declines in benthic PP has not been explored in Lake Erie. To test if a decline in benthic PP might explain hypoxic events in the central basin of Lake Erie, we calculated the inter-decadal changes in benthic and planktonic algal production in this basin from the 1970s to the 2000s. Primary production models using water column Chl a concentrations and light attenuation indicated that benthic PP represents roughly 10% of the basin's total areal PP. However, our calculations show that benthic PP declined from approximately 540 to 200gC/m²y since the 1970s. We propose that a decline in benthic PP may have played a key mechanistic role in the transition from externally-induced hypoxia (i.e. watershed nutrient loading fueling phytoplankton production) in the 1970s and 80s to internally-induced hypoxia (sediment resuspension and internal loading) since the late 1990s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDreissena 3aalgae 3aanaerobic conditions 3abasins 3achlorophyll 3ahypoxia 3alakes 3amodels 3amussels 3anutrients 3aorganic carbon 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apollution load 3aprimary productivity 3asediments 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aLake Erie 0aLake Erie 0aHypoxia 0aInternal loading 0aResuspension 0aPeriphyton 0aPhytoplankton1 aVadeboncoeur, Yvonne Marie,1 aSibley, Paul0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2017 June, v. 43, no. 3 p.73-78dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Great Lakes ResearchwJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2017.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009800167300002000265520154700285592002801832596009801860596009801958596009802056596009802154596009002252596010402342650001902446650002002465650002002485650002302505653001702528653001802545653002502563653002402588700001202612700001602624700001402640700001402654700005202668700005702720700005602777773014702833856008602980852000903066655001203075IND60787267120221116205127.0220808e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078726712DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c030722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinjie10aMechanical Destabilization and Cage Transformations in Water Vacancy-Contained CO₂ Hydrates  ap. 10339-10350.  aClathrate hydrates show wide applications in energy recovery and storage, CO₂ capture and storage, and other sustainable technologies. Water vacancy in clathrate hydrates is a common defect; however, its effects on the mechanical properties of clathrate hydrates, especially CO₂ hydrates, have not been well studied. Herein, the mechanical characteristics of CO₂ hydrates with three different types of water vacancy defects are investigated for the first time through molecular dynamics simulations with several popular water force fields. It turns out that the mechanical properties of CO₂ clathrate hydrate vary with the type of water vacancy and water force field. Upon critical strains, a variety of unconventional cages of 4²5⁸6², 4²5⁸6³, 4²5⁸6⁴, 4¹5¹⁰6², 4¹5¹⁰6³, and 4¹5¹⁰6⁴ form, of which 4¹5¹⁰6² predominates and is identified to be transient and a clathrate intermediate in forming 4²5⁸6², 4²5⁸6³, and 4²5⁸6⁴. Moreover, diverse cage transformations of 5¹²6² ↔ 4¹5¹⁰6³, ↔ 4¹5¹⁰6², ↔ 4²5⁸6³, ↔ 4²5⁸6⁴ and 5¹² ↔ 4¹5¹⁰6², ↔ 4²5⁸6² occur via two distinct transformation mechanisms including insertion/removal and rotation of a pair of water molecules. This study provides new perspectives on the mechanics and microstructural transformations of CO₂ hydrate, which are crucial for evaluating the formation and mechanical stability of CO₂ hydrate-bearing sediments as well as the CO₂ geological storage by hydrate-based technologies.  aPublisher supplied data  a11772278cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a11904300cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a12002350cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a12172314cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a20192BCBL23029cGovernment of Jiangxi Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003412  a20720210025cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy recovery 3agreen chemistry 3amolecular dynamics 0aCO2 hydrates 0awater vacancy 0amechanical stability 0acage transformation1 aFu, Ran1 aLin, Yanwen1 aShi, Qiao1 aLiu, Yisi1 aLi, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2748-794X1 aZhang, Zhisen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8638-09931 aWu, Jianyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9094-48350 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 July 22, v. 10, no. 31 p.10339-10350dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c030723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017700170300001600347520101500363592002801378650001701406650001701423650001701440650001701457650002401474650002601498650001501524650001501539650001801554650000901572650001601581653001101597653001101608653001101619653001101630653000801641653000901649653000801658653000801666653001001674653002301684653001501707653001501722653002201737700001401759700001901773700001701792700001901809700001601828700001901844773010001863856008701963852000902050655001202059IND60611964120221119143342.0201125e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061196412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.05.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiao-Jiao12aA feasibility study of producing a peanut oil matrix candidate reference material and its application to support monitoring of aflatoxins statues for public health purposes  ap. 395-401.  aThe first peanut oil reference materials in naturally contaminated aflatoxins was developed, because of the high consumption of this product and the potential risk associated herewith.

In the device, fluidic microchannels exhibit a characteristic cross-sectional profile arising from distinct three-dimensional (3D) microelectrodes featuring sidewall undercuts readily integrated through a single-mask process. The structure leverages mainly electrothermal convective rolls that efficiently manifest themselves in physiological fluids and yet have received inadequate attention for the application of plasmapheresis due to concerns over Joule heating. Using this device, we show that such convective rolls not only lead to plasma extraction at a high yield and purity but also deliver plasma at an acceptable quality with no evidence of hemolytic stress or protein denaturation. Specifically, plasma from 1.5 μL of whole blood diluted to 4% hematocrit in a high-conductivity buffer (1.5 S/m) is extracted in a continuous flow at a fraction of 70% by using a peak voltage of ±10 Vₚ applied at 650 kHz; the extracted plasma is nearly 99% pure, as shown by a rigorous assessment using flow cytometry. The plasmas obtained using this device and using conventional centrifugation and sedimentation are of comparable quality as revealed by absorbance and circular dichroism spectra despite thermal gradients; however, these gradients effectively drive electrothermal bulk flows, as assessed using the microparticle image velocity technique. The device achieves high target molecule recovery efficiency, delivering about 97% of the proteins detected in the plasma obtained using sedimentation. The utility of the extracted plasma is further validated based on the detection of prostate-specific antigen at clinically relevant levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3ablood 3acentrifugation 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aflow cytometry 3aheat 3ahematocrit 3aplasmapheresis 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprotein denaturation 3aproteins 3atemperature profiles1 aHe, Minghao1 aQiu, Huihe1 aYobas, Levent0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 May 17, v. 88, no. 10 p.5197-5204dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b002153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245016000158300001800318520107400336592002801410596009801438596009301536650001901629650001001648650001501658650001701673650001201690650001201702650001701714650001901731650002001750650001401770650001701784650001801801650003001819650001401849650001601863650001901879653001801898653000901916653002401925653001901949653002901968700001301997700001402010700001602024700001302040700001502053700005402068773014702122856008102269852000902350655001202359IND60778886620221121031709.0220601e20220519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077888662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.2c020792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Sen10aPolyphenolic Extracts of Coffee Cherry Husks Alleviated Colitis-Induced Neural Inflammation via NF-κB Signaling Regulation and Gut Microbiota Modification  ap. 6467-6477.  aCoffee cherry husks, the main byproduct of coffee production, contain an abundance of polyphenols. In this study, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice were used to study the protective effects of polyphenolic extracts of coffee cherry husks (CCHP) on inflammation. The results indicated that CCHP administration alleviated the histological changes of DSS-induced colitis in mice and downregulated the mRNA level of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and Cox-2. Interestingly, CCHP inhibited the activation of microglia and suppressed neural inflammation in the brain. The TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB signaling pathway was examined and found to be inhibited by CCHP. Furthermore, a determination of the gut microbiota showed that an alteration of microbiota induced by DSS was restored by CCHP, including the decrease of the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and the increase of Bacteroidota. In conclusion, our results revealed the great potential of CCHP to alleviate brain inflammation in colitis mice by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and regulating gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data  a31901609cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a20060502100cCapacity-building project of local universities of SSTCdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aProteobacteria 3abrain 3abyproducts 3acoffee beans 3acolitis 3adextran 3aencephalitis 3afood chemistry 3agene expression 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aneuroglia 3apolyphenols 3asodium sulfate 0aacute colitis 0aCCHP 0aneural inflammation 0agut microbiota 0aNF-κB signaling pathway1 aChen, Yu1 aZhang, Yu1 aLv, Hongyan1 aLuo, Lei1 aWang, Shuo1 aGuan, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8004-48440 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 May 19, v. 70, no. 21 p.6467-6477dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c020793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245008700202520110000289592002801389596002401417650001601441650002101457650001101478650001401489650001201503700005701515773007801572856007701650852000901727655001201736IND60624005320221121000909.0181203e20180305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062400532DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/27129452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Ashlee N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8941-857410aEvidence for Interspecific Brood Parasite Detection and Removal in Burying Beetles  aWe tested whether brood parasitism could be successful between two co-occurring species of burying beetles, Nicrophorus guttula and Nicrophorus marginatus, and whether these species exhibit an adaptive response to brood parasitism by detecting and removing parasites. We cross-fostered larvae between broods of the two species and created mixed-species broods to simulate the addition of brood parasites. Brood parasites survived in both species’ broods. Nicrophorus marginatus culled 86% of brood parasites compared to 56% of their own larvae, and N. guttula culled 50% of brood parasites compared to 22% of their own larvae. Additionally, N. guttula brood parasites were significantly smaller than N. guttula that were raised by N. guttula parents, but N. marginatus brood parasites were significantly larger than N. marginatus that were raised by N. marginatus parents. This paper provides the first evidence that burying beetles can discriminate between their own larvae and other species’ larvae. We suggest that brood parasitism may be the selective force responsible for this ability.  aPublisher supplied data  cCharles Redd Center 3aNicrophorus 3abrood parasitism 3alarvae 3aparasites 3aparents1 aBelk, Mark C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0576-07170 tPsyche.g2018 Mar. 5, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:jnl19278x1687-74387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/27129453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011900168300001400287520222600301592002802527650003202555650001802587650002602605650002802631650001402659650002002673650001602693650002102709650001602730650002102746650000902767650001802776650001302794650001302807650001502820650001202835650002702847650002202874653001302896653003802909653001402947653001502961653001002976700002102986700002103007700003003028700006203058700002203120700002803142773010403170856008403274852000903358655001203367IND60530697920221118170400.0180905e20170205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053069792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aČerná, Hana,10aProteomics offers insight to the mechanism behind Pisum sativum L. response to pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV)  ap. 78-88.  aPea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV) significantly reduces yields in a broad spectra of legumes. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor has been shown to confer resistance to this pathogen, thus implying that translation and proteome dynamics play a role in resistance. This study presents the results of a proteome-wide analysis of Pisum sativum L. response to PSbMV infection. LC–MS profiling of two contrasting pea cultivars, resistant (B99) and susceptible (Raman) to PSbMV infection, detected >2300 proteins, 116 of which responded to PSbMV ten and/or twenty days post-inoculation. These differentially abundant proteins are involved in number of processes that have previously been reported in the plant-pathogen response, including protein and amino acid metabolism, stress signaling, redox homeostasis, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism. We complemented our proteome-wide analysis work with targeted analyses of free amino acids and selected small molecules, fatty acid profiling, and enzyme activity assays. Data from these additional experiments support our findings and validate the biological relevance of the observed proteome changes. We found surprising similarities in the resistant and susceptible cultivars, which implies that a seemingly unaffected plant, with no detectable levels of PSbMV, actively suppresses viral replication.Plant resistance to PSbMV is connected to translation initiation factors, yet the processes involved are still poorly understood at the proteome level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of the global proteomic response to PSbMV in plants. The combination of label-free LC–MS profiling and two contrasting cultivars (resistant and susceptible) provided highly sensitive snapshots of protein abundance in response to PSbMV infection. PSbMV is a member of the largest family of plant viruses and our results are in accordance with previously characterized potyvirus-responsive proteomes. Hence, the results of this study can further extend our knowledge about these pathogens. We also show that even though no viral replication is detected in the PSbMV-resistant cultivar B99, it is still significantly affected by PSbMV inoculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPea seed-borne mosaic virus 3aPisum sativum 3aamino acid metabolism 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acids 3afree amino acids 3ahomeostasis 3alipid metabolism 3apeas 3aplant viruses 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asurveys 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirus replication 0aProteome 0aPea seed-borne mosaic virus PSbMV 0aPotyvirus 0aResistance 0aLC-MS1 aČerný, Martin,1 aHabánová, Hana1 aŠafářová, D.q(Dana),1 aAbushamsiya, Kifah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8260-67801 aNavrátil, Milan,1 aBrzobohatý, Břetislav0 tJournal of proteomics.g2017 Feb. 05, v. 153 p.78-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245016600187520153700353592002801890650001601918650001801934650002201952650001301974650001601987650001002003650001802013650002002031650002302051650002002074650000902094650001402103650001402117650001802131650001102149650002502160650002902185650002002214650001602234650001702250650001602267653001802283653001602301653002602317653002202343700002702365700003302392700002802425700003702453700002502490700003902515773009902554856009002653852000902743655001202752IND60707409120221120212721.0201104e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070740912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7358232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArriaga-Hernández, Daniela10aFish meal replacement by soybean products in aquaculture feeds for white snook, Centropomus viridis: Effect on growth, diet digestibility, and digestive capacity  aA feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of the partial replacement of fish meal (FM) by either soybean meal (SBM) or soybean protein concentrate (SPC) on growth, feed utilization, apparent digestibility (AD), and digestive capacity in the white snook, Centropomus viridis. Seven experimental diets were formulated by replacing 0, 15, 30, or 45% of FM protein with either SBM or SPC; the control diet contained FM as the primary protein source. Juvenile fish (3.35 ± 0.24 g average initial body weight) were fed the experimental diets (n = 45 per diet) twice a day for 109 days. Fish fed the SBM-30 diet showed the highest weight gain, while those fed the SPC-45 diet showed lower body weight compared to the control group. Fish fed the SBM diets showed higher protein efficiency ratio and lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) than fish fed the SPC diets. Body fat content of fish fed the SBM or SPC diets was higher than the control group. Moreover, a reduction in pepsin activity in SPC-15 group, as well as a decrease in intestinal α-amylase activity and total alkaline proteases of pyloric caeca from SBM-30 and SPC-45 groups compared to control diet was observed. These results confirm those obtained in the AD assay, where apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) in the experimental groups were higher than in the control group. Our results indicate that a 15–45% replacement of FM by SBM can be made in aquafeeds for juvenile C. viridis without affecting its growth, digestibility, or digestive capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentropomus 3aalpha-amylase 3aaquaculture feeds 3abody fat 3abody weight 3acecum 3adigestibility 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish meal 3ajuveniles 3alipid content 3apepsin 3aprotein concentrates 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aprotein sources 3asoy protein 3asoybean meal 3aweight gain 0aPlant protein 0aWhite snook 0aFish meal replacement 0aDigestive enzymes1 aHernández, Crisantema1 aMartínez-Montaño, Emmanuel1 aIbarra-Castro, Leonardo1 aLizárraga-Velázquez, Esmeralda1 aLeyva-López, Nayely1 aChávez Sánchez, María Cristina,0 tAquaculture.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 530 p.735823-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7358233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010500165520160600270592002801876650001801904650001301922650002101935650002101956650001601977650001701993650001302010650002102023650001102044650001402055650001502069650000702084650002402091650002402115650001502139650002202154650001802176650002302194650001602217653001402233653001702247653002302264653002302287653002202310653001402332700002102346700001702367700002502384773012502409856008302534852000902617655001202626IND60776533320221118220450.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077653332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1046052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaş, Akgül13aAn in-depth study on post-harvest storage conditions depending on putrescine treatments of kiwifruit  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effects of different doses (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 mM) of putrescine treatments on the post-harvest weight loss, decay, firmness, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, pH, respiration rate, L* , a* , b* , Chroma and hue angle and phenolic compounds, organic acids and vitamin C content of kiwi (cv. Hayward. The fruits were kept in a cold storage at 0 ± 0.5 °C and 90 ± 5% relative humidity for 140 days. The weight loss, soluble solids content, increases in respiration rate and high decreases in fruit density, firmness, and titratable acidity were detected in the control group fruits during storage. Among the putrescine treatments, 1.2 mM concentration was observed to be more effective than other concentrations and providing better protection for organic acids, while treatment with 2.0 mM was determined to be providing more protection in preventing the loss of vitamin C. The dominant organic acid of kiwi was determined as citric acid, followed by malic acid, succinic acid and vitamin C. Similarly, it was determined that treatment with 2.0 mM putrescine prevented the loss of phenolic acid and flavonoid more than the control group and other treatments. It was determined that the most common compound found among phenolic acids in kiwi was protocatechuic acid, followed by chlorogenic acid. At day 140 of storage, the minimum change was observed in protocatechuic acid with the application of 1.6 mM putrescine dose, while chlorogenic acid and catechin were the most conserved compounds under treatment with of 2.0 mM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acatechin 3acell respiration 3achlorogenic acid 3acitric acid 3acold storage 3afirmness 3afood composition 3afruits 3akiwifruit 3amalic acid 3apH 3apostharvest storage 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aputrescine 3arelative humidity 3asuccinic acid 3atitratable acidity 3aweight loss 0aKiwifruit 0aPreservation 0aQuality properties 0aPhenolic compounds 0aOrganic compounds 0aVitamin C1 aBerk, Selma Kuru1 aKibar, Hakan1 aGündoğdu, Muttalip0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 Aug., v. 111 p.104605-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1046053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245009100180500001900271520102200290592002801312650001501340650001701355650001301372650001001385650000701395650002101402650001601423653001201439653001501451700002401466700002301490773010101513856008901614852000901703655001201712IND60695368920221120034635.0200614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069536892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2020.1040412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Sosa, Pablo10aControlled lacustrine microcosms show a brGDGT response to environmental perturbations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBranched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) have proven useful for paleoclimate reconstructions. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which these biomarkers respond to the environment and the identity of the source organisms, remain poorly understood. These gaps in knowledge have prevented the study of brGDGTs in culture, thereby limiting the use of these molecules as a tool for paleoclimate reconstruction. In this work we used controlled microcosms to study the effect of temperature and pH on brGDGTs in lake water. Our results show that temperature has a strong influence on the production of brGDGTs, with a sensitivity that is similar to empirical observations. In contrast, the pH experiments yielded inconclusive results, either due to a limited response, or to the experimental set up. This study demonstrates that the brGDGT response to temperature can be replicated under controlled conditions, establishing that microcosms are a viable strategy to better understand the proxy response mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ageochemistry 3aglycerol 3alakes 3apH 3apaleoclimatology 3atemperature 0abrGDGTs 0aMicrocosms1 aTierney, Jessica E.1 aMeredith, Laura K.0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2020 July, v. 145 p.104041-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2020.1040413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245007500176300001600251520140700267592002801674650001401702650001501716650000901731650002001740650001101760700002201771700001801793700002201811700002001833700002701853773009401880856009001974990002302064852000902087655001202096IND60095821820221118012122.0141104e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009582182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeitgeb, Thomas10aInterferometric determination of heat release rate in a pulsated flame  ap. 589-600.  aIntroducing a new measurand, namely the rate of change of density in line-of-sight, can be of great interest for people working on thermoacoustics and combustion noise. In this work the relationship between the radiated acoustic pressure, the time rate of change of unsteady heat release and of density fluctuations in a laminar pulsated premixed flame is presented. The burner produced a ‘M’-shaped flame which is excited by harmonic modulations of the flow at two forcing frequencies f=51 and 101Hz. Measurements were performed by a microphone to record the sound pressure radiated by the flame in the far field, a photomultiplier to collect the light emission from which the heat release rate was estimated, and a laser vibrometer to detect the rate of change of density fluctuations within the reaction region. As the latter technique is a novel approach in combustion analysis a detailed description of the fundamentals of laser interferometric vibrometry is presented. Laser vibrometry offers the advantage to be low-demanding in terms of instrumentation and settings and to be relatively straightforward to process for a broad frequency range. The different signals recorded are correlated. An interpretation of the measurement data is given and the potential of laser vibrometry to obtain time resolved data on density and heat release rate fluctuations in the flame region is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3acombustion 3aheat 3ainstrumentation 3apeople1 aSchuller, Thierry1 aDurox, Daniel1 aGiuliani, Fabrice1 aKöberl, Stefan1 aWoisetschläger, Jakob0 tCombustion and Flame.g2013 Mar., v. 160, no. 3 p.589-600dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245012700183300001600310520162900326592002801955650001101983650001001994650001702004650001102021650001902032650001402051650001102065650002302076650001102099650001102110650001002121650001602131650001102147653000702158653001002165653001202175653002502187653002302212653002502235653001902260700001702279700001902296700002002315773011002335856008602445852000902531655001202540IND60543228420221120074922.0190410e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054322842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Steertegem, Bénédicte14aThe role of gluten proteins in production and quality of a yeast leavened sugar and fat rich wheat based food model system  ap. 991-997.  aLittle if any literature is available on the functionality of gluten proteins in yeast leavened developed dough systems containing high sugar and fat levels. We here studied whether and to what extent gluten proteins impact the different phases of the production of such a system (which contains about 35 parts invert syrup and 70 parts margarine per 100 parts flour) and how these proteins affect its quality. In a first approach, we used model systems based on gluten–starch blends as this allowed specifically altering the gluten levels without altering the gluten quality and/or levels of other wheat flour components. In a second approach flour was heat treated upfront to alter its gluten proteins. Despite the large amounts of sugars and fat, the presence of a developed gluten network in these systems allowed dough pieces to retain gas during fermentation. Also, dough pieces with a developed gluten network could expand faster during subsequent baking than dough pieces without a developed gluten network (i.e. ca. 3.6 vs. 1.9cm/min, respectively). Remarkably, at a given moment during baking (i.e. between 65 and 105sec of baking), dough pieces started to shrink in all directions. This was related to the (elastic) protein network present in the system. However, the time at which shrinking occurred was influenced by factors other than the gluten network. Besides the level, the quality of the gluten fraction determined gluten development during mixing of dough systems containing high levels of sugars and fat, and thus, the spread behavior during fermentation and baking and the final product's dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaking 3adough 3afermentation 3agluten 3aheat treatment 3amargarine 3amixing 3amodel food systems 3asugars 3asyrups 3awheat 3awheat flour 3ayeasts 0adm 0aSDSEP 0aSE-HPLC 0aGluten functionality 0aGluten development 0aFlour heat treatment 0aWaffle quality1 aPareyt, Bram1 aBrijs, Kristof1 aDelcour, Jan A.0 tFood research international.g2014 Aug., v. 62 p.991-997dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015000171300001600321520105900337592002801396650002101424650001701445650001701462650003001479650001501509650002101524650001201545650001201557650001001569650001001579650001101589651001501600651001201615653000801627653002001635653001701655653001301672700002401685700001601709700002301725700002001748700001901768700002601787700002001813700002201833700001801855700001901873773012001892856008502012852000902097655001202106IND60535307020221121042948.0190401e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053530702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrdana, Foojan10aOccurrence of zoonotic nematodes Pseudoterranova decipiens, Contracaecum osculatum and Anisakis simplex in cod (Gadus morhua) from the Baltic Sea  ap. 581-587.  aBaltic cod Gadus morhua (a total of total 224 specimens) captured east of the island of Bornholm in the southern Baltic Sea were subjected to a parasitological investigation between March 2013 and April 2014. Full artificial digestion of fillets from 188 cod and additional investigation of livers from 36 cod were performed. Cod or seal worm Pseudoterranova decipiens was recorded in musculature (prevalences up to 55% and intensities up to 56 worms per fish) associated with a negative correlation between worm intensity and condition factor. Liver worm Contracaecum osculatum (100% prevalence with intensities up to 320 worms per fish) in liver tissue were recorded but only a slight negative correlation between intensity and condition factor was noted. Seals act as final host for both worm species and the increased occurrence during recent years is associated with the increasing grey seal population in the area. Infection with Anisakis simplex (the herring or whale worm) in Baltic cod was found at a low level corresponding to previous studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisakis simplex 3aContracaecum 3aGadus morhua 3aPseudoterranova decipiens 3acod (fish) 3acondition factor 3afillets 3aherring 3aliver 3aseals 3awhales 3aBaltic Sea 3aDenmark 0aCod 0aPseudoterranova 0aContracaecum 0aAnisakis1 aBahlool, Qusay Z.M.1 aSkov, Jakob1 aMarana, Moonika H.1 aSindberg, Diana1 aMundeling, Mai1 aOvergaard, Bettina C.1 aKorbut, Rozalia1 aStrøm, Sverri B.1 aKania, Per W.1 aBuchmann, Kurt0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 205, no. 3-4 p.581-587dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010700171300001600278520202200294592002802316650001302344650001302357650001402370650001402384650001402398650001502412650001602427650001802443650001202461650001302473650001502486650002802501650001402529650001602543650001102559650003702570650001102607650004002618650001102658653001702669653001302686653002302699653002102722653001502743653001802758700002902776700002702805700002102832700001902853700002402872700002402896700001902920773010602939856008403045852000903129655001203138IND60530698020221118173038.0180905e20170116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053069802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Surza L.G.10aScreening for target toxins of the antiophidic protein DM64 through a gel-based interactomics approach  ap. 204-213.  aDM64 is a glycosylated protein with antivenom activity isolated from the serum of the opossum Didelphis aurita. It binds non-covalently to myotoxins I (Asp49) and II (Lys49) from Bothrops asper venom and inhibits their myotoxic effect. In this study, an affinity column with immobilized DM64 as bait was used to fish potential target toxins. All ten isolated myotoxins tested were able to effectively bind to the DM64 column. To better access the specificity of the inhibitor, crude venoms from Bothrops (8 species), Crotalus (2 species) and Naja naja atra were submitted to the affinity purification. Venom fractions bound and nonbound to the DM64 column were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Although venom fractions bound to the column were mainly composed of basic PLA2, a few spots corresponding to acidic PLA2 were also observed. Some unexpected protein spots were also identified: C-type lectins and CRISP may represent putative new targets for DM64, whereas the presence of serine peptidases in the venom bound fraction is likely a consequence of nonspecific binding to the column matrix. The present results contribute to better delineate the inhibitory potential of DM64, providing a framework for the development of more specific antivenom therapies.Local tissue damage induced by myotoxic PLA2 remains a serious consequence of snake envenomation, since it is only partially neutralized by traditional antivenom serotherapy. Myotoxin inhibition by highly specific molecules offers great promise in the treatment of snakebites, a health problem largely neglected by governments and pharmaceutical industries. Bioactive compounds such as DM64 can represent a valuable source of scaffolds for drug development in this area. The present study has systematically profiled the binding specificity of DM64 toward a variety of snake venom toxin classes and therefore can lead to a better understanding of the structure-function relationship of this important antivenom protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBothrops 3aCrotalus 3aDidelphis 3aNaja atra 3aNaja naja 3aantivenoms 3ablood serum 3aglycosylation 3alectins 3aopossums 3apeptidases 3apharmaceutical industry 3ascreening 3asnake bites 3asnakes 3astructure-activity relationships 3atoxins 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3avenoms 0aSnake venoms 0aMyotoxin 0aMyotoxin inhibitor 0aDidelphis aurita 0aProteomics 0aInteractomics1 aNeves-Ferreira, Ana G.C.1 aTrugilho, Monique R.O.1 aAngulo, Yamileth1 aLomonte, Bruno1 aValente, Richard H.1 aDomont, Gilberto B.1 aPerales, Jonas0 tJournal of proteomics.g2017 Jan. 16, v. 151 p.204-213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245015000214300001800364520137500382592002801757650001601785650001201801650001801813650001001831650001201841650002101853650001501874650002401889700002201913700002801935700002401963700002601987700002102013700002302034773013102057856008302188852000902271655001202280IND60793766120221120033140.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079376612DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-022-04047-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbu-Zaitoon, Yousef M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1952-250910aEvidence from Co-expression Analysis for the Involvement of Amidase and INS in the Tryptophan-Independent Pathway of IAA Synthesis in Arabidopsis  ap. 4673-4682.  aThe reverse genetic approach has uncovered indole synthase (INS) as the first enzyme in the tryptophan (trp)-independent pathway of IAA synthesis. The importance of INS was reevaluated suggesting it may interact with tryptophan synthase B (TSB) and therefore involved in the trp-dependent pathway. Thus, the main aim of this study was to clarify the route of INS through the analysis of Arabidopsis genome. Analysis of the top 2000 co-expression gene lists in general and specific conditions shows that TSA is strongly positively co-expressed with TSB in general, hormone, and abiotic conditions with mutual ranks of 89, 38, and 180 respectively. Moreover, TSA is positively correlated with TSB (0.291). However, INS was not found in any of these coexpressed gene lists and negatively correlated with TSB (− 0.046) suggesting unambiguously that these two routes are separately and independently operated. So far, the remaining steps in the INS pathway have remained elusive. Among all enzymes reported to have a role in IAA synthesis, amidase was found to strongly positively co-expressed with INS in general and light conditions with mutual ranks of 116 and 141 respectively. Additionally, amidase1 was found to positively correlate with INS (0.297) and negatively coexpressed with TSB concluding that amidase may exclusively involve in the trp-independent pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aamidase 3abiotechnology 3agenes 3aindoles 3areverse genetics 3atryptophan 3atryptophan synthase1 aAbu-Zaiton, Ahmed1 aTawaha, Abdel Rahman Al1 aFandi, Khalid Ghazi1 aAlnaimat, Sulaiman M.1 aPati, Siddhartha1 aAlmomani, Fouad A.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2022 Oct., v. 194, no. 10 p.4673-4682dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-022-04047-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01700naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245004200171300001800213520078100231592002801012650001501040650001401055650001601069650001201085700002501097700002201122700002301144773014101167856008101308852000901389655001201398IND60438978320221120143002.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043897832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-014-0965-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakushev, Victor P.10aSoil acidity adaptive control problem  ap. 1671-1677.  aProblem of soil acidity regularization is modeled as stochastic adaptive control problem with a linear difference equation of the dynamics of a field pH level.

Yellow chrysanthemum flower petals [Chrysanthemum morifolium (Ramat.)] are the result of a deleted or suppressed carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene (CmCCD4a). Therefore, investigating the global gene expression patterns in chrysanthemum mutants producing yellow petals represents an appropriate strategy to analyze the effects of signaling mediated by carotenoid derivatives. We compared the transcriptomes of chrysanthemum cultivars producing white petals with purple stripes (‘Noble Wine’) and its mutant producing yellow petals with purple stripes (‘ARTI-Yellow Star’). Read mapping and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that CmCCD4a is absent in the ARTI-Yellow Star genome, while at least three CmCCD4a gene family members are actively transcribed in ‘Noble Wine’ plants. These results indicate that the deletion of CmCCD4a may be responsible for the development of yellow petals in ARTI-Yellow Star flowers. During comparisons of gene expression patterns between Noble Wine and ARTI-Yellow Star, we detected numerous significantly up-regulated plastid protein-coding genes as well as significantly or mildly up-regulated carotenoid biosynthesis genes in ARTI-Yellow Star plants. The up-regulated plastid protein-coding genes belong to a broad range of functional categories related to translation, photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species scavenging, oxidative phosphorylation, transcription, processing, terpenoid metabolism, and chlorophyll metabolism. Our results present a possible relationship between CmCCD4a and regulation of plastid protein-coding genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acorolla 3acultivars 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amutants 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant development 3apollinators 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranslation (genetics) 3awines 0aCCD 0aNCED 0aABA 0aZDS 0aDEG 0aDXS 0aDXR 0aIPI 0aGGPS 0aPSY 0aPDS 0aCRTISO 0aLCYB 0aLCYE 0aCHYB 0aCDS 0aCYP97A 0aCYP97C 0aZEP 0aVDE 0aGO 0aKEGG 0aFPKM 0aChrysanthemum 0aMutation 0aCarotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) 0aChloroplast 0aRetrograde signaling1 aKim, Ye-Sol1 aRyu, Jaihyunk1 aChoi, Hong-Il1 aKim, Se-wŏn,1 aKang, Han Sol1 aAhn, Joon-Woo1 aKim, Jin-Baek1 aKang, Si-Yong1 aKim, Sang Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1790-08360 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Nov. 22, v. 212 p.49-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2016.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01411naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013300169300001800302520029000320592002800610650002300638650002300661650001300684650001200697650001400709653001300723653001200736653001600748653002500764653001600789700001700805700001700822700001600839773008900855856008400944852000901028655001201037IND60551623420221118015435.0161019e20160824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055162342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Zhenzhen12aA general method for synthesis of cis-dicarbonyl epoxides through DBU/LiBr-cocatalyzed cyclization of α,β-dicarbonyl peroxides  ap. 3827-3831.  aA general method for synthesis of cis-dicarbonyl epoxides is developed.

We investigated the inflammatory and immunological consequences of EA in sleep-deprived colitis and found that dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in sleep-fragmented (SF) mice was more severe than that in mice with normal sleep. This increase in the severity of colitis was accompanied by reduced body weight, shortened colon length, and deteriorated disease activity index. DSS with SF mice presented obvious diminished intestinal tight junction proteins (claudin-1 and occludin), elevated proinflammatory cytokines (CRP, IFN-γ, IL-6), lowered melatonin and adiponectin levels, downregulated vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) type 1 and 2 receptor (VPAC1, VPAC2) expression, and decreased diversity of gut bacteria. EA ameliorated colitis severity and preserved the performance of the epithelial tight junction proteins and VIP receptors, especially VPAC2. Meanwhile, the innate lymphoid cells-derived cytokines in both group 2 (IL-4, IL5, IL-9, IL-13) and group 3 (IL-22, GM-CSF) were elevated in mice colon tissue. Furthermore, dysbiosis was confirmed in the DSS group with and without SF, and EA could maintain the species diversity. Firmicutes could be restored, such as Lachnospiraceae, and Proteobacteria become rebalanced, mainly Enterobacteriaceae, after EA intervention. On the other hand, SF plays different roles in physiological and pathological conditions. In normal mice, interrupted sleep did not affect the expression of claudin-1 and occludin. But VPAC1, VPAC2, and gut microbiota diversity, including Burkholderiaceae and Rhodococcus, were opposite to mice in an inflamed state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderiaceae 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aLachnospiraceae 3aadiponectin 3abody weight 3acolitis 3acolon 3adextran sulfate 3adysbiosis 3aelectroacupuncture 3aepithelium 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-5 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-9 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amelatonin 3aoccludins 3aspecies diversity 3atight junctions 3avasoactive intestinal peptide1 aZhuo, Xin-Cheng 1 aHuang, Yueh-Hsiang 1 aLiu, Hsuan-Miao 1 aWu, Ren-Chin 1 aKuo, Chia-Jung 1 aChen, Ning-Hung 1 aChuang, Li-Pang 1 aLin, Shih-Wei 1 aChen, Yen-Lung 1 aYang, Huang-Yu 1 aLee, Tzung-Yan 0 tBiology.g2022 June 25, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110709623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015900164300001100323520131000334592002801644650003501672650001201707650001001719650001101729650001401740650001901754650001101773650002401784650001001808650001101818650003901829650001101868650001301879650001201892700001801904700002001922700001701942700001801959773010701977856007802084852000902162655001202171IND60746265620221121054445.0210729e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074626562DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-3-992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabte, Habtom H14aThe role of crude human saliva and purified salivary MUC5B and MUC7 mucins in the inhibition of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in an inhibition assay  ap. 99.  aBACKGROUND: Despite the continuous shedding of HIV infected blood into the oral cavity and the detectable presence of the AIDS virus at a high frequency, human saliva is reported to inhibit oral transmission of HIV through kissing, dental treatment, biting, and aerosolization. The purpose of this study was to purify salivary MUC5B and MUC7 mucins from crude saliva and determine their anti-HIV-1 activities. METHODS: Following Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography and caesium chloride isopycnic density-gradient ultra-centrifugation, the purity and identity of the mucins was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis respectively. Subsequently an HIV-1 inhibition assay was carried out to determine the anti-HIV-1 activity of the crude saliva and purified salivary mucins by incubating them with subtype D HIV-1 prior to infection of the CD4⁺ CEM SS cells. RESULTS: Western blotting analysis confirmed that the mucin in the void volume is MUC5B and the mucin in the included volume is MUC7. The HIV inhibition assay revealed that both the crude saliva and salivary MUC5B and MUC7 mucins inhibited HIV-1 activity by 100%. CONCLUSION: Although the mechanism of action is not clear the carbohydrate moieties of the salivary mucins may trap or aggregate the virus and prevent host cell entry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aagarose 3ablood 3acesium 3achlorides 3achromatography 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amouth 3amucins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asaliva 3avirology 3aviruses1 aMall, Anwar S1 ade Beer, Corena1 aLotz, Zoë E1 aKahn, Delawir0 tVirology journal.g2006 Dec., v. 3, no. 1 p.99-99dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-3-993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010300168520105800271592002801329650002301357650001201380650002101392650002201413650001301435650000901448650001101457650002701468650000901495650000901504650001401513650002401527650001101551650002401562650000701586650001501593650002401608650002001632650001201652650000901664651002501673651001001698700003601708700002701744700003001771700002401801700002401825773012801849856007401977852000902051655001202060IND60652732420221119141151.0190713e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065273242DNAL7 a10.3390/su101245342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro-Pedreño, Jose 10aTrace Metal Content and Availability of Essential Metals in Agricultural Soils of Alicante (Spain)  aThis article analysed the presence of trace metals (essential elements and pollutants) and soil properties in rural abandoned soils of a Mediterranean region. The soil properties determined were texture, pH, equivalent calcium carbonate, soil organic matter, availability of micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn), and acid microwave digestion extraction to measure the trace metals considered as main pollutants (Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb). Descriptive statistics and correlations were used to determine the relations among these parameters. pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and clay were the main properties that controlled the availability of essential metals. pH was the main factor related to these metals in these calcareous soils. However, SOC, which can be incremented by adding organic fertilizers for soil rehabilitation as a sustainable practice, played an important role. Mean values of the metal composition in soils (Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb) obtained in this study were similar to values reported for other areas in the Mediterranean basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3acadmium 3acalcareous soils 3acalcium carbonate 3achromium 3aclay 3acopper 3adescriptive statistics 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amicrowave treatment 3anickel 3aorganic fertilizers 3apH 3apollutants 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil properties 3atexture 3azinc 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain1 aAlmendro-Candel, María  Belén1 aGómez Lucas, Ignacio 1 aJordán Vidal, Manuel  M.1 aBech Borras, Jaume 1 aZorpas, Antonis A.,0 tSustainability.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101245343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012000175300001600295500001500311520178000326592002802106650002302134650001902157650001802176650001002194650001502204650002302219650002202242650002002264650002502284650002002309650002602329650003202355650004502387650001602432650002302448650002002471650001602491650001302507650002302520650001302543650001002556650001202566650002402578650001702602653003002619653001102649653002402660653000902684653001102693653001402704653002802718700006402746700006202810700001602872700001602888773008802904856008702992852000903079655001203088IND60565602520221120111556.0180904e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056560252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2017.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzbayram, E.

An anaerobic cellulolytic culture was enriched from sheep rumen fluid using wheat straw as substrate under mesophilic conditions. To investigate the effects of bioaugmentation on methane production from straw, the enrichment culture was added to batch reactors in proportions of 2% (Set-1) and 4% (Set-2) of the microbial cell number of the standard inoculum slurry. The methane production in the bioaugmented reactors was higher than in the control reactors. After 30 days of batch incubation, the average methane yield was 154 mLN CH4 gVS⁻¹ in the control reactors. Addition of 2% enrichment culture did not enhance methane production, whereas in Set-2 the methane yield was increased by 27%. The bacterial communities were examined by 454 amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, while terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting of mcrA genes was applied to analyze the methanogenic communities. The results highlighted that relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae increased during the enrichment. However, Cloacamonaceae, which were abundant in the standard inoculum, dominated the bacterial communities of all batch reactors. T-RFLP profiles revealed that Methanobacteriales were predominant in the rumen fluid, whereas the enrichment culture was dominated by Methanosarcinales. In the batch rectors, the most abundant methanogens were affiliated to Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales. Our results suggest that bioaugmentation with sheep rumen enrichment cultures can enhance the performance of digesters treating lignocellulosic feedstock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanomicrobiales 3alignocellulose 3aribosomal RNA 3agenes 3afeedstocks 3aMethanobacteriales 3aMethanosarcinales 3abioaugmentation 3arumen microorganisms 3aLachnospiraceae 3abacterial communities 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3awheat straw 3aenrichment culture 3aRuminococcaceae 3amethanogens 3ainoculum 3amethane production 3aslurries 3asheep 3amethane 3aanaerobic digestion 3arumen fluids 0aLignocellulosic feedstock 0aT-RFLP 0aAnaerobic digestion 0amcrA 0aBiogas 0adigesters 0a454 amplicon sequencing1 aKleinsteuber, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8643-340X1 aNikolausz, Marcell1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2858-99721 aInce, Bahar1 aInce, Orhan0 tAnaerobe.g2017 Aug., v. 46 p.122-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2017.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245006600166300001800232520177200250536017602022592002802198596009302226596009302319650001502412650001202427650000902439650001702448650001702465650000802482650002002490650001402510650001502524650002102539650001502560650001702575650001502592650000902607650001702616651001802633651001402651653001102665653002102676653001702697653001702714653001702731700002102748700002302769773009802792856008002890852000902970655001202979IND60622405220221120132720.0181125e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062240522DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836166873812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeindel, Ruth C10aRates and processes of aeolian soil erosion in West Greenland  ap. 1281-1290.  aIn arid landscapes across the globe, aeolian processes are key drivers of landscape change, but arid Arctic regions are often overlooked. In the Kangerlussuaq region of West Greenland, strong katabatic winds have removed discrete patches of soil and vegetation, exposing unproductive glacial till and bedrock. Although lake-sediment records suggest that landscape destabilization began approximately 1000 years ago, the upland soil erosion has never been directly dated. We use a novel application of lichenometry to estimate the rates and timing of soil erosion. We show that the formation of deflation patches occurred approximately 800–230 years ago, in general agreement with lake-sediment records. In West Greenland, the ‘Little Ice Age’ (AD 1350–1880) was characterized by a cold and arid climate, conditions that increased susceptibility to erosion. On average, deflation patches are expanding at a rate of 2.5 cm yr⁻¹, and variation in the rate of patch expansion cannot be explained by proximity to the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), slope, aspect, elevation, or patch size. An erosional threshold exists in this aeolian system, with climate conditions necessary for patch formation likely harsher than those necessary for continued patch expansion, a result that has implications for land management in arid regions. Currently, deflation patches are expanding throughout the study region and are forming in areas close to the GrIS, but future deflation rates are dependent on projected climate and potential land-use changes. Our results stress the importance of aeolian processes in arid polar landscapes such as Kangerlussuaq, and demonstrate the use of aeolian landforms in paleoclimate reconstructions and predicting future landscape change.  aFunding This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant numbers 0801490 to RAV and 1506155 to LEC and RAV) and Dartmouth’s Institute of Arctic Studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a0801490cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  a1506155cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100000001 3aarid zones 3abedrock 3acold 3aeolian soils 3aglacial till 3aice 3aland use change 3alandforms 3alandscapes 3apaleoclimatology 3aprediction 3aupland soils 3avegetation 3awind 3awind erosion 3aArctic region 3aGreenland 0aArctic 0alandscape change 0alichenometry 0apaleoclimate 0awind erosion1 aCuller, Lauren E1 aVirginia, Ross A.,0 tHolocene.g, v. 27, no. 9 p.1281-1290dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836166873813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245016600169520151000335592002801845650001401873650002501887650001401912650001601926650002401942650001501966650001501981650001401996700002502010700002002035700002302055773012102078856008002199852000902279655001202288IND60783982520221120182509.0220726e20220718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078398252DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110710672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavrilov, Valery M.10aMetabolic Scaling in Birds and Mammals: How Taxon Divergence Time, Phylogeny, and Metabolic Rate Affect the Relationship between Scaling Exponents and Intercepts  aAnalysis of metabolic scaling in currently living endothermic animal species allowed us to show how the relationship between body mass and the basal metabolic rate (BMR) has evolved in the history of endothermic vertebrates. We compared six taxonomic groups according to their energetic characteristics and the time of evolutionary divergence. We transformed the slope of the regression lines to the common value and analyzed three criteria for comparing BMR of different taxa regardless of body size. Correlation between average field metabolic rate (FMR) of the group and its average BMR was shown. We evaluated the efficiency of self-maintenance in ordinary life (defined BMR/FMR) in six main groups of endotherms. Our study has shown that metabolic scaling in the main groups of endothermic animals correlates with their evolutionary age: the younger the group, the higher the metabolic rate, but the rate increases more slowly with increasing body weight. We found negative linear relationship for scaling exponents and the allometric coefficient in five groups of endotherms: in units of mL O₂/h per g, in relative units of allometric coefficients, and also in level or scaling elevation. Mammals that diverged from the main vertebrate stem earlier have a higher “b” exponent than later divergent birds. A new approach using three criteria for comparing BMR of different taxa regardless of body mass will be useful for many biological size-scaling relationships that follow the power function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3abasal metabolic rate 3abody size 3abody weight 3adivergent evolution 3aendothermy 3ametabolism 3aphylogeny1 aGolubeva, Tatiana B.1 aWarrack, Giles 1 aBushuev, Andrey V.0 tBiology.g2022 July 18, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110710673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012700172300001300299520153500312592002801847650001801875650001701893650001501910650001701925650003101942650001901973650001701992650001802009650001302027650002402040650001302064650002602077650002302103650001602126650001402142650001602156650002502172653002402197653002402221653001602245653002402261700002202285700001602307700001602323700002002339700001802359773008502377856008702462852000902549655001202558IND60565602620221120111650.0180904e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056560262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2017.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Keiko10aEffect of operating temperature on anaerobic digestion of the Brazilian waterweed Egeria densa and its microbial community  ap. 8-17.  aTo develop an effective treatment for the globally invasive Brazilian waterweed Egeria densa, anaerobic digestion was observed at 37 °C, 55 °C, and 65 °C. The average methane production rate at 55 °C was 220 mL L⁻¹ day⁻¹, which was two-fold that at 37 °C and 65 °C. Volatile fatty acid accumulation was detected under thermophilic conditions; however, although there was methane production, the system did not shutdown. The microbial communities differed between mesophilic (37 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C and 65 °C) conditions. A bacterial community consisting of the phyla Bacteroidetes (43%), Firmicutes (37%), Proteobacteria (9%), Synergistetes (5%), Spirochaetes (1%), and unclassified bacteria (5%) were detected under mesophilic condition. In contrast, the phylum Firmicutes was dominant under thermophilic conditions. In the archaeal community, Methanosaeta concilii (40%), Methanolinea sp. (17%), and unclassified euryarchaeota (43%) were detected under mesophilic condition. Methanosarcina thermophila (87% at 55 °C, 54% at 65 °C) and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (13% at 55 °C, 46% at 65 °C) were detected under thermophilic conditions. At both 37 °C and 55 °C, acetoclastic methanogenesis likely occurred because of the lower abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. At 65 °C, the growth of the acetoclastic methanogen Methanosarcina thermophila was limited by the high temperature, therefore, acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis may have occurred.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aEgeria densa 3aFirmicutes 3aMethanosaeta 3aMethanosarcina thermophila 3aProteobacteria 3aSpirochaetes 3aSynergistetes 3aacetates 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aoxidation 3atemperature 3avolatile fatty acids 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBrazilian waterweed 0aTemperature 0aMicrobial community1 aKoyama, Mitsuhiko1 aUeda, Junko1 aBan, Syuhei1 aKurosawa, Norio1 aToda, Tatsuki0 tAnaerobe.g2017 Oct., v. 47 p.8-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2017.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006500166300001200231520065800243592002800901596006100929596004700990596005901037650005201096650001501148650001401163650002001177650001501197650001701212650002001229650001301249650001701262650001501279700002101294700001801315700002301333700002101356700002401377700002301401700002301424700001701447700002701464773010301491856008301594852000901677655001201686IND60746265920221121032943.0220309e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074626592DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-021-02426-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFritz, Adrian10aHaploflow: strain-resolved de novo assembly of viral genomes  ap. 212.  aWith viral infections, multiple related viral strains are often present due to coinfection or within-host evolution.

The results reveal not only that tempering plays a decisive role in their thermophysical properties, but also that the changes in thermal conductivity due to heat treatment are dependent on the degree of alloying. Isobaric heat capacities c ₚ are found to be less dependent on heat treatment than thermal diffusivities a. The results are discussed with respect to the resulting microstructures and, for high-tempered conditions, under consideration of Calphad calculations. The results are relevant for the thermal design of tools, in particular, for tailored tempering of tools used for press hardening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3atemperature 3atempering 3athermal conductivity1 aLüdtke, Fabian1 aWeber, Sebastian1 aTheisen, Werner0 tJournal of materials science.g2013 Dec., v. 48, no. 24 p.8483-8492dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-013-7665-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009100161520124600252592002801498650002301526650001201549650001201561650001301573650001101586650001501597650001601612650000901628650001201637650001801649650001101667650001101678650001701689650000901706650001301715650001901728650002501747650001501772650000901787651001001796700002301806700001801829700002001847700001401867700001801881700001701899700002001916700002001936773012801956856007402084852000902158655001202167IND60652732720221119141200.0190713e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065273272DNAL7 a10.3390/su101245332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xianfeng 10aPollution Assessment of Trace Elements in Agricultural Soils around Copper Mining Area  aAgricultural soils from Dongchuan copper mining area were sampled and analyzed to determine the concentrations of selected trace elements, namely As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn. The main objectives of this study were: (1) To determine the levels of trace elements and their spatial distribution in soils; (2) to evaluate the potential ecological risk; and (3) to identify the main sources of risk element pollution. The environmental risks were assessed using five different contamination and pollution indexes. Descriptive and exploratory statistical analyses were performed to identify the relations among the trace elements in soils and possible sources of pollution. Although the values of As, Cu and Zn in the soils were significantly higher than Yunnan background values and exceeded the limits of the Chinese national standards in several sampling points, the most serious threat for the ecosystem and human health was represented by Cd. The main sources of Cu and As were identified mining activities, airborne particulates from smelters and the weathering of tailings, and partly also agricultural fertilizers. The major source of Cd was agricultural fertilizers and partly sources associated with mining and smelting activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3aecosystems 3afertilizers 3alead 3amercury 3amine tailings 3amining 3anickel 3aparticulates 3arisk 3asmelters 3asoil pollution 3astatistical analysis 3aweathering 3azinc 3aChina1 aDrozdova, Jarmila 1 aDanek, Tomas 1 aHuang, Qianrui 1 aQi, Wufu 1 aYang, Shuran 1 aZou, Liling 1 aXiang, Yungang 1 aZhao, Xinliang 0 tSustainability.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101245333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100004200152245016200194500001900356520166700375592002802042650001002070650001702080650001702097650000902114650001802123650001102141650001502152650002302167650001902190650001102209650001502220651001702235651001002252651001102262653002602273653002802299653001202327700005302339700006102392773009802453856008702551852000902638655001202647IND60713381620221119143026.0201118e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071338162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1074472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho Carneiro de Mendonça, Bruno10aSpatial scale determines how the morphological diversity relates with river biological diversity. Evidence from a mountain river in the central Chilean Andes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRivers shape the landscape and determine spatial connectivity for a variety of riverine and terrestrial organisms. Rivers impacted by human disturbances are often in need of restoration in order to increase their functionality and ecological diversity, and ultimately to improve the ecosystems services that they offer. Because it is usually assumed that physical diversity of river systems promotes biological diversity or riverine species, river restoration practices often tend to enhance simplified rivers by increasing structural morphological complexity of river reaches. However, the relationship between the variability of physical features and the biological communities in riverine environments is not necessarily straightforward to assume due to the high degree of complexity and feedback in the relationship. This work presents a case study with the application of a recent geomorphological method developed in Europe for the assessment and characterization of geomorphic conditions in combination with biological surveys, along a mountain river basin in Central Chile (Clarillo River). Although representing a single “snapshot” in the pulsating nature of a river system, our results suggest that availability of habitats provides the conditions to support different levels of biodiversity in a hierarchical way in terms of spatial scale. In particular, we found that abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates are more related with composition of geomorphic units, whereas the presence of fish is more related with the geomorphic nature of the reaches, and the presence of anurans is more related with the geomorphic nature of river segments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnura 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3afish 3ageomorphology 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amacroinvertebrates 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aAndes region 3aChile 3aEurope 0aFluvial geomorphology 0aMorphological diversity 0aAnurans1 aMao, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8619-52211 aBelletti, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6247-76190 tGeomorphology.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 372 p.107447-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1074473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245022900175300001600404520154900420592002801969650002501997650001202022650001602034650002602050650003202076650001402108650001602122650001002138650001702148650001402165650001302179650001802192650003702210650001302247650003002260650001602290653002602306653002502332653000802357653001602365653001702381653002102398700001902419700003102438700002602469700002402495700002402519773008802543856008702631852000902718655001202727IND60634172920221121034930.0190516e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063417292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKierzkowska, Marta14aThe presence of antibiotic resistance genes and bft genes as well as antibiotic susceptibility testing of Bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from inpatients of the Infant Jesus Teaching Hospital, Warsaw during 2007–2012  ap. 109-115.  aThe purpose of this study was to assess drug susceptibility of clinical B. fragilis strains and to determine any correlation between drug resistance and the presence of specific genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using E-tests. All isolates were analyzed with the PCR technique for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (cepA, cfxA, cfiA, ermF, ermB, ermG, nim), insertion sequences elements (IS1186, IS1187, IS1188, IS942), and enterotoxin-encoding genes (bft). Susceptibility tests yielded the following rates of resistance to the evaluated antibiotics: penicillin G (100%), clindamycin (22.5%), cefoxitin (6.3%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1.8%). All strain were susceptible to imipenem, and metronidazole. The following antibiotic resistance genes were detected in the evaluated isolates: cepA (in 96.4% of isolates), cfxA (in 12.6%), cfiA (in 1.8%), and ermF (in 25.2%). Genes ermB, ermG, and nim were not found. The presence of the cepA gene showed no correlation with the penicillin G MIC. However, we observed a high correlation between cefoxitin MIC values and the presence of gene cfxA as well as a nearly complete correlation between clindamycin MIC values and the presence of gene ermF. The presence of a bft gene was detected in 14.4% of the analyzed B. fragilis isolates; with the bft-1 allele found in 75%, bft-2 in 25%, and bft-3 in none of the isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles of enterotoxin gene-positive isolates in our study did not differ from those of enterotoxin gene-negative isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aalleles 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3acefoxitin 3aclindamycin 3adrugs 3aenterotoxins 3ahospitals 3aimipenem 3ametronidazole 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atransposons 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aBacteroides fragilis 0abft 0aClindamycin 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0aResistance genes1 aMajewska, Anna1 aSzymanek-Majchrzak, Ksenia1 aSawicka-Grzelak, Anna1 aMlynarczyk, Andrzej1 aMlynarczyk, Grazyna0 tAnaerobe.g2019 Apr., v. 56 p.109-115dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245005900165520108600224592002801310650001001338650001501348650002201363650001101385650003601396650002301432700002601455700001801481773012101499856008001620852000901700655001201709IND60783982820221120182436.0220726e20220718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078398282DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110710712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanjić, Klara 10aCommon Ground between Biological Rhythms and Forensics  aBiological clocks set the timing for a large number of essential processes in the living human organism.

We summarize the associations between the molecular mechanisms of biological rhythms and forensically relevant aspects, including post-mortem interval and cause of death, entomological findings, sex, age, ethnicity and development. Given their importance during lifetime, biological rhythms could be potential tools to draw conclusions on the death circumstances and the identity of a deceased person by mechanistic investigations of the different biological clocks in a forensic context. This review puts the known effects of biological rhythms on the functions of the human organism in context with potential applications in forensic fields of interest, such as personal identification, entomology as well as the determination of the post-mortem interval and cause of death.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3aentomology 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apostmortem changes1 aReisinger, Christoph 1 aKanz, Fabian 0 tBiology.g2022 July 18, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110710713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245004900178300001800227500001500245520139900260592002801659650002201687650001101709650001901720650002601739650003801765650002801803650003301831650001201864650001501876653001301891653002101904700003801925700002401963773010601987856008102093852000902174655001202183IND60120634620221119190953.0150208e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012063462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7667-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Ligia Maria Manzine10aElectrospinning of PCL/natural rubber blends  ap. 8501-8508.  a2019-12-04  aIn this study, a thermoplastic/elastomeric binary blend of non-vulcanized natural rubber (NR) and polycaprolactone (PCL) was electrospun using polymer solutions consisting of varying proportions of PCL and NR. Specifically, an 8 % (w/v) NR/toluene solution was mixed with an 8 % (w/v) PCL/chloroform solution at proportions of 2, 15, 30, and 50 % (v/v). The morphological, thermal, and mechanical properties of the electrospun mats were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry, and uniaxial tensile tests. The SEM images demonstrated the production of micrometer- and sub-micrometer-sized fibers with no bead formation. Fibers with diameters ranging from 1.3 μm for samples with 0 % NR to 210 nm for samples containing 50 % NR were observed. Fibers with rough and smooth morphologies were observed, showing that the PCL/NR mats had phase-separated. The blend miscibility was evaluated by thermal analysis, which showed that blending did not improve the thermal stability of the systems. An investigation of the mechanical properties of the electrospun mats showed that adding NRL to the blend increased the tensile modulus, the ultimate elasticity, and the strain. Thus, non-vulcanized NR was successfully incorporated into electrospun mats, which exhibited useful mechanical properties that could be harnessed in biomaterials applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal stability 3arubber 3athermoplastics 3amechanical properties 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3abiocompatible materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atoluene 3achloroform 0apolymers 0athermal analysis1 aMattoso, Luiz Henrique Capparelli1 aFerreira, Mariselma0 tJournal of materials science.g2013 Dec., v. 48, no. 24 p.8501-8508dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-013-7667-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014200162300001800304520113300322592002801455650002101483650002001504650001201524650001201536650001901548650001701567650001601584650002201600650001701622650001001639651001001649700001901659700001701678700002001695773009301715856008101808852000901889655001201898IND60438975120221123042751.0151029e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043897512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-015-1222-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Feng10aInfluence of climate warming and resin collection on the growth of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) in a subtropical forest, southern China  ap. 1423-1430.  aKEY MESSAGE : Influence of climate warming and resin collection on the growth of Masson pine. Using tree-ring analysis coupled with the resin tapping history and climate data, we investigated the effects of climate warming and resin collection on the radial growth of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) in southern China. Fifty Masson pine trees from untapped (LDC) and tapped (WLS) stands were sampled from Changting, southern China. The radial growth of Masson pine at the LDC site was positively influenced by previous November and current February temperature and current July precipitation. There is an abrupt change point of the LDC series in 2002, which may be linked with regional climate warming. An increasing trend in the LDC series over the last 20 years is also found. Resin collection had a negative effect on the radial growth of Masson pine at the WLS site, especially on old trees. The positive effect of climate warming on the radial growth of Masson pine was offset by the negative effect of the resin collection. Therefore, in order to keep timber production, the unplanned resin collection should be forbidden.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus massoniana 3aadverse effects 3aclimate 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3agrowth rings 3atemperature 3atimber production 3atree tapping 3atrees 3aChina1 aYuan, Yu-jiang1 aYu, Shu-long1 aZhang, Tong-wen0 tTrees.g2015 Oct., v. 29, no. 5 p.1423-1430dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-015-1222-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245008100187300001500268520070800283592002800991650002301019650001801042650000701060650001301067650001001080650004501090650005201135650002901187650003901216650002401255650003501279700001901314700002201333700002301355773010001378856008101478852000901559655001201568IND4412928120221118043217.0151024e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441292812DNAL7 a187731492pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-008-9825-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGovender, Yageshni10aBioreduction of platinum salts into nanoparticles: a mechanistic perspective  ap. 95-100.  aA mechanism for the bioreduction of H₂PtCl₆ and PtCl₂ into platinum nanoparticles by a hydrogenase enzyme from Fusarium oxysporum is proposed. Octahedral H₂PtCl₆ is too large to fit into the active region of the enzyme and, under conditions optimum for nanoparticle formation (pH 9, 65°C), undergoes a two-electron reduction to PtCl₂ on the molecular surface of the enzyme. This smaller molecule is transported through hydrophobic channels within the enzyme to the active region where, under conditions optimal for hydrogenase activity (pH 7.5, 38°C) it undergoes a second two-electron reduction to Pt(0). H₂PtCl₆ was unreactive at pH 7.5, 38°C; PtCl₂ was unreactive at pH 9, 65°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aplatinum 3asalts 2aHydrogenasexmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMetal Nanoparticlesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlatinum Compoundsxmetabolism1 aRiddin, Tamsyn1 aGericke, Mariekie1 aWhiteley, Chris G.0 tBiotechnology letters.g2009 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.95-100dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-008-9825-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011100176300001800287520215100305592002802456650001102484650001602495650001402511650001402525650001802539650001802557650001302575650001902588650001602607650002202623650000902645650001402654700002402668773010602692856008102798852000902879655001202888IND60120634720221119191428.0150208e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012063472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7647-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParamsothy, Muralidharan10aZrB2 nanoparticle induced nano-LPSO-grain and nano-LPSO-layer reinforced ultra-high strength Mg–RE alloy  ap. 8368-8376.  aZrB₂nanoparticles were used to modify a selected solidification processed Mg–RE alloy to give it ultrahigh strength (tensile yield strength >400 MPa). This approach did not involve time consuming and therefore cost incurring stages such as (1) ingot solutionizing and quenching prior to hot extrusion as well as (2) thermal aging beyond 24 h after hot extrusion. Rather, the ZrB₂nanoparticle induced finer LPSO phase (nano-LPSO-layer) formation due to nano-surface effects and the consequent nucleating effects of the fibrous LPSO ends during hot extrusion resulted in the formation of nanograins. Alternatively, free zirconium from ZrB₂nanoparticles reacting with the magnesium matrix may have had a significant nanoscale grain refining effect on the alloy. During the 24 h period of lower temperature (200 °C) thermal aging in this study, the LPSO phase formed in nanograins containing sufficient dissolved Gd, Y, and Zn, this being nano-LPSO-grain formation which “auto-locked” the nanoscale grain size during thermal aging due to the thermal stability of the high melting point rare earth containing LPSO phase. Compared to the surrounding alloy matrix, the nano-LPSO-grain cluster with random grain striation orientation was more robust. This was confirmed by the observation of predominantly non-basal or [Symbol: see text]c+a[Symbol: see text] type dislocations requiring higher CRSS around as well as within the room temperature tensile deformed nano-LPSO-grains. The LPSO phase generally constricted the flow of dislocations during deformation. The nano-LPSO-layer also acted as finely divided nanoscale reinforcement for the alloy matrix, including nanoscale strengthening of selected micrograin boundaries by bridging. The higher robustness of the nano-LPSO-grain cluster (and nano-LPSO-layer), good stress transfer characteristics across the nano-LPSO-grain boundary (and nano-LPSO-layer–alloy matrix interface), and nanoscale bridging across selected micrograin boundaries by nano-LPSO-layers contributed to the ultra–high strength characteristic (tensile yield strength >400 MPa) of the selected Mg–RE alloy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3adeformation 3aextrusion 3amagnesium 3amelting point 3ananoparticles 3arefining 3asolidification 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3azinc 3azirconium1 aGupta, M.q(Manoj),0 tJournal of materials science.g2013 Dec., v. 48, no. 24 p.8368-8376dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-013-7647-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001600260520102800276592002801304650001501332650001501347650001501362650001201377650001901389650002001408650001601428650001101444650002201455650001001477650001801487650001001505650000701515650001101522650001901533650001301552650002301565650001901588650002201607700002201629700002401651700002101675773009901696856008101795852000901876655001201885IND60587292920221118042909.0171216e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058729292DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829170401252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZinchenko, T.

To investigate the effects of elevated CO₂, temperature and their combination, the dwarf bamboo plantlets were exposed to two CO₂ regimes (ambient and double ambient CO₂ concentration) and two temperatures (ambient and +2.2°C) in growth chambers. Gas exchange, leaf traits and carbohydrates concentration were measured after the 150‐day experiment. Elevated CO₂ significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate (Aₙₑₜ), intrinsic water‐use efficiency (WUEᵢ) and carbon isotope composition (δ¹³C) and decreased stomatal conductance (gₛ) and total chlorophyll concentration based on mass (Chlₘ) and area (Chlₐ). On the other hand, elevated CO₂ decreased specific leaf area (SLA), which was increased by elevated temperature. Elevated CO₂ also increased foliar carbon concentration based on mass (Cₘ) and area (Cₐ), nitrogen concentration based on area (Nₐ), carbohydrates concentration (i.e. sucrose, sugar, starch and non‐structural carbohydrates) and the slope of the Aₙₑₜ–Nₐ relationship. However, elevated temperature decreased Cₘ, Cₐ and Nₐ. The combination of elevated CO₂ and temperature hardly affected SLA, Cₘ, Cₐ, Nₘ, Nₐ, Chlₘ and Chlₐ. Variables Aₙₑₜ and Nₐ had positive linear relationships in all treatments.

By providing solid supports, biofilm formation can be accelerated due to the early initial adhesion of residing microbes. Alteration in surface properties is therefore one such approach that helps us understand microbial interfacial interaction. Here, self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols with carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), and amine (-NH2) terminal moieties on gold (Au) substrates were employed to study the initial adhesion of wastewater microbes. An elastomeric flow cell was also utilized to simulate the environment of wastewater bioreactor. Results from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) portrayed more enhanced microbial adhesion after 2 h on -NH2 functional group with the calculated surface coverage of 12.8 ± 2.4% as compared to 7.7 ± 1.6% on -COOH, 11.0 ± 2.0% on -OH, and 1.2% on unmodified Au surfaces. This might be because of concomitant electrostatic attraction between negatively-charged bacteria and positively-charged (-NH3+) functional groups. Nevertheless, the average surface coverage by individual biofilm clusters was 28.0 ± 5.0 μm2 and 32.0 ± 9.0 μm2 on -NH2 and -OH surfaces, respectively, while -COOH surfaces resulted in higher value (60.0 ± 5.0 μm2) and no significant cluster formation was observed on Au surfaces. Accordingly, the average inter-cluster distance observed on -NH2 surfaces was relatively smaller (3.0 ± 0.6 μm) as compared to that on other surfaces. Overall, these data suggest favorable initial biofilm growth on more hydrophilic and positively-charged surfaces. Furthermore, the analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity revealed preferred initial adhesion of key microbes (archaea) on -OH and -NH2 surfaces. Indeed, results obtained from this study would be beneficial in designing selective biointerfaces for certain biofilm carriers in a typical wastewater bioreactor. Importantly, our elastomeric flow cell integrated with SAM-modified surfaces demonstrated an ideal platform for high-throughput investigation of wastewater biofilm under controlled environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agold 3ahydrophilicity 3amoieties 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aSelf-assembled monolayers (SAMs) 0aPDMS flow cell 0aBiofilm 0aWastewater 0aBiogas1 aSuraraksa, Benjaphon1 aHorprathum, Mati1 aOaew, Sukunya1 aCheunkar, Sarawut0 tAnaerobe.g2019 June, v. 57 p.11-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007400167300001800241520185100259592002802110650003002138650002302168650001602191650001102207650001402218650001002232650001002242650001102252650003102263650001402294650001602308650005202324650001302376650002202389650001002411650001202421651001102433651001002444651001002454700001402464700002002478700001802498773009302516856008102609852000902690655001202699IND60438975320221120055823.0151029e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043897532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-015-1219-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhardwaj, Pooja10aNatural occurrence of Apple stem grooving virus on Bauhinia variegata  ap. 1415-1422.  aKEY MESSAGE : Among apple viruses, the present study identified Apple stem grooving virus infection in Bauhinia variegata . CP gene of the isolate clustered with kiwi isolate, however, differing in biological characteristics. Bauhinia variegata, widely distributed in Kangra district (Himachal Pradesh, India), was found to exhibit severe virus-like symptoms, which included chlorosis, chlorotic and necrotic spots, mottling, leaf distortion and grooves on the stem. Symptomatic leaf samples collected from three different locations in the district, viz. CSIR-IHBT (Palampur), CSK HPKV (Palampur) and Dharamshala were analyzed by DAS-ELISA, dot blot hybridization and RT-PCR for the presence of ASGV infection. The combined results of three detection techniques showed 9 out of 30 samples to be positive for the virus. To understand the incidence of other major apple viruses, samples were also analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR. However, only ASGV was detected from the samples. Complete CP gene from four of the positive samples was amplified by RT-PCR and confirmed through sequencing and BLAST analysis of the amplicons. Phylogenetically, three isolates (abbreviated as BAU1, BAU2 and BAU18) clustered with apple isolates from India, Brazil and China, while one (BAU16) clustered separately. All the four isolates shared 94–99 % sequence identity at amino acid level and 87–98 % sequence identity at nucleotide level with all the other isolates from various geographical locations and differing hosts. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first report describing ASGV infection on B. variegata, its molecular characterization, and diversity analysis and incidence study. The tree probably acts as a reservoir of ASGV as it is found actively growing around apple nursery plantations, while no other apple virus was diagnosed from Bauhinia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApple stem grooving virus 3aBauhinia variegata 3aamino acids 3aapples 3achlorosis 3agenes 3ahosts 3aleaves 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aphylogeny 3aplantations 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asampling 3asequence analysis 3atrees 3aviruses 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aIndia1 aRam, Raja1 aZaidi, Aijaz A.1 aHallan, Vipin0 tTrees.g2015 Oct., v. 29, no. 5 p.1415-1422dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-015-1219-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010900165300001800274520185500292592002802147650001702175650001202192650001002204650001302214650001502227650001302242650001802255650002202273650001202295650002202307651002102329700002002350700001802370773010702388856004802495852000902543655001202552IND4468225720221118062246.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446822572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-011-0148-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Amelia J.14aThe efficacy of common species as indicators: avian responses to disturbance in British Columbia, Canada  ap. 3555-3575.  aCommon species can be major drivers of species richness patterns and make major contributions to biomass and ecosystem function, and thus should be important targets for conservation efforts. However, it is unclear how common species respond to disturbance, because the underlying reasons for their commonness may buffer or amplify their responses to disturbance. To assess how well common species reflect changes in their community (and thus function as indicator species), we studied 58 bird species in 19 mixed conifer patches in northern British Columbia, Canada, between 1998 and 2010. During this time period two disturbance events occurred, stand level timber harvest and a regional-scale bark beetle outbreak. We examined relationships among densities of individual species, total bird density and overall species richness, correlations in abundance among species, and responses to disturbance events. We found three broad patterns. First, densities of common species corresponded more strongly with changes in total bird density and overall species richness than rare species. These patterns were non-linear and species with intermediate-high commonness showed similar or better correspondence than the most common species. Second, common species tended to be more strongly correlated with abundances of all other species in the community than less-common species, although on average correlations among species were weak. Third, ecological traits (foraging guild, migratory status) were better predictors of responses to disturbance than species commonness. These results suggest that common species can collectively be used to reflect changes in the overall community, but that whenever possible monitoring programs should be extended to include species of intermediate-high commonness and representatives from different ecological guilds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abark beetles 3abiomass 3abirds 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3aforaging 3aforest stands 3aindicator species 3alogging 3aspecies diversity 3aBritish Columbia1 aDrever, Mark C.1 aMartin, Kathy0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2011 Dec., v. 20, no. 14 p.3555-3575dSpringer-Verlagx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-011-0148-3  aDNAL 7aarticle01856naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005000171300001600221520102000237592002801257650001301285650001901298650002201317650001401339650001301353773011801366856008501484852000901569655001201578IND60624687420221120072826.0181206e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062468742DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btv5432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilpin, William10aPyPDB: a Python API for the Protein Data Bank  ap. 159-160.  aSummary: We have created a Python programming interface for the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) that allows search and data retrieval for a wide range of result types, including BLAST and sequence motif queries.

In addition to the use of regular LAMP primers to amplify the target region, a 5’-FAM–labeled backward loop primer (FLB) and 3’-dabcyl–labeled quencher probe (QP) were designed for annealing curve analysis of the amplification product. The QP, which contacts the FLB, is located at the SNP site and has the A₂₂₅₄ allele. LAMP reactions were performed at 63°C for 40 min, and the subsequent annealing curve analyses were accomplished within 20 min. The LAMP-FLP assay could clearly differentiate A₂₂₅₄ and G₂₂₅₄ genotypes according to the difference in the annealing temperature of the QP between the 2 genotypes. Good agreement between the LAMP-FLP and the real-time PCR for genotyping of this SNP was observed in the detection of EHV-1 in equine clinical samples. The newly developed assay is a simple and rapid method for detecting and differentiating EHV-1 strains with A₂₂₅₄ and G₂₂₅₄ polymorphisms and would be suitable for clinical use.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aalleles 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahorses 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3anucleic acid annealing 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atemperature 3aviruses 0aequid herpesvirus 1 0agenotyping techniques 0apolymorphism 0asingle nucleotide1 aBannai, Hiroshi1 aNemoto, Manabu1 aKokado, Hiroshi0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g2019 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.640-644dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387198564043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011300163300001800276520177000294536010402064592002802168596005602196650001202252650002002264650001702284650001102301650002102312650001302333650001102346650001402357650002202371650002002393650002302413650002502436651001102461653002502472653001902497653003002516653001802546653001102564653003802575653002002613653002602633700001202659700001802671700001702689700001202706700001802718773009802736856008002834852000902914655001202923IND60622405920221120131855.0181125e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062240592DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836176905882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuffield, CJ10aSpatial and temporal organic carbon burial along a fjord to coast transect: A case study from Western Norway  ap. 1325-1339.  aWe investigated spatial and temporal changes in accumulation rate and source of organic carbon on a gradient along the Lysefjord and the more coastal Høgsfjord, Western Norway. This was achieved through analysis of total organic carbon and nitrogen content of sediment cores, which were radiometrically dated to the early 19th and 20th centuries for the Høgsfjord and Lysefjord, respectively. Benthic foraminifera (protists) were utilized to determine changes in organic carbon supply and Ecological Quality Status (EcoQS) by their accumulation rate (benthic foraminiferal accumulation rate (BFAR)), assemblage composition, species diversity, individual species responses and the composition of stable carbon isotopes of the tests (shells) of Cassidulina laevigata, Hyalinea balthica and Melonis barleeanus. Organic carbon accumulation rates were greatest closest to the river Lyse at the head of the Lysefjord (83–171 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹). The organic carbon at the head of the fjord is mainly terrestrial in origin, and this terrestrial influence becomes progressively less seaward. The δ¹³C in H. balthica tests as well as the benthic foraminiferal assemblage composition also showed a clear fjord to coast gradient. Organic carbon accumulation rates were lower and less variable at the seaward study sites (13–61 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹). We observe no temporal trend in organic carbon, carbon isotopes, EcoQS or foraminiferal assemblage composition in the Lysefjord. In contrast, in the Høgsfjord, there seems to have been an increase in organic carbon accumulation rates during the 1940s. Subsequent accumulation rates are stable. The foraminiferal assemblages in the surface sediments reflect a recent transition from good/moderate to moderate/bad EcoQS.  aFunding This project was partly funded by the Institute of Marine Research (project no. 14152-010).  aPublisher supplied data  aProject no. 14152-010cInstitute of Marine Research 3aRetaria 3acarbon isotopes 3acase studies 3acoasts 3anitrogen content 3aprotists 3arivers 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3astable isotopes 3atemporal variation 3atotal organic carbon 3aNorway 0abenthic foraminifera 0acarbon storage 0aEcological Quality Status 0alate-Holocene 0aNorway 0aorganic carbon accumulation rates 0astable isotopes 0aterrestrial influence1 aAlve, E1 aAndersen, N.,1 aAndersen, TJ1 aHess, S1 aStrohmeier, T0 tHolocene.g, v. 27, no. 9 p.1325-1339dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836176905883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010700162300001800269520096300287592002801250650001101278650001601289650001301305650001901318650002201337700001501359700001301374700001401387700001301401700001501414773010601429856008101535852000901616655001201625IND60120635120221118135853.0150208e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012063512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7672-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, F.

The FSP Mg–Li–Al–Zn alloy consisted of a mixed microstructure with fine, equiaxed, and recrystallized α (hcp) and β (bcc) grains surrounded by high-angle grain boundaries, and the average grain size of the α and β grains was ~1.6 and ~6.8 μm, respectively. The fine α grains played a critical role in providing thermal stability for the β grains. The FSP Mg–Li–Al–Zn alloy exhibited low-temperature superplasticity with a ductility of 330 % at 100 °C and high strain rate superplasticity with ductility of ≥400 % at 225–300 °C. Microstructural examination and superplastic data analysis revealed that the dominant deformation mechanism for the FSPed Mg–Li–Al–Zn alloy is grain boundary sliding, which is controlled by the grain boundary diffusion in the β phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3adeformation 3afriction 3amicrostructure 3athermal stability1 aTan, M.

Changes in temperature or salinity of dense shelf waters around Antarctica, resulting from increased glacial meltwater input, have the potential to significantly impact the location and structure of the global Meridional Overturning Circulation, with seabed irregularities such as submarine canyons, driving these flows toward the abyss. Submarine canyons also influence the location of intruding warm water currents by acting as preferential routes for rising Circumpolar Deep Water. These global changes have implications for large-scale effects to atmospheric and oceanic circulation. The ability for numerical modellers to predict these future behaviours is dependent upon our ability to understand both modern and past oceanic, sedimentological and glaciological processes. This knowledge allows ocean models to better predict the flux and pathways of Circumpolar Deep Water delivery to the shelf, and consequently to ice shelf cavities where melt is concentrated. Here we seek to understand how dense shelf water and other continental slope processes influence submarine canyon morphology by analysing newly collected geophysical and oceanographic data from a region of significant and prolonged dense shelf water export, the Hillary Canyon in the Ross Sea. We find that cascading flows of dense shelf water do not contribute to significant gully incision at the shelf edge during interglacial periods, however, are strong enough to prevent gully infilling and contribute to canyon-levee aggradation down-slope. We find buried paleo-gullies beneath gullies incising the modern seafloor. Paleo-gullies occur as single gullies and in complexes indicating that gully activity was continuous over multiple glacial cycles and formed an important role in the development of the shelf edge and upper slope. Glacial cycles likely drive large-scale shifts in canyon head processes with periods of intense seafloor erosion and significant gully incision likely occurring when ice grounded near to the shelf edge, during glacial and deglacial periods, when sediment-laden subglacial meltwater was released at the shelf edge. We put slope morphology observed at the Hillary Canyon head into global perspective to show that cascading flows of dense shelf water do not exert consistent patterns of erosion on high-latitude continental margins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanyons 3aexports 3ageophysics 3aglaciation 3aheat 3aice 3aice shelf 3alatitude 3asalinity 3asea level 3asnowmelt 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aSlope process 0aContinental slope 0aSubmarine gully 0aMeltwater1 aRebesco, M.1 aDe Santis, L.1 aBergamasco, A.1 aColleoni, F.1 aKim, S.1 aAccettella, D.1 aKovacevic, V.1 aLiu, Y.1 aOlivo, E.1 aColizza, E.1 aFlorindo-Lopez, C.1 aZgur, F.1 aMcKay, R.0 tGeomorphology.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 372 p.107453-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1074533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245007100165520123100236592002801467650001001495650001901505650001401524650001101538650002101549650001201570650001301582650002101595650002001616650001701636700002101653700002201674700002101696773012101717856008001838852000901918655001201927IND60783983320221120192007.0220726e20220719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078398332DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110710742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagata, Sayaka 10aDevelopment of Long-Acting Human Adrenomedullin Fc-Fusion Proteins  a(1) Background: Human adrenomedullin (hAM) is a hypotensive peptide hormone that exerts powerful anti-inflammatory effects. AM also had therapeutic effects in various animal experimental models of disease. However, treatment required continuous administration as the half-life of native AM is short in blood. To resolve this, we developed four human IgG1 and IgG4 Fc-fusion proteins containing full-length hAM or hAM residues 6-52. (2) Methods: We used mammalian cells to produce recombinant Fc-AM derivatives and tested the pharmacokinetics and biological activity of Fc-AM. (3) Results: We developed four Fc-fusion AMs (Fc-AM), which are long-acting AM derivatives in mammalian cells. Fc-AM had a prolonged half-life in blood and retained its ability to bind to the AM₁ receptor. Fc-AM (6-52) induced higher cAMP levels for the receptor than Fc-AM. After the administration of IgG1-AM (6-52) or IgG4-AM (6-52) to rats, tissue transfer to the kidney and small intestine was observed. In addition, treatment with IgG4-AM (6-52) inhibited blood pressure increase in spontaneously hypertensive rats. (4) Conclusions: Fc-AM produced from mammalian cells can be easily prepared and might be an effective novel therapeutic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood pressure 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3akidneys 3apeptides 3apharmacokinetics 3asmall intestine 3atherapeutics1 aYamasaki, Motoo 1 aKuroishi, Nobuko 1 aKitamura, Kazuo 0 tBiology.g2022 July 19, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110710743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04914naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001400295520268400309592002802993650001903021650001103040650002503051650002503076650001503101650001603116650002503132650001903157650001603176650002303192650001203215650001003227650001903237650001703256650001803273650001003291650002003301650001003321650000803331650000903339650001103348650002103359650001403380650001503394650002003409650002103429650001003450653000803460653000903468653000803477653000903485653000903494653000803503653000803511653000903519653001003528653000903538653000803547653000703555653001103562653001003573653000903583653000903592653000903601653002003610653002303630653001003653653001903663653001703682653004803699653002003747700002803767700002103795700002003816773012203836856008103958852000904039655001204048IND60607752420221121044608.0180801e20161212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060775242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2016.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanna, Daniel10aInfluence of sex and developmental stage on acute hepatotoxic and inflammatory responses to liver procarcinogens in the mouse  ap. 30-40.  aThe incidence of liver cancer is higher in men than in women. This sex difference is also observed in murine tumor induction models that result in the appearance of liver tumors in adult mice following their exposure on postnatal days 8 and/or 15 to carcinogens such as 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) or diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Previous studies performed in adult mice showed that acute hepatotoxic and inflammatory responses to high-dose DEN exposure were greater in males than in females, leading to the suggestion that these responses could account for the sex difference in tumor development. We also recently observed that female but not male mice exposed postnatally to ABP had slightly increased expression of the antioxidant defense genes Nqo1 and Ggt1, which are regulated by the oxidative stress response protein nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), while expression of Hmox1 was increased in both sexes. The goal of the present study was therefore to compare selected acute hepatotoxic, inflammatory and oxidative stress defense responses to ABP, DEN, or the prototype hepatotoxicant carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), in male and female mice exposed to these chemicals either postnatally or as adults. Exposure of adult mice to ABP, DEN or CCl4 produced a 2-fold greater acute elevation in serum levels of the hepatotoxicity biomarker alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in males than in females, while levels of the inflammatory biomarker interleukin-6 (IL-6) showed no sex difference. However, treatment of immature mice with either ABP or DEN using standard tumor-inducing postnatal exposure protocols produced no increase in serum ALT or IL-6 levels in either males or females, while CCl4 produced a 40-fold ALT elevation but with no sex difference. Basal expression of the NRF2-responsive gene Nqo1 was higher in adult females than in males, but there was no sex difference in basal expression of Ggt1 or Hmox1. Sexually immature animals showed no sex difference in basal expression of any of the three genes. Postnatal DEN exposure modestly increased the expression of Ggt1 only in male mice and Nqo1 in both sexes, while CCl4 slightly increased expression of Ggt1 in both males and females and Nqo1 only in females. Taken together, our results make it unlikely that acute hepatotoxic, inflammatory or NRF2-activated gene responses account for the male predominance in liver tumor growth following postnatal carcinogen exposure in mice. Our findings also suggest that acute toxicity studies performed in adult mice should be interpreted with caution when extrapolating potential mechanisms to liver carcinogenesis models that commonly use postnatally exposed mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3aadults 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogens 3adiethylnitrosamine 3afemales 3agenes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3amales 3amen 3amice 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aprotocols 3aprototypes 3astress response 3atoxicity testing 3awomen 0aABP 0aAFB1 0aALT 0aAPAP 0aCCl4 0aCYP 0aDEN 0aDMSO 0aGapdh 0aGgt1 0aHCC 0aH3 0aγH2AX 0aHmox1 0aIL-6 0aNqo1 0aNRF2 0a4-Aminobiphenyl 0aDiethylnitrosamine 0aLiver 0aHepatotoxicity 0aInflammation 0aNuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 0aSex differences1 aRiedmaier, Ariane Emami1 aSugamori, Kim S.1 aGrant, Denis M.0 tToxicology.g2016 Dec. 12, v. 373 p.30-40dElsevier Ireland LtdaElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2016.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011300170300001800283520055200301592002800853650001000881650001400891650002300905650002300928650000900951650001100960650002200971650002100993653002101014653002401035653002101059653003201080653002101112700001301133700001401146700001701160700001901177773008901196856008401285852000901369655001201378IND60551621520221118015408.0161019e20140326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055162152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Jing-Jing10aCatalyzation of 1,4-additions of arylboronic acids to α,β-unsaturated substrates using nickel(I) complexes  ap. 2107-2109.  aNickel(I) complexes were generated in situ from Ni (PPh3)2Cl2 using activated iron and the complexes combined with N,N′-bis(4-fluorobenzylidene) ethane-1,2-diamine (BFBED) were then used as a catalyst for the 1,4-addition reaction of arylboronic acids to α,β-unsaturated substrates.

Fibers from five varieties representing four cultivated cotton species (G. herbeceum, G. arboreum, G. hirsutum, and G. barbadense) are included in this study. With the exception of G. arboreum, breaking forces, toughness, and linear density are highly dependent on the seed position in the locule, and the dependence is especially high for G. herbeceum and G. barbadense. Fibers from seeds located closer to the main stem have higher breaking forces and linear densities, indicating their association with the distribution of nutrition resources. The relationships between single fiber tensile properties and fiber lengths vary among these cotton species. Breaking force and tenacity are independent of fiber length for G. barbadense, whereas fiber-length dependence is positive for G. herbeceum and G. arboreum, and there is a negative trend for the Maxxa variety of G. hirsutum. For G. herbeceum and G. arboreum, longer fibers have higher breaking forces, whereas the opposite is true for Maxxa. Single fiber breaking elongation decreases with increasing fiber length for all except G. barbadense. Overall variations of single fiber tensile properties are associated more strongly with the seed position in the locule than with the fiber length.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3aphysical properties 3aseeds 3atensile strength 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aGossypium barbadense 3avarieties 3aGossypium herbaceum 3alength 3abolls 3aGossypium arboreum 0aplant anatomy1 aYang, Hongbo1 aHsieh, You-Lo0 tTextile research journal.g2001 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.1079-1086dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517501071012083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03076naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011100166300001200277520161600289592002801905650001601933650002801949650002201977650001401999650001002013650002202023650001302045650003702058650001202095650002602107650001902133650001402152650001302166650001402179650001202193650001802205651001102223700002802234700002202262700003202284700002602316700002102342700001902363773010902382856008202491852000902573655001202582IND60578157020221118060518.0180619e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057815702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-017-1992-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatei, Gilvani10aProfiling and genotype × environment interactions of seed sugar contents in Brazilian soybean genotypes  ap. 203.  aBrazil is one of the largest soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) producers in the world, as well as main exporter. Little information is available about both the composition of Brazilian genotypes in respect to soluble sugars contents such as sucrose, glucose, raffinose and stachyose, and the effect of genotype × environment interaction (GEI). This study evaluated the soluble sugar contents, the GEI and the genetic variability of highly cultivated cultivars and new soybean lines. A sample of 46 commercial Brazilian cultivars and 35 pre-commercial lines were evaluated at six locations during the 2014/15 crop season, in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Soluble sugars were evaluated using an infrared spectroscopy (NIR) method. The average contents of sucrose, glucose, raffinose and stachyose were 3.3, 1.62, 0.39 and 3.07% which were lower than the levels found in other countries. All field traits were highly influenced by the environment. The cultivar NS 6121 RR presented a reduced (and stable across the environments) raffinose and stachyose content and can be used as a source of novel genes in breeding programs. Brazilian soybean presents genotypic differences which can be exploited to reduce or increase soluble sugar contents in breeding programs. There is a strong GEI for sucrose, glucose, raffinose and stachyose contents for Brazilian environments. The evaluated genotypes presented reduced contents of raffinose and stachyose, which are considered antinutritional factors. The new soybean lines presented similar soluble sugar contents to the tested cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aantinutritional factors 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aglucose 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aplant breeding 3araffinose 3asoybeans 3astachyose 3asucrose 3asugar content 3aBrazil1 aWoyann, LeomarGuilherme1 aMeneguzzi, Cátia1 aTodeschini, MatheusHenrique1 aTrevizan, DiegoMaciel1 aRosa, AnaClaudia1 aBenin, Giovani0 tEuphytica.g2017 Sept., v. 213, no. 9 p.203-203dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-017-1992-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015900170300001600329520106800345592002801413650001801441650002201459650001701481650002001498650002801518650001801546650001601564650001001580650001201590650001001602650001001612650001101622650001801633650001801651650001601669700001701685700001801702700002201720773011101742856008101853852000901934655001201943IND60587293420221118042857.0171216e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058729342DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255170601172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemenchenko, V.

Significant differences in the biomass of different algal groups in mesocosms with fish in respect to the control were established only for diatoms and were not found for other phytoplankton groups. Common carp had a greater effect on the abundance of large zooplankton species (Diaphanosoma brachyurum) compared to bream. The abundance of the small Bosmina longirostris increased in mesocosms both with bream and common carp. The macrozoobenthos biomass reduced at higher rates in mesocosms with common carp than in those with bream, with the strongest effect of common carp on mayfly larvae. The differences between the consumption of chironomid and oligochaete larvae were not established in mesocosms with common carp. Bream mainly affected the larvae of mayflies and oligochaetes and, to a lesser degree, the chironomid larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbramis brama 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChironomidae 3aCyprinus carpio 3aDiaphanosoma brachyurum 3aEphemeroptera 3aOligochaeta 3aalgae 3abiomass 3abream 3alakes 3alarvae 3alittoral zone 3aphytoplankton 3azooplankton1 aMoroz, M.

The cDNA obtained covered 1942bp with an open reading frame of 1635bp encoding 545 amino acids. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis revealed a high homology (91–100%) among most fish and higher vertebrates. This AMPKα2 mRNA predominantly expressed in muscle, liver and brain, while little in gill and intestine. Then, the AMPKα2 expressions were determined in the muscle, liver and brain of fish subjected to a glucose load (injected intraperitoneally with 0, 1.67 and 3.34g glucose per kg body weight) and after a 12-week feeding trial (fed two dietary carbohydrate levels: 30% and 43%), respectively. After the glucose load, plasma glycemia peaked at 1h in fish. Thereafter, it decreased significantly to the basal level at 8h. However, AMPKα2 expression in muscle, liver and brain all decreased significantly during the first 2h, then returned to the basal value at 24h. Unlikely, tissue AMPKα2 expression of fish receiving saline solution increased significantly during the whole sampling period. Additionally, high-carbohydrate diet enhanced its expression in liver and muscle, but not that in brain. These findings indicated that the AMPKα2 gene shared a high degree of conservation with that of the other vertebrates. Muscle, liver and brain AMPKα2 expressions were highly induced by glucose administration. Furthermore, high dietary carbohydrate modified its expressions in these tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aMegalobrama amblycephala 3aamino acids 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3abrain 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acomplementary DNA 3adietary carbohydrate 3agenes 3aglucose 3aherbivorous fish 3ahigh carbohydrate diet 3ahomeostasis 3aintestines 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3asodium chloride 3atissues 0aAMP-activated protein kinase α2 0aDietary carbohydrate 0aGlucose load 0aMegalobrama amblycephala 0aMolecular cloning1 aLiu, Wen-Bin1 aZhang, Ding-Dong1 aWang, Kai-Zhou1 aXia, Si-Lei1 aLi, Xiang-Fei0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2017 June, v. 208 p.24-34dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100005800187245008600245300001600331506007600347520125000423536012001673592002801793506003701821650001501858650001001873650001401883650001801897650006601915650001401981653002101995653001702016653002202033700002102055700001902076700003202095700001902127700001902146773014102165856008002306852000902386655001202395IND60655698720221207113334.0190803e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065569872DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387198569322doi7 aPMC68570292pmcid7 a311842872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaudler, Liane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9378-897010aIdentification and differentiation of avian Mycoplasma species using MALDI-TOF MS  ap. 620-624.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe identification of avian Mycoplasma spp. by conventional immunologic, phenotypic, and molecular methods can be demanding and time-consuming. We evaluated MALDI-TOF MS for its suitability to identify avian mycoplasmas at the species level. We generated a mycoplasma spectral database of 36 main spectrum profiles (MSPs) representing 23 avian Mycoplasma spp. using 23 type and reference strains, 1 live vaccine strain, and 8 clinical isolates. We then used 112 avian Mycoplasma clinical isolates of different avian mycoplasmas, 4 Mycoplasma live vaccine strains, and 1 Mycoplasma type strain, previously cultured and identified to the species level by molecular methods, to evaluate the MSP database. Protein extraction and MALDI-TOF MS analysis were performed with a maximum of 3 repetitions per isolate. MALDI-TOF MS resulted in accurate species-level identification with a score of ≥2.0 for 112 of 117 (96%) isolates. The MALDI-TOF MS analysis of 4 of 5 isolates that did not yield a score of ≥2.0 resulted in best-match identifications that were still concordant at species level with the molecular method used for previous identification. Therefore, MALDI-TOF MS is a promising tool for reliable identification of avian Mycoplasma spp.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycoplasma 3abirds 3adatabases 3alive vaccines 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aphenotype 0aavian mycoplasma 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0amass spectrometry1 aScheufen, Sandra1 aZiegler, Luisa1 aMöller Palau-Ribes, Franca1 aEwers, Christa1 aLierz, Michael0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g2019 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.620-624dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387198569323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245010200168300001800270520177500288536008302063592002802146596010002174596010002274650001202374650001202386650001302398650001202411650001102423650001702434650001502451650001502466650001102481650001702492650001102509650002402520651002402544651001302568653001902581653002102600653004302621653001702664653001302681653001102694700001602705700002802721773009802749856008002847852000902927655001202936IND60622406220221122020420.0181125e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062240622DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836176905912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Penelope J10aLong-term environmental change in eastern Tasmania: Vegetation, climate and fire at Stoney Lagoon  ap. 1340-1349.  aTasmania’s dry, inland east is ideally positioned to inform models of late Quaternary environmental change in southern Australasia. Despite this, it remains poorly represented in the palaeoecological record. Here, we seek to address this with a >13,000-year vegetation and fire history from Stoney Lagoon, a site at the eastern margin of Tasmania’s inland Midlands plains. Pollen and charcoal analysis indicates that here, a relatively moist early deglacial was followed by a dry later deglacial (ca. 14,000–12,000 cal. BP), when sclerophyll forests became well established and burning increased. This suggests that the Midlands’ vegetation responded to the climatic signals characterising Australia’s south-eastern coast rather than those governing developments in western Tasmania. Dry sclerophyll forest persisted throughout the Holocene; with a pronounced transition from more to less grassy understoreys between ca. 9000 and 7000 cal. BP. From the mid-Holocene, the sclerophyll community remains relatively stable. However, increased fire activity and trends in moisture-sensitive taxa suggest generally drier conditions coupled with greater hydroclimatic variability under the strengthening influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Overall, these results highlight the role of macro-scale climatic shifts in shaping vegetation development in Tasmania’s inland east, while hinting at the concurrent importance of local ecological drivers. This highlights the need for spatially diverse studies to understand interactions between drivers of long-term environmental change in sub-humid southern Australia. This research also supports conservation by strengthening understandings of pre-colonial baselines in this highly modified landscape.  aFunding This research was supported by ARC grants DI110100019 and IN140100050.  aPublisher supplied data  aDI110100019cAustralian Research Councildhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923  aIN140100050cAustralian Research Councildhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923 3aEl Nino 3aburning 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3acoasts 3afire history 3aglaciation 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apaleoecology 3apollen 3asclerophyll forests 3aAustralasian region 3aTasmania 0aclimate change 0aeastern Tasmania 0aEl Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 0afire history 0aHolocene 0apollen1 aThomas, Ian1 aFletcher, Michael-Shawn0 tHolocene.g, v. 27, no. 9 p.1340-1349dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836176905913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245016300172520148200335592002801817650002601845650001401871650001101885650002201896650001301918650001101931650001601942650001601958650002201974700002201996700002202018700002102040700002202061700003002083773012102113856008002234852000902314655001202323IND60783983620221120201947.0220726e20220719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078398362DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110710792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietrobelli, Annalisa 10aSexual Dimorphism in the Fibular Extremities of Italians and South Africans of Identified Modern Human Skeletal Collections: A Geometric Morphometric Approach  aFibular metric variations have revealed their potential in distinguishing between males and females; however the fibula remains scarcely analyzed in studies of sexual dimorphism. This work aims at investigating sexually dimorphic features in fibular proximal and distal epiphyses through geometric morphometrics methods. A total of 136 left fibulae, from two Italian and one South African identified skeletal collections were virtually acquired through CT and laser scanning and analyzed using geometric morphometric methods. Statistical analyses were performed on shape, form, and size variables. Results show that fibular epiphyses are smaller with narrower articular surfaces in females than in males in both extremities. Relevant sexual differences emerge in fibular form and size for the two Italian samples but not for the South African one, likely for its small sample size. Discriminant analysis on form principal components (PCs) offers accuracy above 80% when the samples are pooled, and reaches accuracy of 80–93% when the Italian samples are considered separately. However, our method on form PCs was not successful for the South African sample (50–53% accuracy), possibly due to the small sample size. These results show relevant morphological variation in relation to fibular form and size, with a degree of accuracy that indicates the utility of the present method for sexing human fibulae in both forensic and bioarchaeological contexts for Italian samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscriminant analysis 3aepiphyses 3afibula 3aforensic sciences 3ageometry 3ahumans 3amorphometry 3asample size 3asexual dimorphism1 aSorrentino, Rita 1 aDurante, Stefano 1 aMarchi, Damiano 1 aBenazzi, Stefano 1 aBelcastro, Maria Giovanna0 tBiology.g2022 July 19, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110710793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009900156520167200255592002801927650001101955650002801966650001201994650002802006651001002034700001702044700002002061773012802081856007402209852000902283655001202292IND60652733520221119141118.0190713e20181202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065273352DNAL7 a10.3390/su101245422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Weiwei 10aSustainability Evaluation of Cities in Northeastern China Using Dynamic TOPSIS-Entropy Methods  aThe revitalization of Northeastern China has been an important topic in China in recent years. Sustainable development of cities plays a strong role in the revitalization process. In this paper, we evaluated the sustainability of the 34 prefecture-level and above cities in Northeastern China. The evaluation process was viewed as a dynamic evaluation problem. A dynamic technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and entropy method was developed by extending the entropy weight and TOPSIS to dynamic situation. It was found that the sustainability levels of the cities in Northeastern China were comparatively low. Only four sub-provincial cities&rsquo; average performances were over 0.5 (accounting for 11.8%). Except for Jixi, nearly all the cities had dim sustainability because of the lower positive or even negative growth rates. In addition to Shenyang, Dalian, Changchun, Harbin, and Daqing, the other cities performed worst in the economic sustainability with performance values below 0.3. This implicates that the necessity and urgency of improving the economic sustainability levels of the cities in Northeastern China to realize the coordinated development of the three dimensions (economy, society and environment). In terms of the cities located in Liaoning province, they need to pay more attention to the economic sustainability, even though their economy basis (or levels) were comparatively better than that in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. For the cities in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, the decline of their environmental sustainability was serious. This case should arouse the attention of local authorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aeconomic sustainability 3asociety 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aYi, Pingtao 1 aZhang, Danning 0 tSustainability.g2018 Dec. 02, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101245423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001700186245012900203300001100332506007600343520056800419592002800987506003701015650003201052650002201084650002001106650003101126650001001157650001801167650001001185650002701195650004101222650002101263650001201284650004701296650007001343650003401413650004201447650003801489650001001527650004001537650004301577650001801620650006401638650001401702700001901716700001801735700001301753700001801766700001301784700001401797773009101811856007901902852000901981655001201990IND50089727620221207131945.0161031e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008972762DNAL7 aPMC40189682pmcid7 a247585932pmid7 a10.1186/1297-9716-45-482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, Pengbo10aDiscovering up-regulated VEGF–C expression in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells by classical swine fever virus Shimen  ap. 48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInfection of domestic swine with the highly virulent Shimen strain of classical swine fever virus causes hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and diffuse hemorrhaging in infected swine.

Our data prove the expansion of rotan and sunbleak ranges to the north. In particular, for the first time, populations of rotan are reported from the lower section of the Ob. We also present new data about range expansion of the studied fish species southward. All three species have probably reached the southern limits of their possible distribution in the Upper Ob system, entering the potamon/rhithron transition zone, because the species under study prefer lowland waters. The spatio-temporal dynamics of their expansion reveals the role of the Ob River as the main invasion corridor, enhancing their distribution mostly in meridional direction. In the system of the Upper Ob, rotan and sunbleak were found by us in isolated ponds and lakes, as well as in floodplain systems. This is in agreement with the concept of two invasion vectors: the translocation of fish by humans between water bodies and self-distribution along the river courses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlburnus alburnus 3aLeucaspius delineatus 3aPerccottus glenii 3afish 3afloodplains 3ahumans 3alakes 3aponds 3arivers 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3aSiberia1 aGolubtsov, A.

The majority of results based on this approach have been derived assuming a flat uninformative prior, but this assumption is to a large extent arbitrary (any one-to-one transformation of the random variable will change the flat uninformative prior into some non-constant function). In a companion paper we introduced the notion of a natural reference point for dimensional physical variables, and used this notion to derive a class of physical priors that are form-invariant to changes in the system of dimensional units. The present paper studies effects of these priors on the probability density functions derived using the maximum entropy formalism. Analysis of real data shows that when the maximum entropy formalism uses the physical prior it yields significantly better results than when it is based on the commonly used flat uninformative prior. This improvement reflects the significance of the incorporating additional information (contained in physical priors), which is ignored when flat priors are used in the standard form of the maximum entropy formalism. A potentially serious limitation of the maximum entropy formalism is the assumption that sample moments are available. This is not the case in many macroscopic real-world problems, where the knowledge base available is a finite sample rather than population moments. As a result, the maximum entropy formalism generates a family of “nested models” parameterized by the unknown values of the population parameters. In this work we combine this formalism with a model selection scheme based on Akaike’s information criterion to derive the maximum entropy model that is most consistent with the available sample. This combination establishes a general inference framework of wide applicability in scientific/engineering problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3amodels 3aprobability1 aChristakos, George0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2007 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.435-446dSpringer-Verlagx1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-006-0076-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014700167300001600314520165600330592002801986650001302014650001302027650001602040650001402056650001902070650001202089650001502101650002802116650001202144651001202156700001702168700002402185773010402209856004802313852000902361655001202370IND50073707120221120233507.0140307e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007370712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-014-0637-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardy, Peter B.14aThe impact of climatic change on butterfly geography: does climatic change produce coincident trends in populations, distributions and ranges?  ap. 855-876.  aWith climatic warming is the expectation of coincident changes in distributions and range limits driven by population changes. An outstanding question is whether such coincident changes (positive or negative) occur, especially in smaller regions in which management for change tends to be conducted. Using atlas and survey monitoring data (BMS) we studied population and distribution changes in 31 butterfly species in North West England over three recording periods (1940–1994, 1995–2001, 2001–2007). We found that since the first recording period many more species have shifted their centres of gravity significantly northwards and uphill than have increased in population abundance (density) and distribution cover. At the same time, far fewer species have effectively shifted southwards and downhill than have decreased in density and distribution cover. A significant association between change in distribution cover and density is divorced from the weaker association between shifts in altitude and northing; whereas many species are gaining northwards and at higher altitude, they are doing so from a failing base at lower altitude and at the core of their distributions. Usually losses at lower altitudes are ascribed to loss of biotopes. But, declines in some species, such as Lasiommata megera, are occurring at a much faster rate than physical changes to the landscape and in land uses. The findings of this study indicate that changes in populations, distributions and ranges are a great deal more complex than hitherto considered. Currently, the basis for such rapid changes is not being supported by detailed autecology on species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abiotopes 3abutterflies 3ageography 3aglobal warming 3agravity 3amonitoring 3apopulation distribution 3asurveys 3aEngland1 aSparks, Tim,1 aDennis, Roger L.

We explored postharvest application. Over the growing seasons of 2007–2010, three irrigation treatments were applied to ‘Conference’ pear in an experimental orchard. They were full irrigation (control, C), withholding irrigation after harvest (DI-PHₐ₊b), and full irrigation for two weeks after harvest followed by withholding irrigation (DI-PHb). According to our previous experience with ‘Conference’, the DI treatments were to be irrigated if midday stem water potential (Ψₛₜₑₘ) became lower than −1.5MPa. But it never did. The average annual irrigation water applied to C was 590mm. This was reduced by 15% for DI-PHb and by 27% for DI-PHₐ₊b. Fruit yield in DI-PHₐ₊b was similar to C for each of the three years following DI. But a carry-over effect was observed after the dry season of 2008. In 2009 fruit set and crop load were therefore reduced for DI-PHₐ₊b but fruit size was increased. For all years DI-PHb was similar to C in terms of fruit set, crop load, fruit size, and yield. Fruit soluble solids concentration (SSC), titratable acidity, and flesh firmness were measured in 2009 and 2010. They were the same in C and DI fruit except for 2009 when SSC was higher in DI-PHₐ₊b fruit. ‘Conference’ adapted to DI in such a way that Ψₛₜₑₘ could be maintained by higher water depletion at a greater soil depth as the experiment progressed. Postharvest DI is recommended for ‘Conference’ but to the extent that midday Ψₛₜₑₘ does not become lower than −1.2MPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3airrigation water 3atotal soluble solids 3afruit set 3apears 3adeficit irrigation 3afruit quality 3asoil depth 3airrigation rates 3atitratable acidity 3afruit yield 3awater potential 0asoluble solids1 aLopez, G.1 aMata, M.1 aGirona, J.0 tAgricultural water management.g2012 Jan., v. 103 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2011.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04249naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245014100161300001800302520186400320536020402184592002802388596011402416596011302530596011402643596006302757650001202820650001102832650001102843650002602854650001202880650001002892650001902902650001902921650002102940650001702961650001402978650002002992650002003012650001103032650001903043651001003062653003703072653002603109653003503135653001903170653001303189653003103202653001703233653002003250700001603270700001603286700001403302700001703316700001703333700001703350700001503367700001703382773009903399856008003498852000903578655001203587IND60622406420221122020919.0181125e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062240642DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836176938932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yong10aMid- to late-Holocene paleoenvironmental changes inferred from organic geochemical proxies in Lake Tangra Yumco, Central Tibetan Plateau  ap. 1475-1486.  aInvestigations of the paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental changes in the Tibetan Plateau in recent years have led to many significant achievements. However, high-resolution lake records from the mid- to late-Holocene have not been determined for the Central Tibetan Plateau, which is in the transition zone between the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) system and the westerlies. In this study, we analyzed the distribution and compound-specific carbon isotope compositions (δ¹³C) of sedimentary n-alkanes and the bulk sediment total organic matter (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and C/N ratios to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental changes over the past 6 cal. ka BP using a 376-cm sediment core from the southern basin of Tangra Yumco, Central Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that clear stepwise decreases in lake productivity and lake level occurred during the mid- to late-Holocene based on decreases in δ¹³C values of mid-chain n-alkanes and Paq (an n-alkane-based proxy). Additionally, the variations in the TOC, TN, and C/N ratios revealed generally increased inputs of allochthonous organic matter over the past 6 cal. ka BP. When our findings at Tangra Yumco were compared with records from the Central Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions, we found generally consistent patterns of lake environmental changes over the past 6 cal. ka BP, suggesting that the climate of the Central Tibetan Plateau was primarily influenced by the ISM system at the millennial time scale. Therefore, our results depict the evolution of the ISM over the past 6 cal. ka BP in the Central Tibetan Plateau, which corresponds to summer solar insolation and the migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). We also propose that the climate of the North Atlantics influenced the climate of the Central Tibetan Plateau through some indirect climatic mechanisms.  aFunding The National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos 41301206, 41271225, and 41190082) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grant no. 2012FY111400) supported this work.  aPublisher supplied data  a41190082cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a41271225cMinistry of Science and Technology of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a41301206cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2012FY111400cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aalkanes 3abasins 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aclimate 3alakes 3amonsoon season 3aorganic matter 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asediments 3asolar radiation 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3atotal nitrogen 3aChina 0acompound-specific carbon isotope 0aIndian summer monsoon 0aIntertropical Convergence Zone 0alake sediments 0an-alkane 0apaleoenvironmental changes 0aTangra Yumco 0aTibetan Plateau1 aWang, Junbo1 aZhu, Liping1 aLin, Xiao1 aHu, Jianfang1 aMa, Qingfeng1 aJu, Jianting1 aPeng, Ping1 aYang, Ruimin0 tHolocene.g, v. 27, no. 10 p.1475-1486dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836176938933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012000172500001900292520143900311592002801750650001501778650001701793650001401810650001201824650001201836650001101848650000901859650001401868650001501882650002201897650002001919650000901939653002101948653001601969653001701985653001502002653002102017700002402038700002202062700001802084700001702102700002102119700001902140700002102159773013202180856008602312852000902398655001202407IND60713382920221119143138.0201202e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071338292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.1037142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeil, Chelsea W.10aIodine effective diffusion coefficients through volcanic rock: Influence of iodine speciation and rock geochemistry  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAccurate prediction of the subsurface transport of iodine species is important for the assessment of long-term nuclear waste repository performance, as well as monitoring compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, given that radioiodine decays into radioxenon. However, the transport of iodine through intact geologic media is not well understood, compromising our ability to assess risk associated with radioiodine migration. The current study's goal is to quantify the matrix diffusion of iodine species through saturated volcanic rock, with particular attention paid to the redox environment and potential speciation changes. Diffusion experiments were run for iodide through lithophysae-rich lava, lithophysae-poor lava, and welded tuff, whereas iodate diffusion was studied through welded tuff. Iodine transport was compared with a conservative tracer, HDO, and effective diffusion coefficients were calculated. Likely due to a combination of size and anion exclusion effects, iodine species diffused more slowly than the conservative tracer through all rock types tested. Furthermore, oxidation of iodide to iodate was observed in the lithophysae-poor lava, affecting transport. Results provide much needed data for subsurface transport models that predict radioiodine migration from underground sources, and indicate the pressing need for geochemical and redox interactions to be incorporated into these models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3ageochemistry 3ahydrology 3aiodates 3aiodides 3aiodine 3alava 3aoxidation 3aprediction 3aradioactive waste 3arisk assessment 3atuff 0aMatrix diffusion 0aRadioiodine 0aRadionuclide 0aRepository 0aNonproliferation1 aTelfeyan, Katherine1 aSauer, Kirsten B.1 aWare, S.

Tourism is one of the sectors that has been heavily affected by the crisis. Even though there are several protocols for tourism activities that were written for the austral summer season, at the present, physical distancing is considered an effective way to reduce the spread of the virus. Clear and simple public actions should be rapidly implemented by the authorities to minimize the number of people on the beach. For instance, increasing the number of accesses to the beaches, building parking lots adjacent to the farthest beaches, or opening coastal roads on the outskirts of town to expand usable beaches, would be some simple and direct measures to reduce the beach population density. A simple analytical formulation for assessing the percentage decrease of the static population density respect to the absolute maximum population density on a beach is described in this paper. The variables of this simple analytical tool are the instantaneous sea-level (tide), air temperature, and beach expansion. Beach expansion is the single and manageable variable of the formulation, and refers to the inclusion of some near or adjacent extension of beach. It is suggested that the expansion of beaches would be very useful not only for pandemic time but also for the new normality. An application of this methodology is presented in the municipality of La Costa, Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3aair temperature 3acoastal zone management 3apandemic 3apeople 3apopulation density 3asea level 3asummer 3atourism 3aviruses 3aArgentina 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aBeach population 0aApplication example 0aMunicipality of La Costa 0aArgentina1 aBacino, Guido1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7904-02561 aAlonso, Guadalupe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1960-31810 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 July 01, v. 208 p.105589-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015900167300001600326520134300342592002801685650001601713650001801729650002501747650002101772650001001793650001301803650001601816650001901832650000901851650001801860650001701878650001301895650001301908650001401921650002301935650001801958700003301976700001602009700002002025700001602045773013202061856008102193852000902274655001202283IND60607236820221121065446.0180730e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060723682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-017-0391-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Eun Kyung10aGenome-wide Characterization of Brassica rapa Genes Encoding Serine/arginine-rich Proteins: Expression and Alternative Splicing Events by Abiotic Stresses  ap. 198-209.  aSerine/arginine-rich (SR) gene family members can diversify the transcriptome and proteome of eukaryotes by facilitating the alternative splicing (AS) of precursor messenger RNAs. Herein, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics, AS patterns, and expression levels of the Brassica rapa SR (BrSR) gene family in young seedlings treated with abiotic stresses. A comparative genomic analysis identified 25 BrSR genes at 18 Arabidopsis loci and three BrSR-like genes at two Arabidopsis loci. Thirteen of these loci were singletons, while seven loci carried paralogs. All the duplicated pairs were determined to be under purifying selection pressure. The expansion of the BrSR gene family was found to be the result of segmental duplications only. Additionally, the expression levels of 78.6% (22 of 28) and the AS patterns of 60.7% (17 of 28) of the BrSR genes were altered in response to abiotic stresses. Among the analyzed abiotic stresses, oxidative, cold, and heat treatments induced the largest expression changes, while cold and heat stresses caused most AS events. Our findings provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics of BrSR genes following polyploidization events, and provide an important resource for future studies aimed at characterizing the specific function(s) of BrSR genes in plant growth, development, and defense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica rapa 3aalternative splicing 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3aplant growth 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aseedlings 3aselection pressure 3atranscriptome1 aKrishnamurthy, Panneerselvam1 aKim, Jin A.1 aJeong, Mi-Jeong1 aLee, Soo In0 tJournal of plant biology =.g2018 Aug., v. 61, no. 4 p.198-209dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000110x1226-92397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-017-0391-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002200164245014800186300001600334520090300350592002801253650000901281650001301290650001901303650002201322650002901344650001201373650002901385650001001414650001801424650005301442650005301495650006301548650003801611650003801649650004401687653002901731653000901760653002001769653002301789653003501812653002901847653003001876653002001906700001701926700001701943700001801960773010601978852000902084856008302093655001202176IND2058838220221119205152.0181009e199703  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205883822DNAL7 a90660832pmid7 a10.1177/0300985897034002092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemarchand, T.

Gross findings included severely thickened and rugose distal rectal mucosae. Histologically, there were thickened villi, enterocyte hyperplasia, dilated glands filled with mucus and heterophils, and a dense infiltrate of heterophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells in the lamina propria. Examination of Warthin-Starry silver-stained sections revealed numerous apically located comma-shaped intracytoplasmic bacteria approximately 1X3 μm in size. Campylobacter-like organisms morphologically compatible with ileal symbiont intracellularis now known as Lawsonia intracellularis were seen via electron microscopy. Bacteria were further characterized by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody specific for the 25-27-kd outer membrane protein of L. intracellularis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemus 3abacteria 3ahistopathology 3aintestinal mucosa 3aLawsonia intracellularis 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxpathology 2aBirds 2aCampylobacter 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxisolation & purification 2aGram-Negative Bacterial Infectionsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aIntracellular Fluidxmicrobiology 2aProctitisxpathologyxveterinary. 2aRectal Prolapsexpathologyxveterinary. 0aDromaius novaehollandiae 0aemus 0aenteroproctitis 0aimmunofluorescence 0aileal symbiont intracellularis 0aLawsonia intracellularis 0aproliferative enteropathy 0arectal prolapse1 aTully, T.

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway has been identified as one of the downstream components of the maternal Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The ability of the FGF signaling pathway to induce the formation of a dorsal axis with a complete head structure requires chordin (chd) expression; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in this developmental process, due to activation of FGF signaling, remain unclear. In this study, we showed that activation of the FGF signaling pathway induced the formation of complete head structures through the expression of chd and dickkopf-1b (dkk1b). Using the organizer-deficient maternal mutant, ichabod, we identified dkk1b as a novel downstream factor in the FGF signaling pathway. We also demonstrate that dkk1b expression is necessary, after activation of the FGF signaling pathway, to induce neuroectoderm patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) axis and for formation of complete head structures. Co-injection of chd and dkk1b mRNA resulted in the formation of a dorsal axis with a complete head structure in ichabod embryos, confirming the role of these factors in this developmental process. Unexpectedly, we found that chd induced dkk1b expression in ichabod embryos at the shield stage. However, chd failed to maintain dkk1b expression levels in cells of the shield and, subsequently, in the cells of the prechordal plate after mid-gastrula stage. In contrast, activation of the FGF signaling pathway maintained the dkk1b expression from the beginning of gastrulation to early somitogenesis. In conclusion, activation of the FGF signaling pathway induces the formation of a dorsal axis with a complete head structure through the expression of chd and subsequent maintenance of dkk1b expression levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3afibroblast growth factors 3agastrulation 3ahead 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3asignal transduction 0achordin 0adickkopf-1b 0aFGF signaling 0aHead induction 0aThe Spemann organizer1 aHosokawa, Hiroshi1 aWeinberg, Eric S.1 aMaegawa, Shingo0 tDevelopmental biology.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245015100195300001600346520065500362592002801017650002201045650003001067650003501097650001201132650002101144650001101165650000901176650001201185650000901197650001201206650003501218650001201253650003401265650002901299650003301328650003401361650001101395650004101406650003301447650002401480650003901504650005401543650003201597651002301629651001101652700002701663700003201690773013001722856004801852852000901900655001201909IND4474524520221118034143.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447452452DNAL7 a217484722pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-011-0355-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsuna-Martínez, Carmen C.10aCadmium, Copper, Lead and Zinc in Cultured Oysters Under two Contrasting Climatic Conditions in Coastal Lagoons from SE Gulf of California, Mexico  ap. 272-275.  aIn order to determine the metal concentrations in cultured oysters from four coastal lagoons from SE Gulf of California, several individuals of Crassostrea gigas and C. corteziensis were collected and their cadmium, copper, lead and zinc levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry after acid digestion.

The aim of this work was to examine the influence of either decreased or increased mesos concentrations (MgSO₄, CaCl₂, and KH₂PO₄) on shoot multiplication of five cultivars of three small fruit species (Amelanchier alnifolia var. cusickii, Rubus fruticosus ‘Black Satin’ and ‘Loch Ness’, and Vaccinium corymbosum ‘Brigitta Blue’ and ‘Toro’). Mesos nutrients were manipulated from half to four times their base concentration. The results indicate that mesos manipulation significantly influences the number and length of shoots in most of the studied cultivars. The greatest multiplication rate for A. alnifolia was achieved with tripled mesos, whereas ‘Black Satin’ and ‘Loch Ness’ reacted positively to a lower (1–2x) concentration of mesos. Decreasing the concentration of mesos to half led to worse quality in both blackberry and Saskatoon shoots. ‘Brigitta Blue’ was more sensitive to greater mesos concentrations compared to ‘Toro’. Optimizing the mineral nutrition of plants cultivated in vitro enhances their multiplication rate and contributes to a higher production of good quality plantlets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmelanchier alnifolia 3aRubus plicatus 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3ablackberries 3ablueberries 3acalcium chloride 3acultivars 3afruits 3amagnesium sulfate 3anutrients 3aplant nutrition 3aplantlets 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3ashoots 3aSaskatchewan1 aGajdošová, Alena 1 aSzabóová, Monika 0 tPlants.g2020 July 24, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90809353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300001800270520241100288592002802699650001902727650001702746650000902763650001402772650001702786650002002803650002002823700001902843700001902862700002002881773011802901856008103019852000903100655001203109IND60537230120221120163021.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053723012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-016-1393-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSipos, Péter,10aChanges in micro-fabric and re-distribution of Fe and Mn with nodule formation in a floodplain soil  ap. 2105-2117.  aPURPOSE: Ferromanganese nodules are common features in aquic soils of the temperate climate. Although they are intensively studied due to their pedogenic significance, there is a lack of knowledge on the relationship between their micro-fabric and distribution of their major chemical components. Our aim was to fill this gap and to relate these characteristics to the different stages of the nodule development in the soil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To fulfill our aims, ferromanganese nodules from a gleyic fluvisol profile was separated in which nodules with strongly varying appearance and fabric are present in a wide depth interval, so they are expected to represent the different stages of nodule formation. Micro-chemical analyses were carried out on the polished surface of 28 nodules. Micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was used to produce Fe and Mn elemental maps of the whole nodules as well as line scan analyses along perpendicular cross sections. Additionally, the spatial distribution and major element associations of Fe and Mn within the individual nodules were studied by point analyses at 775 spots by electron micro-probe analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Typic and concentric nodules in the soil exhibited both similar (presence of outer coating band) and different (undifferentiated and banded interiors, respectively) characteristics in their micro-fabric. These were related to the rate of hydromorphism in the soil which was found to determinate the major processes (accretion vs. impregnation) forming the fabric of the nodules. The following stages of the nodule development were distinguished: (1) cementation, (2) formation of outer band, (3) re-arrangement and slow impregnation of nodules’ interior, and (4) fast impregnation of the interior and exfoliation of outer band. We found that separation of Fe and Mn is characteristic of each stage of nodule formation. However, as long as spatial segregation occurs in the first stages, displacement of Mn by Fe is rather typical later. CONCLUSIONS: Fabric and appearance of nodules form by varying rate and dominance of accretion and impregnation relatively slowly. However, distribution pattern of Fe and Mn within the nodules may exhibit much faster changes simultaneously. Complex micro-chemical analyses support a powerful tool to follow such changes and to get a deeper insight into the genesis of ferromanganese nodules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial soils 3afluorescence 3airon 3amanganese 3aspectroscopy 3atemperate soils 3atemperate zones1 aBalázs, Réka1 aBozsó, Gábor1 aNémeth, Tibor,0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2016 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.2105-2117dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-016-1393-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012000168300001600288520133900304592002801643650001501671650001501686650001101701650001901712650001501731650001101746650000901757650001201766650001601778650001001794653002101804653002101825653002101846700001601867700001701883700001401900700001801914700001801932700001601950773009001966856008502056852000902141655001202150IND60598503620221121130355.0190725e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059850362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Huijuan10aMethane recovery in a combined amine absorption and gas steam boiler as a self-provided system for biogas upgrading  ap. 744-751.  aBiogas, which primarily consists of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), is a renewable energy carrier, and can be upgraded to a natural gas substitute after removing trace impurities and CO2. Among the various CO2 separation technologies, amine absorption is generally considered to be energy intensive as regenerating the rich solution need additional heat to strip CO2. However, it could hardly be found the related data concerning energy consumption of biogas upgrading projects adopting amine absorption. In this work, a pilot biogas upgrading project with combined amine absorption unit and gas steam boiler was established with treatment capacity of 300 Nm3/h feed biogas. The major energy for operating this biogas upgrading project was self-provided through combustion a fraction of the biogas to generate steam for regenerating rich absorbent. Operation results showed that, besides much higher CO2 removal efficiency (>99.5%), CH4 recovery of this project attained around 89.0%, which was higher than that of several biogas upgrading projects using one-stage PSA or two-stage membrane permeation technologies. Based on the results of this work, it proves that amine absorption is a highly effective technique for CO2 removal in biogas upgrading projects, and its energy consumption is not higher than other technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aheat 3amethane 3anatural gas 3asteam 0aBiogas upgrading 0aAmine absorption 0aMethane recovery1 aChen, Zezhi1 aYu, Huiqiang1 aWu, Weili1 aWang, Weixing1 aPang, Honglei1 aDu, Mengfan0 tEnergy.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.744-751dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014700166300001400313520126800327592002801595650001201623650002501635650001801660650001101678650001701689650001201706700001801718700002401736700003501760773008701795856008101882852000901963655001201972IND60081922920221118042006.0141130e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008192292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-014-1939-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonin, Alan M.10aUnderstanding of colonization and breakdown of leaves by invertebrates in a tropical stream is enhanced by using biomass as well as count data  ap. 79-88.  aWe hypothesized that (i) the importance of shredders for leaf breakdown is more evident in terms of their biomass than their abundance, due to the large bodies and high-feeding efficiencies of some typical shredders; (ii) non-shredder invertebrates select more refractory leaves because these are a more stable substrate for colonization or to obtain other forms of food. To test these hypotheses, we performed a decomposition experiment with leaves of contrasting chemical composition in a tropical stream, and determined the changes in the ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of the litter, and the invertebrate abundance and biomass during a 44-day period. The biomass of shredders showed a positive relationship with AFDM remaining, whereas their abundance was unrelated to AFDM. While shredder abundance represented only 4–12% of total invertebrate abundance, shredder biomass constituted 19–36% of total invertebrate biomass. We conclude that (i) shredder biomass expresses better than abundance the role of this guild in the decomposition of leaf detritus, demonstrating that they are important for the functioning of tropical streams; (ii) incubation time rather than stability of leaf litter as a substrate influences colonization by non-shredder invertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3achemical composition 3ainvertebrates 3aleaves 3aplant litter 3astreams1 aHepp, Luiz U.1 aRestello, Rozane M.1 aGonçalves, José F., Jr.cJr.0 tHydrobiologia.g2014 Nov., v. 740, no. 1 p.79-88dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1939-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014000185300001800325520115300343592002801496650002201524650002201546650003201568650002401600650001301624650001201637650002601649650001501675650001901690650001501709650002501724650001301749650003701762650002201799650001201821650006301833650003601896650002901932650003701961650001101998650003202009650006002041650006302101650003302164650001702197700001802214700002902232773014402261852000902405856008202414655001202496IND4423070320221121012632.0200208e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442307032DNAL7 a194152652pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-009-2017-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajpai, Vivek K.10aAntifungal potential of essential oil and various organic extracts of Nandina domestica Thunb. against skin infectious fungal pathogens  ap. 1127-1133.  aThis study was undertaken to assess the in vitro antifungal potential of the essential oil and n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of Nandina domestica Thunb. against dermatophytes, the casual agents of superficial infections in animals and human beings. The oil (1,000 μg/disc) and extracts (1,500 μg/disc) revealed 31.1–68.6% and 19.2–55.1% antidermatophytic effect against Trichophyton rubrum KCTC 6345, T. rubrum KCTC 6375, T. rubrum KCTC 6352, Trichophyton mentagrophytes KCTC 6085, T. mentagrophytes KCTC 6077, T. mentagrophytes KCTC 6316, Microsporum canis KCTC 6591, M. canis KCTC 6348, and M. canis KCTC 6349, respectively, along with their respective minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 62.5 to 500 and 125 to 2,000 μg/ml. Also, the oil had strong detrimental effect on spore germination of all the tested dermatophytic fungi as well as concentration and time-dependent kinetic inhibition of T. rubrum KCTC 6375. The present results demonstrated that N. domestica mediated oil and extracts could be potential sources of natural fungicides to control certain important dermatophytic fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrosporum canis 3aNandina domestica 3aTrichophyton mentagrophytes 3aTrichophyton rubrum 3aacetates 3aanimals 3aantifungal properties 3achloroform 3aessential oils 3afungicides 3akeratinophilic fungi 3amethanol 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aspore germination 2aAnimals 2aAntifungal Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aArthrodermataceaexdrug effects 2aBerberidaceaexchemistry 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHumans 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aOils, Volatilexisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aOrganic Chemicalsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSpores, Fungalxdrug effects 2aTime Factors1 aYoon, Jung In1 aKang, S.

The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship among blood thiamine, mammillary bodies, major fiber bundle fractional anisotropy, and volume changes with diffusion tensor tractography in patients with acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure of non-alcoholic etiology. METHODS: Blood thiamine, mammillary bodies, fiber bundle fractional anisotropy and volume of major fiber tracts were quantified from acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure patients and compared with healthy controls. In 7 acute liver failure patients, follow-up study was done after clinical recovery at 5 weeks. RESULTS: Blood thiamine, mammillary bodies and fornix volume, and fornix fiber bundle fractional anisotropy were significantly decreased as compared to controls. Blood thiamine showed significant positive correlation with mammillary bodies' volume only. On follow-up study, acute liver failure patients showed significant reversibility only in blood thiamine level and mammillary bodies' volume. CONCLUSIONS: Mammillary bodies' volume changes are primarily a consequence of thiamine deficiency, which may secondarily result in microstructural changes in the fornix. These observable changes are known to be specific and may be reversible with restoration of blood thiamine level. These imaging changes may be used as imaging biomarker of thiamine deficiency in these patients in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrophy 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3abrain 3aetiology 3aliver failure 3apatients 3athiamin 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnisotropy 2aBiomarkers. 2aChild 2aDiffusion Tensor Imaging 2aEnd Stage Liver Diseasexphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFornix, Brainxpathology 2aHumans 2aLiver Failure, Acutexphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aMale 2aMammillary Bodiesxpathology 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeuronsxpathology 2aOrgan Size 2aRemission Induction 2aThiaminexblood 2aThiamine Deficiencyxbloodxetiologyxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aYoung Adult 0aIndia1 aYadav, Santosh Kumar1 aSaraswat, Vivek Anand1 aRangan, Murali1 aSrivastava, Anshu1 aYadav, Abhishek1 aTrivedi, Richa1 aYachha, Surendra Kumar1 aRathore, Ram Kishore Singh0 tClinical nutrition.g2012 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.422-428dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2011.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009200168300001600260520154900276592002801825650002001853650001201873650001601885650002301901650001001924650002301934650001801957650002001975650001301995650002602008650002002034650001502054650001902069650002502088650001602113650001402129650001802143650001802161700002402179700002302203700002102226773010402247856004802351852000902399655001202408IND4463744720221118034046.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446374472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-009-0316-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAina, Adebisola J.10aPhysicochemical Properties of Caribbean Sweet Potato (Ipomoea batatas (L) Lam) Starches  ap. 576-583.  aThe proximate compositions and physicochemical properties of 21 Caribbean sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L) Lam) starches were investigated. Proximate composition, amylose, reducing and non-reducing sugars were determined using standard methods. Swelling power and solubility were evaluated and pasting properties of the starches were determined using Rapid Visco Analyzer. Moisture (8.0â12.4%), protein (0.0â0.2%), ash (0.1â0.5%), and reducing (0.3â2.3%) and non-reducing sugar (0.1â0.2%) contents of starches were significantly different (Pâ<â0.05) among the cultivars. Amylose content varied significantly between 12.8â21.3%. Swelling power and solubility ranged between 7.8â31.1% and 1.5â9.6%, respectively. Pasting properties such as peak viscosity measured in Rapid Visco Units (143.2â288.8Â RVU), breakdown viscosity (29.4â162.6Â RVU), and setback viscosity (15.0â78.8Â RVU), pasting temperature (73.5â87.7Â Â°C) and time to pasting temperature (3.6â4.5Â min) varied significantly among the cultivars. Breakdown viscosity was poorly correlated with final viscosity attained (râ=âââ0.0507, Pâ<â0.05); however, pasting temperature was correlated (râ=â0.479, Pâ<â0.05) with setback viscosity. The variability observed in the physicochemical properties of the starches was related to specific requirements for use in the production of noodles, pasta, and inclusion in bread and weaning food formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIpomoea batatas 3aamylose 3aash content 3anonreducing sugars 3apasta 3apasting properties 3apotato starch 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aproximate composition 3areducing sugars 3asolubility 3asweet potatoes 3aswelling (materials) 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awater content 3aweaning foods1 aFalade, Kolawole O.1 aAkingbala, John O.1 aTitus, Pathelene0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.576-583dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-009-0316-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01599naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245009600169520062300265592002800888650001700916650000800933650001100941650001600952650001400968650001600982650001100998650000901009650001101018650001601029650001101045773011901056856007701175852000901252655001201261IND60707936220221120165933.0200821e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070793622DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90810372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPucciariello, Chiara 10aMolecular Mechanisms Supporting Rice Germination and Coleoptile Elongation under Low Oxygen  aRice germinates under submergence by exploiting the starch available in the endosperm and translocating sugars from source to sink organs.

Depending on the variety, rice can produce a short or a long coleoptile. Longer length entails the involvement of a functional transport of auxin along the coleoptile.

From the PZ, cells enter meiosis and differentiate, ensuring the continued production of oocytes. In this study, we investigated the proliferation strategy used to maintain the PZ pool by using a photoconvertible marker to follow the fate of selected germ cells and their descendants in live worms. We found that the most distal pool of 6–8 rows of cells in the PZ (the distal third) behave similarly, with a fold expansion corresponding to one cell division every 6h on average. Proximal to this region, proliferation decreases, and by the proximal third of the PZ, most cells have stopped dividing. In addition, we show that all the descendants of cells in rows 3 and above move proximally and leave the PZ over time. Combining our data with previous studies, we propose a stochastic model for the C. elegans PZ proliferation, where a pool of proliferating stem cells divide symmetrically within the distal most 6–8 rows of the germline and exit from this stem cell niche occurs by displacement due to competition for limited space.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3acell proliferation 3ahermaphroditism 3ameiosis 3amitosis 3aoocytes 3astem cells 3astochastic processes 0aGermline 0aStem cells 0aProliferation 0aLineage tracing1 aCohen-Fix, Orna0 tDevelopmental biology.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 423, no. 2 p.93-100dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012000172300002000292520146800312592002801780650000801808650001201816650002501828650003501853650001801888650001901906650001901925650001201944650001301956650002101969650002701990650001402017700001602031700006602047773011702113856008402230852000902314655001202323IND60751071720221116152850.0210921e20210909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075107172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c016392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeili, Amir R.10aImpact Dynamics and Freezing Behavior of Surfactant-Laden Droplets on Non-Wettable Coatings at Subzero Temperatures  ap. 11049-11060.  aThe present study investigates the impact and freezing behavior of the droplets of surfactant solutions on non-wettable coatings at very low temperatures of −10 to −30 °C. Our goal is to elucidate the critical role of concentration, molecular weight, and ionic nature of surfactants on these phenomena. To achieve this goal, we used sodium dodecyl sulfate (anionic), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (cationic), and n-decanoyl-n-methylglucamine (nonionic) at four concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 × CMC (critical micelle concentration). We captured the impact-freezing of the droplets on superhydrophobic alkyl ketene dimer coatings using a high-speed camera at 5000 frames per second. The results show that the ability of the droplets to spread and retract on the coatings is a function of concentration, ionic nature, and molecular weight of the surfactants, as well as the temperature-dependent viscosity of the solutions. Additionally, surfactant-laden droplets generally demonstrated an accelerated freezing compared to pure water. This might be due to the fact that the presence of surfactants can promote both heterogeneous ice nucleation from within the liquid and a larger solid–liquid interfacial area by filling the air pockets of the surface, leading to enhanced heat transfer. The behavior of the cationic surfactant at certain concentrations was, however, an exception leading to a freezing delay, for which a mechanism will be proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acameras 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3aheat transfer 3ahydrophobicity 3aice nucleation 3aliquids 3amicelles 3amolecular weight 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aviscosity1 aMir, Noshin1 aMuḥammadī, Riz̤ā,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4676-48850 tLangmuir.g2021 Sept. 09, v. 37, no. 37 p.11049-11060dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c016393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015000171300001600321520128400337592002801621650001401649650001401663650002001677650001501697650001601712650001401728650002901742650001801771650001301789650002001802650000901822650001401831650002101845650002001866650001601886650002401902653001401926653002601940653003901966653002102005653001602026653001302042700002102055700002702076700002202103700005702125773009102182856008502273852000902358655001202367IND60598503920221121130425.0191220e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059850392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetawea, Rodaina10aProcess intensification of the transesterification of palm oil to biodiesel in a batch agitated vessel provided with mesh screen extended baffles  ap. 111-120.  aOne of the major challenges in the production of biodiesel is the immiscibility of oil and methanol. The extent of dispersion between the two phases controls the mass and heat transfer rates and consequently the rate of the transesterification reaction. In this study, we report a novel design of a batch agitated vessel used for the production of biodiesel from palm oil. The new reactor is provided with static stainless steel mesh screen baffles to promote dispersion between the two immiscible reactants. The effect of the key parameters was investigated. The reaction yield was expressed in terms of FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) concentration. The optimum transesterification reaction conditions that yielded the highest biodiesel yield (97%) were as follows: methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, a reaction temperature of 60 °C, a one percent (wt.%) NaOH solution, a mesh screen size of 12″ and an agitation speed of 250 rpm. In order to test whether the produced biodiesel can replace diesel oil in combustion engines we evaluated the biodiesel quality, the engine performance and the emission characteristics of a B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel) blend. A reduction in carbon monoxide and a marginal increase in nitrogen oxides emissions was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3abiodiesel 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3afatty acid methyl esters 3aheat transfer 3amethanol 3anitrogen oxides 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asodium hydroxide 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3atransesterification 0aBiodiesel 0aPalm oil methyl ester 0aBase-catalyzed transesterification 0aBaffled reactors 0aPerformance 0aEmission1 aZewail, Taghreed1 aEl-Ashtoukhy, El-Sayed1 aEl Gheriany, Iman1 aHamad, Hesham1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2434-89040 tEnergy.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 158 p.111-120dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001600153245011700169300001400286520132400300592002801624650001301652650001001665650001301675650001401688650001001702650001401712650000901726650001801735650000701753650002001760650002501780650002301805650001801828700001401846700001801860700001801878700001401896700001601910773009501926856008902021852000902110655001202119IND4477009020221118034238.0141112e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447700902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2011.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPazzola, M.10aHigher somatic cells counted by the electronic counter method do not influence renneting properties of goat milk  ap. 32-36.  aLaws of different countries regarding SCC of goat milk are not in agreement with each other and sometimes they fix a threshold for the enhancement of dairy products. The aim of this study was to assess if renneting properties of goat milk are influenced by higher somatic cell count (SCC) measured by an electronic cell counter. Milk samples, taken throughout the lactation of 169 goats from three farms, were analyzed for chemical, physical, hygienic and renneting properties. Samples were divided into three levels on the basis of their SCC: L: low level, samples with SCC lower than 10â¶cells/ml; M: medium, between 10â¶ and 2Ã10â¶cells/ml; H: high, higher than 2Ã10â¶cells/ml. Milk clotting time was between 12.07 and 13.31min, curd firming time between 1.68 and 2.05min and curd firmness between 41.66 and 48.97mm. All the three renneting properties were not affected by the SCC level but they were highly correlated with other factors as protein content and pH. Furthermore, the microbial count showed a high positive correlation with SCC. These results showed that in goat milk, contrarily to other dairy species, higher SCC did not affect renneting properties and that counting of somatic cells by using electronic cell counters might be not suitable for the improvement of dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acounters 3afarms 3afirmness 3agoat milk 3agoats 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk clotting 3apH 3aprotein content 3arenneting properties 3asomatic cell count 3asomatic cells1 aBalia, F.1 aCarcangiu, V.1 aDettori, M.L.1 aPiras, G.1 aVacca, G.M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2012 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.32-36dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2011.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245006300158520074700221592002800968650001900996650001801015650001401033650002601047650001801073650002701091650001601118650001801134650002201152650001701174650001901191650001401210700001601224700001201240700001901252700001901271700001801290773011901308856007701427852000901504655001201513IND60707936320221120170157.0200821e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070793632DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90810382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yifan 10aAutophagy Dances with Phytohormones upon Multiple Stresses  aAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process for turning over unwanted cellular components, thus promoting nutrient recycling and maintaining cellular homeostasis, which eventually enables plants to survive unfavorable growth conditions.

In this review, we synthesized field and experimental data on free-floating plants (of varying size and phylogenies) and phytoplankton regimes, to assess the effects of these producers on the environment. Nutrient-rich environments promote free-floating plants dominance—regardless of life form—which causes dark and anoxic environments, and nutrient release from sediments. This reinforces free-floating plants dominance, but controls phytoplankton biomass by strong shading (despite high nutrients and low grazing). Phytoplankton dominance renders turbid and oxygen-rich (when producing) environments. We also searched for case studies of regime shifts for free-floating plants and phytoplankton dominance. Most studies showed that when free-floating plants dominance was interrupted, phytoplankton biomass (usually Cyanobacteria) rose steeply. Likewise, when phytoplankton-dominated, the development of dense mats of free-floating plants covers usually controlled phytoplankton. Field evidence that suggests critical transitions include abrupt regime transitions in time and space; yet, evidence including indoor controlled experiments and mathematical models is needed for conclusive evidence of alternative stable states to be drawn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3abiomass 3acase studies 3afree-floating plants 3agrazing 3amathematical models 3anutrients 3aphylogeny 3aphytoplankton 3asediments 3ashade 3aspace and time1 aO’Farrell, Inés0 tHydrobiologia.g2014 Nov., v. 740, no. 1 p.13-24dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1943-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245012600177300001600303520124800319592002801567650002001595650000901615650001801624650000901642650001301651650002001664650001501684650001701699653001501716653001601731653002601747653001601773653001701789700002201806700002401828773012101852856009001973852000902063655001202072IND50067596020221118195334.0190403e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006759602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalamurugan, R.J.10aInfluence of host anemone (Stichodactyla haddoni, saville-kent, 1893) locomotion on its resident anemonefish reproduction  ap. 103-107.  aAnemonefish are found commonly in reef habitats and they select only limited anemone species to exist their life. This study describes the movement of anemone, Stichodactyla haddoni and its impact on the reproduction of anemonefishes in captivity. The anemone movement was found to be creeping and in straight-line between successive positions (based on overlay mapping). The distance traveled by the host with (60%) and without substrate (20%) varied significantly (P<0.05) at a random direction. Spawning interval of the resident fish (3–4 days) increased significantly to 8–12 days (P<0.001) because of anemone mobility. Furthermore, host locomotion affected the embryonic development of harbored fish clutches. Percentage of egg maturity (3.5–35.3%) showed an exponential decrease with increase in the distance of substrate from the clutches, from 98 to 100% in the absence of host mobility to 3.5–35% with movement of >60cm. This study concludes that the sedentary habitat would enhance the reproduction value of the harbored fish. Further, in captivity providing with a substrate, supplying regular feed and good light intensity could prevent anemone migration and its implications on the reproductive success of the anemonefish.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaptive animals 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3afish 3ahabitats 3alight intensity 3alocomotion 3areproduction 0aLocomotion 0aSea anemone 0aStichodactyla haddoni 0aAnemonefish 0aReproduction1 aKumar, T.T.

To gain more insight into the character and extent of such a gap, as well as how to address it, this article examines how social sustainability has been addressed in peer reviewed scientific articles on MSP between 2005 and 2020. Using search terms such as participation, democracy, social inclusion, social cohesion, equity we systematically identify and review 310 scientific articles that address diverse social sustainability concerns within MSP and marine governance. The review showed that very few papers systematically conceptualised or developed a coherent framework for engaging with social sustainability. Instead, they mostly addressed particular social concerns including participation and engagement, equity and social justice, socio-cultural values and preferences. Marine management and planning efficiency, as well as related instrumental framings of the merits of participation were the key arguments for including these dimensions of social sustainability in MSP. In terms of how to better include social sustainability in MSP, most attention was given to social-cultural mapping and ways to improve social inclusion/participation while also redressing exclusion and maldistribution of outcomes in MSP practice. We conclude that there is a need to deepen and diversify MSP inquiry with respect to social sustainability. In particular, scholars would do well to delve deeper and more broadly in social science literature to find inspiration on ways to understand and elucidate social issues. Here, the enormous body of relevant work on justice, power, critical institutionalism, political ecology and terrestrial planning literatures has hardly been tapped. It is also evident from this review that there is a need for both the academic and practice-based communities to more comprehensively address how the multidimensions of social sustainability interact with each other, as well as with economic and environmental aspects of marine planning and governance. Based on these observations, we highlight a set of suggestions on how to develop MSP research and practice on social sustainability. Most importantly, we argue that more in-depth co-production, linking scholars, practitioners and society actors, is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3aecology 3agovernance 3apolitics 3asocial cohesion 3asocial justice 3asocial sciences 3asocial sustainability 0aMarine governance 0aSustainable development goals 0aSocial sustainability 0aParticipation 0aEquity1 aArmoskaite, Aurelija1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8040-57421 aGee, Kira1 aSaunders, Fred1 aTafon, Ralph1 aZaucha, Jacek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3280-32410 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 July 01, v. 208 p.105618-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1056183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01465naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012800156300001800284520036900302592002800671650001500699650001300714650001200727700001800739700001500757700001600772700002000788700001800808700001200826700001700838700001700855700001400872773013300886856007501019852000901094655001201103IND60766622920221123034202.0220209e20220208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076662292DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc05878a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xueli10aTetrakaidecahedron-shaped Cu four-core supramolecule as novel high-performance electrode material for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 2010-2013.  aHere, a tetrakaidecahedron-shaped Cu four-core supramolecule was designed to overcome the defects of supramolecules for lithium-ion batteries.

In this study, we examined potential interactions between smallmouth bass (introduced) and walleye Sander vitreus (a native predator) in two Missouri River reservoirs and four natural lakes in South Dakota, USA, using historical standardized sampling data, which indexed four fitnessârelated factors (relative abundance, size structure, condition, and growth) of both species. Of the 24 total relationships tested among all water bodies, three (13%) were determined to be significant (size structure in Pickerel Lake: Pâ=â0.06; condition in Lake Kampeska: Pâ=â0.06, and growth at Brant Lake: Pâ=â0.02). Of these three, two relationships were negative as would be expected if negative interactions exist between these two species (size structure in Pickerel Lake: râ=ââ0.61; condition in Lake Kampeska: râ=ââ0.61); the remaining relationship was positive (growth at Brant Lake: râ=â0.75). Further, no water body consistently demonstrated significant negative interactions in all relationships tested. The results of our study did not support the concept that introduced smallmouth bass interfere with walleye populations in South Dakota waters. Rather, it is more likely that other environmental factors influence the observed variability in walleye demographics and dynamics observed in this study. At this time, we believe that both fisheries will continue to coâexist. However, continuous monitoring of both species is warranted as changing environmental conditions in the future could allow these interspecific relationships to shift toward the dominance of smallmouth bass over walleye.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicropterus dolomieu 3aSander vitreus 3abody water 3ademographic statistics 3aenvironmental factors 3afisheries 3afood webs 3ahistory 3alakes 3amonitoring 3apredation 3apredators 3awater reservoirs 3aMissouri River 3aSouth Dakota1 aWillis, D.

However, their growth and development are inhibited in the subtropical regions due to the weak photosynthesis under high-temperature environment in the summer. Chlorophyll a fluorescence transient and 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analyses were conducted to investigate the response characteristics of photosynthesis under simulated 38 °C heat stress in leaves of Malus. ‘Prairifire’, a spring-red leaf cultivar of flowering crabapple with strong thermal adaptability. In the present study, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) was significantly decreased during the heat shock process, which showed a similar trend to the stomatal conductance (Gs), indicating a sensitive stomatal behavior to heat stress. Moreover, an efficient reaction center in photosystem II (PSII), and a functionally intact oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) conferred strong photosynthetic adaptability under heat stress. The higher level of transketolase (TK) under 48-h heat shock treatment was considered a protective mechanism of photosynthetic apparatus. However, heat stress inhibited the functions of light harvesting complex II (LHCII), electron transport in PSII, and the levels of key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, which were considered as the reasons causing an increase in the proportion of non-stomatal restrictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalvin cycle 3aMalus 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aelectron transfer 3aflowering 3afluorescence 3aheat stress 3aleaves 3alight harvesting complex 3aornamental woody plants 3aoxygen evolving complex 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3asubtropics 3asummer 3atransketolase 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aLuo, Siqian 1 aMa, Yingli 1 aLi, Lingyu 1 aXie, Yinfeng 1 aZhang, Wangxiang 0 tPlants.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90810403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010600170300001800276520158400294592002801878650003001906650002301936650002201959650002101981650001302002650001802015650000902033650001402042650002002056650002202076650002402098650001302122650002202135650001202157650001402169650001102183650001402194650003002208650001002238650001502248650002202263700003202285700002502317700002102342700002402363700001802387700001602405700005802421773012402479856008302603852000902686655001202695IND60636509420221120203552.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063650942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-019-04670-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVi, Thi Xuan Thuy10aOverexpression of the ZmDEF1 gene increases the resistance to weevil larvae in transgenic maize seeds  ap. 2177-2185.  aPlant defensins are divided into 18 groups and are multifunctional proteins. The Zea mays defensin 1 (ZmDEF1) gene encodes the defensin 1 protein, which can inhibit alpha-amylase in the insect gut. In this study, the ZmDEF1 gene was transferred into two maize cultivars, LC1 and LVN99, to improve weevil resistance in maize. The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein was assessed for its ability to inhibit alpha-amylase in the gut of the larvae of the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais Motsch.). ZmDEF1 was cloned into a pBetaPhaso-dest vector, which harbours phaseolin, a seed-specific promoter, and the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 harbouring the pBetaPhaso-ZmDEF1 vector was used to transfer the ZmDEF1 gene into two maize cultivars using immature embryos. Transformed calluses were selected on selection media containing kanamycin. The stable integration of the ZmDEF1 transgene into the transgenic maize plant genome was confirmed using Southern blotting. The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein of approximately 10 kDa was expressed in three transgenic maize lines from the LC1 cultivar (C1, C3, and C5) and two transgenic maize lines from the LVN99 cultivar (L1 and L3). The ZmDEF1 transgenic efficiency based on the results of PCR, as well as Southern and Western blotting, was 1.32% and 0.82%, respectively, which depends on the genotypes of LC1 and LVN99. The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein inhibited the alpha-amylase activity of the maize weevil larvae, and its ability to inhibit alpha-amylase is 54.52–63.09% greater than the ZmDEF1 protein extracted from non-transgenic plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aSitophilus zeamais 3aSouthern blotting 3aWestern blotting 3aZea mays 3aalpha-amylase 3acorn 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3agene overexpression 3agenotype 3ainsect resistance 3ainsects 3akanamycin 3alarvae 3aphaseolin 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseeds 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants1 aNguyễn, Thị Ngọc Lan,1 aPham, Thi Thanh Nhan1 aNguyen, Huu Quan1 aNguyen, Thi Hai Yen1 aTu, Quang Tan1 aLe, Van Son1 aChu, Hoang Mau1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8260-63690 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 Apr., v. 46, no. 2 p.2177-2185dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-04670-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010200170300001600272520144700288592002801735650001901763650002301782650001501805650001801820650001801838650002201856650002001878650001601898650001001914650002301924650001101947650002401958650001701982650001001999650001802009650001402027650001202041650001502053700001902068700001902087773011202106856008802218852000902306655001202315IND4478051420221118034210.0150812e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447805142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandero, J.L.13aTheeffect of feeding lentil on growth performance and diet nutrient digestibility in starter pigs  ap. 108-112.  aThe effects of substitution of soybean meal with increasing levels of green lentil (Lens culinaris) were evaluated in 240 starter pigs from 9 to 20kg. Five pelleted wheat-based diets containing 0, 75, 150, 225, or 300g lentil/kg were formulated to contain 9.76MJ net energy (NE)/kg and 1.20g standardised ileal digestible lysine (Lys)/MJ NE and were fed for 3weeks starting 2weeks after weaning at 19days of age. Lentil was added by replacing soybean meal and wheat and the diets were balanced for NE using canola oil and for amino acids using crystalline Lys, threonine, methionine and tryptophan. Increasing dietary inclusion of lentil linearly decreased (P<0.001) the diet apparent total tract digestibility coefficient for crude protein from 0.821 to 0.798 and digestible energy value from 14.4 to 14.0MJ/kg. For the entire trial (day 0â21), increasing dietary inclusion of lentil linearly decreased (P<0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and quadratically reduced (P<0.01) feed efficiency (G:F). Specifically, pigs fed 75â225g lentil/kg had a similar ADG and G:F than pigs fed 0g lentil/kg, whilst the inclusion of 300g lentil/kg reduced (P<0.01) both ADG and G:F by 10%. Differences in feed intake were not observed (P>0.05). In conclusion, inclusion of green lentil should not exceed 225g/kg in diets for nursery pigs to maintain similar performance as pigs fed a diet with soybean meal as the main supplemental protein feedstuff.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens culinaris 3aaverage daily gain 3acanola oil 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3agrowth performance 3alysine 3aprotein supplements 3asoybean meal 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3athreonine 3aweaning 3awheat meal1 aBeltranena, E.1 aZijlstra, R.T.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 June 1, v. 174, no. 1-2 p.108-112dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04450naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001600164245012900180300001600309520281500325592002803140650000903168650001403177650001803191650001303209650001403222650002503236650001903261650002003280650001203300650003803312650000903350650001103359650001703370650002503387650000903412650006303421650008303484650002303567650002003590653000903610653002503619653002503644653001403669653001903683653002003702773010603722852000903828856008303837655001203920IND2059357520221119205604.0181009e199609  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205935752DNAL7 a88851802pmid7 a10.1177/0300985896033005082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGinn, P.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic canine tissues were studied using an avidin-biotin complex technique employing three murine monoclonal antibodies (C494, C219, JSB-1) to different epitopes of the P-glycoprotein molecule. Evaluation of immunostaining of normal canine tissues revealed positive labeling detected by each antibody in the liver, proximal renal tubular epithelium, adrenal cortex, colonic epithelium, and capillary endothelial cells of the brain. A total of 166 tumors of epithelial or mesenchymal origin were evaluated for P-glycoprotein immunoreactivity. Hepatomas (4/4), colorectal adenomas (7/7), colorectal carcinomas (4/4), adrenal cortical adenomas (3/3), hemangiopericytomas (15/15), apocrine gland adenocarcinomas (4/5, 80%), and transitional cell carcinomas (2/2) consistently labeled with at least one of the antibodies. Histiocytomas (0/10), cutaneous plasma cell tumors (0/10), fibromas (0/3), fibrosarcomas (0/4), and leiomyomas (0/4) were uniformly negative with all antibodies. Malignant lymphomas (6/22, 27.3%), malignant melanomas (4/13, 30.8%), leiomyosarcomas (3/6, 50%), mammary gland carcinomas (12/19, 63.2%), mammary gland adenomas (3/9, 33.3%), squamous cell carcinomas (8/10, 80%), basal cell tumors (5/7, 71.4%), apocrine gland adenomas (1/2, 50%), cholangiocarcinomas (2/3, 66.7%), and thyroid gland carcinomas (2/4, 50%) gave variable results. The antibodies C494, JSB-1, and C219 labeled 66/166 (39.8%), 53/166 (31.9%), and 38/166 (22.9%) of all tumors studied, respectively. A total of 26/166 (15.7%), 22/166 (13.3%), and 37/166 (22.6%) of tumors were labeled by all three, just two, or one antibody alone, respectively. The antibody C494 was the only antibody labeling 28/166 (16.9%) of the cases. JSB-1 alone labeled 9/166 (5.4%) of the tumors. C219 failed to label any tumors not also labeled by either C494 or JSB-1. Labeling by C494 was more intense and specific than labeling by the other two antibodies. Results indicate that P-glycoprotein can be detected in routinely processed canine tissues. The detection of P-glycoprotein within canine liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and colon and within tumors arising from these tissues is consistent with that reported in the literature for human tissues. Variable labeling results of other tumors such as malignant lymphoma and mammary gland carcinomas also is consistent with reports of human studies. Detection of multidrug resistance markers such as P-glycoprotein in canine tissues may provide additional information upon which to base a prognosis or to design treatment regimens for canine tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aneoplasms 3aglycoproteins 3aepitopes 3adetection 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aanimal tissues 3adrug resistance 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxchemistry 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aFormaldehyde 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMale 2aNeoplasms, Experimentalxchemistryximmunologyxpathology. 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1xanalysisximmunology. 2aParaffin Embedding 2aTissue Fixation 0aDogs 0aimmunohistochemistry 0amultidrug resistance 0aneoplasms 0anormal tissues 0aP-glycoprotein.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 33, no. 5 p.533-541dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985896033005083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01119naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245005600163300001600219520018300235592002800418650001400446650001400460650001600474650001100490700002000501700002000521700001800541700001900559700002000578700002200598773010400620856004800724852000900772655001200781IND4424868220221118034209.0130428e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442486822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-009-9338-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBobaev, I.

However such patients are at a high risk for multiple primary neoplasm(s) (MPN). In order to study the genetic susceptibility to MPN, 22 candidate SNPs were genotyped based on which a distinctive Genotype Score was created using Additive, Dominant and Recessive models. Using lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) generated from these individuals, the Genotype Score was correlated with carcinogen sensitivity in vitro. LCLs from MPN patients exhibited significantly higher Genotype Score and showed resistance to genotoxic agents compared to matched controls. This report demonstrates quantitative assessment of cumulative effect of gene polymorphisms and its correlation with carcinogen sensitivity for predicting susceptibility to MPN.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3agenotoxicity 3agenotype 3ahead 3amodels 3aneck 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3arisk 2a7,8-Dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene 9,10-oxidextoxicity 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCarcinogensxtoxicity 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCell Cycle Checkpointsxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Transformed 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDNA Damage 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometry 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aGene-Environment Interaction 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHead and Neck Neoplasmsxgeneticsxpathology. 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aLymphocytesxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Genetic 2aMutagenicity Tests 2aNeoplasms, Multiple Primaryxgeneticsxpathology. 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors1 aKotnis, Ashwin1 aSarin, Rajiv1 aMulherkar, Rita0 tCancer letters.g2013 May 10, v. 332, no. 1 p.46-54dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2013.01.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010800169300001800277520112300295592002801418650002301446650001601469650002901485650000901514650002001523650001001543650001501553650001501568650001201583650002301595650001701618650001901635650001101654700002301665700002501688773012601713856008101839852000901920655001201929IND60607237920221121065635.0180730e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060723792DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9936-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamouda, Ragaa A.10aBioethanol Production by Various Hydrolysis and Fermentation Processes with Micro and Macro Green Algae  ap. 1495-1501.  aAlgae are considered as a good substrate for bioethanol production. This study was carried out to evaluate the potential chemical and biological hydrolysis of the macrogreen alga Ulva fasciata and the microgreen alga Chlorella vulgaris to pretreatment of cell wall and sugar production. Different concentrations of reduced sugar extracted from U. faciata was studied to obtain the maximum amount of bioethanol. Saccharomyces cerevisiae SH02, Pseudomonas sp. SH03, were used to determine the best microorganisms that affect in fermentation process and hence the production of bioethanol. U. fasciata contains maximum amount of sugar. Chemical hydrolysis is the best methods for pretreatment of algae. S. cerevisiae SH02 was the best microorganisms for fermentation process with sugar obtained from U. faciata by chemical hydrolysis. The highest ethanol production by S. cerevisiae SH02 was 40% with 5% sugar concentration that produced by acid hydrolysis and with increasing sugar ratio ethanol production decrease. The highest ethanol yield with Pseudomonas sp. SH03 was 22% obtained by fermentation of 5% algal sugar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aPseudomonas 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aUlva 3aacid hydrolysis 3aalgae 3abioethanol 3acell walls 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3amicroorganisms 3asugars1 aSherif, Shaimaa A.1 aGhareeb, Mohammed M.0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Sept., v. 9, no. 9 p.1495-1501dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9936-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03871naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001700164245012600181300001600307520211400323592002802437650004202465650001102507650001602518650001002534650002202544650001302566650002302579650001202602650002302614650004802637650003802685650001302723650000902736650001102745650002502756650002402781650004102805653002302846653002502869653004002894653002102934653001102955653002902966653002802995653002603023700001903049700002103068700001803089773010603107852000903213856008303222655001203305IND2059357620221119205610.0181009e199609  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205935762DNAL7 a88851812pmid7 a10.1177/0300985896033005092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuniappa, N.10aLight Microscopic and Ultrastructural Changes in the Ceca of Chicks Inoculated with Human and Canine Serpulina pilosicoli  ap. 542-550.  aLight microscopic and ultrastructural changes were observed in chicks challenged with North American Serpulina pilosicoli, a weakly β-hemolytic intestinal spirochete (WBHIS) associated with human and canine intestinal spirochetosis. Chicks in control groups received trypticase soy broth or canine Serpulina innocens. The birds were necropsied at weekly intervals, and the ceca were processed for bacteriologic and pathologic examinations. No WBHIS were isolated from the ceca of chicks in the control groups, but WBHIS with genotypes similar to the parent isolates were isolated from the ceca of chicks inoculated with human and canine S. pilosicoli. Gross examination revealed no significant changes in the ceca of chicks at any time post-inoculation. Light microscopic examination revealed no spirochetal attachment in the ceca of chicks in control groups. In contrast, focal to diffuse thickening of the brush border of the surface epithelium along with dilation of the crypt lumina and mild focal lamina propria heterophil infiltration were present in the ceca of chicks inoculated with human and canine S. pilosicoli. Scanning electron microscopic examination revealed focal to confluent spirochetal attachment mainly in the furrow region at the periphery of the crypt units. Transmission electron microscopic examination revealed spirochetes attached to the brush border of the cecal epithelium, causing effacement of the microvilli and disruption of the terminal web microfilaments. The cecal epithelium of chicks inoculated with the canine S. pilosicoli also had caplike elevations of the apical membrane at the point of attachment of the spirochetes together with large numbers of vesicles in the cytoplasm immediately beneath the terminal web and evidence of spirochetal invasion beyond the mucosal barrier. The changes observed suggested that the mechanism of attachment of human and canine S. pilosicoli to the cecal epithelium of chicks was analogous to but different from that described previously for other attaching and effacing gastroenteric bacterial pathogens of human beings and animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3apathological processes and conditions 3achicks 3aBrachyspira 3acecum 3aintestinal mucosa 3aadhesion 3astrain differences 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBrachyspiraxclassificationxpathogenicity. 2aCecumxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aChickens 2aDogs 2aHumans 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpirochaetales Infectionsxpathology 0aBacterial adhesion 0abacterial attachment 0aβ-hemolytic intestinal spirochetes 0acecal epithelium 0achicks 0aintestinal spirochetosis 0amicrovillous effacement 0aSerpulina pilosicoli.1 aDuhamel, G.

In the 24-h exposure assays, epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, actylcholine and γ-aminobutyric acid induced larval metamorphosis at 10−6 to 10−4M concentrations. In addition, epinephrine and dopamine, an epinephrine precursor, both exhibited inductive activity, indicating that the epinephrine biosynthesis pathway may play an important role in the process of larval metamorphosis in this species. The ions, NH4+ at 10−3M induced 8% metamorphosis, excess K+ at 5×10−2M induced 20% metamorphosis, and Ca2+ did not induce larval metamorphosis in all concentrations tested. Ethanol and methanol both induced metamorphosis in the 24-h exposure assays. Effects of exposure time on larval metamorphosis were further investigated for epinephrine, NH4+ and ethanol. Experiments revealed that efficacy of these chemicals varied with exposure time. Epinephrine at 10−4M induced a maximum of 31% larval metamorphosis after 1h exposure. NH4+ at 10−2M induced a maximum of 43% larval metamorphosis after 3h exposure. Ethanol at 0.5M yielded a maximum of 35% metamorphosis after 24h exposure. Thus, the above compounds were shown to be effective inducers of larval metamorphosis, and may be used to improve M. coruscus larval production for the Chinese aquaculture industry. The findings provide new insights on the biochemical mechanism controlling larval metamorphosis in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus 3abioassays 3abiochemical mechanisms 3abiosynthesis 3adopamine 3aepinephrine 3aethanol 3aexposure duration 3aindustry 3aions 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3amethanol 3amussels 3aserotonin 3asolvents 0aMytilus coruscus 0aLarval metamorphosis 0aArtificial inducers 0aNeuroactive compounds 0aOrganic solvents 0aIons1 aLi, Shu-Heng1 aLi, Yi-feng,1 aLiu, Zhi-Wei1 aLiang, Xiao1 aBao, Wei-Yang1 aLi, Jia-Le0 tAquaculture.g2013 June 01, v. 396-399 p.106-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245008300209300001400292520095600306592002801262650002401290650001201314650001901326650001001345650001001355650001001365650001201375650001401387650001601401651001701417653002001434653001401454653001801468653001301486653000901499700001801508700002101526700003001547700001601577773008901593856008501682852000901767655001201776IND60598504320221121091158.0191220e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059850432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁbrego, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4493-654010aPyrolysis of cashew nutshells: Characterization of products and energy balance  ap. 72-80.  aCashew cultivation leads to the generation of large amounts of nutshells. In order to determine whether pyrolysis could be a suitable method for the valorization of this agricultural residue, cashew nutshells (CNS) from Burkina Faso were pyrolyzed in the temperature range between 400 and 600 °C in a laboratory-scale fixed bed reactor. The solid, liquid and gaseous fractions were quantified and characterized, with special focus on the solid product. Recovery of the cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) was accomplished during pyrolysis separately from the pyrolysis liquid. Results suggest that, except for the aqueous fraction, all the products obtained from pyrolysis are suitable for fuel purposes, and that part of the CNSL can be recovered below 200 °C during the heating process. A preliminary energy balance of the process shows that burning the gases can provide the energy necessary for the process at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3aburning 3aenergy balance 3afuels 3agases 3ahulls 3aliquids 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3aBurkina Faso 0aCashew nutshell 0aPyrolysis 0aCarbonization 0aCharcoal 0aCNSL1 aPlaza, Daniel1 aLuño, Francisco1 aAtienza-Martínez, María1 aGea, Gloria0 tEnergy.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 158 p.72-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245004400169300001600213520113800229592002801367650002701395650001001422650001701432650002001449651001101469653002101480653001001501653001301511653002301524700002601547700002801573773010601601856008501707852000901792655001201801IND60563630920221120105748.0170303e20170217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056363092DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2017.12447972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomé, Karim10aSocial Interaction and Beer Consumption  ap. 186-208.  aThe aim of this article is to describe young consumers’ attitudes and conduct regarding beer consumption, analyzing the consumer as an individual (addressing internal factors) and in a collective (external factors). The research was designed in Brazil involving 52 participants, divided into 16 focus groups, and the respective data was transcribed and analyzed. The findings show three distinct types of consumers were identified. The authors termed these the Inductor , the Induced , and the Sophisticated . The article details how each type of consumer can be distinguished through different attitudes and factors. The results suggest that, rather than thinking of beer consumption as an individual item, beer consumption should be thought of as different types, involving different behavior, attitudes, and social interaction. The article demonstrates originality and value to put forward the notion that beer consumption should not be defined as an individual item. The framework offered in this article will assist future researchers to consider consumption of different types and brands of beer, based on social interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abeers 3afocus groups 3asocial behavior 3aBrazil 0aBeer consumption 0abrand 0aconsumer 0asocial interaction1 aSoares, Ariel Pirangy1 aMoura, Jehudiel Ventura0 tJournal of food products marketing.g2017 Feb. 17, v. 23, no. 2 p.186-208dRoutledgex1540-41027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454446.2017.12447973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012700169520174200296592002802038650002902066650003102095650001202126650002302138650001802161650002502179650001002204650001302214650001602227650003202243653001302275653001402288653000802302653002502310653003102335653004002366700002202406700002102428700001702449700001902466773013002485856008402615852000902699655001202708IND60779901720221120162625.0220714e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077990172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2022.1030502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelloli, Matteo10aEffectiveness of two UV-C light-emitting diodes (LED) systems in inactivating fungal conidia on polyethylene terephthalate  aThe present study aimed to assess the effects of two UV-C LED systems on three food-spoilage fungi (Hyphopichia burtonii, Penicillium brevicompactum, Aspergillus brasiliensis) that can contaminate food packaging materials. The UV-C LED systems were used at two distinct light intensities (9.0 mW/cm² and 5.5 mW/cm²) for up to 800 s. Fungal conidia were deposited on polyethylene terephthalate lids as either a single (4–5 log CFU/lid) or a multiple layer of cells (5–6 log CFU/lid) to evaluate any difference due to a potential “shadow effect”. In the tests performed, A. brasiliensis was the most resistant fungus to the effects of UV-C LED irradiation, with its 1D-value varying from 23 to 58 s (9.0 mW/cm²) and from 46 to 58 s (5.5 mW/cm²) regardless of the light source used or the type of inoculum. In contrast, H. burtonii and P. brevicompactum were inactivated within 5 s when a single layer was used, whereas their 1D-values were equal to 2–4 s (H. burtonii) and to 3–13 s (P. brevicompactum) when a multilayer was tested. Given the low fungal contamination of food packaging devices and the possibility of developing tailored LED systems, UV-C LED technology was confirmed as an interesting method of sanitization for food packaging. Industrial relevance: This study provides data on the behaviour of two different UV-C LED systems in inactivating fungal conidia on polyethylene terephthalate surfaces. This study helps to understand how specific factors (e.g., spatial arrangement of cells; fluctuating fungal loads on packaging devices) can influence the UV-C LED system performance and therefore could be useful for both plant manufacturers and food industries to develop tailored UV-C LED systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus brasiliensis 3aPenicillium brevicompactum 3aconidia 3afood contamination 3afood spoilage 3afungal contamination 3afungi 3ainoculum 3airradiation 3apolyethylene terephthalates 0aUV-C LED 0aPackaging 0aPET 0aHyphopichia burtonii 0aPenicillium brevicompactum 0aAspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 164041 aCigarini, Massimo1 aMilesi, Giovanni1 aMutti, Paola1 aBerni, Elettra0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2022 July, v. 79 p.103050-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2022.1030503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002200173245004300195300001500238520145900253592002801712650002001740650002101760650001801781650001301799650002601812650002501838650002501863650001001888650001301898650001101911650001801922650001601940650001801956700001601974700002001990700001902010773011602029856005502145852000902200655001202209IND50059128220221118034059.0121011e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005912822DNAL7 a237572352pmid7 a10.1111/j.1758-2229.2011.00309.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFridman, Svetlana10aBacterial communities in floral nectar  ap. 97-104.  aFloral nectar is regarded as the most important reward available to animal‐pollinated plants to attract pollinators. Despite the vast amount of publications on nectar properties, the role of nectar as a natural bacterial habitat is yet unexplored. To gain a better understanding of bacterial communities inhabiting floral nectar, culture‐dependent and ‐independent (454‐pyrosequencing) methods were used. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial communities in nectar are abundant and diverse. Using culture‐dependent method we showed that bacterial communities of nectar displayed significant variation among three plant species: Amygdalus communis, Citrus paradisi and Nicotiana glauca. The dominant class in the nectar bacterial communities was Gammaproteobacteria. About half of the isolates were novel species (< 97% similarities of the 16S rRNA gene with known species). Using 454‐pyrosequencing we demonstrated that nectar microbial community are distinct for each of the plant species while there are no significant differences between nectar microbial communities within nectars taken from different plants of the same species. Primary selection of the nectar bacteria is unclear; it may be affected by variations in the chemical composition of the nectar in each plant. The role of the rich and diverse nectar microflora in the attraction–repulsion relationships between the plant and its nectar consumers has yet to be explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus paradisi 3aNicotiana glauca 3aPrunus dulcis 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3achemical composition 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3ahabitats 3anectar 3anectar plants 3apollinators 3aribosomal RNA1 aIzhaki, Ido1 aGerchman, Yoram1 aHalpern, Malka0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2012 Feb., v. 4, no. 1 p.97-104dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-2229.2011.00309.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008600166300001400252520066700266592002800933596007300961596006301034650001701097650001501114650004601129650001101175650001501186650004401201650002301245650002501268650002101293650002201314650001001336650001401346700001301360700001901373700001801392700001701410700002001427700005601447773011301503856008201616852000901698655001201707IND60627552920221119051603.0200528e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062755292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-018-1232-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Dongsheng10aMacrolide sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids from the stems of Tripterygium regelii  ap. 23-33.  aNine new monomacrolide sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids, macroregelines A–I (1–9), were isolated from the stems of Tripterygium regelii, along with a known alkaloid, tripfordine B.

In this work, a membrane with photoresponse is fabricated by spraying hybrid particles of silicon and titanium dioxide. Under the combined action of hybrid particles and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane, the prepared membrane is superhydrophobic in air. Because of the presence of titanium dioxide, the membrane can realize the transformation from superoleophilic underwater to superoleophobic underwater through UV irradiation and heating. Surprisingly, the membranes with superoleophobicity underwater are also superhydrophobic underoil. Thanks to this unique wettability transition, the prepared membrane can be applied to emulsion separation and fog harvesting. This is inspiring for the preparation and the multifunctional application of multiphase media superlyophobic surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aemulsions 3ahydrophobicity 3asilicon 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3awettability1 aKang, Meng1 aGuo, Zhiguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4438-33441 aLiu, Weimin0 tLangmuir.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 37, no. 37 p.11115-11122dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c018953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01253naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012300157300001800280520032200298592002800620650001400648650001400662650001100676650001400687700002000701700002500721773013300746856007500879852000900954655001200963IND60766623420221123023236.0220209e20220208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076662342DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc06050c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Manisha10aElectronic interplay: synergism of binary transition metals and role of M–N–S site towards oxygen electrocatalysis  ap. 1934-1937.  aTowards rational catalyst development, a binary Fe–Co centre has been coordinated with S and N in a nanocarbon matrix.

The aim of this study was to observe the changes in the key components of EPS extracted from mechanical dewatered sludge before and after enzyme and thermal pressure treatment. The results showed that the soluble protein content increased by 160 and 110% and the polysaccharide content increased by 180 and 200% after adding 0.03 g/g TSS neutral protease and alpha-amylase, respectively. The effect of compound enzyme treatment was better than that of single enzyme treatment. Furthermore, three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy indicated the presence of tryptophan and aromatic-like proteins, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the types of functional groups exhibited a sharp decrease in the loosely bound-EPS layer after thermal pressure treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 51308349 and No. 51276119cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalpha-amylase 3abiopolymers 3adewatering 3aenzymatic treatment 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3aorganic matter 3apolysaccharides 3apressure treatment 3aprotein content 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3asludge 3atryptophan1 aWang, Lingyun1 aGao, Xuemei1 aYang, Tianhua1 aLi, Rundong0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Sept., v. 9, no. 9 p.1523-1533dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9941-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle08723naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006700153245012000220300001600340520727800356592002807634650000907662650001107671650001107682650001207693650001607705650001107721650001107732650001407743650001407757650001507771650001107786650001507797650001507812651001107827651001607838653002007854653001407874653002007888653002307908653002607931653002007957653001307977653001207990700003108002773008808033856008708121852000908208655001208217IND60564839320221120045543.0170712e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056483932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Arne Thorshøj1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8194-854614aThe regressive Early-Mid Cambrian ‘Hawke Bay Event’ in Baltoscandia: Epeirogenic uplift in concert with eustasy  ap. 288-350.  aThe lower Middle Cambrian of Scandinavia is reviewed and subjected to sequence stratigraphical analysis. Sequences are defined as transgressive–regressive depositional units bounded by maximum regressive surfaces and their correlative conformities. The lower Middle Cambrian forms part of a 2nd order sequence, labelled Cambrian Supersequence 3 (CS-3). It is bounded at the base by a regional unconformity ascribed to the so-called Hawke Bay Event, the focus of this paper. CS-3 comprises at least four 3rd order sequences, but the upper part above the Triplagnostus gibbus Zone has not been analysed as yet and the upper supersequence boundary remains undefined for the time being. The oldest sequence of CS-3 is seemingly of Early Cambrian age. There are numerous T/R cycles in the Acadoparadoxides oelandicus Superzone, here ranked as subsequences (4th order sequences), but a classification as 3rd order cycles of some of these is possible, thereby increasing the number of prospective sequences in CS-3. The high frequency sea-level fluctuations are reminiscent of glacioeustasy and the early Mid Cambrian possibly represents a c. 5Ma long glacial interval with overall low global sea-level and frequent sea-level changes.The Hawke Bay Event, as identified in Scandinavia, primarily reflects an extensive and long-lasting epeirogenic uplift of western Baltica, and using the term event is a misnomer. The uplift is informally referred to as the Hawke Bay uplift. However, the initial rapid uplift in the latest Early Cambrian coincided with ≥100m eustatic lowering of the sea-level, leading to simultaneous regression in the East Baltic area and elsewhere. This forced regression is assumed representing the Hawke Bay Event s.str. In Estonia–Latvia–Lithuania, the unconformity separating the Kibartian and Deimenian regional stages signals the Hawke Bay regression. The Hawke Bay uplift gradually and differentially subsided during the early Mid Cambrian, starting in the Öland–Gotland area, and the collapse then slowly progressed westwards and southwestwards. Subsidence also advanced from western Norway and eastwards whereas the western margin of Baltica apparently remained uplifted throughout the late Mid Cambrian to earliest Ordovician. In central Scandinavia, the last traces of the Hawke Bay uplift eventually disappeared during the Acidusus atavus Chron. As a result the Hawke Bay unconformity represents a greater hiatus in central and southernmost Scandinavia where the uplift persisted for a longer time (locally up to c. 6Ma), causing long-lasting non-deposition associated with minor erosion. The epeirogenic uplift is inferred to have been triggered by stress-induced isostasy linked to major plate-tectonic adjustments, possibly the onset of subduction in the adjacent Iapetus Ocean or cessation of the Timanide collision, or both.A series of palaeogeographical maps is constructed for the Middle Cambrian of Scandinavia and adjacent countries. Subcrop and onlap maps of the Hawke Bay unconformity, as well as isopach maps for Middle Cambrian formations are also shown. The elongate land area that straddled the axis of the Scandinavian Peninsula during the Early Cambrian disappeared after subsidence of the Hawke Bay uplift and a new basin configuration was established. This had an overall gentle westwardly sloping sea floor delimited by a broad uplift along the western Baltica margin that formed a submarine sill from the medial Mid Cambrian and onwards. The sill, which eventually disappeared in the later part of the Tremadocian, restricted exchange of water masses and the deeper parts of the epicontinental sea became characterized by dysoxic and anoxic conditions. The resulting organic-rich deposit is referred to as Alum Shale.The sea-level rose eustatically after the terminal Early Cambrian Hawke Bay lowstand (in a strict sense) to reach a temporary highstand during the later part of the A. oelandicus Superchron. It then fell abruptly again at the end of the A. oelandicus Superchron and remained low in the earliest part of the Paradoxides paradoxissimus Superchron. Overall, on a 2nd order scale, the sea-level remained low during the early Mid Cambrian and as a result, the clastic supply was relatively high. The principal sediment supply was from the east; initially minor amounts of clastics were also supplied from the uplifted parts of Scandinavia but overall erosion of the uplifted area was limited, probably due to the extremely flat topography. The high clastic influx from the east resulted in progradation, progressively shifting the coastline westwards. Eventually it reached a position roughly corresponding to the present-day east coast of mainland Sweden.In addition to the initial Hawke Bay regression (s.str,) in the latest Early Cambrian significant forced regressions occurred at the end of the Acadoparadoxides pinus–Pentagnostus praecurrens Chron (here named the Faludden Lowstand) and in the T. gibbus Chron (the Mid-gibbus Lowstand). Several unnamed sea-level lowerings also occurred in the A. pinus–P. praecurrens Chron. A rapid, major sea-level rise at the beginning of the A. pinus–P. praecurrens Chron, estimated at c. 60–70m, is named the Oelandicus Drowning. Fast sea-level rises at the start and in the middle of the T. gibbus Chron are referred to as the Forsemölla and Exsulans drownings, respectively. From the middle of the T. gibbus Chron onwards into the A. atavus Chron there was a major sea-level rise (Atavus Highstand). This latter rise is estimated at c. 100m and for the first time the sea-level became as high or higher than it was just prior to the Hawke Bay regression. The associated transgression shifted the coastline some 500–700km eastwards and from then onwards, extreme clastic starvation prevailed in the epicontinental sea covering Scandinavia. Simultaneously, the mid-shelf became a net sedimentary bypass zone, either due to regular outboard transport of sediment during storms or due to recurrent erosive events associated with sea-level lowstands.Two Mid Cambrian depositional phases are recognized, termed Depositional Phases 3 and 4. Depositional Phase 3 encompasses the transient increase in sedimentary supply during the early Mid Cambrian sea-level lowstand, whereas DP4 covers the strongly starved conditions and widespread dysoxia from the A. atavus Chron onwards associated with high sea-level. A gradual expansion of the oxygen minimum zone during the Mid Cambrian developed independently of the rising sea-level and is suggestive of a stratified water column, presumably created by silled basin conditions. It is likely, however, that the general ‘background’ oxygen level in the oceans also was low, perhaps due to sluggish global circulation in a greenhouse world.Two new regional stages, the Bödan and Almbackenian, are introduced for the Middle Cambrian A. oelandicus and P. paradoxissimus superzones of Scandinavia, respectively. The base of the Middle Cambrian Timofeevia lancare acritarch assemblage zone is located within the upper part of the A. pinus–P. praecurrens trilobite Zone. The T. gibbus trilobite Zone is informally subdivided into a lower Paradoxides jemtlandicus subzone and an upper Bailiaspis dalmani subzone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalum 3abasins 3acoasts 3adysoxia 3agreenhouses 3aoceans 3aoxygen 3asea level 3asediments 3astarvation 3astorms 3asubsidence 3atopography 3aNorway 3aScandinavia 0aMiddle Cambrian 0aSea-level 0aBiostratigraphy 0aChronostratigraphy 0aSequence stratigraphy 0aPalaeogeography 0aIsostasy 0aBaltica1 aSchovsbo, Niels Hemmingsen0 tEarth-science reviews.g2015 Dec., v. 151 p.288-350dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012300170300001600293520129900309592002801608650000901636650001901645650001101664650001201675650001401687650002001701650001801721650001101739650001301750650001801763650002401781653002501805653002101830653002401851653002301875700001401898700002001912700002001932700001601952773009101968856008502059852000902144655001202153IND60598504720221121091243.0191220e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059850472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuzhong,10aEntropy generation analysis on a heat exchanger with different design and operation factors during transient processes  ap. 330-342.  aEntropy generation analyses on the transient processes of heat exchangers can guide their designs and operations. A dynamic model of a typical recuperative heater is developed based on mass, energy, and momentum conservation equations. Dynamic behaviors of the heater during transient processes are analyzed based on the second law of thermodynamics. The real-time entropy generation rate due to the heat transfer between the work medium and metal surfaces, and the heat conduction in metals are presented and discussed. A cold fluid flow rate with 20% step increase is adopted as the boundary disturbance, and dynamic performances are obtained. Additional entropy is generated in the heater during the transient processes compared with stationary work conditions. Several design and operation factors of the heater are discussed. Calculation results show that the additional total entropy generation diminishes during the transient processes with the increase in the thermal diffusivity of metal. This rule is also suitable for the influence of thermal transfer resistance between the fluid and metal. By contrast, the metal thickness and specific heat capacity of hot work fluid have opposite influences on the total additional entropy generation of the heater during the transient processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aentropy 3aequations 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3ametals 3amomentum 3aspecific heat 3athermal diffusivity 0aRecuperative heaters 0aDynamic modeling 0aTransient processes 0aEntropy generation1 aLiu, Ming1 aZhao, Yongliang1 aQiao, Yongqiang1 aYan, Junjie0 tEnergy.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 158 p.330-342dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009500164300001800259520191500277592002802192650002402220650002102244650001102265650001402276650002802290650001102318650002402329650001802353650002202371650001102393650001202404650001502416650002102431650001702452700001702469700001902486700001602505773012602521856008102647852000902728655001202737IND60607238420221121102452.0180730e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060723842DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9950-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Ben-lin10aComparison of Different Pretreatments of Rice Straw Substrate to Improve Biogas Production  ap. 1503-1512.  aChemical and biological pretreatments (with NaOH, HCl, CO(NH₂)₂ and cellulase) were used to pretreat rice straw at ambient temperature (about 20 °C) to improve its biodegradability and increase anaerobic biogas production. The NaOH and CO(NH₂)₂ pretreatments reduced the percentage contents of hemicellulose and lignin. The HCl pretreatment mainly dissolved the hemicellulose and resulted in decreases of 12.5–7.1% of the hemicellulose. The percentage content of cellulose showed a dramatic decrease, from 38.3 to 10.9%, after the cellulase pretreatment. Compared with untreated rice straw substrate, the total biogas yield ratios were 3.38–5.91, 1.63–2.99, 1.93–5.22 and 3.62–6.45, with a hydraulic retention time of 30 days, under NaOH, HCl, CO(NH₂)₂ and cellulose pretreatments, respectively. The highest yields of biogas and methane were obtained from 40 U/g total solids (TS) cellulase-pretreated rice straw (20.433 and 9.918 L respectively). Biogas production yields of volatile solids (VS) were 123.7, 273.8, 318.5, 353.5 mL/g for control, 6% CO(NH₂)₂-, NaOH- and 40 U/g TS cellulase-pretreated rice straw substrate, respectively. Compared to untreated rice straw substreates, cumulative biogas production yields increased 16–103, 25–122% for NaoH- and cellulase-pretreated rice straw substrate, respectively. The results suggested that the highest removal efficiencies of TS and VS were obtained from 6% NaOH-pretreated (53.80 and 36.80%), 6% CO(NH₂)₂-pretreated (54.90 and 36.10%) and 40 U/g TS cellulase-pretreated (51.30 and 37.30%) rice straw substrate. In short, NaOH, HCl, CO(NH₂)₂ and cellulase pretreatment was suitable to enhance the biogas production. However, to choose the optimal treatment, the energy requirements relative to the energy gain as extra biogas production have to be taken into account, as well as the costs of chemicals or enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrochloric acid 3alignin 3amethane 3arice straw 3asodium hydroxide 3atotal solids1 aGuo, Xu-jing1 aYuan, Dong-hai1 aXu, Ji-ming0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Sept., v. 9, no. 9 p.1503-1512dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9950-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04117naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002100164245012400185300001600309520184900325592002802174650001102202650001602213650001002229650002402239650002702263650002302290650001702313650001802330650001202348650003902360650002302399650005102422650004602473650002702519650001102546650001502557650004002572650003502612650007702647650002002724650005502744650003502799650000902834650002702843650000902870650001302879650005602892650006302948650006103011650003303072650001703105653001703122653003403139653002203173700001803195700001903213773010603232852000903338856008303347961001303430655001203443IND2059596820221119205340.0181009e199611  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205959682DNAL7 a89520222pmid7 a10.1177/0300985896033006022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAckermann, M. R.10aPassage of CD18⁻ and CD18⁺ Bovine Neutrophils into Pulmonary Alveoli during Acute Pasteurella haemolytica Pneumonia  ap. 639-646.  aCD18 is a subunit for three β ₂ integrin molecules (Mac-1, p150, 95, LFA-1), which are expressed on the plasma membrane of neutrophils. These molecules mediate passage of neutrophils into sites of infection. In children and animals that lack CD18 expression, neutrophil infiltration is impaired in most tissues. However, in lung, CD18-neutrophils have been identified in the airway spaces during spontaneous episodes of pneumonia. To determine whether CD18 is vital for passage through the pulmonary alveolar wall, lung lobes of cattle with neutrophils that were deficient in CD18 expression (CD18-) and cattle with normal CD18 expression (CD18+) were inoculated with Pasteurella haemolytica by fiberoptic bronchoscopy; control lobes were inoculated with pyrogen-free saline (PFS). Neutrophil passage into alveolar lumina at 4 and 6 hours postinoculation was measured by computerized image analysis. Blood levels of neutrophils for CD18- cattle ranged from 12- to 26-fold higher than for CD18+ cattle prior to inoculation, and counts in both groups rose slightly postinoculation. In P. haemolytica-inoculated lobes, total numbers of neutrophils in alveolar lumina of the two groups were similar. An increase in the number of neutrophils in the alveolar wall was fourfold greater in CD18- cattle than in CD18+ cattle. In PFS-inoculatad lobes, the number of neutrophils in the alveolar wall was sixfold higher in CD18 cattle than in CD18+ cattle. This work shows that by 4 and 6 hours, CD18 neutrophils enter the alveolar lumen at a rate similar to that in CD18+ cattle. Higher numbers of CD18- neutrophils are present in the alveolar wall of control (PFS) and bacteria-inoculated lobes. Thus, the CD18- cells are increased in the walls of alveoli and numbers of neutrophils that enter the alveolar lumen are similar in CD18+ and CD18- cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3aneutrophils 3alungs 3abacterial pneumonia 3aMannheimia haemolytica 3adefense mechanisms 3ainflammation 2aAcute Disease 2aAnimals 2aCD18 Antigensxanalysisxgenetics. 2aCattleximmunology 2aCattle Diseasesxbloodximmunologyxpathology. 2aCell Membranexchemistryxultrastructure. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aHomozygote 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aIntegrin alphaXbeta2xanalysis 2aLeukocyte-Adhesion Deficiency Syndromexgeneticsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aLungxpathology 2aLymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1xanalysis 2aMacrophage-1 Antigenxanalysis 2aMale 2aMannheimia haemolytica 2aMice 2aMutation 2aNeutrophilsximmunologyxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aPasteurella Infectionsximmunologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPneumonia, Bacterialximmunologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPulmonary Alveolixpathology 2aTime Factors 0aInflammation 0aleukocyte adhesion deficiency 0arespiratory tract1 aKehrli, M.

Although no requirement for PSII activity in the BS has been established, several component proteins of PSII have been detected in BS cells of developing maize leaves exhibiting O₂-insensitive photosynthesis. We used the basal fluorescence emissions of PSI (F ₀I) and PSII (F ₀II) as quantitative indicators of the respective relative photosystem densities. Chl fluorescence induction was measured simultaneously at 680 and 750 nm. In mature leaves, the F ₘ(680)/F ₀(680) ratio was 10.5 but less in immature leaves. We propose that the lower ratio was caused by the presence of a distinct non-variable component, F c, emitting at 680 and 750 nm. After F c was subtracted, the fluorescence of PSI (F ₀I) was detected as a non-variable component at 750 nm and was undetectably low at 680 nm. Contents of Chls a and b were measured in addition to Chl fluorescence. The Chl b/(a + b) was relatively stable in developing sunflower leaves (0.25–0.26), but in maize it increased from 0.09 to 0.21 with leaf tissue age. In sunflower, the F ₀I/(F ₀I + F ₀II) was 0.39 ± 0.01 independent of leaf age, but in maize, this parameter was 0.65 in young tissue of very low Chl content (20–50 mg m⁻²) falling to a stable level of 0.53 ± 0.01 at Chl contents >100 mg m⁻². The values of F ₀I/(F ₀I + F ₀II) showed that in sunflower, excitation was partitioned between PSII and PSI in a ratio of 2:1, but the same ratio was 1:1 in the C₄ plant. The latter is consistent with a PSII:PSI ratio of 2:1 in maize mesophyll cells and PSI only in BS cells (2:1:1 distribution). We suggest, moreover, that redox mediation of Chl synthesis, rather than protein accumulation, regulates photosystem assembly to ensure optimum excitation balance between functional PSII and PSI. Indeed, the apparent necessity for two Chls (a and b) may reside in their targeted functions in influencing accumulation of PSI and PSII, respectively, as opposed to their spectral differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aC4 plants 3aHelianthus annuus 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aemissions 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3aphotosystem II 3aproteins1 aOja, V.q(Vello),1 aEichelmann, Hillar1 aBichele, Irina1 aDall’Osto, Luca1 aLaisk, Agu0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2014 Oct., v. 122, no. 1 p.41-56dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-014-0009-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011600173300001400289520099900303592002801302650001501330650002601345650000901371650000901380650001001389650002301399650001101422650001001433650002001443650001501463650001201478650001101490653001601501653001501517653001001532653001201542653001701554700003601571700004101607700002201648773010601670856008501776852000901861655001201870IND60563631320221120151731.0170303e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056363132DNAL7 a10.1080/10454438.2016.12747052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias Neto, José,10aHomeopathic complex increases survival without affecting the performance of Nile tilapia during masculinization  ap. 33-45.  aDuring the masculinization of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus , the effect of a homeopathic complex (containing Chamomilla, Quina , and sulphur) was evaluated based on survival, performance, gills and liver integrity, and parasitism. Group fed with basal diet + 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (control) showed low survival (40.02%), while the group that additionally received homeopathy and the group that received sucrose (vehicle) showed 73.7% and 87.7% survival, respectively. The growth performance of the group that received homeopathic and the control group was significantly higher than that of the group that received only sucrose. Still, fish that received the homeopathic complex showed higher branchial and hepatic integrity as compared to the other groups. The homeopathic complex contributes to a greater survival of fish in addition to maintaining satisfactory growth. Furthermore, homeopathy contributes to the improvement in gill and liver integrity of the Nile tilapia larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMatricaria 3aOreochromis niloticus 3adiet 3afish 3agills 3agrowth performance 3alarvae 3aliver 3amasculinization 3aparasitism 3asucrose 3asulfur 0aAquaculture 0aChamomilla 0aQuina 0asulphur 0atestosterone1 aValladão, Gustavo Moraes Ramos1 aViadanna, Pedro Henrique De Oliveira1 aPilarski, Fabiana0 tJournal of applied aquaculture.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 29, no. 1 p.33-45dTaylor & Francisx1545-08057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454438.2016.12747053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01511naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245007000205300001600275506007600291520026700367592002800634506003700662650004400699650001000743650002200753650001800775700001600793700001900809700002000828700001600848700001900864700001400883700001800897773010800915856008101023852000901104655001201113IND60537231620221207095254.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053723162DNAL7 a10.1007/s13659-016-0097-32doi7 aPMC49402562pmcid7 a272073142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Guo-Lei10aSix New 9,19-Cycloartane Triterpenoids from Cimicifuga foetida L.  ap. 187-193.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSix new 9,19-cycloartane triterpene derivatives, as well as 3 known analogues (7–9), were isolated from the roots of Cimicifuga foetida L.

The determination of the concentration of chemical composition in teas will predict the ranking of teas and indicate the geographical origins. This overview concerns an investigation of analytical methods that are being used for the determination of the geographical origin of tea. The analytical approaches have been subdivided into three groups: spectroscopic techniques, chromatographic techniques, and other techniques. The advantages, drawbacks, and reported applications concerning geographical authenticity are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3achemical composition 3achromatography 3aleaves 3aspectroscopy 3atea 2aCamellia sinensisxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aFood Inspectionxmethods 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aTeaxchemistry 0ageographical origin 0aanalytical methods 0atraceability 0atea0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 52, no. 9 p.775-780dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2010.508568  aDNAL 7aarticle
