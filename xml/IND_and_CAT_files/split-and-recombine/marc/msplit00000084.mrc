The physicochemical properties (relative density, refractive index, free fatty acids, saponification value, iodine value and peroxide value) of seinat seed and peanut oil blends in ratios 95:5, 85:15, 30:70 and 50:50 proportions were evaluated, as well as oxidative stability index, deferential scanning calorimetric (DSC) characteristics and tocopherols content. Results of oil blend showed that there was no negative effect by the addition of seinat seed oil to peanut oil and also had decreased percentages of all saturated fatty acids except stearic acid, conversely, increased the levels of unsaturated fatty acids. As for the sensory evaluation, the panelist results showed that seinat seed oil blends had no significant differences (p < 0.05) in all attributes except the purity. The results indicated that the blending of seinat seed oil with peanut oil had also increased the stability and tocopherols content. As Sudan is the first producer of seinat oil, blending of seinat seed oil with traditional oil like quality, and may decrease the consumption of other expensive edible oils.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucumis melo 3acalorimetry 3achemical composition 3acooking fats and oils 3afree fatty acids 3aiodine value 3amixing 3aoxidative stability 3apeanut oil 3aperoxide value 3arefractive index 3asaponification 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3astearic acid 3atocopherols 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3aChina 3aSudan1 aXia, Wenshui0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2015 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.8172-8179dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-1889-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011800158520206000276592002802336650001502364650003702379650001402416650001102430650001902441650002302460650003002483650001602513650001002529650002402539650001002563650002302573650001402596650001302610650001202623650001402635650001202649650001602661651001402677651001602691700001702707700002302724700002002747700001702767700002402784700002302808700002002831700001902851773012102870856007302991852000903064655001203073IND60742770620221122034230.0210624e20210621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074277062DNAL7 a10.3390/v130611842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Robyn N.10aAge and Infectious Dose Significantly Affect Disease Progression after RHDV2 Infection in Naïve Domestic Rabbits  aRabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2 or GI.2, referring to any virus with lagovirus GI.2 structural genes) is a recently emerged calicivirus that causes generalised hepatic necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation leading to death in susceptible lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Previous studies investigating the virulence of RHDV2 have reported conflicting results, with case fatality rates ranging from 0% to 100% even within a single study. Lagoviruses are of particular importance in Australia and New Zealand where they are used as biocontrol agents to manage wild rabbit populations, which threaten over 300 native species and result in economic impacts in excess of $200 million AUD annually to Australian agricultural industries. It is critically important that any pest control method is both highly effective (i.e., virulent, in the context of viral biocontrols) and has minimal animal welfare impacts. To determine whether RHDV2 might be a suitable candidate biocontrol agent, we investigated the virulence and disease progression of a naturally occurring Australian recombinant RHDV2 in both 5-week-old and 11-week-old New Zealand White laboratory rabbits after either high or low dose oral infection. Objective measures of disease progression were recorded through continuous body temperature monitoring collars, continuous activity monitors, and twice daily observations. We observed a 100% case fatality rate in both infected kittens and adult rabbits after either high dose or low dose infection. Clinical signs of disease, such as pyrexia, weight loss, and reduced activity, were evident in the late stages of infection. Clinical disease, i.e., welfare impacts, were limited to the period after the onset of pyrexia, lasting on average 12 h and increasing in severity as disease progressed. These findings confirm the high virulence of this RHDV2 variant in naïve rabbits. While age and infectious dose significantly affected disease progression, the case fatality rate was consistently 100% under all conditions tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagomorpha 3aRabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 3aVesivirus 3aadults 3aanimal welfare 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acoagulation 3adeath 3adisease progression 3afever 3aindigenous species 3amortality 3anecrosis 3arabbits 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aweight loss 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand1 aKing, Tegan 1 aO'Connor, Tiffany 1 aRead, Andrew J.1 aArrow, Jane 1 aTrought, Katherine 1 aDuckworth, Janine 1 aPiper, Melissa 1 aStrive, Tanja 0 tViruses.g2021 June 21, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130611843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012000166300001200286520101900298592002801317650001501345650001701360650002001377650001401397650001101411650002401422650002101446700006201467773013501529856008301664852000901747655001201756IND60755485120221120033632.0211114e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075548512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-10049-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFattahi, Hadi13aAn indirect measurement of rock tensile strength through optimized relevance vector regression models, a case study  ap. 748.  aTo design the structure of foundations and tunnels, one of the most important parameters to be well considered is the rock tensile strength (TS). Direct methods of TS measurement, i.e., laboratory experiments, are both costly and time-consuming. Therefore, to measure the rock TS, this paper proposes two novel hybrid optimization models, i.e. relevance vector regression (RVR) optimized by the harmony search (HS) and cuckoo search (CS) algorithms. A database including 76 datasets was constructed through collecting the rock samples from a tunnel site and exposing them to different tests (Brazilian tensile strength, BTS, as output) in laboratory. The proposed models performances were assessed through some statistical metrics, e.g., determination coefficient. The results demonstrated the successful application of RVR-HS and RVR-CS models in predicting BTS. However, the performance of RVR-HS was better than RVR-CS. As a conclusion, the HS algorithm played a great role in optimizing the proposed RVR model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adatabases 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3atensile strength1 aHasanipanah, Mahdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7582-67450 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 Nov., v. 80, no. 22 p.748-748dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-10049-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012300171300001800294520107800312592002801390650002301418650002201441650001201463650001501475650002201490650002501512650001301537651001001550653002301560653002101583653001701604653001901621653001501640700002001655700002001675773011401695856008401809852000901893655001201902IND60123687220221122134810.0150330e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012368722DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2013.7997252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunam, Ramesh K.10aCommunity Forestry and the Threat of Recentralization in Nepal: Contesting the Bureaucratic Hegemony in Policy Process  ap. 1407-1421.  aNepal's community forestry program has been touted as a successful case in decentralized forest management. However, the government of Nepal has often constrained the autonomy of local communities as an apparent attempt to reverse decentralization. This article identifies the mechanisms through which decentralized reforms and growing deliberative culture of policy process are attenuated. To this end, we analyze an amendment proposal of the government to revise the Forest Act 1993—a widely recognized legislation for democratic decentralization—with the tacit aim of re-equipping the government forestry staff with substantial power. This article shows that the government often monopolizes the policy process and obstructs community forestry, while failing to address its own governance deficits. While acknowledging the importance of an antagonistic form of resistance, we emphasize the combination of alliance-led resistance and research-informed deliberation as an effective strategy to contest inappropriate policy decisions and promote a deliberative culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity forestry 3aforest management 3aforests 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3apolitics 3aNepal 0acommunity forestry 0adecentralization 0adeliberation 0apolicy process 0aresistance1 aPaudel, Naya S.1 aPaudel, Govinda0 tSociety & natural resources.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 26, no. 12 p.1407-1421dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2013.7997253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152100006200212245007700274520268500351592002803036653002803064653002003092653000903112653001103121653001203132653001603144653001203160700001803172700002803190773009803218856008703316852000903403655001203412IND60701550520221121220931.0201104e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070155052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1073342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, G.B.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1626-08221 aPedersen, Gro B.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1626-082210aMorphometry of glaciovolcanic edifices from Iceland: Types and evolution  aThe morphology of glaciovolcanoes is considered one of the distinctive characteristics of their ice-confining eruption environment. However, a thorough morphometric analysis of a large number of glaciovolcanic edifices has never been performed. Based on semi-automatic geomorphometric mapping, we present a morphometric database of 155 glaciovolcanic edifices within the Icelandic neovolcanic zones, formed during the last 0.78 Ma. This database enables a comprehensive analysis of the morphometric diversity of a large suite of glaciovolcanic edifices. Sheet-like formations, however, are not considered due to lack of data. Using three planimetric measurements (basal length, average basal width and average summit plateau width) and their ratios, three main morphometric groups can be distinguished in a ternary diagram: 1) conical edifices with no or small summit plateaus, 2) linear ridges and 3) flat-topped edifices (subdivided into equidimensional and elongated). All three groups contain edifices with and without lava caps. These morphometric groups can be fitted to the commonly accepted terminology for cone/mound, tindar and tuya. However, since lava caps occur in all morphometric groups, a grouping based on its existence is not practical. This suggests that by adding the descriptor “lava-capped” to any of the three classes may be a useful way to refine the classification. Based on the ternary diagram, ridges are the most morphometrically distinct glaciovolcanic edifice, because of their extreme elongation, followed by flat-topped edifices and finally conical edifices. However, morphometric parameters cannot be used singlehanded to identify glaciovolcanic edifices from other types of volcanic edifices such as composite volcanoes, shields or submarine volcanoes, and should always be complemented with other observations. The glaciovolcanic edifice volumes range from 0.15 · 10⁻² km³ to 32 km³. Conical edifices are the smallest (<0.1 km³) and the group of flat-topped edifices has the largest edifices (>1 km³). Overall, with growth three morphological evolutions can be considered: (A) an initial eruptive fissure concentrates into one vent generating an equidimensional edifice, that either can be a conical or a flat-topped edifice; (B) the edifice maintains its elongation, suggesting that a fissure is the dominating vent structure, and during continued eruption develops significant summit plateaus, generating elongated flat-topped edifices; and (C) the edifice increases in elongation because the fissure lengthens during the eruption, and a plateau-building stage does not occur, producing increasingly elongated ridges.  aPublisher supplied data 0aVolcano-ice interaction 0aGlaciovolcanism 0aTuya 0aTindar 0aMóberg 0aMorphometry 0aIceland1 aGrosse, Pablo1 aGudmundsson, Magnús T.0 tGeomorphology.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 370 p.107334-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1073343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04134naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013300171300001800304520296700322592002803289650001203317650002303329650002003352650001303372650002103385650001003406650001103416650001303427650001303440650002203453650002203475650001503497700001903512773013803531856008203669852000903751655001203760IND60592098220221117205243.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059209822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-016-1636-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayes, MichaelH. B.13aAn appreciation of the contribution of Frank Stevenson to the advancement of studies of soil organic matter and humic substances  ap. 1212-1231.  aPURPOSE: The aims of this paper are to outline the state of knowledge with regard to the chemistry of soil organic matter (SOM) prior to 1950; then, to review and evaluate the contributions made by Frank Stevenson during Stevenson’s research period (1950–1994); and subsequently to outline advances that are being made in the modern era. PROGRESS IN THE STEVENSON PERIOD: Frank Stevenson’s research career began in the middle of the twentieth century when a number of techniques of colloid chemistry were available to him, but relatively few of the recently developed instrumental techniques and other procedures of analytical organic chemistry that have enabled significant advances to be made in the chemistry and properties of SOM components.The contributions that Frank Stevenson has made to the chemistry of SOM and of humic substances (HSs) are an integral part of his book (first and second editions) Humus Chemistry: Genesis, Composition, Reactions. The validity of the terms humus and HSs are being questioned as legitimate terms that describe definable components, and SOM is being viewed as a ‘continuum of progressively decomposing organic compounds’. The legitimacy of isolating the organic matter components from their native soil environment is questioned. Those who pose such questions would do well to consider how progress could have been made in the vital life sciences areas of, for example, proteomics and genomics, without the isolation of the relevant cellular components. We recognise the importance of clear and rigorous definitions of HS components and stress the need to isolate these components from the SOM matrix as a prerequisite to the study of the composition, structure and reactivity of these components. We disagree with proposals or suggestions that do not recognise HSs as a scientific entity, and we feel sure that Frank Stevenson would have supported this stance. Various studies of SOM and of HSs have taken place over the centuries, but progress was slow because the tools required to study such complex systems were not available. Frank Stevenson’s research involved many areas of humic chemistry, and his major advances were in aspects of functionality and in the interactions of humic functional groups with metals and to a lesser extent with anthropogenic organic chemicals. His studies of nitrogen and of ammonia in relation to organic matter also had a very great impact. PROGRESS IN THE MODERN ERA: Frank Stevenson can be said to have provided the stimulation that enabled beginners and established scientists to obtain a good grasp of the fundamentals of SOM and the humic sciences. His scientific contributions have catalysed many of the significant advances that have been made in the field since he retired. In the final section, some of the advances that have been made using modern analytical techniques are addressed and some of the controversial topics that have recently arisen are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanalytical methods 3aedaphic factors 3agenomics 3ahumic substances 3ahumus 3ametals 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3aproteomics1 aSwift, RogerS.0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2018 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.1212-1231dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-016-1636-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013200168500001900300520200600319592002802325650001202353650001302365650001102378650001302389650001602402651001502418653001002433653001102443653000902454653000902463700001802472700001802490700002502508700001802533700003002551700001502581700001602596700002302612700002502635700002102660773010502681856008702786852000902873655001202882IND60701550620221121221007.0201104e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070155062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.1051222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Safi10aEvaluation of CMIP5 models and projected changes in temperatures over South Asia under global warming of 1.5 oC, 2 oC, and 3 oC  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal performance of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models in the historical simulation and future projections of minimum (Tₘᵢₙ), maximum (Tₘₐₓ), and mean temperature (Tₘₑₐₙ) over South Asia (SA) during global warming of 1.5 ᵒC, 2 ᵒC, and 3 ᵒC targets under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. It is worth mentioning that the present study is the first of its kind to use such a large number of CMIP5 models to project future changes in Tₘᵢₙ, Tₘₐₓ, and Tₘₑₐₙ over SA using three different warming thresholds. The results show that CSIRO–MK3–6–0, MIROC–ESM–CHEM, CNRM–CM5, CCSM4, and MRI–CGCM3 models relatively performed better with a consistent and accurate spatiotemporal simulation of Tₘᵢₙ, Tₘₐₓ, and Tₘₑₐₙ over SA. In terms of projected changes, Tₘᵢₙ, Tₘₐₓ, and Tₘₑₐₙ show a dominating and consistent warming pattern over SA with stronger intensity in higher latitude than mid–low latitudes under 1.5 ᵒC, 2 ᵒC, and 3 ᵒC warming thresholds. The northwestern (eastern) regions of SA will witness greater (least) warming in Tₘᵢₙ, Tₘₐₓ, and Tₘₑₐₙ under all warming thresholds in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Furthermore, the central and southern parts of SA will experience a moderate increase in Tₘᵢₙ, Tₘₐₓ, and Tₘₑₐₙ under all warming targets. The uneven and intensified patterns of Tₘᵢₙ, Tₘₐₓ, and Tₘₑₐₙ may result in temperature extremes, which would pose potential risks to the local population. Therefore, more attention should be paid on the regional and local perspectives to estimate the adverse impacts of these extremes under different global warming targets. We further suggest to project future changes in climate extremes over SA under different warming levels, which will be helpful in climate change adaptation and mitigation over the study region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3alatitude 3amodels 3aresearch 3atemperature 3aSouth Asia 0aCMIP5 0a1.5 oC 0a2 oC 0a3 oC1 aYou, Qinglong1 aZhang, Yuqing1 aBhatti, Asher Samuel1 aUllah, Waheed1 aHagan, Daniel Fiifi Tawia1 aAli, Amjad1 aGohar, Ali,1 aJan, Mushtaq Ahmad1 aKhān, Shāh Nawāz,1 aʻAlī, Āṣif,0 tAtmospheric research.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 246 p.105122-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.1051223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013600160300001800296520081500314592002801129650001601157650002201173650002301195650002301218650002901241650001601270650001101286650001301297650002201310650001401332650001501346650001101361700001601372700002401388700002201412700002401434700002301458773011901481856007501600852000901675655001201684IND60549916420221117162231.0160909e20121005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054991642DNAL7 a10.1021/jo30153742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAggarwal, Trapti10aSite-Selective Electrophilic Cyclization and Subsequent Ring-Opening: A Synthetic Route to Pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinolines and Indolizines  ap. 8562-8573.  aAn efficient strategy for the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinolines and indolizines from pyranoquinolines via site-selective electrophilic cyclization and subsequent opening of pyran ring using silver/iodine under mild reaction conditions is described.

Quantum chemical calculations between C–N (ΔEₐ = 9.01 kcal/mol) and C–C (ΔEₐ = 31.31 kcal/mol) bond formation were performed in order to rationalize the observed site selectivity.

Satisfactory performance can be obtained in an ideal scenario with sufficient and static environment features. However, there are usually numerous dynamic objects in deep urban areas, and these moving objects can severely distort the feature-tracking process which is critical to the feature-based VINS. One well-known method that mitigates the effects of dynamic objects is to detect vehicles using deep neural networks and remove the features belonging to surrounding vehicles. However, excessive feature exclusion can severely distort the geometry of feature distribution, leading to limited visual measurements. Instead of directly eliminating the features from dynamic objects, this study proposes to adopt the visual measurement model based on the quality of feature tracking to improve the performance of the VINS. First, a self-tuning covariance estimation approach is proposed to model the uncertainty of each feature measurement by integrating two parts: (1) the geometry of feature distribution (GFD); (2) the quality of feature tracking. Second, an adaptive M-estimator is proposed to correct the measurement residual model to further mitigate the effects of outlier measurements, like the dynamic features. Different from the conventional M-estimator, the proposed method effectively alleviates the reliance on the excessive parameterization of the M-estimator. Experiments were conducted in typical urban areas of Hong Kong with numerous dynamic objects. The results show that the proposed method could effectively mitigate the effects of dynamic objects and improved accuracy of the VINS is obtained when compared with the conventional VINS method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3auncertainty 3aurban areas 3aChina1 aWen, Weisong 1 aHsu, Li-Ta 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 May 25, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121016863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245020900171300001800380520099900398592002801397650001701425650003501442650001101477650001501488650001501503650001301518650002501531650001501556650001701571653003501588653001201623653001201635653002501647653001601672700002001688773011401708856008401822852000901906655001201915IND60123687520221122134739.0150330e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012368752DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2013.8199542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowery, Damon R.12aA Qualitative Method for Collecting Spatial Data on Important Places for Recreation, Livelihoods, and Ecological Meanings: Integrating Focus Groups with Public Participation Geographic Information Systems  ap. 1422-1437.  aThe association between humans and their environments is highly interactive, with humans bound to the landscapes and landscapes subject to the actions of humans. Sense of place is a concept used to describe the relationships that exist, bonds that form, and the meanings that humans ascribe to landscapes. This article builds on previous qualitative research using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) to develop an alternative and efficient methodology to spatially represent place. The approach integrates participatory mapping procedures within a focus group format. Benefits of this approach include the rich text uncovered in qualitative place studies; the synergy of dialogue, efficiency in sampling, ability to elicit information from a range of groups; and the efficient use of drawn polygons as part of the qualitative PPGIS mapping procedure. This methodology can provide pertinent and spatially explicit findings useful for place based planning and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3afocus groups 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3aplanning 3aqualitative analysis 3arecreation 3aspatial data 0ageographic information systems 0amapping 0amethods 0apublic participation 0aqualitative1 aMorse, Wayde C.0 tSociety & natural resources.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 26, no. 12 p.1422-1437dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2013.8199543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01463naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011700161300001800278520051600296592002800812650001600840650002200856650001300878650001700891650001200908700002700920773014000947856007701087852000901164655001201173IND60521512720221120055849.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052151272DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1977-10052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreund, H.-R.10aÜber Oxocuprate, XXIV Zur Kenntnis von Lu2Cu2O5 und Sc2Cu2O5 / On Oxocuprates, XXIV About Lu2Cu2O5 and Sc2Cu2O5  ap. 1123-1124.  aSingle crystals of the compounds Lu₂Cu₂O₅ (A) and Sc₂Cu₂O₅ (B) were prepared by melting the oxide mixtures (2 CuO : 1 Lu₂O₃, 2 CuO : 1 Sc₂O₃) in a KF-flux.

M.10aCarbenoid Alkene Insertion Reactions of Oxiranyllithiums  ap. 8605-8614.  aThe first computational investigations of the carbenoid reactions of α-lithiated dimethyl ether (methoxymethyllithium) and the intramolecular and intermolecular reactions of lithiated epoxides with the alkene double bond to yield cyclopropane rings are presented. These reactions represent the full spectrum of known carbenoid pathways to cyclopropanation. The reaction of Li–CH₂–O–CH₃ with ethylene proceeds exclusively through a two-step carbolithiation pathway, the intramolecular reaction of 1,2-epoxy-5-hexene follows either the carbometalation or a concerted methylene transfer pathway (the former is energetically more favorable), and the reaction of lithiated ethylene oxide (oxiranyllithium) with ethylene, the main focus of this paper, appears to proceed exclusively by the methylene transfer mechanism. In the case of these latter reactions, the free energy of activation for cyclopropanation tends to decrease with the higher aggregation states. Formation of tetramers or higher aggregates is favorable in nonpolar solvents, but in strongly coordinating solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), steric factors appear to limit aggregate sizes to the dimer. In the case of 1,2-epoxy-5-hexene, consideration of competing reaction pathways provide an explanation for the observed product distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aepoxides 3aethylene 3aethylene oxide 3aorganic chemistry 3asolvents 3atetrahydrofuran1 aMai, Binh Khanh1 aRamachandran, B.

Among plausible factors influencing this issue are hybridisation and introgression recently detected in the genus. Nonetheless, to date, only a bounded set of taxa have been investigated using integrative taxonomy combining morphological and molecular data. Here, we report the first large-scale study on five feather grass species across several hybrid zones in Russia and Central Asia. In total, 302 specimens were sampled in the field and classified based on the current descriptions of these taxa. They were then genotyped with high density genome-wide markers and measured based on a set of morphological characters to delimitate species and assess levels of hybridisation and introgression. Moreover, we tested species for past introgression and estimated divergence times between them. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that 250 specimens represent five distinct species: S. baicalensis, S. capillata, S. glareosa, S. grandis and S. krylovii. The remaining 52 individuals provided evidence for extensive hybridisation between S. capillata and S. baicalensis, S. capillata and S. krylovii, S. baicalensis and S. krylovii, as well as to a lesser extent between S. grandis and S. krylovii, S. grandis and S. baicalensis. We detected past reticulation events between S. baicalensis, S. krylovii, S. grandis and inferred that diversification within species S. capillata, S. baicalensis, S. krylovii and S. grandis started ca. 130–96 kya. In addition, the assessment of genetic population structure revealed signs of contemporary gene flow between populations across species from the section Leiostipa, despite significant geographical distances between some of them. Lastly, we concluded that only 5 out of 52 hybrid taxa were properly identified solely based on morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that hybridisation is an important mechanism driving evolution in Stipa. As an outcome, this phenomenon complicates identification of hybrid taxa in the field using morphological characters alone. Thus, integrative taxonomy seems to be the only reliable way to properly resolve the phylogenetic issue of Stipa. Moreover, we believe that feather grasses may be a suitable genus to study hybridisation and introgression events in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3agene flow 3agenotyping 3agrasses 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3aphenotypic variation 3aphylogeny 3aplant biology 3apopulation structure 3ataxonomy 3aCentral Asia1 aRyzhakova, Daria1 aGudkova, Polina D.1 aNobis, Marcin0 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.505-505dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03287-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001400278520169700292592002801989650002402017650002102041650002002062650001002082650001102092650001202103650002202115650001202137650003402149650002102183650002402204650003302228650002202261653006802283653002302351653002302374653001602397653002002413653002402433700001902457700001902476773010802495856008202603852000902685655001202694IND60526937320221118003712.0180904e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052693732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2015.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKück, Ulrich14aThe composition and function of the striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK) complex in fungi  ap. 31-38.  aThe striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK) complex is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein complex that was recently described for diverse animal and fungal species. Here, we summarize our current knowledge about the composition and function of the STRIPAK complex from the ascomycete Sordaria macrospora, which we discovered by investigating sexually sterile mutants (pro), having a defect in fruiting body development. Mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid analysis defined core subunits of the STRIPAK complex, which have structural homologs in animal and other fungal organisms. These subunits (and their mammalian homologs) are PRO11 (striatin), PRO22 (STRIP1/2), SmMOB3 (Mob3), PRO45 (SLMAP), and PP2AA, the structural, and PP2Ac, the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Beside fruiting body formation, the STRIPAK complex controls vegetative growth and hyphal fusion in S. macrospora. Although the contribution of single subunits to diverse cellular and developmental processes is not yet fully understood, functional analysis has already shown that mammalian homologs are able to substitute the function of distinct fungal STRIPAK subunits. This underscores the view that fungal model organisms serve as useful tools to get a molecular insight into cellular and developmental processes of eukaryotes in general. Future work will unravel the precise localization of single subunits within the cell and decipher their STRIPAK-related and STRIPAK-independent functions. Finally, evidence is accumulating that there is a crosstalk between STRIPAK and various signaling pathways, suggesting that eukaryotic development is dependent on STRIPAK signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSordaria macrospora 3aeukaryotic cells 3afruiting bodies 3afungi 3ahyphae 3amammals 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aprotein subunits 3asignal transduction 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3avegetative growth 0aStriatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK) complex 0aCellular signaling 0aFungal development 0aAscomycetes 0aMammalian cells 0aSordaria macrospora1 aBeier, Anna M.1 aTeichert, Ines0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2016 May, v. 90 p.31-38dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2015.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245012800171500001900299520167500318592002801993650002202021650001302043650001202056650001302068650001102081650001602092650001102108650004302119650002502162650001302187650001002200650003202210650001802242650001702260650001502277700002002292700002302312700002202335700001902357700002702376773012102403856008002524852000902604655001202613IND60738650620221120212554.0210524e20210518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073865062DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110509972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCvelbar Weber, Nika 10aInfluence of Nitrogen, Calcium and Nano-Fertilizer on Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) Fruit Inner and Outer Quality  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe production system, especially fertilisation has an important effect on yield and quality of strawberries. In the present study, plants were fertilized with different doses of nitrogen (0–100% recommended doses), calcium chelate, as well as nano fertilizer Lithovit. Strawberry cultivar ‘Clery’ yield and quality parameters (fruit color and firmness) including nutritional indicators (total soluble solids, sugars, organic acids, phenolic and volatile compounds) were monitored. Volatiles were identified and monitored using headspace solid phase microextraction and analysed using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (SPME/GC-MS) and sugars, organic acids, and phenolic compounds with high performance liquid chromatography. Organic acids and phenolic compounds were detected with mass spectrometer (HPLC/MS). Both nitrogen and calcium fertilisation had altered sugars, organic acids, volatile and phenolic contents in strawberry fruits. Fertilisation with higher doses of nitrogen and calcium increased the content of unpleasant aromas aldehydes hexanal (up to 3.8-fold) and (E)-2-hexen-1- (up to 3.7-fold). The content of fruity esters was uppermost in fruits fertilised with nano-fertiliser Lithovit (up to 2.3-fold). Fertilisation with N and Ca decreased the strength of ketone and terpenoids fruity aroma. The highest content of total phenols, as well as all individual hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives were obtained in the nano-fertiliser Lithovit treatment. Fertilisation, especially with nitrogen, had mostly negative impact on strawberry flavour while nano-fertilization with Lithovit improved strawberry phenolic content and aroma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3aagronomy 3acalcium 3afirmness 3aflavor 3afruit color 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydroxybenzoic acids 3anitrogen 3aodors 3asolid phase microextraction 3aspectrometers 3astrawberries 3aterpenoids1 aKoron, Darinka 1 aJakopič, Jerneja 1 aVeberič, Robert 1 aHudina, Metka 1 aBaša Česnik, Helena 0 tAgronomy.g2021 May 18, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110509973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245017500150300001800325520145800343592002801801650002101829650002701850650001701877650001601894650002401910650002101934650001101955650001501966650002001981650000902001650001602010650001602026650002802042650003602070650002302106650002202129650001802151650001502169650001802184650001302202650001402215650001902229650003202248653001702280653001302297653002902310653001902339653002502358700001502383700001402398700001502412700001502427773011202442856007402554852000902628655001202637IND60673797520221116160736.0210209e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067379752DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pey2062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, N10aEffect of cysteamine hydrochloride supplementation on the growth performance, enterotoxic status, and glutathione turnover of broilers fed aflatoxin B1 contaminated diets  ap. 3594-3600.  aThis study aimed to investigate the effect of cysteamine hydrochloride (CSH) supplementation on the growth performance, opportunistic bacteria and enterotoxic markers, visceral lesions, glutathione turnover, and inflammatory factors of broilers fed diets contaminated with aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁). One-day-old Arbor Acres broilers (n = 480) were randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 6 replicates of 20 chicks each for a 2 × 2 design with CSH (0 or 200 mg/kg) and AFB₁ (0 or 40 μg/kg). The trial lasted for 42 d. Results showed that AFB₁ negatively affected (P < 0.05) growth performance, opportunistic bacteria and enterotoxic markers, intestinal lesions, glutathione turnover, and inflammatory factors. The CSH increased (P < 0.05) feed intake and body weight gain. The enterotoxic status was relieved in the CSH treatments by reducing (P < 0.05) the populations of gut Escherichia coli, Gram-negative bacteria, serum diamine oxidase, and intestinal lesions. The CSH also increased (P < 0.05) serum reduced glutathione, glutathione s-transferases, and glutathione reductase, and decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. Significant interactions (P < 0.05) were found on Gram-negative bacteria, diamine oxidase, and glutathione s-transferases. The results suggest that the CSH can improve glutathione turnover and reduce the risk of enterotoxic disease induced by AFB₁ in broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aaflatoxin B1 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3acysteamine 3adiamine oxidase 3adiet 3afeed intake 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3agrowth performance 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestines 3amessenger RNA 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3arisk reduction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aaflatoxin B1 0abroilers 0acysteamine hydrochloride 0aenterotoxicity 0aglutathione turnover1 aWang, J.Q.1 aLiu, Z.Y.1 aChen, Y.K.1 aWang, J.P.0 tPoultry science.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 97, no. 10 p.3594-3600dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey2063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245013200153300001500285520129500300592002801595650001601623650001101639650001701650650001401667650002401681650001401705650001101719650002001730700002201750700001901772773015201791856007001943856010002013852000902113655001202122IND60752883320221121052736.0211008e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075288332DNAL7 a10.3791/627452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHentig, James10aShuttle box assay as an associative learning tool for cognitive assessment in learning and memory studies using adult zebrafish  ap. e62745.  aCognitive deficits, including impaired learning and memory, are a primary symptom of various developmental and age-related neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Zebrafish are an important neuroscience model due to their transparency during development and robust regenerative capabilities following neurotrauma. While various cognitive tests exist in zebrafish, most of the cognitive assessments that are rapid examine non-associative learning. At the same time, associative-learning assays often require multiple days or weeks. Here, we describe a rapid associative-learning test that utilizes an adverse stimulus (electric shock) and requires minimal preparation time. The shuttle box assay, presented here, is simple, ideal for novice investigators, and requires minimal equipment. We demonstrate that, following TBI, this shuttle box test reproducibly assesses cognitive deficit and recovery from young to old zebrafish. Additionally, the assay is adaptable to examine either immediate or delayed memory. We demonstrate that both a single TBI and repeated TBI events negatively affect learning and immediate memory but not delayed memory. We, therefore, conclude that the shuttle box assay reproducibly tracks the progression and recovery of cognitive impairment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3abrain damage 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3aequipment 3amemory 3aneurophysiology1 aCloghessy, Kaylee1 aHyde, David R.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 July 12, , no. 173 p.e62745-e62745dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/627453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/62745/shuttle-box-assay-as-an-associative-learning-tool-for-cognitive  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017200170300001600342520190200358592002802260650001602288650001602304650001602320650001402336650001902350650002002369650002302389650001002412650001302422650001502435650002602450650000902476650002702485650002002512650002502532650001702557650002902574650002502603650001602628651001202644653001502656653000802671653000802679653000802687653000902695653002002704700005702724773011402781856008402895852000902979655001202988IND60602335520221118220829.0180711e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060233552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegueiro, Jorge10aDevelopment and validation of a stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of bisphenols in ready-made meals  ap. 110-121.  aDue to their growing consumption, ready-made meals are a major dietary component for many people in today's society, representing an important potential route of human exposure to several food contaminants. The recent restrictions in the use of bisphenol A have led the plastic industry to look for alternative chemicals, most of them belonging to the same family of p,p′-bisphenols.The aim of the current work was to develop and validate a method based on stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of bisphenol A and its main analogs – bisphenol S, 4,4′-sulfonylbis(2-methylphenol), bisphenol F, bisphenol E, bisphenol B, bisphenol Z, bisphenol AF, bisphenol AP, tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol P – in solid foodstuffs, and particularly in ready-made meals.Extraction was carried out by ultrasound-assisted extraction after sample disruption with sand. A selective solid-phase extraction procedure was then applied to reduce potential matrix interferences. Derivatization of bisphenols with pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride increased their ionization efficiency by electrospray ionization. Validation of the proposed method was performed in terms of selectivity, matrix effects, linearity, precision, measurement uncertainty, trueness and limits of detection. Satisfactory repeatability and intermediate precision were obtained; the related relative standard deviations were ≤7.8% and ≤10%, respectively. The relative expanded uncertainty (k=2) was below 17% for all bisphenol analogs and the trueness of the method was demonstrated by spike recovery experiments. Low limits of detection, in the range from 0.025μgkg⁻¹ to 0.140μgkg⁻¹, were obtained for all compounds. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, it was eventually applied to several ready-made meals purchased from different supermarkets in Belgium.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3abisphenol F 3abisphenol S 3achlorides 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3afood contamination 3afoods 3aindustry 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3asand 3asolid phase extraction 3astable isotopes 3astatistical analysis 3asupermarkets 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultrasonic treatment 3auncertainty 3aBelgium 0aBisphenols 0aBPA 0aBPF 0aBPS 0aFood 0aReady-made meal1 aWenzl, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2017-37880 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Oct. 02, v. 1414 p.110-121dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03775naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245015500180300001600335520184800351592002802199650003102227650001302258650002302271650002102294650001102315650002902326650002202355650001002377650001702387650000902404650000902413650001002422650001302432650003002445650001502475650001502490650000902505650001802514650004402532650001902576650001502595650002002610650001202630650002102642650001102663653003102674653000902705653000802714653002002722653001502742700002602757700002502783700002902808700003302837700003002870700002802900773010302928856008503031852000903116655001203125IND60633972220221118041334.0190321e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063397222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2017.11.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazquez-Mendoza, Paulina10aAntimicrobial and bactericidal impacts of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 on fecal shedding of pathogenic bacteria in dairy calves and adult dogs  ap. 458-463.  aTwo experiments were carried out to evaluate the bactericidal impacts of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 on the shedding of faecal pathogenic bacteria in dairy calves (Experiment 1) and in adults dogs (experiment 2). In the calves experiment, a completely randomized design was used to investigate the faecal bacteria profile of Holstein dairy calves fed with either pasteurized waste milk (PWM; n = 9) or a formulated non-medicated milk replacer (NMR; n = 9) for 60 d. The NMR containing sodium-butyrate and the active probiotic B. amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940. In the dogs experiment, addition of same probiotic (i.e., B. amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940) was carried out in two stages. The first stage started from day 7–37, and the second from day 44–71. The assessment of faecal score measured on day 22, 37, 42, 57, 71 and 77 to determine the texture of the stools. Calves received PWM consumed (P < 0.05) more starter feed between day 16 and day 45. The calves fed NMR had more moisture faeces and less cough reflux than the PWM-calves. Feeding NMR to calves increased faecal Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus vulgaris counts in comparison to PWM-calves. The administration of B. amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 to the dog diet has no significant effect on the hardness of the stool. Meanwhile, the bacillus count increases while the coliforms count decreases upon B. amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 administration. This reveals that B. amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 survived the gastrointestinal passage and rapidly colonized the dog intestine, which could positively affect the metabolism and composition of the intestinal microflora. These results show that B. amyloliquefaciens are a promising probiotic with an antimicrobial and bactericidal activities against the intestinal pathogenic bacteria for dairy calves and adult dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aHolstein 3aKlebsiella oxytoca 3aProteus vulgaris 3aadults 3aantibacterial properties 3acoliform bacteria 3acough 3adairy calves 3adiet 3adogs 3afeces 3ahardness 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3ametabolism 3amilk 3amilk replacer 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apasteurization 3aprobiotics 3asodium butyrate 3atexture 3avirulent strains 3awastes 0aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 0aCalf 0aDog 0aFaecal bacteria 0aWaste milk1 aElghandour, Mona M.M.1 aAlaba, Peter Adeniyi1 aSánchez-Aparicio, Pedro1 aAlonso-Fresán, María Uxúa1 aBarbabosa-Pliego, Alberto1 aSalem, Abdelfattah Z.M.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2018 Jan., v. 114 p.458-463dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.11.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245007400210506007600284520097000360536031001330592002801640596010601668506003701774650001601811650002701827650001401854650001701868650001101885650002301896650001101919650002601930650000901956650002001965650001001985650002901995650002602024650002102050653001002071653001002081653000802091653001002099700001802109773011902127856008502246852000902331655001202340IND60691040920221207142716.0200427e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069104092DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2018.15544672doi7 aPMC63510852pmcid7 a305378852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hong Gil10aInteraction of DGAT1 and PDAT1 to enhance TAG assembly in Arabidopsis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeeds contain a large quantity of oils, which are mainly constituted of triacylglycerol (TAG), a fundamental source of carbon and energy. TAG biosynthesis is catalyzed by a series of multiple enzymes. In particular, two key enzymes catalyzing the last acylation step for TAG production, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (PDAT1), are rate-limiting enzymes that determine TAG accumulation in Arabidopsis seeds. We recently showed that the two enzymes are transcriptionally coordinated by the R2R3-type MYB96 transcription factor to promote TAG assembly during seed maturation in Arabidopsis. Here, we further found that DGAT1 and PDAT1 physically associate, possibly to enhance the efficiency of TAG production. Overall, our findings suggest that TAG biosynthesis is intricately regulated at multiple levels, and these molecular strategies can potentially be used for metabolic engineering in plants.  aThis work was supported by the Basic Science Research [NRF-2016R1D1A1B03931139] and Basic Research Laboratory [NRF-2017R1A4A1015620] programs provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea and by the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program [PJ01319304] provided by the Rural Development Administration.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2016R1D1A1B03931139cNational Research Foundation of Koreadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000037250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aPDAT (acyltransferase) 3aacylation 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3ametabolic engineering 3aoils 3aseed maturation 3aseeds 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atriacylglycerols 0aDGAT1 0aPDAT1 0aTAG 0aMYB961 aSeo, Pil Joon0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 14, no. 1 p.1554467-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2018.15544673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003300112245011100145300001200256520193500268592002802203650002102231650002102252650001602273650001502289650001402304650001102318650001702329650001802346650002402364650001502388650001902403650002002422650001602442650002202458650001002480650001102490650002002501650001202521700001802533773015902551852000902710655001202719IND60721301320221121101058.0201224e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072130132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajibhai, Khorajiya Jaynudin10aPathology and Host-Pathogen In teraction in sheep Experimentally Infected with Bluetongue Virus Serotype-2  ap. 154.  aBluetongue is an infectious but non-contagious haemorrhagic disease of ruminants, caused by bluetongue virus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. Sheep is the most susceptible host while cattle, buffalo and goats serve as reservoir. The present study was executed to explore the sequential events in the clinico-pathological, virological, and immunological responses of Bluetongue virus 2 in sheep. Further, we also studied the host- virus interactions to quantify the global changes in the transcriptomic signature by RNA-sequencing in pre-scapular lymph node of infected animals. The BTV infected group comprised of 14 sheep inoculated with 6 ml of clarified virus containing 1x10⁶/ml TCID₅₀ of BTV-2 by intradermal route whereas the uninfected control group comprised of 6 animals inoculated with 6 ml of cell culture medium without virus by intradermal route. Blood and serum samples were collected at 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 14, 21, 45 days post-inoculation for haemato- biochemical and immune response study and two BTV infected animals each were scarified on 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 45 DPI and one each animal from control group were also sacrificed on 3, 7, 14 and 45 DPI to study the gross and histopathological lesions. The BTV-2 infected animals showed mild progression of disease on 3 DPI, moderate on 7 DPI then downward progression on 14 and 21 DPI and clinical signs varied between individual sheep in infected group. On gross examination, lungs were swollen with ecchymotic haemorrhages and emphysematous changes. Pre-scapular lymph node was swollen with focal haemorrhages. Spleen found swollen with round border. Histopathological examination revealed varying degree of interstitial proliferation and capillary congestion of the lungs was consistent in all the infected animals. Lymphoid depletion, focal hemorrhage along with necrotic changes were observed in the PSLN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBluetongue virus 3aanimal pathology 3ablood serum 3abluetongue 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3acell culture 3aculture media 3adouble-stranded RNA 3ahemorrhage 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3alymph nodes 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3aspleen 3atranscriptomics 3aviruses1 aSingh, K.

Iodine is very active and mobile in soil and may adversely affect human health due to bioaccumulation through the food chain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immobilization efficiency of biochar on the mobility of iodine (I⁻) and iodate (IO₃⁻) in soil near Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biochar was produced from a widely available agricultural waste (rice husk) at a pyrolysis temperature of 350 °C. Biochar was applied to the soil at five application rates (0, 0.33, 0.67, 1, and 1.33%). The affinities of I⁻ and IO₃⁻ with soil/biochar, the mobility of I⁻ and IO₃⁻ in biochar-amended soil, and effects of soil pH and ionic strength on immobilization of biochar were assessed by the standard batch sorption and desorption tests. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Rice husk-derived biochar exhibited strong affinities for I⁻ and IO₃⁻ as compared to that of soil, with immobilization ability (K bᵢₒcₕₐᵣ/K ₛₒᵢₗ) of 936.6 and 309.9, respectively. Results showed that addition of 1% biochar to soil could significantly reduce desorption of I⁻ and IO₃⁻ from soil. In addition, immobilization efficiency of biochar was not affected by soil physicochemical properties such as pH and ionic strength. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggested that the easily synthesized biochar could be a promising and environmentally friendly amendment for the efficient immobilization of soil I⁻ and IO₃⁻.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aagricultural wastes 3aapplication rate 3abioaccumulation 3abiochar 3adesorption 3afood chain 3ahuman health 3aiodates 3aiodides 3aiodine 3aionic strength 3anuclear fuels 3anuclear power 3apH 3apower plants 3apyrolysis 3arice 3arice hulls 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil physical properties 3atemperature1 aLu, Li1 aLu, Ting,1 aJin, Meiqing1 aLin, Jun1 aLiu, Xingyuan1 aZhao, Hongting1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4562-45760 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2018 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.1540-1547dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1864-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03935naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010000166300001100266520234100277592002802618596005902646596005902705650001602764650001302780650001402793650001102807650001702818650001802835650001802853650000902871650001202880650002102892650001302913650004902926650001402975650002002989650001903009700001803028700001803046700001803064700001303082700001103095700001703106700001303123700001403136700005503150773010803205856008303313852000903396655001203405IND60755485820221117223000.0220112e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075548582DNAL7 a10.1186/s12986-021-00623-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Changpeng12aL-carnitine ameliorates the muscle wasting of cancer cachexia through the AKT/FOXO3a/MaFbx axis  ap. 98.  aBACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest potential benefits of applying L-carnitine in the treatment of cancer cachexia, but the precise mechanisms underlying these benefits remain unknown. This study was conducted to determine the mechanism by which L-carnitine reduces cancer cachexia. METHODS: C2C12 cells were differentiated into myotubes by growing them in DMEM for 24 h (hrs) and then changing the media to DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum. Differentiated myotubes were treated for 2 h with TNF-α to establish a muscle atrophy cell model. After treated with L-carnitine, protein expression of MuRF1, MaFbx, FOXO3, p-FOXO3a, Akt, p-Akt, p70S6K and p-p70S6K was determined by Western blotting. Then siRNA-Akt was used to determine that L-carnitine ameliorated cancer cachexia via the Akt/FOXO3/MaFbx. In vivo, the cancer cachexia model was established by subcutaneously transplanting CT26 cells into the left flanks of the BALB/c nude mice. After treated with L-carnitine, serum levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and the skeletal muscle content of MuRF1, MaFbx, FOXO3, p-FOXO3a, Akt, p-Akt, p70S6K and p-p70S6K were measured. RESULTS: L-carnitine increased the gastrocnemius muscle (GM) weight in the CT26-bearing cachexia mouse model and the cross-sectional fiber area of the GM and myotube diameters of C2C12 cells treated with TNF-α. Additionally, L-carnitine reduced the protein expression of MuRF1, MaFbx and FOXO3a, and increased the p-FOXO3a level in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of Akt, upstream of FOXO3a, reversed the effects of L-carnitine on the FOXO3a/MaFbx pathway and myotube diameters, without affecting FOXO3a/MuRF-1. In addition to regulating the ubiquitination of muscle proteins, L-carnitine also increased the levels of p-p70S6K and p70S6K, which are involved in protein synthesis. Akt inhibition did not reverse the effects of L-carnitine on p70S6K and p-p70S6K. Hence, L-carnitine ameliorated cancer cachexia via the Akt/FOXO3/MaFbx and p70S6K pathways. Moreover, L-carnitine reduced the serum levels of IL-1 and IL-6, factors known to induce cancer cachexia. However, there were minimal effects on TNF-α, another inducer of cachexia, in the in vivo model. CONCLUSION: These results revealed a novel mechanism by which L-carnitine protects muscle cells and reduces inflammation related to cancer cachexia.  aPublisher supplied data  a81673167cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81603347cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3ablood serum 3acachexia 3acarnitine 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3amyotubes 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3anutrition 3askeletal muscle 3aubiquitination1 aZhu, Mingxing1 aLu, Zongliang1 aZhang, Yaowen1 aLi, Long1 aLi, Na1 aYin, Liangyu1 aWang, He1 aSong, Wei1 aXu, Hongxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5215-734X0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2021 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.98-98dBioMed CentralwJournal:2211x1743-70757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-021-00623-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245017500165300001800340520081800358592002801176650002101204650001801225650001101243650001101254650000801265700002001273773015301293856007701446852000901523655001201532IND60521513120221120075335.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052151312DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1977-10092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarwel, Siegfried10aHomogene Olefinmetathese mit Wolfram-Germanium- und Wolfram-Zinn-Komplexakatalysatoren/ Homogeneous Metathesis of Olefins by Tungsten-Germanium and Tungsten-Tin-Catalysts  ap. 1145-1148.  aBimetallic tungsten-germanium and tungsten-tin compounds (e.g. π-C₅H₅(CO)₃W-MR₃; M=Ge, Sn; R=CH₃, C₆H₅) upon activation with Cl₂Al-i-C₄H₉/O₂ (2:1) give highly active catalytic systems for the homogeneous metathesis of linear olefins with internal double bonds (2-hexene, 3-heptene, 4-octene). The activation procedure has a decisive influence on the reaction velocity and the distribution of products. Starting the reaction by addition of oxygen to the mixture of the other compounds, the metathesis leads selectively and slowly to the primary metathesis products. On the other hand the metathesis takes place rapidly if the olefin is added to the preformed catalytic system. In this case metathesis is accompanied by strong double bond isomerisation and yields broad range olefin mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3aisomerization 3aolefin 3aoxygen 3atin1 aLaarz, Wolfgang0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 32, no. 10 p.1145-1148dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1977-10093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009800159520138500257592002801642650002201670650000801692650001501700650001601715650002401731650002401755650002501779650002001804650001301824650001101837650000901848650001901857650001301876700001901889773012001908856007302028852000902101655001202110IND60742771420221122063549.0210624e20210521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074277142DNAL7 a10.3390/v130609512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVachon, Alicia 10aNovel Biomarkers of Hepatitis B Virus and Their Use in Chronic Hepatitis B Patient Management  aEven though an approved vaccine for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is available and widely used, over 257 million individuals worldwide are living with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who require monitoring of treatment response, viral activity, and disease progression to reduce their risk of HBV-related liver disease. There is currently a lack of predictive markers to guide clinical management and to allow treatment cessation with reduced risk of viral reactivation. Novel HBV biomarkers are in development in an effort to improve the management of people living with CHB, to predict disease outcomes of CHB, and further understand the natural history of HBV. This review focuses on novel HBV biomarkers and their use in the clinical setting, including the description of and methodology for quantification of serum HBV RNA, hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg), quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg), including ultrasensitive HBsAg detection, quantitative anti-hepatitis B core antigen (qAHBc), and detection of HBV nucleic acid-related antigen (HBV-NRAg). The utility of these biomarkers in treatment-naïve and treated CHB patients in several clinical situations is further discussed. Novel HBV biomarkers have been observed to provide critical clinical information and show promise for improving patient management and our understanding of the natural history of HBV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aRNA 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3achronic hepatitis B 3adisease progression 3ahepatitis B antigens 3anatural history 3apatients 3apeople 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3avaccines1 aOsiowy, Carla 0 tViruses.g2021 May 21, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130609513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015900172300001400331520178200345592002802127650002402155650002102179650002502200650001402225650001502239650001502254650001302269650001402282650001202296650001202308650002102320650002402341650001202365650002402377650001202401653001202413653002402425653002002449653001502469653002402484653002102508700001802529700002502547700001802572700002102590700002002611773011902631856008502750852000902835655001202844IND60540455420221120070155.0190318e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054045542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeffers, Laura A.10aPolymers for the stabilization and delivery of proteins topically and per os to the insect hemocoel through conjugation with aliphatic polyethylene glycol  ap. 58-66.  aCo-feeding of aliphatic polyethylene glycol (PEG), phospholipase A2, anionic and ionic detergents, and amphipathic glycoside with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein to fourth stadium tobacco budworms, Heliothis virescens, did not affect the levels of BSA in the hemolymph. Covalent conjugation of small proteins like the decapeptide trypsin modulating oostatic factor (TMOF) to polyethylene glycol was previously shown to protect the peptide from protease attack and enhance its accumulation in the insect hemocoel. Whether this polymer chemistry could do the same for larger proteins was examined. The chemistry for the synthesis of polydispersed aliphatic PEG350-insulin and monodispersed aliphatic PEG333-insulin are described herein. Insulin was used for this synthesis and not BSA to better control conjugation among the available free amine groups. When PEGylated insulin or free insulin were fed in artificial diet to fifth stadium budworms, greater concentrations of insulin using the PEGylated variants were found in the hemolymph than when free insulin was used (a 6.7 and 7.3-fold increase for the PEG350 and PEG333 conjugates, respectively). When insulin is topically applied to the dorsum of H. virescens, no insulin is found in the hemolymph. However, after topical application of the PEGylated insulins, PEG350-insulin and PEG333-insulin were detected in the hemolymph. After injections of insulin into the hemocoel of fourth stadium H. virescens, insulin is completely cleared from the hemolymph in 120min. In comparison, PEG350-insulin and PEG333-insulin were present in the hemolymph for 300 and 240min after injection, respectively, translating to a 3.3 and 2.7-fold increase in the length of time insulin remains in the hemolymph after injection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeliothis virescens 3aartificial diets 3abovine serum albumin 3achemistry 3adetergents 3aglycosides 3ahemocoel 3ahemolymph 3ainsects 3ainsulin 3aphospholipase A2 3apolyethylene glycol 3atobacco 3atopical application 3atrypsin 0aInsulin 0aHeliothis virescens 0aTobacco budworm 0aPEGylation 0aPolyethylene glycol 0aProtein delivery1 aShen, Hongyan1 aBissinger, Brooke W.1 aKhalil, Sayed1 aBrent Gunnoe, T.1 aMichael Roe, R.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2014 Oct., v. 115 p.58-66dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245015200179300001800331500001400349520100800363536014801371592002801519596009701547650002101644650002501665650002401690650002501714650002501739650001601764650001401780650001801794650001501812650001001827650001001837650001201847650001301859650001201872650001101884653002701895653002401922700002101946700002201967700002001989773013802009856008602147852000902233655001202242IND60692803520221120122529.0210202e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069280352DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2017.13205182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamasaki-Yashiki, Shino10aCharacterization and gene cloning of l-xylulose reductase involved in l-arabinose catabolism from the pentose-fermenting fungus Rhizomucor pusillus  ap. 1612-1618.  aNAL-light  al-Xylulose reductase (LXR) catalyzes the reduction of l-xylulose to xylitol in the fungal l-arabinose catabolic pathway. LXR (RpLXR) was purified from the pentose-fermenting zygomycetous fungus Rhizomucor pusillus NBRC 4578. The native RpLXR is a homotetramer composed of 29 kDa subunits and preferred NADPH as a coenzyme. The Kₘ values were 8.71 mM for l-xylulose and 3.89 mM for dihydroxyacetone. The lxr3 (Rplxr3) gene encoding RpLXR consists of 792 bp and encodes a putative 263 amino acid protein (Mᵣ = 28,341). The amino acid sequence of RpLXR showed high similarity to 3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase. The Rplxr3 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant RpLXR exhibited properties similar to those of native RpLXR. Transcription of the Rplxr3 gene in R. pusillus NBRC 4578 was induced in the presence of l-arabinose and inhibited in the presence of d-glucose, d-xylose, and d-mannitol, indicating that RpLXR is involved in the l-arabinose catabolic pathway.  aWe gratefully acknowledge support for this study by a grant from NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization of Japan).  aPublisher supplied data  aJPMJER1102cJapanScience and Technology Agency, ERATOdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002241 3aEscherichia coli 3aL-xylulose reductase 3aRhizomucor pusillus 3aacyl carrier protein 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aarabinose 3abiotechnology 3acatabolism 3afungi 3agenes 3aglucose 3amannitol 3axylitol 3axylose 0al-Arabinose catabolism 0azygomycetous fungus1 aKomeda, Hidenobu1 aHoshino, Kazuhiro1 aAsano, Yasuhisa0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 81, no. 8 p.1612-1618dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.13205183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245008100205520175200286592002802038650001302066650002502079650001102104650001102115650001202126650001802138650001102156650001302167650002302180651001102203651001802214653002902232653003002261653001802291653002002309700001702329773009502346856008402441852000902525655001202534IND60732800120221118030315.0210708e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073280012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1052392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shanshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3816-045110aMeta-analysis of consumers' willingness to pay for sustainable food products  aThere is a continuous increase in the number of studies dealing with consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) price premiums for sustainable food products. This research focused on a broad area of sustainable food products, including different sustainable attributes using a meta-analysis of 80 worldwide studies. The publication bias was verified using the funnel plot and Egger's test. In addition, the subgroup analysis and meta-regression were applied to classify the source of heterogeneity. The results suggest that the overall WTP premium for sustainability (in percentage terms) is 29.5% on average. Furthermore, gender, region, sustainable attributes and food categories influence the average WTP estimates and their heterogeneity. Results also indicate that the WTP estimate conducted by hypothetical approach (choice experiment and contingent valuation method) is higher than non-hypothetical one due to hypothetical bias. In addition, the WTP estimate from the CVM is higher than that from the CE. Additionally, the WTP value of organic attribute is higher than the other sustainable attributes. The subgroup analysis indicates that the fruit &vegetable category has the highest WTP estimate while the seafood receives the lowest one. Results also highlight that Asian WTP estimates, in percentage terms, are higher than those obtained in North America and similar to those from Europe. In addition, positive WTP estimates are shown independent of the food categories, region or methods, denoting the presence of great market potential for sustainable products worldwide. The findings of this research can be used as a guide by food producers, marketers and policymakers when making decisions related to the sustainability of food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3acontingent valuation 3afruits 3agender 3amarkets 3ameta-analysis 3aprices 3aseafoods 3awillingness to pay 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aWillingness to pay (WTP) 0aSustainable food products 0aMeta-analysis 0aMeta-regression1 aKallas, Zein0 tAppetite.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 163 p.105239-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1052393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03857naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008700166506011700253506007600370520177700446592002802223506003702251650001302288650002102301650002402322650001602346650001702362650001702379650001102396650001402407650002602421650001702447650001402464650001702478653001002495653002302505653002702528653001402555653001202569653000802581653001202589653001102601653000702612653001102619653000802630653000802638653000802646653000802654653000702662653000802669653000802677653000702685653000702692653001002699653000702709700001402716700001502730700001702745700002002762700001602782700001502798700001802813700001302831700001402844700001702858700001302875773010502888856008502993852000903078655001203087IND60778014920221207133535.0220802e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077801492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2022.1072802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shudan10aLong-term exposure to ozone and cardiovascular mortality in a large Chinese cohort  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEvidence for the association between long-term exposure to ozone (O₃) and cause-specific cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is inconclusive, and this association has rarely been evaluated at high O₃ concentrations. We aim to evaluate the associations between long-term O₃ exposure and cause-specific CVD mortality in a Chinese population. From 2009 to 2018, 744,882 subjects (median follow-up of 7.72 years) were included in the CHinese Electronic health Records Research in Yinzhou (CHERRY) study. The annual average concentrations of O₃ and fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅), which were estimated using grids with a resolution up to 1 × 1 km, were assigned to the community address for each subject. The outcomes were deaths from CVD, ischemic heart disease (IHD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke. Time-varying Cox model adjusted for PM₂.₅ and individual-level covariates was used. The mean of annual average O₃ concentrations was 68.05 μg/m³. The adjusted hazard ratio per 10 μg/m³ O₃ increase was 1.22 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13–1.33) for overall CVD mortality, 1.08 (0.91–1.29) for IHD, 1.21 (0.90–1.63) for MI, 1.28 (1.15–1.43) for overall stroke, 1.39 (1.16–1.67) for hemorrhagic stroke and 1.22 (1.00–1.49) for ischemic stroke, respectively. The study showed that subjects without hypertension had a higher risk for CVD mortality associated with long-term O₃ exposure (1.66 vs. 1.15, p = 0.01). We observed the association between long-term exposure to high O₃ concentrations and cause-specific CVD mortality in China, independent of PM₂.₅ and other CVD risk factors. This suggested an urgent need to control O₃ pollution, especially in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acherries 3achronic exposure 3aconfidence interval 3aenvironment 3ahazard ratio 3ahypertension 3amodels 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3aparticulates 3apollution 3atelemedicine 0aOzone 0aLong-term exposure 0aCardiovascular disease 0aMortality 0aChinese 0aBMI 0aCanCHEC 0aCHERRY 0aCI 0aCPS-II 0aCVD 0aEPA 0aGBD 0aGDP 0aHR 0aIHD 0aIQR 0aMI 0aO3 0aPM2.5 0aSD1 aZhang, Yi1 aMa, Runmei1 aLiu, Xiaofei1 aLiang, Jingyuan1 aLin, Hongbo1 aShen, Peng1 aZhang, Jingyi1 aLu, Ping1 aTang, Xun1 aLi, Tiantian1 aGao, Pei0 tEnvironment international.g2022 July, v. 165 p.107280-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.1072803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014700167500001400314520186400328592002802192650001402220650002302234650002202257650001402279650001202293650001802305650001302323650002202336650000902358650001302367650001902380650001402399650001502413650001402428650002502442653002402467653002802491653002602519653002502545700001502570700001702585700005402602700002002656773011302676856008602789852000902875655001202884IND60722166720221118233831.0210212e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072216672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1256532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiaozi10aIn-situ growing protective Cr-substituted goethite film on iron shavings (Fe0) as efficient catalytic ozonation catalysts: A comparative study  aNAL-light  aH₂O₂-modified iron shavings (HMI) with surface γ-FeOOH film were effective as a catalyst in catalytic ozonation, but the iron leaching and loss of surface component limited its application. In this study, Cr-modified iron shavings (CrMI) was developed by introducing Cr³⁺ to promote Cr-substituted goethite (α-Fe(Cr³⁺)OOH) film formation on iron shavings. The variety in stability and catalytic performance between CrMI and HMI were compared. The α-Fe(Cr³⁺)OOH film was compact while the γ-FeOOH film contained abundant voids and microcracks as observed from SEM. After long-time ozonation, α-Fe(Cr³⁺)OOH film was thin and homogeneous whereas γ-FeOOH film grew thicker through inner iron layer corrosion as indicated by XPS etching. The α-Fe(Cr³⁺)OOH film has 63% reduction in corrosion current densities (22.95 μA) and 96% reduction of donor densities (3.40 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³) as well as 9 times increase in polarization resistance (4399.0 Ω cm²), which verified that it was more stable and less defective. Owing to the protective properties of α-Fe(Cr³⁺)OOH film, iron leaching of CrMI were reduced for 85% with only 4.1 mg L⁻¹ of total iron concentration detected in solution, and surface loss of CrMI were reduced for 91% with only 5.8 NTU of turbidity left in the solution after catalytic ozonation. Moreover, the addition of CrMI as catalyst in ozonation led to slightly higher mineralization rate of 79% for organic pollutants as the results of higher surface acid sites density and more hydroxyl radicals generation. It also presented excellent reusability based on 20 h successive run with unnoticeable performance decay and metal release. These results revealed that, with excellent stability and high catalytic performance, CrMI was highly competitive for long-term application in wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acomparative study 3acorrosion 3adensity 3adeterioration 3agoethite 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3aleaching 3amineralization 3aozonation 3apollutants 3aturbidity 3awastewater treatment 0aCatalytic ozonation 0aCr-substituted goethite 0aProtective properties 0aSurface modification1 aLi, Xufang1 aFei, Jiaoran1 aMa, Luming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4410-558X1 aHuang, Yuanxing0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 288 p.125653-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1256533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010300173300001800276500001900294520099000313592002801303596003701331650002101368650003001389650001801419650001201437650001301449650002601462653004601488653002801534653003401562700002201596700001901618700001901637700001801656700002101674700001201695700002301707700001801730700002201748700001801770773013801788856008601926852000902012655001202021IND60692803720221120132605.0210202e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069280372DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2017.13205202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuyama, Masayuki10aSubstrate recognition of the catalytic α-subunit of glucosidase II from Schizosaccharomyces pombe  ap. 1503-1511.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe recombinant catalytic α-subunit of N-glycan processing glucosidase II from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpGIIα) was produced in Escherichia coli. The recombinant SpGIIα exhibited quite low stability, with a reduction in activity to <40% after 2-days preservation at 4 °C, but the presence of 10% (v/v) glycerol prevented this loss of activity. SpGIIα, a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 31 (GH31), displayed the typical substrate specificity of GH31 α-glucosidases. The enzyme hydrolyzed not only α-(1→3)- but also α-(1→2)-, α-(1→4)-, and α-(1→6)-glucosidic linkages, and p-nitrophenyl α-glucoside. SpGIIα displayed most catalytic properties of glucosidase II. Hydrolytic activity of the terminal α-glucosidic residue of Glc₂Man₃-Dansyl was faster than that of Glc₁Man₃-Dansyl. This catalytic α-subunit also removed terminal glucose residues from native N-glycans (Glc₂Man₉GlcNAc₂ and Glc₁Man₉GlcNAc₂) although the activity was low.  aPublisher supplied data  a22780082a26450114cJSPS KAKENHI 3aEscherichia coli 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3abiotechnology 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3asubstrate specificity 0acatalytic α-subunit of ER glucosidase II 0aheterologous expression 0aglycoside hydrolase family 311 aMiyamoto, Masashi1 aMatsuo, Ichiro1 aIwamoto, Shogo1 aSerizawa, Ryo1 aTanuma, Masanari1 aMa, Min1 aKlahan, Patcharapa1 aKumagai, Yuya1 aTagami, Takayoshi1 aKimura, Atsuo0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 81, no. 8 p.1503-1511dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.13205203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245010600213520142900319592002801748650001601776650001301792650001101805650001101816650001501827650001501842650001401857650001101871650002301882653002301905653001501928653002401943653004401967653001902011653001502030700006502045773011302110856008602223852000902309655001202318IND60722166820221118233831.0220426e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072216682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1256542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrand, Benedikt M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4250-470410aExamining sustainability surcharges for outdoor apparel using Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint analysis  aIn order to explore the compensatory effects between sustainability aspects and willingness to pay (WTP), the vast majority of studies applies Choice-Based Conjoint analysis (CBC). However, this method suffers from multiple restrictions (e.g., limited number of factors includable) resulting in biased WTP estimations. In contrast, the advanced and more realistic Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint analysis (ACBC) allows – inter alia – incorporating all facets of sustainability and capturing the nowadays increasingly complex purchase decision process holistically. No other study has measured WTP with ACBC in the context of sustainable clothing yet. Based on expert interviews, we conduct an ACBC utilizing the ‘summed price’ approach and incorporating the insights gained from the Calibration section. While the latter one allows to refine the purchase likelihood and thus, enables more accurate WTP estimations, it has yet been largely neglected by previous sustainability literature. Our findings indicate significant differences in WTP and surcharges for each feature contingent on gender and the ecological orientation of consumers. While very green consumers rather emphasize the impact of sustainability-related features (e.g., materials (18.43%), labels (12.90%), country-of-origin (13.14%)), price represents by far the most influential driver for less green consumers (42.37%), followed by design (12.54%).  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3aclothing 3adesign 3agender 3ainterviews 3aliterature 3amaterials 3aprices 3awillingness to pay 0aWillingness to pay 0aSurcharges 0aSustainable apparel 0aAdaptive Choice-Based Conjoint analysis 0aSustainability 0ae-commerce1 aRausch, Theresa Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5476-48100 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 289 p.125654-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1256543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013800175300001800313500001900331520105500350592002801405596010601433650002601539650001201565650001801577650000901595650002801604650001401632650001201646650001501658650001101673650001201684650001501696653002301711653001401734653001901748653001401767700003301781700002301814700002401837700002901861700002401890700001901914700002001933773013801953856008502091852000902176655001202185IND60692803820221120112015.0200503e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069280382DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2017.13209372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSornlake, Warasirin10aCharacterization of cellulolytic enzyme system of Schizophyllum commune mutant and evaluation of its efficiency on biomass hydrolysis  ap. 1289-1299.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSchizophyllum commune is a basidiomycete equipped with an efficient cellulolytic enzyme system capable of growth on decaying woods. In this study, production of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes from S. commune mutant G-135 (SC-Cel) on various cellulosic substrates was examined. The highest cellulase activities including CMCase, FPase, and β-glucosidase were obtained on Avicel-PH101 while a wider range of enzymes attacking non-cellulosic polysaccharides and lignin were found when grown on alkaline-pretreated biomass. Proteomic analysis of SC-Cel also revealed a complex enzyme system comprising seven glycosyl hydrolase families with an accessory carbohydrate esterase, polysaccharide lyase, and auxiliary redox enzymes. SC-Cel obtained on Avicel-PH101 effectively hydrolyzed all agricultural residues with the maximum glucan conversion of 98.0% using corn cobs with an enzyme dosage of 5 FPU/g-biomass. The work showed potential of SC-Cel on hydrolysis of various herbaceous biomass with enhanced efficiency by addition external β-xylosidase.  aPublisher supplied data  aP-15-50202cNational Science and Technology Development Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004192 3aSchizophyllum commune 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3acorn 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aesterases 3aglucans 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3amutants 3aproteomics 0abiomass hydrolysis 0acellulase 0alignocellulose 0aSecretome1 aRattanaphanjak, Phatcharamon1 aChampreda, Verawat1 aEurwilaichitr, Lily1 aKittisenachai, Suthathip1 aRoytrakul, Sittiruk1 aFujii, Tatsuya1 aInoue, Hiroyuki0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 July 3, v. 81, no. 7 p.1289-1299dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.13209373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245017400161300001700335500001400352520042300366592002800789650001700817650000900834650001800843650001900861650002100880650001500901650001000916650001500926650001600941650001300957653003100970653001401001653003001015653002401045653002401069700001901093700002301112700001701135700002601152700002001178773018301198856007401381852000901455655001201464IND60691931120221120055629.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069193112DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.9992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKANAMOTO, Ryuhei10aSoybean Resistant Proteins Interrupt an Enterohepatic Circulation of Bile Acids and Suppress Liver Tumorigenesis Induced by Azoxymethane and Dietary Deoxycholate in Rats  ap. 999-1002.  aNAL-light  aWe found that azoxymethane and dietary deoxycholate induced liver tumors in rats.

Microbiome diversity of ticks is influenced by several factors. In this study, we investigated microbiome diversity in field‐collected female and male H. longicornis ticks and compared the microbial composition of fed and unfed ticks and of those feeding on different hosts using barcode sequencing of V3–V4 region of 16S RNA gene. Regardless of sex, host, and feeding status; the highest abundance among all samples was found for the genus Coxiella. The relative numbers of Coxiella sequences decreased with the length of the blood feeding, whereas the numbers of Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium increased gradually. The dominance of Coxiella across all samples indicates that it is an obligate symbiont of H. longicornis. Overall, higher microbiome richness was detected in male ticks than in female ticks. Fed ticks showed a more diverse microbe composition than unfed ticks, and ticks fed on goats exhibited the highest diversity. These findings of this study can serve as a basis for future studies of microbiota biology and interactions between the microbes and pathogens of H. longicornis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017GSF221017cKey Research and Development project of Shandong Province 3aCorynebacterium 3aCoxiella 3aHaemaphysalis longicornis 3aStaphylococcus 3ablood meal 3afemales 3afever 3agenes 3agoats 3ahematophagy 3ahosts 3amales 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asymbionts 3athrombocytopenia 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aChina1 aHuang, Zhendong1 aYu, Guangfu1 aZhang, Zhong0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2019 Feb., v. 59, no. 2 p.215-223dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2018003723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245007600166520171000242592002801952650002001980650003002000650002002030650002202050650001102072650001502083650001502098653002802113653004702141653004002188653003802228653002502266700001402291700001602305700001802321773011502339856008702454852000902541655001202550IND60732800420221118030250.0211213e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073280042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1139462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yun10aBayesian infinite mixture models for wind speed distribution estimation  aWind energy, as a clean, environment-friendly, and inexhaustible renewable energy, has attracted significant attention, and wind speed distribution plays an important role in its development. Currently, various finite mixture distributions have been proposed to fit the empirical wind speed distribution. However, they have two disadvantages. First, different distribution components result in different fitting performances, and it is difficult to determine the optimal type of single distributions to construct a mixture model. Second, the number of distribution components has a significant effect on the final performance of the mixture model. It is well known that a mixture of Gaussian distributions (MoG) can fit any complex continuous distribution. To overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages, based on stick-breaking construction, this study extends the original MoG to two different types of infinite mixtures of Gaussian distributions (IMoG) with different prior parameter distributions. These distributions are called IMoG-I and IMoG-II. The proposed models not only have superior fitting performance but also determine the optimal number of Gaussian components automatically. The results show that both IMoG-I and IMoG-II perform better than single, heterogeneous, and homogeneous mixture distributions. In most cases, the coefficient of determination-based criterion can reach its maximum of 1. In addition, the optimal number of Gaussian components varies with different datasets. When modeling different wind speed distributions in this study, they are all less than 10.

Western Australian Collie sub-bituminous coal, Victorian Loy Yang brown coal and Australian mallee wood were pyrolysed in a wire-mesh reactor at a heating rate of 1000Ks−1 with holding time ranging from 0s to 50s. FT-Raman/IR spectroscopy was used to characterise the structural features of the chars obtained at different temperatures. The combined use of a wire-mesh reactor and an FT-Raman/IR spectrometer has provided significant insights into the rapid changes in the chemical structure of nascent char during fast pyrolysis. Our results indicate that the three fuels began significant ring condensation at different temperatures. Mallee wood showed significant growth of large rings within 1s holding at 600°C; however Loy Yang and Collie coals showed significant ring condensation at 800°C and 900°C respectively. With increase in temperature to 1000°C and higher, most ring condensation occurred at <1s holding time. The decrease in the intensity of FT-IR spectrum at ~1600cm−1 confirmed the rapid growth in ring systems at relatively high temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollie 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical structure 3acoal 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3apyrolysis 3aspectrometers 3atemperature 3awood 0aFast pyrolysis 0aChar structure 0aCollie coal 0aLoy Yang coal 0aMallee wood1 aLi, Tingting1 aQuyn, Dimple1 aDong, Li1 aQiu, Penghua1 aLi, Chun-Zhu0 tFuel Processing Technology.g2015 Oct., v. 138 p.390-396dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245015800164300001800322520125800340592002801598650001501626650001901641650001301660650001901673650002001692650001101712650003101723650001501754650001301769650005001782650000901832700002201841773010601863856008401969852000902053655001202062IND60112893620221120072353.0141111e20111028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011289362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Ying10aEvaluation of selectivity in multimodal anion exchange systems: A priori prediction of protein retention and examination of mobile phase modifier effects  ap. 7813-7820.  aAlthough recent advances in multimodal chromatography have shown significant potential for selective protein purification, there is a need to establish a deeper understanding of the nature of selectivity in these systems. In this work, the adsorption behavior of a library of commercially available proteins with varying physicochemical properties was investigated. Linear gradient experiments were carried out with the multimodal anion exchanger and the results were compared to those obtained with a traditional anion exchange material. Proteins were more strongly retained on the multimodal resin and a different elution pattern was obtained as compared to anion exchange. Quantitative structure–property relationship models using a support vector regression technique were developed and the resulting models were shown to have good predictive abilities in both systems. Molecular descriptors selected during the generation of these models suggested that multiple interaction modes contributed to the stronger retention and different elution patterns observed in the multimodal system. Finally, mobile phase modifiers such as ethylene glycol, urea and arginine were shown to be able to impart unique selectivity trends in multimodal chromatography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange 3aarginine 3achromatography 3aethylene glycol 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aurea1 aCramer, Steven M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Oct. 28, v. 1218, no. 43 p.7813-7820dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05166naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001600188245014600204300001200350506007600362520294000438592002803378596006103406506003703467650001703504650000803521650002303529650002503552650002503577650001603602650001703618650001603635650001303651650002303664650001303687650002203700650002003722650002103742650001003763650001703773650001103790650002003801650003103821650001403852650001203866650001503878650001203893650004303905650005203948650002204000650002004022650001304042700002404055700001704079700002404096700002404120700001804144700002104162700006404183773010504247856008204352961001304434852000904447655001204456IND60675962820221207073032.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067596282DNAL7 a317114162pmid7 aPMC68440652pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-2073-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Xinpeng10aTranscriptome analysis identifies genes related to the waxy coating on blueberry fruit in two northern-adapted rabbiteye breeding populations  ap. 460.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Blueberry is of high economic value. Most blueberry varieties selected for the fresh market have an appealing light blue coating or “bloom” on the fruit due to the presence of a visible heavy epicuticular wax layer. This waxy layer also serves as natural defense against fruit desiccation and deterioration. RESULTS: In this study, we attempted to identify gene(s) whose expression is related to the protective waxy coating on blueberry fruit utilizing two unique germplasm populations that segregate for the waxy layer. We bulked RNA from waxy and non-waxy blueberry progenies from the two northern-adapted rabbiteye hybrid breeding populations (‘Nocturne’ x T 300 and ‘Nocturne’ x US 1212), and generated 316.85 million RNA-seq reads. We de novo assembled this data set integrated with other publicly available RNA-seq data and trimmed the assembly into a 91,861 blueberry unigene collection. All unigenes were functionally annotated, resulting in 79 genes potentially related to wax accumulation. We compared the expression pattern of waxy and non-waxy progenies using edgeR and identified overall 1125 genes in the T 300 population and 2864 genes in the US 1212 population with at least a two-fold expression difference. After validating differential expression of several genes by RT-qPCR experiments, a candidate gene, FatB, which encodes acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase, emerged whose expression was closely linked to the segregation of the waxy coating in our populations. This gene was expressed at more than a five-fold higher level in waxy than non-waxy plants of both populations. We amplified and sequenced the cDNA for this gene from three waxy plants of each population, but were unable to amplify the cDNA from three non-waxy plants that were tested from each population. We aligned the Vaccinium deduced FATB protein sequence to FATB protein sequences from other plant species. Within the PF01643 domain, which gives FATB its catalytic function, 80.08% of the amino acids were identical or had conservative replacements between the blueberry and the Cucumis melo sequence (XP_008467164). We then amplified and sequenced a large portion of the FatB gene itself from waxy and non-waxy individuals of both populations. Alignment of the cDNA and gDNA sequences revealed that the blueberry FatB gene consists of six exons and five introns. Although we did not sequence through two very large introns, a comparison of the exon sequences found no significant sequence differences between the waxy and non-waxy plants. This suggests that another gene, which regulates or somehow affects FatB expression, must be segregating in the populations. CONCLUSIONS: This study is helping to achieve a greater understanding of epicuticular wax biosynthesis in blueberry. In addition, the blueberry unigene collection should facilitate functional annotation of the coming chromosomal level blueberry genome.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject 8042-21000-279-00cAgricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucumis melo 3aRNA 3aVaccinium virgatum 3aacyl carrier protein 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3ablueberries 3abreeding 3acatalytic activity 3acoatings 3acomplementary DNA 3adata collection 3aepicuticular wax 3aexons 3afresh market 3afruits 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3ahydrolases 3aintrons 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes1 aOgden, Elizabeth L.1 aDie, Jose V.1 aEhlenfeldt, Mark K.1 aPolashock, James J.1 aDarwish, Omar1 aAlkharouf, Nadim1 aRowland, L.

Gene constructs of the intergenic region together with its adjoining gene acmA or acmB from the actinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chrysomallus were transferred into Streptomyces lividans TK64. Each construct expressed the respective synthetase indicating divergent promoters. Primer extension revealed for both directions −10 and −35 boxes similar to σ⁷⁰‐dependent promoters from Streptomyces and E. coli. No conspicuous regulatory sequences were detected. Accordingly, S. chrysomallus—grown in glucose‐containing medium—produced the peptide synthetases AcmA and AcmB/C as well as actinomycin during logarithmic growth phase. Alignments with the corresponding intergenic region of the actinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces antibioticus identified analogous −10 and −35 boxes of σ⁷⁰ consensus sequence. However, in S. antibioticus—cultivated in the same conditions—AcmA and AcmB/C were at maximum activity in late log phase and actinomycin formation peaked in stationary phase. The different patterns of formation of actinomycin and its peptide synthetases encoded by the highly homologous actinomycin biosynthetic gene clusters in S. chrysomallus and S. antibioticus suggest strain‐specific control of biosynthesis in agreement with absence of pathway‐specific regulatory genes.  aPublisher supplied data  aKe 452/8‐4cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  cCluster of Excellence “Unifying Concepts in Catalysis” at the Technische Universität Berlin  cGerman Research Foundation (DFG Rückkehrstipendium) 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces antibioticus 3aStreptomyces chrysomallus 3aStreptomyces lividans 3abiosynthesis 3aconsensus sequence 3adevelopmental stages 3aintergenic DNA 3aligases 3amultigene family 3aregulator genes 3aregulatory sequences 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLang, Manuel1 aOrtel, Ingo1 aSüssmuth, Roderich D.1 aKeller, Ullrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7709-82350 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2019 Feb., v. 59, no. 2 p.148-157dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2018002443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010800172520116000280592002801440650002601468650002501494650002101519650002701540650002301567650002601590650002701616650003101643650002601674650002601700650002401726650001801750650002801768650001601796650000901812650001101821650001201832650001501844653000801859653000801867653000801875653000801883653000801891653000801899653000701907653000801914653000901922653001301931653003001944653001201974653001001986653001101996653001302007700002502020700002102045700003802066700002202104773011002126856008402236852000902320655001202329IND60770924920221119194503.0220621e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077092492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2022.1010242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGheibipour, Maryam14aThe potential of tannin degrading bacteria isolated from rumen of Iranian Urial ram as silage additives  aHigh-tannin forages and agricultural waste reduce feed digestibility while some rumen bacteria can degrade tannin easily.

The two main classes of phages are lytic or virulent and lysogenic or temperate. In comparison with antibiotics, to deal with bacterial infections, phage therapy is thought to be more effective. In 1921, the use of phages against bacterial infections was first demonstrated. Later on, in humans, phage therapy was used to treat skin infections caused by Pseudomonas species. Furthermore, phages were successfully employed against infections in animals – calves, lambs, and pigs infected with Escherichia coli. In agriculture, for instance, phages have successfully been used e.g., Apple blossom infection, caused by Erwinia amylovora, was effectively catered with the use of bacteriophages. Bacteriophages were also used to control E. coli, Salmonella, Listeria, and Campylobacter contamination in food. Comparatively, phage display is a recently discovered technology, whereby, bacteriophages play a significant role. This review is an effort to collect almost recent and relevant information regarding applications and complications associated with the use of bacteriophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aErwinia amylovora 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria 3aPseudomonas 3aSalmonella 3aanimal diseases 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3abacteriophages 3acalves 3acapsid 3acell walls 3aendolysin 3ahumans 3alambs 3aphage therapy 3askin diseases 3aswine 3avirulence1 aBukhari, Sayed M.

Healthy adult humans (n = 160) were randomized to receive 6 g of fish oil, 6 g of fish oil plus a multivitamin, 3 g of fish oil plus a multivitamin or a placebo daily for 16 weeks. Treatment with 6 g of fish oil, with or without a daily multivitamin, led to higher eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) composition at endpoint. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) composition was unchanged following treatment. The long chain LC n-3 PUFA index was only higher, compared to placebo, in the group receiving the combination of 6 g of fish oil and the multivitamin. Analysis by gender revealed that all treatments increased EPA incorporation in females while, in males, EPA was only significantly increased by the 6 g fish oil multivitamin combination. There was considerable individual variability in the red blood cell incorporation of EPA and DHA at endpoint. Gender contributed to a large proportion of this variability with females generally showing higher LC n-3 PUFA composition at endpoint. In conclusion, the incorporation of LC n-3 PUFA into red blood cells was influenced by dosage, the concurrent intake of vitamin/minerals and gender.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aerythrocytes 3afemales 3afish oils 3ahumans 3amales 3aminerals 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials1 aCockerell, Robyn1 aGrima, Natalie1 aSinclair, Andrew1 aStough, Con1 aScholey, Andrew1 aMyers, Stephen1 aCroft, Kevin1 aSali, Avni1 aPase, Matthew P.0 tNutrients.g2014 May 14, v. 6, no. 5 p.1956-1970dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60519563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245014000202520206300342592002802405650001402433650001202447650002202459650001102481650001102492650000702503650002202510650001802532700005602550700006202606700005602668700005802724700006402782773009702846856007702943852000903020655001203029IND60780437820221120203051.0220620e20220609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078043782DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/37563842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDedhia, Priyanka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9280-572710aAnalysis of Erosive Nature of Fruit Beverages Fortified with Calcium Ions: An In Vitro Study Evaluating Dental Erosion in Primary Teeth  aBackground. Since children frequently consume acidic fruit beverages, dental erosion is common in children. The erosive effects on primary teeth are more profound due to the lesser thickness of enamel and dentin. This study evaluated if calcium fortification of fruit beverages could reduce their erosive potential. Methodology. Tropicana Orange Delight was the fruit beverage chosen and fortified with calcium carbonate. Forty noncarious extracted primary teeth were equally distributed into four groups. Samples in group A were exposed to calcium-fortified fruit beverages and group B to nonfortified fruit beverages for 1, 2, and 3 min. The pH and calcium ion concentration of both the fruit beverages were evaluated from baseline through the test period. Samples in groups C and D were then exposed to fortified and nonfortified fruit beverages for 10, 20, and 30 min. The surface roughness and microhardness of these samples were analysed. Results. Due to fortification, the pH and calcium ion concentration of fortified beverages was higher compared to nonfortified beverages at baseline. The calcium ion concentration of fortified beverages decreased from baseline in contrast to an increase in the nonfortified beverage group. This indicates that fortified beverage is less erosive in nature. The surface roughness of samples in the fortified beverage group did not decrease significantly from baseline. In the nonfortified beverage group, surface roughness values at 20 and 30 min of exposure were higher than baseline, suggesting that significant erosive changes occur at the prolonged duration of exposure. The microhardness values of samples in the fortified beverage group increased from baseline through the test period, suggestive of resistance to erosion offered by calcium fortification. The microhardness values of samples in the nonfortified beverage group decreased through the test period, suggestive of erosion. Conclusion. Calcium fortification of this fruit beverage significantly reduces its erosive potential on primary teeth.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3aenamel 3afruits 3apH 3asurface roughness 3atooth erosion1 aPai, Deepika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6814-98001 aShukla, Shyam Dutt1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9201-34551 aAnushree, U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6443-29911 aKumar, Saurabh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8863-61471 aPentapati, Kalyana C1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5462-56770 tThe scientific world journal.g2022 June 9, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:27586x1537-744X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/37563843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01287naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010500169300001800274500001900292520030100311592002800612650002400640650001500664650001500679650001500694651001600709700001800725773015200743856008100895852000900976655001200985IND60684808620221120213717.0200222e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068480862DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590190901402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitnikova, T.

We used cytochrome-b mitochondrial DNA sequence data to investigate species diversity, distributional patterns, and taxonomy of Apodemus in Ukraine. Sequence data proved useful for species-level discrimination, because the 11 species examined were defined by low levels of intraspecific variation (mean range, 0.00––3.35%%) and by high levels of interspecific variation (mean range, 5.37––18.9%%). We identified the 211 specimens to 1 of 4 species: A. flavicollis (n == 121), A. sylvaticus (n == 34), A. uralensis (n == 16), and A. witherbyi (n == 40). Although all 4 species are known from Ukraine, this study provides new information about the ranges and population identity for these species in southeastern Europe. For example, our analyses substantiate the marked genetic structure reported for A. sylvaticus and document the presence of northern and southern continental lineages of this species in Ukraine that are hypothesized to have been isolated from each other in glacial refugia approximately 1.5 million years ago (>5%% genetic divergence). Banks of the Dneiper River in northern Ukraine represent an area of secondary contact for the 2 lineages. Additionally, although application of A. witherbyi as a species-level name is debatable, examination of our genetic and morphological data supports its validity and priority over junior synonyms A. hermonensis and A. iconicus.  aPublisher supplied data 0aApodemus 0acytochrome b 0adistribution 0aRodentia 0aSylvaemus 0asystematics 0ataxonomy 0aUkraine1 aGaschak, Sergey1 aDunina-Barkovskaya, Yelena1 aMakluk, Julia1 aMeeks, Heather N.1 aWickliffe, Jeffrey K.1 aBaker, Robert J.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2007 Apr., v. 88, no. 2 p.330-342dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F06-MAMM-A-218R1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300002000285520154600305592002801851650001601879650002201895650001401917650001601931650002201947650001301969650001801982650002502000650002402025650001702049650001702066650001502083700005702098700005802155773011702213856008402330852000902414655001202423IND60672029120221116144508.0191008e20190916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067202912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruisong10aUnified Modeling Framework for Thin-Film Evaporation from Micropillar Arrays Capturing Local Interfacial Effects  ap. 12927-12935.  aThin-film evaporation from micropillar array porous media has gained attention in a number of fields including energy conversion and thermal management of electronics. Performance in these applications is enhanced by leveraging the geometries of the micropillar arrays to both optimize flow through these arrays via capillary pumping and increase the curved liquid–vapor interface (meniscus) area for active phase-change heat transfer. In this work, we present a unified semianalytical modeling framework to predict the dry-out heat flux accurately for thin-film evaporation from micropillar arrays with the precise prediction of (i) the pressure profile along the wick achieved by discretizing the porous media domain and (ii) the local permeability that depends on the local meniscus shape. We validate the permeability model with 3D numerical simulations and verify the accuracy of the thin-film evaporation modeling framework with available experimental data from the literature. We emphasize the importance of predicting an accurate liquid–vapor interface shape for the prediction accuracy of both the permeability and the associated governing equations for liquid propagation and phase-change heat transfer through porous materials. This modeling framework is an accurate non-CFD-based methodology for predicting the dry-out heat flux during thin-film evaporation from micropillar arrays and will serve as a general framework for modeling steady liquid–vapor phase-change processes (evaporation and condensation) in porous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronics 3aenergy conversion 3aequations 3aevaporation 3afilms (materials) 3ageometry 3aheat transfer 3aliquid-air interface 3amathematical models 3apermeability 3aporous media 3aprediction1 aJakhar, Karan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9841-53561 aAntao, Dion S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5439-80720 tLangmuir.g2019 Sept. 16, v. 35, no. 40 p.12927-12935dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003500146245008400181300001600265520143900281592002801720653001701748653001601765653001401781653001301795653001501808653001601823653001601839653001701855653001301872653001301885700001701898700003201915700001901947700002201966773011301988856008202101852000902183655001202192IND60128680520221118045533.0151116e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012868052DNAL7 a10.1644/06-MAMM-A-276R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelgen, K.

Specimens of Dyacopterus are sparsely represented in collections of world museums, which has hindered resolution of species limits within the genus. Based on our studies of most available museum material, we review the infrageneric taxonomy of Dyacopterus using craniometric and other comparisons. In the past, 2 species have been described——D. spadiceus (Thomas, 1890), described from Borneo and later recorded from the Malay Peninsula, and D. brooksi Thomas, 1920, described from Sumatra. These 2 nominal taxa are often recognized as species or conspecific subspecies representing these respective populations. Our examinations instead suggest that both previously described species of Dyacopterus co-occur on the Sunda Shelf——the smaller-skulled D. spadiceus in peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo, and the larger-skulled D. brooksi in Sumatra and Borneo. We further identify specimens of Dyacopterus from the large islands of Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippines as representatives of a distinctive new species, Dyacopterus rickarti. This new species differs from the Sundaic taxa in its much larger size, unique palatal ridge formula, and in qualitative craniodental features. The natural history of each species, so far as it is known, is briefly reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiogeography 0aDyacopterus 0aIndonesia 0aMalaysia 0amorphology 0anew species 0aPhilippines 0aPteropodidae 0ataxonomy 0aThailand1 aKock, Dieter1 aGomez, Rai Kristie Salve C.1 aIngle, Nina R.1 aSinaga, Martua H.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2007 Apr., v. 88, no. 2 p.302-318dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F06-MAMM-A-276R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014300165300001600308520147200324592002801796650001601824650001401840650002201854650001401876650001101890650001901901650001901920650001701939650001301956650001301969650001201982650001201994650001302006650001202019650002402031650001002055650001902065653001302084653001602097653001302113653002402126653002002150700001602170700001602186700001502202773009302217856008402310852000902394655001202403IND60561878820221119161212.0170720e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056187882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemón, J.10aEffect of acetic acid, methanol and potassium hydroxide on the catalytic steam reforming of glycerol: Thermodynamic and experimental study  ap. 325-336.  aThe present work analyses the effect on the reforming process of biodiesel crude glycerol of three impurities commonly found in this product. The influence of the presence of CH3OH (0–5wt.%) and/or CH3COOH (0–3wt.%) and/or KOH (0–2.8wt.%) during the catalytic steam reforming of a 30wt.% glycerol aqueous solution has been evaluated theoretically, studying the equilibrium composition of the gas, and experimentally in a fluidised bed reactor at 550°C. The presence of the aforementioned impurities has a weak impact on the thermodynamic gas composition. However, they significantly influence the product distribution (in carbon basis) obtained experimentally. The carbon of the feed converted into gas, solid and liquid products varied as follows: 75–100%, 0–25% and 0–2.5%. CH3OH alone does not alter the results obtained with pure glycerol. In contrast, CH3COOH and KOH decrease the initial production of gases. This decrease is very high for KOH due to the formation of char. However, its progressive accumulation inside the reactor exerts a positive catalytic effect on the gasification of this char, augmenting the gas production over time. The composition of the gas was little affected by the presence of the impurities. The gas phase was made up of a mixture of H2 (66–70vol.%), CO2 (24–29vol.%), CO (3–6vol.%) and CH4 (0.5–2.5vol.%). The liquid phase consisted of a mixture of alcohols, ketones, cyclic compounds, aldehydes and phenols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aaldehydes 3aaqueous solutions 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen 3aketones 3amethane 3amethanol 3aphenols 3apotassium hydroxide 3asteam 3athermodynamics 0aGlycerol 0aAcetic acid 0aMethanol 0aPotassium hydroxide 0aSteam reforming1 aMercado, V.1 aGarcía, L.1 aArauzo, J.0 tFuel Processing Technology.g2015 Oct., v. 138 p.325-336dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172300001600306520165200322592002801974650001902002650000902021650001202030650001702042650002902059650001202088650001102100650001602111650001002127650001002137650001802147653002802165653001702193653001502210653002802225653001902253700002302272700002102295773009302316856008402409852000902493655001202502IND60561878920221119160908.0170720e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056187892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhouse, Jaffer H.10aModelling, simulation and design of an integrated radiant syngas cooler and steam methane reformer for use with coal gasification  ap. 378-389.  aIn this work, a novel process intensification design is proposed to integrate the Radiant Syngas Cooler (RSC) utilised to cool the coal-derived synthesis gas in entrained-bed gasifiers and a steam methane reformer (SMR). The feasibility of the proposed integrated system is analyzed by developing a rigorous, dynamic, multi-dimensional model and establishing design heuristics for the integrated system. Two different flow configurations are explored; co-current and counter-current. The simulation results show that the proposed concept is feasible that allows for methane conversions as high as 80% in co-current mode and 88% in counter-current mode. The results also demonstrate that the counter-current design, though with higher conversion and cooling duty provided when compared to co-current designs, is limited by the tube wall material limitations. Our analysis shows that the total avoided CO2 emissions is 13.3tonnes/h by using the proposed integrated configuration in place of an external reformer for the natural gas feed rates considered in this study. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed on key model assumptions and the resulting effect on the performance is assessed. The sensitivity results have helped identify key factors to consider prior to pilot-scale implementation and further improvement for agile designs; a one third reduction in tube length reduced pressure drop by as much as 50% but reduces methane conversion by 15% points, neglecting slag deposition on tubes over-predicts performance only by 3%, and a 10% change in gas emissivity calculations affects model prediction of performance by less than 1%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acooling 3agasification 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amethane 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aslags 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 0aSteam methane reforming 0aGasification 0aIntegrated 0aProcess intensification 0aPolygeneration1 aSeepersad, Dominik1 aAdams, Thomas A.0 tFuel Processing Technology.g2015 Oct., v. 138 p.378-389dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001800293500001900311520125200330592002801582650002201610650001801632650001601650650002201666650001401688650001501702650001001717650001601727700002001743773015201763856008101915852000901996655001202005IND60684808920221120182850.0200222e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068480892DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590190901522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmirnov, A.

The interaction between foraging and thermoregulatory behavioral responses was studied in experimental conditions using 1+ perch individuals. The behavior of fish was examined in a thermally heterogeneous environment with varying levels of food availability: “excessive” (food objects constituted 20% of the overall fish weight in each compartment of the experimental device), “limited” (3%), and “zero” (0%). The values of the final preferred temperatures revealed in these conditions differed significantly: 26, 24, and 22°С, respectively. In the conditions of excessive food, fish locomotor activity was minimal. The food of juvenile fish consumed over 15 minutes was independent of the number of food objects (20 and 3%) in the experimental device, constituting 14.2 and 15.2% of the fish body weight, respectively. However, fish growth was observed only in the first case, probably due to the higher locomotor activity needed to find and obtain food in the environments with fewer food objects. The data presented may be useful for estimating the dominant forms of behavior of juvenile fish both in experimental and field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerca fluviatilis 3aanimal growth 3abody weight 3afood availability 3ajuveniles 3alocomotion 3aperch 3atemperature1 aSmirnova, E.

The chemical framework and relative stereochemistry of these four natural products were isolated, purified, and determined by using various separation and spectroscopy techniques. Each of them features a unique bicyclic-fused or trifuso-centro-fused ring system. Notably, 1 and 2 are cucurbitane-based compounds possessing a new C-24 and C-2″ carbon–carbon linkage with 5-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one and 6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-4H-pyran-3,4,4-triol units, respectively, and represented an unprecedented molecular skeleton. In terms of biosynthesis, they all originate from a common precursor 3-hydroxycucurbita-5,24-dien-19-al-7,23-di-O-β-glucopyranoside. Of two sugar moieties, the one at 23-O-β-glucopyranoside grants each individual congener uniqueness likely through microbial symbiont-mediated intramolecular transformation into two major types of furo[2,3-b]pyranone and furo[3,2-c]pyranone derivatives. These new products possess desirable anti-inflammatory biological activities in addition to being generally regarded as safe.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMomordica charantia 3abiosynthesis 3afood chemistry 3aglycosides 3aspectroscopy 3astereochemistry 3asugars 3atriterpenoids 0aMomordica charantia 0aCucurbitane 0aTaimordisins 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aNO production1 aLo, I-Wen1 aLin, Yu-Chi1 aHuang, Hung-Tse1 aZhang, Li-Jie1 aHsiao, Pin-Chun1 aLi, Tsung-Lin1 aKuo, Yao-Haur0 tFood chemistry: X.g2022 June 30, v. 14 p.100286-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27262x2590-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fochx.2022.1002863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012000166300001400286520132700300592002801627650002001655650002201675650001601697650001401713650001001727650001401737650001001751650001801761650001001779650001601789650001401805650000901819650002001828650001201848650001301860650001001873653001401883653002301897653001601920653001501936653000901951700001601960700001401976700001701990700001602007700001402023700001902037773011902056856008502175852000902260655001202269IND60540456220221120050738.0190318e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054045622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ping10aEvaluating the enantioselective degradation and novel metabolites following a single oral dose of metalaxyl in mice  ap. 32-39.  aMetalaxyl [N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)-D,L-alaninemethylester] is a systemic fungicide widely used in agriculture. In this study, the enantioselective distribution, degradation and excretion of metalaxyl were investigated after oral gavage administration of rac-metalaxyl to mice. Concentration of metalaxyl and its enantiomers was determined by HPLC–MS/MS. The results showed that R-metalaxyl was much higher than S-metalaxyl in heart, liver, lung, urine and feces. As for the strong first pass effect, concentrations of metalaxyl in liver were much higher than those in other tissues. The total body clearance (CL) of metalaxyl in mice was 1.77 L h−1 kg−1 and degradation half-lives of (t1/2) of S-metalaxyl and R-metalaxyl in liver were 2.2 h and 3.0 h, respectively. Such results indicated the enantioselectivity of metalaxyl lies in distribution, degradation and excretion processes in mice. Main metabolites were also determined and biotransformation reactions were hydroxylation, demethylation and didemethylation. Furthermore, metabolite concentrations in urine and feces were much higher than those in tissues. These results may have potential implications to predict toxicity and provide additional information associated with adverse health effects for risk assessment of metalaxyl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abiotransformation 3aenantiomers 3aexcretion 3afeces 3ahalf life 3aheart 3ahydroxylation 3aliver 3ametabolites 3ametalaxyl 3amice 3arisk assessment 3atissues 3atoxicity 3aurine 0aMetalaxyl 0aEnantioselectivity 0aDegradation 0aMetabolite 0aMice1 aZhu, Wentao1 aQiu, Jing1 aWang, Dezhen1 aWang, Xinru1 aWang, Yao1 aZhou, Zhiqiang0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2014 Nov., v. 116 p.32-39dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245006700203300001800270506007600288520120000364592002801564506003701592650000901629650001901638650002401657650001201681650001301693650001001706650001201716650000901728650001001737650002601747650002601773650001401799700002201813700002101835773013201856856007301988852000902061655001202070IND60649894820221207112202.0190707e20140521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064989482DNAL7 a10.3390/nu60520232doi7 aPMC40425692pmcid7 a248538882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiegler, Ekhard E.10aIron Stores of Breastfed Infants during the First Year of Life  ap. 2023-2034.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe birth iron endowment provides iron for growth in the first months of life. We describe the iron endowment under conditions of low dietary iron supply. Subjects were infants participating in a trial of Vitamin D supplementation from 1 to 9 months. Infants were exclusively breastfed at enrollment but could receive complementary foods from 4 months but not formula. Plasma ferritin (PF) and transferrin receptor (TfR) were determined at 1, 2, 4, 5.5, 7.5, 9 and 12 months. At 1 month PF ranged from 38 to 752 µg/L and was only weakly related to maternal PF. PF declined subsequently and flattened out at 5.5 months. PF of females was significantly higher than PF of males except at 12 months. TfR increased with age and was inversely correlated with PF. PF and TfR tracked strongly until 9 months. Iron deficiency (PF < 10 µg/L) began to appear at 4 months and increased in frequency until 9 months. Infants with ID were born with low iron endowment. We concluded that the birth iron endowment is highly variable in size and a small endowment places infants at risk of iron deficiency before 6 months. Boys have smaller iron endowments and are at greater risk of iron deficiency than girls.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aboys 3abreast feeding 3acomplementary foods 3afemales 3aferritin 3agirls 3ainfants 3airon 3amales 3anutrient deficiencies 3atransferrin receptors 3avitamin D1 aNelson, Steven E.1 aJeter, Janice M.0 tNutrients.g2014 May 21, v. 6, no. 5 p.2023-2034dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60520233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015000171300001600321520128100337592002801618650001501646650002201661650001101683650001601694650002001710650001001730650002101740650002001761653001601781653002101797653001401818653002701832700002201859773009001881856008501971852000902056655001202065IND60581762320221117193417.0180830e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058176232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRājēṣ, Ār.,10aDesign and real time implementation of a novel rule compressed fuzzy logic method for the determination operating point in a photo voltaic system  ap. 140-153.  aIn the PhotoVoltaic (PV) system characteristics, a maximum power operating point exists for each value of solar irradiance. The operating point continuously varies as the solar irradiance vary and therefore tracking of maximum power in PV system is significant. This paper introduces a new rule compressed fuzzy logic method to track optimal power operating point of photovoltaic system under non-uniform irradiance. The method has three-input parameters and a single output parameter. The input parameters are the change in power, the change in voltage and change in duty cycle and the output parameter is the reference current to the converter. With respect to each combination of two input parameters, three set of output rules are developed and then compressed to a single set of rules based on tracking conditions. The step response, analysis under partial shading and with one day solar irradiance data are implemented in Matlab/simulink platform. The method confirms its effectiveness by attaining the optimal power at 2.46s with a low steady state error of 0.35%. The energy capitulation efficiency is obtained as 99.5%. The performance of the proposed method is also evaluated experimentally and its efficiency is proved by comparing with perturb & observe algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3afuzzy logic 3alight intensity 3ashade 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 0aFuzzy logic 0aRule compression 0aPV system 0aNon uniform irradiance1 aMabel, M.

The modulation of HNF4α activity is thought to be a promising drug target pathway for hyperlipidemia. To identify compounds that reduce the activity of HNF4α, we conducted luciferase reporter assays using the promoter region of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) gene, which contains an HNF4α-responsive element. Using this system, we show here that the flavonoid derivative 4′-nitro-6-hydroxyflavone (NOHF) suppresses MTP promoter activity. Treatment with NOHF caused a decrease in the expression of the HNF4α target gene. We also identified that NOHF triggers the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and accelerates the degradation of HNF4α protein. Knock-down of AMPK diminishes the effect of NOHF. These results indicate that NOHF is an AMPK activator and attenuates the transcriptional activity of HNF4α, at least in part, by accelerating HNF4α protein degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  a16K14919cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3abiotechnology 3adrugs 3aflavonoids 3agenes 3ahyperlipidemia 3aluciferase 3apromoter regions 3aprotein degradation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atriacylglycerols 0aAMPK 0aHNF4α 0aflavonoid1 aIkeda, Shiori1 aKanayama, Tomohiko1 aSatō, Ryūichirō,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 81, no. 8 p.1548-1552dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.13253163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245014000208300001200348500001900360520049400379592002800873596003700901650002900938650001700967651001200984773013400996856008301130852000901213655001201222IND60736603720221119101249.0210523e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073660372DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-09675-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnh, Nguyen Ngoc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1477-426410aComment on “An assessment of heavy metal contamination in the surface sediments of Ha Long Bay, Vietnam” by Dang Hoai et al.

V.14aThe Structure and Numbers Dynamics of the Urban Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula, Anseriformes, Anatidae) Population in Moscow  ap. 1084-1096.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFrom 1985–1998 to 2017, the numbers and structure of the urban population of the goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) were studied in the city of Moscow. Wintering birds and females with ducklings were counted on 150 ponds and 23 creeks of Moscow. Based on the age of ducklings, the date of the onset of egg-laying by females was calculated using the countdown method. The size of the wintering group has grown significantly since 1993 (rₛ = 0.92, p < 0.05, n = 25). It reached 2400 birds by 2014. Since 2010, there has been a gradual shift of wintering goldeneyes from outside the city to within its borders. The increase in numbers, like that of the mallard, correlates with local climatic indices: the length of the period of frost (rₛ = –0.73, p < 0.05, n = 25) and the mean daily air temperature (rₛ = 0.42, p < 0.05, n = 25) do not correlate with the global Index of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The breeding cycles of the goldeneye and mallard are similar in the ordering of the onset of egg-laying in relation to the transition of the average daily air temperature towards over 0°C. The earlier temperatures above freezing are established and the ice melts, the more time the females have to prepare for egg-laying for both goldeneyes (rₛ = –0.80, p < 0.05, n = 18) and mallards (rₛ = –0.77, p < 0.01, n = 18). In the nesting goldeneye group, in contrast to the mallards, changes were not observed in the timing of reproduction and in the regulation of the negative effects of overstocking, such as an extended egg-laying period and a reduction of brood size in response to increased female numbers. The numbers of nesting goldeneyes grew from 1998 to 2010 up to 57 broods, but in 2017 it dropped to 4. The negative consequences for the local population are primarily associated with winter weather anomalies that lead to the death of trees and their removal by communal services in the habitats of goldeneyes. The goldeneye population sizes in winter and summer vary in the opposite directions, this being caused by multidirectional trends in habitat transformation. The population dynamics of nesting goldeneyes largely depends on the frequency of dangerous meteorological events, while the population dynamics of wintering goldeneyes depends on the regional climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aBucephala 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3adeath 3afemales 3afrost 3ahabitats 3aice 3aoviposition 3apopulation dynamics 3asummer 3aurban population 3awinter0 tBiology bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences.g2019 Dec., v. 46, no. 9 p.1084-1096dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237766x1062-35907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623590190900363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013600165300001600301520076000317592002801077653001401105653001701119653000901136653002201145653001601167700001901183700001701202700002901219773011301248856008201361852000901443655001201452IND60128681020221118045640.0151116e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012868102DNAL7 a10.1644/05-MAMM-A-409R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, Sylvain10aCytogenetic and Molecular Relationships between Zarudny's Rock Shrew (Crocidura zarudnyi; Mammalia: Soricomorpha) and Eurasian Taxa  ap. 706-711.  aWe karyotyped and sequenced 1,140 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b of a specimen of Zarudny's rock shrew (Crocidura zarudnyi) from Baluchestan, southeastern Iran, to clarify its cytogenetic and molecular relationships with other Eurasian species of Crocidura.

The PEA-induced [Ca²⁺]c increase was dependent on the concentrations of PEA applied, and the Ca²⁺ mostly originated from an extracellular source. Preceding the Ca²⁺ influx, H₂O₂ was generated in the cells by the addition of PEA. Externally added H₂O₂ also induced a [Ca²⁺]c increase. These results suggest that PEA induces the [Ca²⁺]c increase via H₂O₂ generation. The PEA-induced [Ca²⁺]c increase occurred in the mid1 mutant with a slightly smaller peak than in the wild-type strain, indicating that Mid1, a stretch-activated nonselective cation channel, may not be mainly involved in the PEA-induced Ca²⁺ influx. When PEA was applied, the MATa mid1 mutant was rescued from α-factor-induced death in a Ca²⁺-limited medium, suggesting that the PEA-induced [Ca²⁺]c increase can reinforce calcium signaling in the mating pheromone response pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces 3aaequorin 3abiotechnology 3acalcium 3adeath 3agenetically modified organisms 3aion channels 3amutants 3apheromones 3ayeasts 0acalcium signaling 0acytosolic Ca2+ 0ahydrogen peroxide 0aβ-phenylethylamine 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aKRYSTOFOVA, Svetlana1 aKAWANO, Tomonori1 aMORI, Izumi C.1 aTSUJI, Frederick I.1 aIIDA, Hidetoshi1 aMUTO, Shoshi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 66, no. 5 p.1069-1074dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.66.10693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001600188245012200204300001200326506007600338520130300414592002801717596007901745596008701824596008701911506003701998650002802035650001502063650001602078650001102094650002702105650002702132650002602159650002002185650003802205650001002243650002402253650001502277650002502292650001502317700001702332700001702349700001402366700001702380700001602397700005702413700001802470773011702488856008202605852000902687655001202696IND60675963520221207072415.0210403e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067596352DNAL7 aPMC68492772pmcid7 a317114942pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-019-2156-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaolin10aComparative evaluation of two commercial ELISA kits for detection of antibodies against Akabane virus in cattle serum  ap. 408.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Akabane disease (AD), a barrier to international trade for endemic areas with far economic impact on the countries, is caused by Akabane virus (AKAV). Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a commonly used diagnostic technique for AKAV infection, including the IDEXX and IDVET ELISA kits. However, the comparative evaluation of the IDEXX and IDVET ELISA kits has not been published. The object of this study was to evaluate the test performance of the two commercial ELISA kits in detecting serum anti-AKAV antibodies in cattle. RESULTS: With virus neutralization test (VNT) as the “relative gold standard”, the diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) was 80.39% (123/153) and 93.46% (143/153) for the IDEXX and IDVET ELISA kit, when suspect samples were included. The diagnostic specificity (DSp) for the IDEXX and IDVET ELISA kit was 93.48% (502/537) and 82.31% (442/537), respectively. CONCLUSION: Both of the tested ELISA kits could be applied to detect antibodies against AKAV in cattle serum. The IDVET ELISA kit had a higher DSe. The IDEXX ELISA kit possessed the higher DSp. These results have important implications if the kits are used to screen herds or individual cattle in surveillance programs, or at border crossings for import-export inspection and quarantine.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0501100cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2017JK039cthe Basic Research Fund for Central Public Interest Institutes of China  a2018JK013cthe Basic Research Fund for Central Public Interest Institutes of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAkabane orthobunyavirus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acattle 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3adiagnostic specificity 3adiagnostic techniques 3aeconomic impact 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherds 3ainternational trade 3amonitoring 3aneutralization tests 3aquarantine1 aJing, Hongli1 aLiu, Xiaofei1 aWang, Qin1 aQiu, Songyin1 aLiu, Dandan1 aWu, Shaoqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3255-80201 aLin, Xiangmei0 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.408-408dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2156-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017600166300001200342500001900354520187300373592002802246596007502274650001702349650001702366650001202383650001502395650001102410650001502421650001102436650001902447650001102466650001202477650001502489651001002504700002002514700005602534773013402590856008302724852000902807655001202816IND60736603920221119101644.0210523e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073660392DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-09656-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Xiaopeng10aDesert channel erosion, accretion characteristics and their implications for aeolian–fluvial interactions: a case study in a desert watershed in the Ordos Plateau, China  ap. 371.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe significance of aeolian–fluvial interactions in controlling the geomorphology of the landscape in semi-arid desert dune fields has long been appreciated, but limited field data are available to examine how these modern aeolian–fluvial processes interact with the desert channel. In this study, based on desert channel changes and flash flood monitoring during a field survey, we characterize the responses of the desert channel to interactions between fluvial and aeolian processes in an ephemeral desert river in the ten kongduis region in the Hobq Desert in the Ordos Plateau (China). We find that the desert channel is the key place for interactions between aeolian and fluvial processes and has a significant impact on erosion and sediment yield. The pattern of aeolian–fluvial interactions in this area is that aeolian processes can move dunes and narrow the channels in the dry season, but storm floods can cause hyper-erosion of dune-covered banks and widen the channels, which are characterized by hyper-concentration flows during the flood season. Based on the cross-sections, the results show that the channel cross-section accretion area in the dry season was 0.4 times and 0.2 times the channel erosion area in the flood seasons of 2011 and 2012, respectively, of which the left bank accretion area in the dry season was 0.3 times and 0.1 times the left bank erosion in the flood seasons of 2011 and 2012, respectively. In the flood season, the dune-covered left bank erosion and sediment yield were 3.5 times those of the right bank on average. For channel lateral movement, the channel narrowing width caused by aeolian dune accretion in the dry season was 1/6 of the channel widening induced by storm-flood erosion in the flood season. Therefore, aeolian–fluvial interactions control the landform and landscape evolution in this desert area.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0402401cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3abank erosion 3acase studies 3adeserts 3adry season 3afloods 3alandscapes 3arivers 3asediment yield 3astorms 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aWang, Hai-bing,1 aLi, Yongshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6429-17140 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 May, v. 80, no. 10 p.371-371dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09656-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011100168300001600279520181000295592002802105650004402133650001202177650001302189650001402202650001202216650001202228650001202240650002202252650001602274650001402290650001602304650002102320650001902341650001602360650001102376650003102387650002502418650001502443650001502458650001502473650001702488650002002505650000902525650001102534650000902545650001402554650001402568650001802582651001202600653002002612653001402632653001202646653000902658653001002667653002302677700003102700700001602731700002102747700002002768773009302788856008402881852000902965655001202974IND60561879220221119160740.0170720e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056187922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraiem, Takwa10aCharacterization of the liquid products obtained from Tunisian waste fish fats using the pyrolysis process  ap. 404-412.  aThe use of organic wastes as new renewable energy sources is becoming necessary to achieve the growing energy demand in Tunisia. In this work, the pyrolysis of abundant waste fish fats provided by a canned Tuna factory was examined in a laboratory fixed-bed reactor. The main objective was to analyze the properties and the composition of the produced bio-oil using in order to implement the suitable valorization strategy. Therefore, high heating value, viscosity, density, flash point, acidity index, moisture content and ash content measurements as well as FTIR and GCMS analyses were carried out to characterize the pyrolytic oil obtained during waste fish pyrolysis at 500°C.The obtained results revealed that waste fish fats can be considered as important feedstock for biofuel production. In particular, the bio-oil characterization showed the presence of many organic compounds such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cyclic hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, aldehydes and alcohols. These compounds could be used as a valuable and sustainable chemicals source. Moreover, the bio-oil properties indicated a good calorific value (~9391kcal/kg) compared to Tunisian Diesel and European biodiesel specifications. In contrast, higher acidity (~103mgKOH/g sample) and viscosity (~7cSt) compared to conventional fuels were obtained. These properties limit the direct use of bio-oils as alternative fuel in a Diesel engine. An efficient mixture with fossil fuel may be a promising solution to improve the fuel properties.Hence, pyrolysis seems to be an eco-friendly process to recover the fish fatty wastes in Tunisia. The implementation of such management strategy will help Tunisian agri-food industries to reduce their environmental impact and fossil fuel consumption and to promote the renewable energy use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacidity 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3aalkynes 3aalternative fuels 3aash content 3abiodiesel 3acanned fish 3acarboxylic acids 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3afatty fish 3afeedstocks 3afish waste 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3aheat 3alipids 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3aviscosity 3awater content 3aTunisia 0aWaste fish fats 0aPyrolysis 0aBio-oil 0aFTIR 0aGC/MS 0aBiofuel properties1 aHassen-Trabelsi, Aïda Ben1 aNaoui, Slim1 aBelayouni, Habib1 aJeguirim, Mejdi0 tFuel Processing Technology.g2015 Oct., v. 138 p.404-412dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013700167300001600304520120200320592002801522653002601550653002901576653001901605653002501624700001901649700002001668773011301688856008301801852000901884655001201893IND60128681120221118045620.0151116e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012868112DNAL7 a10.1644/05-MAMM-A-419R1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamill, Ruth M.10aMicrosatellite Analysis of Mountain Hares (Lepus timidus hibernicus): Low Genetic Differentiation and Possible Sex-Bias in Dispersal  ap. 784-792.  aMountain hares (Lepus timidus hibernicus Bell) are extremely vagile and commute up to 3 km daily within their home ranges. However, observational and mark––recapture evidence suggests that they do not disperse far in their lifetime. Whether behavioral factors such as philopatry are promoting genetic structuring in this largely solitary species is not known. We examined genetic structure in the mountain hare using microsatellite markers from 321 mountain hares from across southern Ireland. Genetic differentiation ranged from low to moderate (pairwise FST == 0––0.116), and across distances of 200 km, FST was not correlated with geographic distance, suggesting possible population fragmentation. Home ranges of males in this species are significantly larger than those of females during the breeding season, suggesting that dispersal may be male-biased. Mean corrected assignment index (mAIC) was lower in males (−−0.280) than in females (0.403). FST was lower among male cohorts of population samples (0.040) than among female cohorts (0.051), but the difference was not significant. These results are consistent with natal dispersal of nonresident males into the sampling areas.  aPublisher supplied data 0aisolation by distance 0aLepus timidus hibernicus 0amicrosatellite 0asex-biased dispersal1 aDoyle, Deirdre1 aDuke, Edward J.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2007 June, v. 88, no. 3 p.784-792dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F05-MAMM-A-419R1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012700171300001600298520194400314592002802258650001502286650001302301650001302314650001602327650001502343650002202358650001802380650002802398650003802426650001702464650001202481650001502493650001402508650002402522650001602546650002102562650001302583650000902596653001502605653002402620653002902644653002202673700002002695700002102715773012002736856008502856852000902941655001202950IND60540456520221120043015.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054045652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakao, Toshifumi10aComparison between the modes of action of novel meta-diamide and macrocyclic lactone insecticides on the RDL GABA receptor  ap. 101-108.  aMacrocyclic lactones, avermectins, and milbemycins are widely used to control arthropods, nematodes, and endo- and ectoparasites in livestock and pets. Their main targets are glutamate-gated chloride channels. Furthermore, macrocyclic lactones reportedly interact with insect RDL γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, but their modes of action on insect RDL GABA receptors remain unknown. In this study, we attempted to better understand the modes of action of macrocyclic lactones on RDL GABA receptors. We observed that ivermectin and milbemectin behaved as allosteric agonists of the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor. G336A, G336S, and G336T mutations had profound effects on the activities of ivermectin and milbemectin, and a G336M mutation abolished the allosteric agonist and antagonist activities of these macrocyclic lactones. These results suggest that G336 in TM3 of the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor is important for the binding of macrocyclic lactones. Recently, it has been suggested that a novel RDL GABA receptor antagonist, 3-benzamido-N-(2-bromo-4-perfluoroisopropyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2-fluorobenzamide (meta-diamide 7), binds to the transmembrane intersubunit pocket near G336 in the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor. Thus, we compared the effects of mutations around G336 and A302 mutations in TM2 on the activities of macrocyclic lactone and meta-diamide 7. The effects of L281C, V340Q, V340N, A302S, and A302N mutations on the activity of meta-diamide 7 differed from those on ivermectin and milbemectin. Molecular modeling studies showed that macrocyclic lactones docked in the intersubunit pocket near G336 in the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor in the open state. In contrast, meta-diamide 7 docked into the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor in the closed state. This suggests that the modes of action of macrocyclic lactone binding to the wild-type Drosophila RDL GABA receptor differ from those of meta-diamide binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aNematoda 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3aarthropods 3achloride channels 3aectoparasites 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agamma-aminobutyric acid receptors 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3aivermectin 3alivestock 3amechanism of action 3amilbemycins 3amolecular models 3amutation 3apets 0aIvermectin 0aMacrocyclic lactone 0aMeta-diamide milbemectin 0aRDL GABA receptor1 aBanba, Shinichi1 aHirase, Kangetsu0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2015 May, v. 120 p.101-108dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245014700204520143300351592002801784650001501812650001501827650001101842650001801853650001501871650001901886650001501905650001101920650001701931650001601948650001201964653002901976653001002005653003102015653003102046653003202077700001302109700001202122700001602134700001802150700002002168700001602188700001802204700002002222700001702242700001802259700001802277700001902295700001702314700005802331773011402389856008602503852000902589655001202598IND60725964120221116154310.0211123e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072596412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1250342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zehui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9651-906310aInvestigation of MOF-derived humidity-proof hierarchical porous carbon frameworks as highly-selective toluene absorbents and sensing materials  aCarbon frameworks (CFs) derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been produced as adsorbents of toluene.

Impressively, the adsorbent CF-1100 also exhibited strong hydrophobicity, low desorption temperature, and good selectivity to toluene. The adsorption capacity decreased by only 10.4% under wet condition compared with the dry condition, standing on the top of the recently reported adsorbents. The impressive adsorption performance of CF-1100 is attributed to the larger specific surface area (1024 m²/g) and pore volume (0.497 cm³/g), newly generated micropores (pore width is 0.6–0.8 nm) and mesopores (pore width above 10 nm), and carbonaceous structure with higher degree of graphitization. Based on the adequate adsorption performance, CF-1100 coated quartz crystal microbalances as sensor also showed a high sensitivity of 0.4004 Hz/ppm and small relative standard deviations of 1.0745% for toluene sensing. This contribution provides a foundation for optimizing potential adsorbents and sensing materials for air pollution abatement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3adesorption 3ahydrophobicity 3amicropores 3aquartz 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atoluene 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aZIF-8 0aHierarchical porous carbon 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aQuartz crystal microbalance1 aYuan, Yi1 aWu, Hao1 aLi, Xinghui1 aYuan, Menglei1 aWang, Huaizhang1 aWu, Xiaoxue1 aLichuanjushi,1 aZheng, Xianming1 aKim, Mingjun1 aZheng, Haoyun1 aRehman, Sadia1 aJiang, Guangya1 aFu, Wangyang1 aJiang, Jingkun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6172-190X0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 June 05, v. 411 p.125034-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1250343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012200172300001800294520120100312592002801513650001401541650001901555650001401574650000901588650001501597650001001612650000901622650001301631650001501644700002501659700002001684700001601704700001901720700002301739700002701762700002401789700001901813700002401832700002301856773010601879856008401985852000902069655001202078IND60112894420221120103832.0141111e20111028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011289442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaintreau, Alain10aCollaborative validation of the quantification method for suspected allergens and test of an automated data treatment  ap. 7869-7877.  aPrevious publications investigated different data treatment strategies for quantification of volatile suspected allergens by GC/MS. This publication presents the validation results obtained on “ready to inject” samples under reproducibility conditions following inter-laboratory ring-testing. The approach is based on the monitoring of three selected ions per analyte using two different GC capillary columns. To aid the analysts a decisional tree is used for guidance during the interpretation of the analytical results. The method is evaluated using a fragrance oil concentrate spiked with all suspected allergens to mimic the difficulty of a real sample extract or perfume oil. At the concentrations of 10 and 100mg/kg, imposed by Directive 76/768/EEC for labeling of leave-on and rinse-off cosmetics, the mean bias is +14% and −4%, respectively. The method is linear for all analytes, and the prediction intervals for each analyte have been determined. To speed up the analyst's task, an automated data treatment is also proposed. The method mean bias is slightly shifted towards negative values, but the method prediction intervals are close to that resulting from the decisional tree.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3achromatography 3acosmetics 3aions 3amonitoring 3aodors 3aoils 3aperfumes 3aprediction1 aCicchetti, Esmeralda1 aDavid, Nathalie1 aEarls, Andy1 aGimeno, Pascal1 aGrimaud, Béatrice1 aJoulain, D.q(Daniel),1 aKupfermann, Nikolai1 aKuropka, Gryta1 aSaltron, Frédéric1 aSchippa, Christine0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Oct. 28, v. 1218, no. 43 p.7869-7877dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245018900161300001800350500001400368520112800382592002801510650002101538650002501559650002301584650001701607650002601624650001801650650001601668650001401684650001101698650001401709650001401723650001401737653002601751653002401777700002101801700002001822700001901842700002201861700002301883700002001906773018401926856007502110852000902185655001202194IND60691932420221120050639.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069193242DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.10842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aITOH, Yoshikane10aFunctional Analysis of the Chitin-binding Domain of a Family 19 Chitinase from Streptomyces griseus HUT6037: Substrate-binding Affinity and cis-Dominant Increase of Antifungal Function  ap. 1084-1092.  aNAL-light  aChitinase C (ChiC) is the first bacterial family 19 chitinase discovered in Streptomyces griseus HUT6037. While it shares significant similarity with the plant family 19 chitinases in the catalytic domain, its N-terminal chitin-binding domain (ChBDCₕᵢC) differs from those of the plant enzymes. ChBDCₕᵢC and the catalytic domain (CatDCₕᵢC), as well as intact ChiC, were separately produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Binding experiments and isothermal titration calorimetry assays demonstrated that ChBDCₕᵢC binds to insoluble chitin, soluble chitin, cellulose, and N-acetylchitohexaose (roughly in that order). A deletion of ChBDCₕᵢC resulted in moderate (about 50%) reduction of the hydrolyzing activity toward insoluble chitin substrates, but most (about 90%) of the antifungal activity against Trichoderma reesei was abolished by this deletion. Thus, this domain appears to contribute more importantly to antifungal properties than to catalytic activities. ChBDCₕᵢC itself did not have antifungal activity or a synergistic effect on the antifungal activity of CatDCₕᵢC in trans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces griseus 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aactive sites 3aantifungal properties 3abiotechnology 3acalorimetry 3acellulose 3achitin 3achitinase 3asynergism 3atitration 0achitin-binding domain 0aantifungal activity1 aKAWASE, Tomokazu1 aNIKAIDOU, Naoki1 aFUKADA, Harumi1 aMITSUTOMI, Masaru1 aWatanabe, Takeshi,1 aITOH, Yoshifumi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 66, no. 5 p.1084-1092dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.66.10843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245014200199300001800341506007600359520134100435592002801776506003701804650001701841650001801858650002901876650001001905650001001915650002501925650001001950650001601960650002301976650002001999650002102019650002202040650001402062650001102076700002602087700002202113700002802135773013302163856007302296852000902369655001202378IND60649895120221207112756.0190707e20140429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064989512DNAL7 a10.3390/nu60518092doi7 aPMC40425712pmcid7 a247870322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaidi, Maya D.10aChronic Vitamin C Deficiency Promotes Redox Imbalance in the Brain but Does Not Alter Sodium-Dependent Vitamin C Transporter 2 Expression  ap. 1809-1822.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVitamin C (VitC) has several roles in the brain acting both as a specific and non-specific antioxidant. The brain upholds a very high VitC concentration and is able to preferentially retain VitC even during deficiency. The accumulation of brain VitC levels much higher than in blood is primarily achieved by the sodium dependent VitC transporter (SVCT2). This study investigated the effects of chronic pre-and postnatal VitC deficiency as well as the effects of postnatal VitC repletion, on brain SVCT2 expression and markers of oxidative stress in young guinea pigs. Biochemical analyses demonstrated significantly decreased total VitC and an increased percentage of dehydroascorbic acid, as well as increased lipid oxidation (malondialdehyde), in the brains of VitC deficient animals (p < 0.0001) compared to controls. VitC repleted animals were not significantly different from controls. No significant changes were detected in either gene or protein expression of SVCT2 between groups or brain regions. In conclusion, chronic pre-and postnatal VitC deficiency increased brain redox imbalance but did not increase SVCT2 expression. Our findings show potential implications for VitC deficiency induced negative effects of redox imbalance in the brain and provide novel insight to the regulation of VitC in the brain during deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aascorbic acid deficiency 3ablood 3abrain 3adehydroascorbic acid 3agenes 3aguinea pigs 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein synthesis 3arepletion 3asodium1 aSchjoldager, Janne G.1 aLykkesfeldt, Jens1 aTveden-Nyborg, Pernille0 tNutrients.g2014 Apr. 29, v. 6, no. 5 p.1809-1822dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60518093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015700169520120900326592002801535650002001563650002301583650002601606650000801632650001601640650002601656650001901682650001501701650001401716650002201730650001101752650001701763653002601780653002301806653002001829653001801849653002001867700001701887700001801904700005701922773011401979856008602093852000902179655001202188IND60725964220221116154250.0211123e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072596422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1250432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kyuhyun10aFabrication of silver nanowire coated fibrous air filter medium via a two-step process of electrospinning and electrospray for anti-bioaerosol treatment  aAntimicrobial agent treatment is needed to prevent airborne infections due to microorganisms causing diseases. Silver nanowires (AgNW) have been increasingly used in air filters for their superior antimicrobial performance. In this study, AgNWs (115 nm in diameter, 4–50 µm in length) were electrosprayed on the surface of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibres that were obtained by electrospinning. Filtration efficiency of the AgNW-coated fibres was tested by aerosolizing and convectively delivering test bacteria and virus particles to the fibres. Then the particles filtered on the fibres were cultured to evaluate antibacterial and antiviral abilities. The overall filtration efficiency of the fibres increased from 92% to 96.5% (at 2.5 cm/s of air velocity) to 98.3–99.6% after AgNW coating for 30 min (areal density = 2.352 μg per 1 cm2 of filter surface area), without affecting the pressure drop. The AgNW coating for 30 min significantly increased the antimicrobial efficiency to 98.0 ± 1.1% for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), 95.2 ± 2.6% for Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), 93.7 ± 1.5% for Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus), and 72.5 ± 1.9% for bacteriophage MS2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aair 3aair filters 3aanti-infective agents 3abacteriophages 3afiltration 3ananowires 3apolyacrylonitrile 3asilver 3asurface area 0aBioaerosol filtration 0aAnti-microorganism 0aElectrospinning 0aNanofibre web 0aSilver nanowire1 aKang, Sangmo1 aPark, Ji-woon1 aHwang, Jungho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0304-73600 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 June 05, v. 411 p.125043-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1250433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245013600197520181900333592002802152650001102180650002802191650001702219650001802236650001902254650001702273650002802290650002302318650001702341650001802358650002202376650001202398650000902410650002202419650002502441650002302466650002702489650002602516650002802542650001302570650001502583650001202598700005902610700005802669700006402727700006702791700005902858700005802917773009502975856007703070852000903147655001203156IND60780438620221120203146.0220620e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078043862DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/64472822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Abha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2706-598210aRecent Advancement in Postharvest Loss Mitigation and Quality Management of Fruits and Vegetables Using Machine Learning Frameworks  aAgriculture is an important component of the concept of sustainable development. Given the projected population growth, sustainable agriculture must accomplish food security while also being economically viable, socially responsible, and having the least possible impact on biodiversity and natural ecosystems. Deep learning has shown to be a sophisticated approach for big data analysis, with several successful cases in image processing, object identification, and other domains. It has lately been applied in food science and engineering. Among the issues and concerns addressed by these systems were food recognition; quality detection of fruits, vegetables, meat, and aquatic items; food supply chain; and food contamination. In precision agriculture, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a commonly used technology for estimating food quality. It is especially important when evaluating crops at different phases of harvest and postharvest. Crop disease and damage detection is a high-priority activity because some postharvest diseases or damages, such as decay, can destroy crops and produce poisons that are toxic to humans. In this paper, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based U-Net, DeepLab, and Mask R-CNN models to detect and predict postharvest deterioration zones in stored apple fruits. Our approach is unique in that it segmented and predicted postharvest decay and nondecay zones in fruits separately. This review will focus on postharvest physiology and management of fruits and vegetables, including harvesting, handling, packing, storage, and hygiene, to reduce postharvest loss (PHL) and improve crop quality. It will also cover postharvest handling under extreme weather conditions and potential impacts of climate change on vegetable postharvest and postharvest biotechnology on PHL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3aartificial intelligence 3abiodiversity 3abiotechnology 3aclimate change 3acrop quality 3aeconomic sustainability 3afood contamination 3afood quality 3afood security 3afood supply chain 3ahygiene 3ameat 3apopulation growth 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest losses 3apostharvest physiology 3aprecision agriculture 3asustainable agriculture 3atoxicity 3avegetables 3aweather1 aVaidya, Gayatri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3667-11191 aJagota, Vishal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9713-34991 aDarko, Daniel Amoako1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7351-31711 aAgarwal, Ravindra Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0654-22841 aDebnath, Sandip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0234-66331 aPotrich, Erich1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9449-75530 tJournal of food quality.g2022 June 6, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x1745-45577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/64472823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008600165300001400251520121200265592002801477650001701505650001501522650001301537650001201550650001501562650001101577650001601588650001901604650001801623653001501641653002601656653001901682653002601701700002801727700003401755700002501789773009101814856008401905852000901989655001201998IND60561879520221119160846.0170720e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056187952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaid, Noha10aInfluence of densification parameters on quality properties of rice straw pellets  ap. 56-64.  aDensified rice straw can be easily handled, which may reduce transportation and storage costs. The influence of densification parameters on the quality properties of rice straw pellets was the main focus of this study. The conditioning factors analyzed were: moisture content of the feeding material (12%, 15% and 17%), starch as an additive (0%, 1% and 2%), operating temperature (below and over 50°C), and the influence of three flat dies with different diameter/compression length (6/20, 6/24 and 8/32mm/mm) on the pellet properties (durability, hardness, moisture content, dimension, and single and bulk densities). The quality of the pellets was evaluated in view of current standards. The results showed that the studied feeding and operating conditions had significant effects on the pellet properties, especially durability and bulk density, which are the most important parameters for pellet quality. All dimensions, most bulk densities, and few durability values of the produced pellets achieved the standard limits. The highest pellet quality, with durability 99.31%, was obtained with operating conditions 2% starch ratio, 17% feeding moisture content, temperature<50°C and die size 8/32mm/mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3adurability 3ahardness 3apellets 3arice straw 3astarch 3atemperature 3atransportation 3awater content 0aRice straw 0aPelletization process 0aPellet quality 0aProduction conditions1 aAbdel daiem, Mahmoud M.1 aGarcia-Maraver, A.q(Angela),1 aZamorano, Montserrat0 tFuel Processing Technology.g2015 Oct., v. 138 p.56-64dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245010000206300001800306506007600324520110600400592002801506506003701534650002501571650001301596650002301609650001801632650002301650650002001673650001001693650002001703650001601723650001101739650002901750650002101779650001301800650002601813650001101839700002801850700001801878773013201896856007302028852000902101655001202110IND60649895220221207112140.0190707e20140522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064989522DNAL7 a10.3390/nu60520772doi7 aPMC40425652pmcid7 a248584092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPascual-Ahuir, Amparo10aToxicity Mechanisms of the Food Contaminant Citrinin: Application of a Quantitative Yeast Model  ap. 2077-2087.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMycotoxins are important food contaminants and a serious threat for human nutrition. However, in many cases the mechanisms of toxicity for this diverse group of metabolites are poorly understood. Here we apply live cell gene expression reporters in yeast as a quantitative model to unravel the cellular defense mechanisms in response to the mycotoxin citrinin. We find that citrinin triggers a fast and dose dependent activation of stress responsive promoters such as GRE2 or SOD2. More specifically, oxidative stress responsive pathways via the transcription factors Yap1 and Skn7 are critically implied in the response to citrinin. Additionally, genes in various multidrug resistance transport systems are functionally involved in the resistance to citrinin. Our study identifies the antioxidant defense as a major physiological response in the case of citrinin. In general, our results show that the use of live cell gene expression reporters in yeast are a powerful tool to identify toxicity targets and detoxification mechanisms of a broad range of food contaminants relevant for human nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3acitrinin 3adefense mechanisms 3adose response 3afood contamination 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahuman nutrition 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoxidative stress 3atoxicity 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aVanacloig-Pedros, Elena1 aProft, Markus0 tNutrients.g2014 May 22, v. 6, no. 5 p.2077-2087dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60520773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245007400206300001800280500001900298520145200317592002801769650001101797650001701808650001101825650001501836650000901851650001301860650000901873700002201882700003201904700002901936700003601965700002902001773012902030856008202159852000902241655001202250IND60684809520221122065854.0200222e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068480952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-020-01942-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArrondo, Eneko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1728-980010aLandscape anthropization shapes the survival of a top avian scavenger  ap. 1411-1425.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEvents of non-natural mortality in human-dominated landscapes are especially challenging for populations of large vertebrates with K strategies. Among birds, vultures are one of the most threatened groups experiencing sharp population declines due to non-natural mortality. Factors causing non-natural mortality are usually studied separately. However, the potential use of an integrated index able to predict large-scale mortality risks of avian scavengers could be especially useful for planning conservation strategies. Here, we used the Human Footprint index to examine the impact of landscape anthropization on the survival rates of 66 GPS-tagged adult Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) in two Spanish regions. Foraging in more anthropized areas resulted in a significantly higher individual mortality risk mainly due to collisions with vehicles, poisonings, electrocutions and fatalities with wind turbines. Mean yearly survival rates were estimated at 0.817 ± 0.043 SE and 0.968 ± 0.018 SE for individuals from the more and less anthropized regions, respectively. Additional research should investigate whether some vulture populations could be acting as sinks unnoticed due to metapopulation dynamics. From a broader point of view, our study shows that a straightforward Human Footprint was a useful index to predict the survival of top scavengers and can be highly applicable to planning large-scale conservation measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiodiversity 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3arisk 3avultures 3awind1 aSanz-Aguilar, Ana1 aPérez-García, Juan Manuel1 aCortés-Avizanda, Ainara1 aSánchez Zapata, José Antonio,1 aDonázar, José Antonio,0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2020 Mar., v. 29, no. 4 p.1411-1425dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-020-01942-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245011100197520166200308592002801970596010201998596007702100596008502177650001002262650001402272650001202286650001602298650001302314650001602327650002102343650001402364650001002378650001702388650001502405650001202420651001002432700005602442700005502498773009502553856007702648852000902725655001202734IND60780438720221120194726.0220620e20220526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078043872DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/66762802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yanrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9826-521210aQuality Evaluation of Three Kinds of Hickories Based on Grey Relational Analysis and Entropy-Weight Theory  aIn this paper, the nutritional ingredient, aroma component, and texture of three kinds of hickories, including American hickory, Chinese Linan hickory, and Chinese Hunan hickory, were tested by instruments. The quality of different hickory varieties was analyzed at three levels by using the grey entropy correlation analysis, namely, the single nutrient composition analysis; nutritional composition and texture analysis; nutrient composition, texture, and aroma analysis. Through the analysis of nutritional composition, American hickory gets the highest score (80.6945), followed by Linan hickory (74.9987), and Hunan hickory has the lowest score (58.5925). Through the analysis of nutrition composition and texture, Linan hickory has the highest score (80.89), American hickory is the second (71.77), and Hunan hickory is last (61.62). Through the analysis of nutrition composition, texture and aroma, Linan hickory has the highest score (75.91), followed by American hickory (74.17), and Hunan hickory has the lowest score (64.20). Finally, the comprehensive evaluation of Linan hickory quality index score is the highest. The main factors contributing to the high score of Linan hickory include superior fatty acid spectrum, aminogram and higher initial chewing hardness, moderate crispness of secondary chewing, optimal palatability, and unique aroma components ((S)-2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-2-pentene, (+/−)-2-methylbutyric acid methyl ester ethyl butyrate, ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, methyl phthalate, decene, (1S)-(−)-β-pinene). The research results provide a basis for consumers to understand the quality differences of different hickories.  aPublisher supplied data  a18YJA630030 21YJA630054cHumanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China  aLY18G010005 LY17G020025cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province  a19NDJC240YB 17NDJC262YBcZhejiang Philosophy and Social Science Program of China 3aCarya 3abutyrates 3aentropy 3afatty acids 3ahardness 3aingredients 3anutrient content 3anutrition 3aodors 3apalatability 3aphthalates 3atexture 3aChina1 aLiu, Hongjiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8175-264X1 aTang, Wanyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5818-707X0 tJournal of food quality.g2022 May 26, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x1745-45577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/66762803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245009700215300001100312506007600323520139400399592002801793596007401821506003701895650001101932650002001943650002801963650003401991650001602025650001102041650002902052650001502081650001002096700003202106700002402138700001802162773010302180856008202283852000902365655001202374IND60675963820221207073257.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067596382DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-019-0487-62doi7 aPMC68492932pmcid7 a317114792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalari-Moghaddam, Asma10aAdherence to the pro-inflammatory diet in relation to prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome  ap. 72.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: There is no prior study that examined the association between nutrient-based dietary inflammatory index (DII) and odds of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). We examined the association between DII score and odds of IBS and its severity among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, dietary intakes of 3363 Iranian adults were examined using a validated Dish-based 106-item Semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (DS-FFQ). DII was calculated based on dietary intakes derived from DS-FFQ. IBS was assessed using a modified Persian version of Rome III questionnaire. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, we found that participants in the highest quintile of DII score had greater chance for IBS compared with those in the lowest quintile (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.03–1.80). By gender, we found a significant association between DII score and IBS among women (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.00–2.00). By BMI status, overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) individuals in top quintile of DII score had greater odds for IBS than those in the bottom quintile (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.07–2.53). No significant association was observed between a pro-inflammatory diet and severity of IBS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of a pro-inflammatory diet was associated with increased odds of IBS, in particular among women and those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m².  aPublisher supplied data  a9321324004cTehran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3agender 3airritable bowel syndrome 3aoverweight 3awomen1 aKeshteli, Ammar Hassanzadeh1 aEsmaillzadeh, Ahmad1 aAdibi, Peyman0 tNutrition journal.g2019 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.72-72dBioMed CentralwJournal:2170x1475-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-019-0487-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245013500200520175400335592002802089596008002117650001802197650001702215650001802232650001102250650001902261650002102280650001502301650001802316650001702334651001402351700001902365700001802384700006102402700002602463700001802489773009502507856007702602852000902679655001202688IND60780438820221120194633.0220620e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078043882DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/68434742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusanty, Aries1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0601-520610aDesigning the Interventions to Mitigate the Barriers of Coordination in Handling Food Security: Insight from Central Java Province  aThis study aims to identify the underlying barriers that may prevent public policy coordination among stakeholders in dealing with food security in Central Java Province and suggest recommendations to enhance the coordination. This study used primary data from a questionnaire that the six government agencies’ experts filled out. These experts were asked to identify the relevance and the importance of each barrier and formulate a suitable policy recommendation. There were three data processing techniques used in this study: Content Validity Analysis, Interpretative Structural Modelling (ISM) Method, and Delphi Method. The result of the Content Validity Analysis indicated 22 valid barriers. The result of the ISM method indicated eight barriers occupied the topmost level (complicated problems, insufficient sharing of information, ambiguities and lack of clarity, gap of coordination implementations between the rules and policies with the actual practice, fewer budget allocations, different aims and priorities, lack of motivation to collaborate among stakeholders from various disciplines, and weak of infrastructure). The result of the ISM method also indicated three “very significant” barriers: inadequate human resources, the limited capability of the regional government, and lack of communication and high specialization in multisector collaboration. Then, the result of the Delphi Method indicated several recognize policies to mitigate those barriers. Moreover, related to the limitation of this study, future studies should focus on the barriers in diverse places nations or compare different regions or countries; include more experts from the various stakeholder group, and test the recognized policies in the real world.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research and Innovation Agency or Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional 3aDelphi method 3afood quality 3afood security 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3alocal government 3amotivation 3apublic policy 3astakeholders 3aIndonesia1 aSusanto, Novie1 aDenny, Hanifa1 aPrabowo, Yulianto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9968-57021 aPermadi, Regine A.

Most of them are saprobes on dead wood and play fundamental role in nutrient cycling, mostly releasing carbon removed from the atmosphere by autotrophic organisms. Despite their importance, little is known about factors affecting polypore occurrence in the Neotropics. In this study, it was tested what abiotic and/or biotic conditions shapes distinct polypore communities in the Atlantic Rain Forest in Northeast Brazil by comparing (1) the composition of the species between coastal and montane forest and between dry and rainy season; (2) the similarities among areas against distance, and (3) the abundance of the species on logs of different sizes and decay stages. One hundred and ten transects (sampling units) were visited from 2008 to 2014, resulting in 138 species of poroid fungi, 80 % of them of infrequent occurrence. According to the Analysis of Similarity and PERMANOVA, the fungal communities did not form distinct groups in relation to the forest type or season, but the areas were different from each other and the variation can be partially explained by the distance among them when using linear regression. The poroid fungi were more frequently recorded in logs of decay stage 1 and 2 and their size had little, if none, effect on polypore occurrence. Thus, we suggest the protection of every fragment of any type of Atlantic Rain Forest and that dead wood should be not removed from a forest in order to protect polypore diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBasidiomycota 3aautotrophs 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3adead wood 3aforest types 3afungal communities 3afungi 3alinear models 3arain forests 3asaprophytes 3aspecies diversity 3atropics 3awet season 3aBrazil1 aNogueira-Melo, Georgea S.1 ade Lira, Carla R.

The majority of the abattoirs applied electrical waterbath stunning (72%), whereas the other methods were gas stunning (13%), head-only stunning (6%), and dry stunning (3%). In 6% of the slaughterhouses, the birds were killed without previous stunning, according to religious rites (i.e., ritual or religious slaughter). Although religious slaughter occurred in a substantial number of abattoirs, the customers of the majority of them allowed stunning, provided the animals were not killed by the stunning procedure. Substantial variation both in electrical waterbath devices and technical settings (electrical current type, wave type, voltage, frequency) combinations was observed. These settings did not only differ between slaughterhouses, but also between subsequent visits to the same slaughterhouse. Despite this variation, all systems comprised a constant voltage, multiple bird stunner. The minimum average electrical current that every chicken should receive at a certain frequency, as stated by the European Regulation No 1099/2009, was not achieved for each animal monitored due to the bird's characteristics and the different applied stunning settings, with the exception of all ISA laying hens and broiler breeders in one particular slaughterhouse. The survival rate ranged from 96.0 to 100%, 97.0 to 100%, 68.0%, 72.0 to 85.1%, and 5.6 to 52.4% in 5-wk-old broilers, 6-wk-old broilers, LSL laying hens, ISA laying hens, and broiler breeders, respectively. Monitoring of unconsciousness after passing through the waterbath was not always performed and when it was, there was no uniformity in the applied criteria. It was concluded that a large variation in slaughter and stunning practices exists among slaughterhouses in Belgium. Further research should explore the effect of the different settings on inducing a successful stun and on carcass quality, and assess if the observed variation also exists in other EU member states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abroiler breeders 3acarcass quality 3aconsumers (people) 3aelectric current 3aelectric potential difference 3alaying hens 3amonitoring 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3astunning methods 3asurvival rate 3aunconsciousness 3aBelgium 0apoultry 0aelectrical waterbath stunning 0atechnical setting 0asurvival rate1 aMoons, C P H1 aHouf, K0 tPoultry science.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 97, no. 9 p.3369-3379dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey1813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008700171300001800258520136500276592002801641650001701669650001201686650001901698650002701717650002301744650001501767650001201782650001301794650001101807650001301818650001101831650001201842650001601854650002101870651001101891700001801902773011201920856008102032852000902113655001202122IND60439389520221120213906.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043938952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-015-0972-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScarano, Fábio R.,10aBrazilian Atlantic forest: impact, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change  ap. 2319-2331.  aBiodiversity hotspots are among some of the habitats most threatened by climate change, and the Brazilian Atlantic forest is no exception. Only 11.6 % of the natural vegetation cover remains in an intensely fragmented state, which results in high vulnerability of this biome to climate change. Since >60 % of the Brazilian people live within the Atlantic forest domain, societies both in rural and urban areas are also highly vulnerable to climate change. This review examines the vulnerabilities of biodiversity and society in the Atlantic forest to climate change, as well as impacts of land use and climate change, particularly on recent biological evidence of strong synergies and feedback between them. We then discuss the crucial role ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change might play in increasing the resilience of local society to future climate scenarios and provide some ongoing examples of good adaptive practices, especially related to ecosystem restoration and conservation incentive schemes such as payment for ecosystem services. Finally, we list a set of arguments about why we trust that the Atlantic forest can turn from a “shrinking biodiversity hotspot” to a climate adaptation “hope spot” whereby society’s vulnerability to climate change is reduced by protecting and restoring nature and improving human life standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecological restoration 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aland use 3apeople 3asociety 3aurban areas 3avegetation cover 3aBrazil1 aCeotto, Paula0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2015 Sept., v. 24, no. 9 p.2319-2331dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-015-0972-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245014300172500001900315520135900334592002801693650002101721650002201742650002501764650001801789650001001807650001301817650001301830650004101843650002301884650001201907650001301919650001401932650001601946700002601962700002501988700002902013700002402042700003002066700003202096773012102128856008002249852000902329655001202338IND60738648320221118232926.0210524e20210514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073864832DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110509762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanga-Lomba, Natalia 10aAssessment of Conjugate Complexes of Chitosan and Urtica dioica or Equisetum arvense Extracts for the Control of Grapevine Trunk Pathogens  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the work presented herein, we analyze the efficacy of three basic substances that comply with European Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, namely chitosan, horsetail (Equisetum arvense L.) and nettle (Urtica dioica L.), for the control of grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) in organic farming. The E. arvense and U. dioica aqueous extracts, prepared according to SANCO/12386/2013 and SANTE/11809/2016, have been studied by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), identifying their main active constituents. The three basic substances, either alone or in combination (forming conjugate complexes), have been tested in vitro against eight Botryosphaeriaceae species, and in vivo, in grafted plants artificially inoculated with Neofusicoccum parvum and Diplodia seriata. A clear synergistic behavior between chitosan and the two plant extracts has been observed in the mycelial growth inhibition tests (resulting in EC₉₀ values as low as 208 μg·mL⁻¹ for some of the isolates), and statistically significant differences have been found in terms of vascular necroses lengths between treated and non-treated plants, providing further evidence of aforementioned synergism in the case of D. seriata. The reported data supports the possibility of extending the applications of these three basic substances in Viticulture beyond the treatment of mildew.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplodia seriata 3aEquisetum arvense 3aNeofusicoccum parvum 3aUrtica dioica 3aVitis 3aagronomy 3achitosan 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrowth retardation 3amildews 3amycelium 3asynergism 3aviticulture1 aBuzón-Durán, Laura 1 aMartin-Ramos, Pablo,1 aCasanova-Gascón, José 1 aMartin Gil, Jesús,1 aSánchez-Hernández, Eva 1 aGonzález-García, Vicente 0 tAgronomy.g2021 May 14, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110509763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014000163300001800303520149700321592002801818650001601846650001501862650001701877650001601894650001201910650001301922650002601935650002201961650001101983650002501994650001602019650001302035650001402048650001602062650001102078700001802089700002302107700002202130700002402152773011102176856008102287852000902368655001202377IND60466288720221119014212.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046628872DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-015-9410-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlidi, Slim12aA Comparative Evaluation of Bio-solvents for the Efficient Extraction of Polyphenolic Phytochemicals: Apple Waste Peels as a Case Study  ap. 1125-1133.  aApple peels were used as a model solid matrix for the comparative evaluation of aqueous mixtures of three bio-solvents, including ethanol, 2,3-butanediol (butanediol) and glycerol, with regard to polyphenol recovery. The evaluation process was based on a step-by-step optimisation of the extraction, taking into consideration basic factors, including solvent composition, liquid-to-solid ratio and temperature. A further detailed description of the extraction capacity of each solvent was carried out using kinetics. Optimal solvent concentrations were 50 % (v/v), 50 % (v/v) and 70 % (w/v) for ethanol, butanediol and glycerol, respectively, while optimal liquid-to-solid ratio and temperature were 100 mL g⁻¹ and 80 °C for all solvents tested. The kinetic assay showed that extraction yields in total polyphenols obtained with these solvent systems displayed no statistical difference, although the overall extraction rate constant and diffusion coefficient were significantly higher for the extraction performed with 50 % (v/v) butanediol. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry examination of the extracts obtained under optimised conditions revealed that their polyphenolic profile was composed, in total, of 12 principal substances, but some qualitative differences among the extracts were also observed. The reducing power of the extract obtained with 50 % (v/v) ethanol was significantly higher, a finding attributed to possible synergistic effects among polyphenols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapple peels 3abutanediol 3acase studies 3adiffusivity 3aethanol 3aglycerol 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 3asolvents 3asynergism 3atemperature 3awastes1 aBikaki, Maria1 aGrigorakis, Spyros1 aLoupassaki, Sofia1 aMakris, Dimitris P.0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2015 Dec., v. 6, no. 6 p.1125-1133dSpringer Netherlandsx1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-015-9410-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01629naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009000165300001400255520060100269592002800870650001300898650002200911650001000933650002200943650002000965650001600985651001401001651002001015651002101035700002101056773012301077856008201200852000901282655001201291IND60592096120221117205253.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059209612DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136180101252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalatov, D.M.10aMacrozoobenthic Communities of Compact Grounds in Streams of Eastern Black Sea Region  ap. 80-86.  aThe diversity of macrobenthic communities formed on rocky and pebbly ground in water streams of the eastern Black Sea Region (the Caucasus, Transcaucasia, and Northern Turkey) was analyzed on the basis of the original data, including 320 quantitative samples.

Calves assigned to D were fed a diet formulated to promote an ADG of 1kg at a DMI of 2.5% of BW (17.7% CP and 0.93 Mcal of NEg/kg). The PF calves had access to native forage, and PF+S calves had access to native forage and received the diet fed to D at a rate of 1% of BW 3× weekly. After the 28-d weaning period, calves were transported 4h to a feedlot, penned according to treatment (n = 6 pens per treatment), and fed a receiving diet (14.9% CP and 0.93 Mcal of NEg/kg) ad libitum for 60 d before transition to a finishing diet. During the first 6 d of receiving, the proportion of calves in each pen that approached the bunk and ate immediately following feed delivery at 0700h was recorded by 2 trained observers. Weaning-phase ADG was greater (P < 0.01) for D than for PF or PF+S; however, morbidity during weaning tended to be greater (P = 0.08) in D than in PF or PF+S. Receiving ADG of D was greater (P = 0.01) than of PF and PF+S. Fewer PF calves were observed at the bunk during the first 5 d of receiving (treatment × day; P < 0.01) than D or PF+S calves; however, the proportion of calves observed at the bunk was not different (treatment × day; P = 0.64) among treatments on d 6. Consequently, receiving DMI and G:F were greater (P ≤ 0.01) for D than for PF calves. Steers assigned to D were heavier (P < 0.01) than steers assigned to PF or PF+S at the beginning of the finishing period; however, steers assigned to PF had greater finishing ADG (P < 0.01) than those assigned to D or PF+S. There were no treatment differences (P ≤ 0.14) in days on feed or finishing period DMI; therefore, finishing G:F was greater (P < 0.01) for PF than D or PF+S. Carcass characteristics were not different (P ≥ 0.36) among treatments. Under the conditions of the current experiment, acclimating pasture-weaned calves to feed bunks during preconditioning had no effects on feedlot health and performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aHereford 3aagricultural experiment stations 3abeef cattle 3acalves 3acarcass characteristics 3adiet 3afeed troughs 3afeedlots 3afinishing 3aforage 3amorbidity 3apastures 3asteers 3aweaning 3aKansas 0abeef calf 0apasture weaning 0apreconditioning 0aweaning1 aJaeger, J.R.1 aWaggoner, J.W.1 aPreedy, G.W.1 aPacheco, L.A.1 aOlson, K.C.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2016 Apr., v. 32, no. 2 p.220-228dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/pas.2015-014563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010600172300001400278520205300292592002802345650001202373650002402385650001202409650002102421650001002442650001102452650002502463650001402488650001002502650001902512650002002531650001002551650001602561650001402577650001402591650003002605650002002635650001102655650002702666651001502693653002602708653001402734653001202748653000802760653000802768700001602776700001502792700001802807700001302825700001602838700001702854700001802871700002102889773015702910856008603067852000903153655001203162IND60721298220221120232225.0201224e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072129822DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2019.00006.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, G.A.10aDetection of visceral leishmaniosis in feral dogs in Bangladesh by conventional and molecular methods  ap. 28-33.  aAn investigation was carried out to recognize the occurrence of visceral leismaniosis(VL) in cattle, goats and dogs in the endemic zone of VL at Mymensingh district, Bangladesh. Venous blood, liver and spleen from the cattle, goats and dogs (50 from each) were collected from slaughter house during 2011 to 2015. Detection of the parasite was through examination of stained smear, histopathology and using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The investigations have revealed amastigote stage of Leishmania in the splenic smears of three dogs. Microgranulomas were seen in the liver of two dogs but amastigote stage of the parasite was not seen in the cytoplasm of macrophages. The PCR protocol was carried out using DNA from the blood, liver and spleen, targeting kinitoplast minicircle DNA (kDNA). A 145bp fragment of kDNA gene was amplified in positive cases of one cattle, seven goats and seven dogs. Two more PCR protocols were, adapted targeting 18S rRNA and cysteine proteases genes to support this observation. Genomic DNA from the blood, spleen and liver of cattle, goats and dogs while used in PCR amplified 18S rRNA and cysteine proteases gene specific fragments of Leishmania donovani in the spleen of two dogs. Phylogenetic analyses of 741bp fragment of the cysteine proteases gene confirmed that the protozoa as L. donovani. PCR protocol targeting 18S rRNA and cysteine proteases genes of Leishmania was found to be specific to detect L. donovani. This is the first report from Bangladesh confirming the visceral leishmaniosis in feral dogs using PCR. Thus, further investigations involving canids and other carrier animalsis required to curtail the incidence and or successful designing of VL eliminationcampaign in Bangladesh.

Herein, the arene core of ortho-iodoarylboronic acid catalysts has been optimized with regards to the electronic effects of ring substitution. Contrary to the expectation, it was found that electron-donating substituents are preferable, in particular, an alkoxy substituent positioned para to the iodide. The optimal new catalyst, 5-methoxy-2-iodophenylboronic acid (MIBA, 4f), was demonstrated to be kinetically more active than the parent des-methoxy catalyst 4a, providing higher yields of amide products in shorter reaction times under mild conditions at ambient temperature. Catalyst 4f is recyclable and promotes the formation of amides from aliphatic carboxylic acids and amines, and from heteroaromatic carboxylic acids and other functionalized substrates containing moieties like a free phenol, indole and pyridine. Mechanistic studies demonstrated the essential role of molecular sieves in this complex amidation process. The effect of substrate stoichiometry, concentration, and measurement of the catalyst order led to a possible catalytic cycle based on the presumed formation of an acylborate intermediate. The need for an electronically enriched ortho-iodo substituent in catalyst 4f supports a recent theoretical study (Marcelli, T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.2010, 49, 6840–6843) with a purported role for the iodide as a hydrogen-bond acceptor in the orthoaminal transition state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aamides 3aamines 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiochemical compounds 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3ahalogens 3ahydrogen bonding 3aiodides 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3aphenol 3apyridines 3astoichiometry 3asynthetic products1 aAl-Zoubi, Raed M.1 aHall, Dennis G.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Oct. 05, v. 77, no. 19 p.8386-8400dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo30132583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01178naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002900143245017300172300001400345520022200359592002800581650001000609650001700619650001600636700002600652773014800678856007700826852000900903655001200912IND60521510120221120213327.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052151012DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1977-01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, Karl-Friedrich10aUntersuchungen über die Existenz einer Verbindung aus Bortrifluorid und Stickstoffmonoxid / On the Existence of a Compound with Boron Trifluoride and Nitrogen Monoxide  ap. 26-31.  aBy investigating infrared spectra of solid BF₃-NO- (and BF₃-¹⁵NO-)mixtures it is suggested, that addition compounds are formed at low temperatures.

Reduction of emissions leads to a significant decrease in the concentration of heavy metals in birch leaves, and the existing differences in the proportion of damaged leaves between the background and impact sites are leveling off. An increasing temporal trend in foliar damage at the impact site confirms that the trophic activity of leaf-eating insects is being recovered following reduction of toxic load, and the remaining differences from the background territory indicate that this process is still continuing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aemissions 3aheavy metals 3ainsects 3aleaves 3atoxicity0 tRussian journal of ecology.g2018 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.87-92dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237798x1067-41367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10674136170600293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245009500166520125100261592002801512650002201540650001201562650001401574650001601588650002001604650001201624700002901636700003101665700003001696773012101726856007301847852000901920655001201929IND60742768720221120194230.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074276872DNAL7 a10.3390/v130611672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos-Valdez, Marina 10aMolecular Mechanisms during Hepatitis B Infection and the Effects of the Virus Variability  aThe immunopathogenesis and molecular mechanisms involved during a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have made the approaches for research complex, especially concerning the patients’ responses in the course of the early acute stage. The study of molecular bases involved in the viral clearance or persistence of the infection is complicated due to the difficulty to detect patients at the most adequate points of the disease, especially in the time lapse between the onset of the infection and the viral emergence. Despite this, there is valuable data obtained from animal and in vitro models, which have helped to clarify some aspects of the early immune response against HBV infection. The diversity of the HBV (genotypes and variants) has been proven to be associated not only with the development and outcome of the disease but also with the response to treatments. That is why factors involved in the virus evolution need to be considered while studying hepatitis B infection. This review brings together some of the published data to try to explain the immunological and molecular mechanisms involved in the different stages of the infection, clinical outcomes, viral persistence, and the impact of the variants of HBV in these processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aanimals 3aevolution 3ahepatitis B 3aimmune response 3aviruses1 aMonroy-Ramírez, Hugo C.1 aArmendáriz-Borunda, Juan 1 aSánchez-Orozco, Laura V.0 tViruses.g2021 June 18, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130611673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245014900201300001800350520140900368592002801777596008601805650001201891650001201903650002101915650002001936650001101956650001001967650002601977650002102003650001002024650000702034650001402041650002302055650001502078650001402093650001802107653001202125653001102137653001402148653001602162653001202178700001602190700002202206700001702228773011202245856007402357852000902431655001202440IND60673795520221116160700.0210209e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067379552DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pey1852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarol Avcılar, Ö1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5999-975010aInfluence of sepiolite additions to different litter materials on performance and some welfare parameters of broilers and litter characteristics  ap. 3085-3091.  aThe litter quality is an important factor affecting the performance, welfare and carcass quality of the broilers. Depending on the progress of the fattening duration, some materials may be added to the litter in order to keep the pH, moisture and ammonia levels in the litter under control. Sepiolite is a natural material and it has strong absorbing ability to the water. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of sepiolite additions to different litter materials on performance and some welfare parameters of broilers and litter characteristics. A total of 288 1-d-old male broiler chicks (ROSS-308) were used. Birds were randomly allocated to 2 litters (wood shavings and rice hull) and 3 sepiolite groups (0, 25, 50%) with 6 replication, and each pen contains 8 chicks. Fattening performance, IgG, tonic immobility period, feather score, skin injures, breast burns, and footpad burns of broilers were not affected significantly by sepiolite additions to the litter. However, sepiolite addition to the litter can improve litter quality. There was no significant difference between 2 litter materials because both have same color. There were no significant interactions in examined parameters. In conclusion, addition of sepiolite at 25 and 50% levels to litter materials may be used as a litter material in the broiler production without adverse welfare and performance problem.  aPublisher supplied data  aOKUBAP-2017-PT2-001cScientific Research Office of Osmaniye Korkut Ata University 3aammonia 3abreasts 3abroiler chickens 3acarcass quality 3achicks 3acolor 3afattening performance 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amales 3apH 3aparalysis 3apoultry production 3arice hulls 3asepiolite 3awood shavings 0abroiler 0alitter 0asepiolite 0aperformance 0awelfare1 aKocakaya, A1 aOnbaşılar, E.E.1 aPirpanahi, M0 tPoultry science.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 97, no. 9 p.3085-3091dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey1853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010800170300001600278500001500294520137700309592002801686650001401714650002301728650002101751650002901772650001701801650001401818650001601832650001401848650002101862650002301883650001401906650001501920650001201935651001201947653002501959700002701984700001702011700002302028700002602051773009202077856004802169852000902217655001202226IND50066173120221119093907.0130503e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006617312DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-012-9267-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilveira, Maria L.10aScreening Perennial Warm-Season Bioenergy Crops as an Alternative for Phytoremediation of Excess Soil P  ap. 469-475.  a2019-12-06  aA recent alternative strategy to reduce environmental problems associated with P transport from agricultural soils is the use of bioenergy crops to remediate excess soil P. In addition to the positive impacts associated with P mitigation, harvested biomass used as a renewable energy source can also offset the cost associated with plant-based P remediation strategies. The objective of this study was to identify potential crop species that can be used for remediation of soil P and as a cellulosic feedstock for production of renewable energy in South Florida. Fifteen crop entries were investigated for their potential to remove P from a P-enriched soil. Dry matter (DM) yield varied among crop species with greatest yield observed for elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) (43 and 39 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, respectively). Similarly, greater P removal rates were observed for elephantgrass (up to 126 kg P ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ in 2008) followed by sugarcane (62 kg P ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ in 2008). Although there was no effect (P = 0.45) of crop species on P reduction in the soil, soil P concentrations decreased linearly during the 3-year study. Because of its relatively greater DM yield and P removal rates, elephantgrass was shown to be a good candidate for remediation of excess soil P in South Florida Spodosols.  aPublisher supplied data 3ascreening 3aagricultural soils 3asoil remediation 3arenewable energy sources 3aenergy crops 3aSaccharum 3awarm season 3aSpodosols 3aphytoremediation 3aCenchrus purpureus 3asugarcane 3afeedstocks 3abiomass 3aFlorida 0aPennisetum purpureum1 aVendramini, Joao M.

For untreated brooders, the values of the motility per cent, sperm density and spermatocrit decreased continuously during the spawning season while the milt volume, duration of motility and milt pH showed only a significant decrease at the end of the season. For GnRHa‐treated males, these parameters increased 14 days after GnRHa treatment (first milt collection) and then decreased continuously towards the end of the season. In addition, the values of milt and sperm density yielded per treated male were higher than that in the untreated group, although these were not statistically different. In any case, the total sum of yielded milt from the treatment group over the spawning season was higher than that in the untreated group. In this experiment, significant positive correlations were found between milt parameters as follows: sperm motility vs. milt pH; sperm density vs. spermatocrit; milt volume vs. spermatocrit; and milt volume vs. sperm density. The results show that the treatment of Caspian brown trout by GnRHa can improve the milt quality in terms of sperm motility and sperm production during a spawning season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3abrooders 3agonadotropin release 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3amales 3amilt 3apH 3aspawning 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa1 aMojazi Amiri, Bagher1 aMehrpoosh, Mehdi1 aNazeri, Samane1 aNiksirat, Hamid0 tAquaculture research.g2011 Nov., v. 42, no. 12 p.1789-1795dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02776.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010500207300001600312520122300328592002801551650001701579650001601596650001901612650002501631650002101656650001001677650001301687650002601700650001501726650000901741650001101750650001301761650001901774650001301793650003301806650001601839650003301855650002401888653000801912653000901920653000901929653003201938653001701970653002501987700005202012700001402064700001402078700001702092700001402109700001502123773011502138856008602253852000902339655001202348IND60701548820221121021808.0210401e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070154882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Wangxiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2054-602210aResurrecting a p53 peptide activator - An enabling nanoengineering strategy for peptide therapeutics  ap. 293-303.  aMany high-affinity peptide antagonists of MDM2 and MDMX have been reported as activators of the tumor suppressor protein p53 with therapeutic potential. Unfortunately, peptide activators of p53 generally suffer poor proteolytic stability and low membrane permeability, posing a major pharmacological challenge to anticancer peptide drug development. We previously obtained several potent dodecameric peptide antagonists of MDM2 and MDMX termed PMIs, one of which, TSFAEYWALLSP, bound to MDM2 and MDMX at respective affinities of 0.49 and 2.4 nM. Here we report the development of gold nanoparticles (Np) as a membrane-traversing delivery vehicle to carry PMI for anticancer therapy. Np-PMI was substantially more active in vitro than Nutlin-3 in killing tumor cells bearing wild-type p53, and effectively inhibited tumor growth in metastasis in a mouse homograft mode of melanoma and a patient-derived xenograft model of colon cancer with a favorable safety profile. This clinically viable drug delivery strategy can be applied not only to peptide activators of p53 for cancer therapy, but also to peptide therapeutics in general aimed at targeting intracellular protein-protein interactions for disease intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallografting 3aantagonists 3acancer therapy 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adrug development 3adrugs 3amelanoma 3amembrane permeability 3ametastasis 3amice 3amodels 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3apeptides 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteolysis 3atumor suppressor protein p53 3axenotransplantation 0ap53 0aMDM2 0aMDMX 0aProtein-protein interaction 0aNanoparticle 0aPeptide therapeutics1 aYan, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6468-60031 aLi, Yujun1 aYan, Siqi1 aWang, Simeng1 aHou, Peng1 aLu, Wuyuan0 tJournal of controlled release.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 325 p.293-303dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245014900187300001600336520122400352592002801576650002101604650001601625650001401641650001901655650001901674650002301693650001701716650000901733650003301742650001601775650002101791650003901812650002601851650001401877650001501891650002201906650003401928650004601962650001802008650002602026650001402052650002102066650003202087650001402119700002002133700001802153700001702171700002202188773008902210856008402299990002302383852000902406655001202415IND60087334320221122061005.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008733432DNAL7 a208075932pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2010.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiangwen10aHydroxyapatite/biodegradable poly(l-lactide–co-ε-caprolactone) composite microparticles as injectable scaffolds by a Pickering emulsion route  ap. 821-828.  aHydroxyapatite (HAp)/biodegradable poly(l-lactide–co-ε-caprolactone) (P(LA/CL)) composite microparticles were fabricated as an injectable scaffold via the Pickering emulsion route in the absence of any molecular surfactants. A stable oil in water emulsion was obtained using water dispersed HAp nanocrystals as the particulate emulsifier and a dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂) solution of P(LA/CL) as the oil phase. The concentration–viscosity relationship of the P(LA/CL) solution and its influence on the formation of a stable emulsion were investigated. The dependence of homogenization on the concentration of the P(LA/CL) solution and shear speed of homogenization was also evaluated. HAp/P(LA/CL) microparticles of various morphologies, such as plates and spheres, or with various surface morphologies were realized through adjustment of the concentration and composition of the P(LA/CL) solution. The microparticles were observed by optical microscopy and scanning electronic microscopy and their size distributions measured using a microparticle size analyzer. The weight percentages of HAp nanocrystals on the HAp/P(LA/CL) microparticles of different average sizes were measured by thermogravimetric analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3ahomogenization 3ahydroxyapatite 3amethylene chloride 3ananocrystals 3aoils 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurfactants 3athermogravimetry 2aBiocompatible Materialsxchemistry 2aDurapatitexchemistry 2aEmulsions 2aInjections 2aMaterials Testing 2aMethylene Chloridexchemistry 2aNanoparticlesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aParticle Size 2aPolyestersxchemistry 2aSolutions 2aThermogravimetry 2aTissue Scaffoldsxchemistry 2aViscosity1 aOkada, Masahiro1 aMaeda, Hayata1 aFujii, Syuji1 aFuruzono, Tsutomu0 tActa biomaterialia.g2011 Feb., v. 7, no. 2 p.821-828dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2010.08.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012600155300001800281520108000299592002801379650002201407650001301429650002501442650002501467650001001492650002201502650001301524650001701537650001101554650001201565650001501577650001401592650001201606651001001618653002601628653000901654653002301663653002601686700001701712700001701729700001401746700001701760700001501777773011201792856007401904852000901978655001201987IND60673795720221116160806.0210209e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067379572DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pey1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Caihui10aGenetic characteristics of H9N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from free-range poultry in Eastern China, in 2014–2015  ap. 3793-3800.  aCirculating H7N9 influenza viruses in live poultry markets continue to pose a threat to human health. Free-range poultry, one of the sources for these markets, are common in China as well as in many developing countries. Because the H9N2 virus could be a source of internal genes for the H7N9 virus, we conducted surveillance in free-range poultry and live poultry markets to study the evolution of H7N9 and H9N2 viruses in Eastern China. We found 28 samples positive for the H9N2 virus (a rate of 3.2%), but no positive samples for the H7N9 virus. Six representative H9N2 isolates were sequenced and analyzed, and the results showed that these viruses shared high nucleotide identities (99.0 to 100%) and were in a same branch in the phylogenetic trees. All these 6 viruses are closely clustered with Zhejiang H9N2 chicken isolates, and belonged to genotype G57, along with some novel H7N9 strains and H9N2 strains circulating in humans in China. We hope that surveillance of AIVs in free-range poultry will be strengthened for further identification more genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3achickens 3adeveloping countries 3afree range husbandry 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3aviruses 3aChina 0aavian influenza virus 0aH9N2 0afree-range poultry 0aphylogenetic analysis1 aHu, Chuanxia1 aGui, Boxiang1 aChen, Qin1 aZhang, Shuyi1 aHe, Guimei0 tPoultry science.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 97, no. 11 p.3793-3800dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01897naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007200171300001800243520088600261592002801147650002201175650002301197650001201220653002501232653002201257653002901279653003601308653003201344773011401376856008401490852000901574655001201583IND60123685820221122174407.0150330e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012368582DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2013.8208162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuradian, Roldan10aPayments for Ecosystem Services as Incentives for Collective Action  ap. 1155-1169.  aThe design and thriving of payments for ecosystem services (PES) have occurred as a response to the relative failure of integrated strategies for reconciling conservation and development. The most widespread definition of PES conceives these payments as markets to solve environmental externalities. This article analyzes the limitations of this “Coasean” approach using insights from transaction costs economics, and it pleads for looking at PES with different analytical lenses. It argues that PES should be seen as “incentives for collective action.” However, the extent to which incentives can contribute to the management of ES should not be taken for granted. The effects of monetary incentives are determined by their “social meanings,” which are context and culture dependent. The proposed conceptual shift has significant analytical and practical implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollective action 3aecosystem services 3amarkets 0abehavioral economics 0acollective action 0aenvironmental governance 0apayments for ecosystem services 0atransaction costs economics0 tSociety & natural resources.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 26, no. 10 p.1155-1169dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2013.8208163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007400166300002000240520092700260592002801187650003701215650002201252650001901274650002001293650002101313650001401334650001701348650001001365650002201375650001101397650001301408650001601421650001701437650001401454650001101468650002101479700001801500700002001518700002001538700001901558700001701577773012901594856008201723852000901805655001201814IND60566931420221120032929.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b051782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChernyak, S.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermal analysis under different heating rates combined with mass spectrometry of evolved gases (TGA–MS) were used to reveal the transformations on the CNT surface. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange and mathematical handling of TGA–MS curves were carried out to evaluate the impact of a small amount of residual oxygen on CNT defunctionalization. Water, CO, CO₂, and NO/CH₂O mass curves recorded during TGA–MS study were curve fitted. The resultant peaks were attributed to the different stages of CNT defunctionalization. Deuterium exchanged CNTs allowed one to reveal the mechanism of water release during heating. Kissinger’s model was applied to estimate the activation energy of the decomposition of different functional groups on the surface of CNTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbon nanotubes 3adeuterium 3aformaldehyde 3agases 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amoieties 3anitric acid 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3athermogravimetry1 aIvanov, A.

Plot experiments were conducted at different levels of salinity and cotton cultivars during three consecutive growing seasons. Time-course measurements of the leaf spectral reflectance, leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight, leaf area, and leaf ion content of cotton were recorded under various treatments. Then, the normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI) and ratio spectral indices (RSI) based on the leaf spectrum were obtained within 350–2500nm, and their correlation with EWT, FMC and SLW were quantified. The results show that the EWT, FMC and SLW of cotton leaves increased with increasing soil salinity levels and that the changes in leaf spectral reflectance under varied salinity levels are highly significant, with consistent patterns across the two cultivars tested. As the soil salinity levels increased, the Na⁺, Cl⁻, and SO₄ ²⁻ content in the cotton leaves increased, whereas K⁺ and Ca²⁺ decreased at the same growth stage. In addition, the relationships among ion content, EWT, FMC and SLW were significant (P<0.01). The sensitive spectral bands for EWT, FMC and SLW occurred mainly within the near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) ranges. The best spectral indices for estimating EWT, FMC and SLW in cotton were found to be NDSI (R₁₃₄₇, R₂₃₀₇), RSI (R₂₃₀₇, R₁₃₄₇); NDSI (R₁₆₅₀, R₁₈₀₁), RSI (R₁₈₀₁, R₁₆₅₀); NDSI (R₁₃₀₀, R₂₃₀₈), RSI (R₂₃₀₇, R₁₃₄₇) and 1650/2220nm ratio, and the regression models based on the above spectral indices were identified as the best equations for the effective estimation of EWT and SLW in cotton. After testing these derived equations, the models for EWT and SLW estimation based on NDSI and RSI yielded an R² of over 0.73, with more satisfactory performance under different ecological conditions, but the estimated accuracies of FMC models were very low and may not be suitable for estimating vegetation water content in saline conditions from leaf-level reflectance. The high fit between the measured and estimated values indicates that the EWT and SLW models based on new spectral indices from leaf-level reflectance could be used for the indirect estimation of plant salinity status by monitoring the changes in EWT and SLW caused by soil salinity in cotton plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3aequations 3agrowing season 3aions 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amodels 3amonitoring 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3asaline soils 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asoil salinity 3avegetation 3awater content1 aZhou, Zhiguo1 aZhang, Guowei1 aMeng, Yali1 aChen, Binglin1 aWang, Youhua0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2012 Aug., v. 41 p.103-117dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2012.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245006200162300001400224500001400238520078500252592002801037650001301065650001501078650000901093650001001102651001001112653001501122653001701137653002001154653001401174653001301188700002001201700001301221700001201234773009401246856008201340852000901422655001201431IND60698706820221118053721.0210303e20200604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870682DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.67.500682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yu-Yan12aA taxonomic reassessment of the genus Balsamia from China  ap. 81-94.  aNAL-light  aMolecular analysis of the genus Balsamia was conducted with ITS and 28S sequences available, including newly gained sequences from Chinese specimens.

Identifying detailed classes of pixels becomes feasible due to the enhancement in spectral and spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes both spatial and spectral information for classifying pixels in hyperspectral images. The method consists of three stages. In the first stage, the pre-processing stage, the Nested Sliding Window algorithm is used to reconstruct the original data by enhancing the consistency of neighboring pixels and then Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce the dimension of data. In the second stage, Support Vector Machines are trained to estimate the pixel-wise probability map of each class using the spectral information from the images. Finally, a smoothed total variation model is applied to ensure spatial connectivity in the classification map by smoothing the class probability tensor. We demonstrate the superiority of our method against three state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark hyperspectral datasets with 10 to 50 training labels for each class. The results show that our method gives the overall best performance in accuracy even with a very small set of labeled pixels. Especially, the gain in accuracy with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms increases when the number of labeled pixels decreases, and, therefore, our method is more advantageous to be applied to problems with a small training set. Hence, it is of great practical significance since expert annotations are often expensive and difficult to collect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprobability1 aLi, Ruoning 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141639983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006200156300002000218520149900238592002801737650002301765650001501788650001701803650000901820650001601829650001801845650001401863650001901877650001201896650001601908650001301924650001801937650001201955650001601967650001301983700001901996700002602015773012402041856007402165852000902239655001202248IND60640883220221119183345.0190505e20160623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064088322DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11695g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQazi, Farah10aAdvances in biogenic synthesis of palladium nanoparticles  ap. 60277-60286.  aGreen approaches for the synthesis of nanoparticles provide advantages due to the fact that green protocols are benign and environmentally friendly. Among various green recipes, biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles has recently emerged as an active area of research due to the simplicity of this method, with cost effective protocols, higher potential of reduction and low toxic effect on human health and the environment. Moreover, the biogenic reduction occurs at physiological conditions of temperature and pressure. The raw materials are easily available and therefore, the reaction can easily be scaled up. This paper presents a review to give an idea about the most reliable, cost-effective and environment friendly synthetic protocols for metal nanoparticles to control size, shape and dispersity. In this contribution, we have emphasized particularly various plants responsible, and investigated so far, for the synthesis of palladium nanoparticles. Based on the isolated compounds/metabolites such as polyols, polyphenols, flavonoids and proteins from the respective plant extracts, a correlation is established where such metabolites are linked with the biogenic syntheses of Pd nanoparticles. The present investigation and works reviewed lead us to recommend a few potential plants for the reduction of Pd²⁺ ions into Pd⁰ nanoparticles. This review not only summarizes the present literature but also highlights the potential of this field to open up new avenues for researchers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aflavonoids 3ahuman health 3aions 3ametabolites 3ananoparticles 3apalladium 3aplant extracts 3apolyols 3apolyphenols 3aproteins 3araw materials 3arecipes 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aHussain, Zakir1 aTahir, Muhammad Nawaz0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 23, v. 6, no. 65 p.60277-60286dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11695g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007000151245008700221520160700308592002801915650001501943650001901958650000901977650001501986650001702001650001502018651001302033653002502046653001802071653002502089653002602114700002302140700002602163700005602189773011302245856008602358852000902444655001202453IND60740532620221120103605.0210904e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Alissandra Pessoa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6736-673410aDynamic modelling of rainwater harvesting with green roofs in university buildings  aUniversity buildings may contribute significantly to the urban demand of potable water, particularly in small and medium communities with large universities. In this regard, alternative sources of water supply contribute to minimizing the pressure on natural resources. This paper investigates the applicability of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems to partially compensate the daily non-potable water demand in university buildings. The traditional daily water balance model was improved to enhance the accuracy of the performance analysis and design optimization of the RWH system by accounting for consumption and runoff variability. The novel algorithm was tested using real daily water consumption data for two university buildings located in Portugal. In addition, different scenarios were evaluated combing RWH systems with extensive green roofs and different runoff distributions over time. The findings indicate that the use of real daily water consumption data instead of average values influences the final results, especially in buildings with fluctuating water consumption patterns over time up to 11%. Regarding the runoff coefficient, it was verified that variable values are recommended compared to the average values. Runoff variability associated with the installation of green roofs was found to decrease RWH system performance due to reduced stormwater runoff. However, the scenario with 50% of the catchment area covered by extensive green roofs showed promising results, decreasing the potential water saving less than 6% and increasing the volume of retained water by almost 15%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adrinking water 3arain 3astormwater 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aPortugal 0aRainwater harvesting 0aWater demands 0aUniversity buildings 0aExtensive green roofs1 aLiberalesso, Tiago1 aSilva, Cristina Matos1 aSousa, Vitor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1997-74200 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 312 p.127655-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015200168300001400320520146200334592002801796650001801824650001701842650001001859650001901869650001301888650001201901650001501913650002501928650001301953650001501966650002201981650001502003650001202018650001802030650001302048650001302061651001902074651001202093651001302105653001902118653002502137653001902162653001702181653001502198653001902213700002302232700001902255700001902274700002102293700002102314773012202335856008302457852000902540655001202549IND60525471820221120214003.0190318e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052547182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠálek, Martin10aScale-dependent habitat associations of a rapidly declining farmland predator, the Little Owl Athene noctua, in contrasting agricultural landscapes  ap. 56-66.  aDuring the last half of century, agricultural intensification within European farmlands caused the deprivation of farmland biodiversity, including farmland birds. Since then different conservation measures have been introduced to reverse declining trends of these birds. Yet, variable success of these measures suggests that habitat management requires planning at appropriate spatial scales. In this study, we examine habitat associations of the Little Owl, a rapidly declining farmland bird, within the context of Central European farmland. We collected presence/absence data from three different countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary) and examined habitat associations within and between regions at three different spatial scales: nest site, home range and landscape. We show that certain habitat associations are shared across all study regions, namely those involving grasslands and farm buildings that are used for foraging and nesting, respectively. Inter-regional analysis reveals that grasslands, gardens/orchards and farm buildings are most important habitats at small spatial scales, whereas at large spatial scales, the owl is positively associated with open habitats in terms of arable fields. We suggest that conservation planning should take into account both regional and inter-regional aspects of a species’ habitat associations to distinguish between common habitat requirements and local species-environment relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthene noctua 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3afarm buildings 3aforaging 3agardens 3agrasslands 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3aintensive farming 3alandscapes 3anesting 3anesting sites 3aorchards 3aplanning 3aCzech Republic 3aHungary 3aSlovakia 0aFarmland birds 0aHabitat associations 0aSpatial scales 0aConservation 0aGrasslands 0aFarm buildings1 aChrenková, Monika1 aDobrý, Martin1 aKipson, Marina1 aGrill, Stanislav1 aVáclav, Radovan0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 May 15, v. 224 p.56-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245012300201506007600324520214800400592002802548506003702576650001102613650002202624650000902646650002002655650002802675650001502703650001202718650001002730650001002740650001702750650001102767650002402778650001302802650001902815650001502834650001302849651002502862700005802887700002202945700005702967773010403024856007603128852000903204655001203213IND60637246720221207081859.0190416e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063724672DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/91484592doi7 aPMC64669312pmcid7 a310617372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlia, Souheir10aNutrition Knowledge and Satisfaction Levels of Postbariatric Surgery Adults in the United Arab Emirates: A Pilot Study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aResearch assessing the nutrition knowledge of postbariatric surgery patients is limited, although this category of patients is predisposed to malnutrition. In this pilot study, we explored postbariatric nutrition knowledge, satisfaction levels with dietitian nutrition counseling, and decision to undergo bariatric surgery of 83 patients who attended a postbariatric outpatient nutrition clinic in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). A cross-sectional design involving gender-stratified random sampling method was used to recruit 83 postbariatric surgery participants. A self-administered questionnaire was employed to collect information about nutrition knowledge related to dietary recommendations after bariatric surgery as well as participant views on dietitian nutrition counseling, their decision to undergo bariatric surgery, and nutrition-related complications experienced after the surgery. The mean (SD) knowledge score of postbariatric diet was 9.7 (2.05) out of a maximum possible score of 14. The majority of the participants (78.3%) correctly identified which foods are recommended during the first stage of the postbariatric surgery diet, and more than 90% knew about the importance of high-protein supplements after bariatric surgery. Female participants had significantly higher mean knowledge score compared to males (p=0.02). Although nearly 80% of the participants reported regular follow-up with their dietitian, only 10.8% reported high adherence to the dietitian’s instructions. Moreover, more than two-thirds of the participants (71.1%) rated dietary advice provided by dietitians as vague. The most common complication experienced by the participants after bariatric surgery was nausea (61.4%). Furthermore, the majority of the participants (83.4%) found their daily and leisure activities to be more enjoyable after bariatric surgery. Ways of improving the quality of information delivery by dietitians should be explored to enhance patient comprehension and adherence to postbariatric surgery diet recommendations. Future research involving a larger and more representative sample to extend our findings are needed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abariatric surgery 3adiet 3adiet counseling 3adietary recommendations 3adietitians 3afemales 3afoods 3amales 3amalnutrition 3anausea 3anutrition knowledge 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3arecreation 3asampling 3aUnited Arab Emirates1 aAli, Habiba I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2685-12441 aZoubeidi, Taoufik1 aAhmed, Mariam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1312-82950 tJournal of nutrition and metabolism.g2019 Apr. 1, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:21568x2090-07327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/91484593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010300160300002000263520090600283592002801189650002101217650001801238650002001256650001801276650001801294650001201312650001201324700002001336700002501356773012401381856007401505852000901579655001201588IND60640883520221119184758.0190505e20160629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064088352DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11703a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHejazian, Majid10aMass transport improvement in microscale using diluted ferrofluid and a non-uniform magnetic field  ap. 62439-62444.  aThis paper demonstrates that a non-uniform magnetic field and diluted ferrofluid can improve mass transport of non-magnetic solutes in a microfluidic device. A hydrodynamic flow-focusing configuration was employed to test this hypothesis. The system consists of a core stream and two sheath streams. The core stream contains a diluted ferrofluid and a fluorescent dye. Without a magnetic field, both magnetic nanoparticles of the ferrofluid and the fluorescent dye in the core stream rely on molecular diffusion to spread transversally. The susceptibility mismatch between the core and focusing fluids results in a magnetoconvective secondary flow and subsequently the mass transport of the non-magnetic fluorescent dye. We observed a significant enhancement in mass transport of the fluorescent dye. The platform presented here could be used as a microfluidics-based gradient generator or micromixer.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrodynamics 3amagnetic fields 3amass transfer 3ananoparticles 3asolutes 3astreams1 aPhan, Dinh-Tuan1 aNguyễn, Nam Trung,0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 29, v. 6, no. 67 p.62439-62444dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11703a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007900168520136600247592002801613650001501641650001001656650001501666650001501681650001201696650002101708650001301729650001501742650002201757650003701779650001101816653002001827653002101847653002201868653001101890653001901901700002201920700002201942700001901964773009201983856008302075852000902158655001202167IND60736783020221118013909.0220214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcsw.2021.1000542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaas, Kalina T.14aThe role of pectin phase separation in plant cell wall assembly and growth  aA rapidly increasing body of literature suggests that many biological processes are driven by phase separation within polymer mixtures. Liquid-liquid phase separation can lead to the formation of membrane-less organelles, which are thought to play a wide variety of roles in cell metabolism, gene regulation or signaling. One of the characteristics of these systems is that they are poised at phase transition boundaries, which makes them perfectly suited to elicit robust cellular responses to often very small changes in the cell’s “environment”. Recent observations suggest that, also in the semi-solid environment of plant cell walls, phase separation not only plays a role in wall patterning, hydration and stress relaxation during growth, but also may provide a driving force for cell wall expansion. In this context, pectins, the major polyanionic polysaccharides in the walls of growing cells, appear to play a critical role. Here, we will discuss (i) our current understanding of the structure–function relationship of pectins, (ii) in vivo evidence that pectin modification can drive critical phase transitions in the cell wall, (iii) how such phase transitions may drive cell wall expansion in addition to turgor pressure and (iv) the periodic cellular processes that may control phase transitions underlying cell wall assembly and expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell walls 3agenes 3ametabolism 3aorganelles 3apectins 3aphase transition 3apolymers 3aseparation 3astress relaxation 3astructure-activity relationships 3aturgor 0aPlant cell wall 0aPhase separation 0aVolume transition 0aPectin 0aCell expansion1 aWightman, Raymond1 aPeaucelle, Alexis1 aHöfte, Herman0 tCell surface.g2021 Dec., v. 7 p.100054-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26762x2468-23307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcsw.2021.1000543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245009600172300002000268520128600288592002801574650001501602650001201617650001301629650001101642650001901653700002501672700002201697700002601719773012901745856008201874852000901956655001201965IND60566931920221120032935.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b053082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakulin, Alexander V.10aFluorine and Oxygen Adsorption and Their Coadsorption on the (111) Surface of InAs and GaAs  ap. 17491-17500.  aOxygen and fluorine adsorption and their coadsorption on the (111) unreconstructed surface of semiconductors InAs and GaAs were studied using the projector augmented-wave method with the generalized gradient approximation for the exchange–correlation functional and hybrid functional approach. The energetically preferable adsorbate sites on the surface were determined. It is shown that fluorine adsorption above surface cations on the AᴵᴵᴵBⱽ(111)A-(1 × 1) unreconstructed surface leads to a removal of the surface state formed by cation pz-orbitals and to an unpinning of the Fermi level, whereas oxygen adsorption induces additional surface states in the band gap. The influence of fluorine and oxygen coadsorption and also fluorine concentration on the surface states in the band gap is discussed. It is shown that oxygen-induced surface states are completely or partially removed from the band gap by fluorine coadsorption if it forms bonds with cation surface atoms involved in an interaction with oxygen. The increase of fluorine concentration leads to considerable changes of the near-surface-layer structure due to the penetration of both electronegative adsorbates into the substrate and affects the electron properties of oxygen/AᴵᴵᴵBⱽ(111) interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acations 3afluorine 3aoxygen 3asemiconductors1 aKulkova, Svetlana E.1 aAksenov, Maxim S.1 aValisheva, Natalia

One promising option for decarbonising the industry is hydrogen direct reduction of iron (H-DR) with electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, powered by zero carbon electricity. However, to date, little attention has been given to the energy system requirements of adopting such a highly energy-intensive process. This study integrates a newly developed long-term energy system planning tool, with a thermodynamic process model of H-DR/EAF steelmaking developed by Vogl et al. (2018), to assess the optimal combination of generation and storage technologies needed to provide a reliable supply of electricity and hydrogen. The modelling tools can be applied to any country or region and their use is demonstrated here by application to the UK iron and steel industry as a case study. It is found that the optimal energy system comprises 1.3 GW of electrolysers, 3 GW of wind power, 2.5 GW of solar, 60 MW of combined cycle gas with carbon capture, 600 GWh/600 MW of hydrogen storage, and 30 GWh/130 MW of compressed air energy storage. The hydrogen storage requirements of the industry can be significantly reduced by maintaining some dispatchable generation, for example from 600 GWh with no restriction on dispatchable generation to 140 GWh if 20% of electricity demand is met using dispatchable generation. The marginal abatement costs of a switch to hydrogen-based steelmaking are projected to be less than carbon price forecasts within 5–10 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aarc furnaces 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3agreenhouses 3ahydrogen 3aindustry 3airon 3amodels 3asteel 3athermodynamics 3awind power 0aIron & steel 0aIndustrial decarbonisation 0aEmissions 0aHydrogen 0aUnited Kingdom1 aCockerill, Tim T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7914-23401 aGale, William F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9627-72870 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 312 p.127665-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008500162300001400247520111800261592002801379650001401407650001401421650001201435650001901447650003001466650001501496650001201511650001501523650001301538650001601551650000901567650002401576653001801600653001701618653001901635653002401654653002401678653002001702700001901722773012201741856008301863852000901946655001201955IND60525472020221120203655.0190318e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052547202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Ming10aDo rhizosphere priming effects enhance plant nitrogen uptake under elevated CO2?  ap. 50-55.  aNumerous studies suggest that rhizosphere priming can mediate decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), but direct evidence of priming-induced soil SOM decomposition on plant N uptake under elevated CO2 (eCO2) is very rare. By using a continuous dual labelling technique with 13C-depleted CO2 and 15N-enriched soil, we investigated priming of SOM decomposition and its relationship with plant N uptake of C4 and C3 grasses from a grassland ecosystem under eCO2. We observed that eCO2 induced increases in plant biomass, plant N uptake, rhizosphere priming, and total SOM decomposition in both grasses at an early plant life stage. Increased total SOM decomposition was positively related with plant N uptake by both C4 and C3 grasses under eCO2. However, the C3 grass was more dependent on N acquired from rhizosphere priming of SOM than the C4 grass. Our findings highlight that plant N uptake could be enhanced under eCO2 via accelerated SOM decomposition, and rhizosphere priming effects on SOM decomposition could play a more important role in N availability of the C3 grass in comparison with the C4 grass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3anitrogen 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 0aDecomposition 0aElevated CO2 0aPlant N uptake 0aRhizosphere priming 0aSoil organic matter 0aStable isotopes1 aPendall, Elise0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 May 15, v. 224 p.50-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014900157300002000306520084400326592002801170650002301198650002301221650002301244650001701267650000901284650001901293650001201312650001301324650001501337650001801352650001901370700001801389700001701407700001701424773012401441856007401565852000901639655001201648IND60640883720221119183512.0190505e20160711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064088372DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11710d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yajiao12aA facile construction of Au nanoparticles on a copolymer ligand brushes modified graphene oxide nanoplatform with excellent catalytic properties  ap. 64937-64945.  aIn this paper, we described an effective method for the in situ synthesis of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) on 8-hydroxyquinoline ligands-containing copolymer brushes modified graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets.

With the use of metallic iron (Fe⁰) in environmental remediation, scientists are facing such a challenging situation. Without an appropriate background, it can be very difficult to discern which information is plausible and which one is not. This communication demonstrates how the chemistry of aqueous iron corrosion (Fe⁰/H₂O system) facilitates a critical assessment of the literature on the decontamination of waters polluted with metals and metalloids. It is reiterated that the pH-dependent solubility of iron and the extent of the oxidation from Feᴵᴵ to Feᴵᴵᴵ species determine the extent of contaminant mitigation in Fe⁰/H₂O systems. Future remediation Fe⁰/H₂O systems should be designed based on the science of iron corrosion under aqueous conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acorrosion 3adecontamination 3airon 3ametalloids 3aoxidation 3apH 3apollutants 3aremediation 3awater pollution 3awater solubility 3awater treatment 0aAcid mine drainage 0aAgricultural drainage water 0aDecentralized water supply 0aIndustrial wastewater 0aSafe drinking water 0aZerovalent iron0 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2021 Aug., v. 22 p.100256-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2021.1002563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018200169300001800351520130700369536014401676592002801820596011101848650006701959650001102026650001202037650000902049650001402058650002002072650002502092650001502117650000902132650001402141650001902155650001402174650001202188650001402200700003202214700002702246773013802273856008502411852000902496655001202505IND60637251520221119102922.0190416e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063725152DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.15775772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalati, Sanaz14aThe influence of cap rock composition on hydrocarbon seep type in the Zagros oil fields, a study using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer mineral map  ap. 4934-4954.  aThe persistent natural hydrocarbon seepage in onshore basins challenges observation and exploration technologies, which are required to document and assess these valuable indications of the presence of oil and gas in the subsurface. This paper aims at demonstrating the relationship between the compositional variation of an evaporite cap rock and the types of seeps occurring at the surface. For this purpose, the multispectral Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data was utilized for mapping mineral variations of a petroleum system in the Zagros oil fields. Relative absorption-band depth (RBD), band rationing and the boosted regression trees (BRT) were applied to enhance and classify the mineral composition of evaporite, sandstone, and marly limestone formations. The gas seeps were associated with the areas of gypsum-bearing evaporite cap rock while oil seeps were mostly associated with calcite and clay zones within the cap rock, which was more prone to fracturing during the tectonic activities of the basin. It is suggested that the application of remote sensing in the oil and gas industry could be widened by detection of sleep-induced alteration to assess the efficiency of cap rock and to evaluate the productivity of reservoirs at a regional scale.  aThis work was supported by the Faculty of Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), University of Twente [ITC foundation grant].  aPublisher supplied data  aITC foundation grantcFaculty of Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), University of Twente 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3abasins 3acalcite 3aclay 3alimestone 3amineral content 3aoil and gas industry 3aoil fields 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aremote sensing 3asandstone 3aseepage 3atectonics1 avan Ruitenbeek, Frank J.

Two-photon (TP) fluorescence microscopy (TPFM) is a promising approach for detecting β-gal enzyme activity in living specimens. In the present study, we have firstly designed a series of novel naphthalene-based β-gal ratiometric TP fluorescent chromophores, and carried out quantum-chemical calculations on their structural and linear/nonlinear optical properties. We have thoroughly studied the effects of different biological bridge groups (quinoline, benzo[d]thiophene, thiophene, diazine) and cyano groups on the one-photon absorption (OPA), fluorescence, as well as two-photon absorption (TPA) properties of β-gal probes and the corresponding reaction products. The calculated results show that the product molecules always exhibit longer absorption and emission wavelengths, and possess both stronger TP transition probability and a larger net charge change relative to that of corresponding β-gal probes, due to their better planarity and larger transition dipole moment. Our analysis suggests that the net charge change dominates the TPA cross section (δₘₐₓ). There is an optimal match for δₘₐₓ and radiation rate (kᵣ) following the increase of the net charge change to improve nonlinear optical activity in the studied molecules. The substitution of benzo[d]thiazole with benzo[d]thiophene is an optimal approach for β-gal probe design with the largest fluorescence efficiency and δₘₐₓ. We hope this contribution can provide detailed theoretical analysis of OPA and TPA properties of β-gal probes and relevant products, and provide insight into the structure–property relationships for guiding experimental design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abeta-galactosidase 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental design 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3aoptical properties 3aprobability 3aquinoline 3athiazoles 3athiophene 3awavelengths1 aWang, Dan1 aZhang, Li1 aGuo, Jing-Fu1 aRen, Ai-Min0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 26, v. 6, no. 75 p.70960-70971dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11712k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245010000158300001600258520143400274592002801708653001801736653002001754653002501774653001501799653001901814700001601833773012501849856007601974852000902050655001202059IND60681627220221119190901.0200226e20180227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068162722DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2017.01272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTillmann, S.10aSyringe-feeding as a novel delivery method for accurate individual dosing of probiotics in rats  ap. 311-315.  aProbiotic administration to rodents is typically achieved using oral gavage or water bottles, but both approaches may compromise animal welfare, bacterial viability, dosing accuracy, or ease of administration. Oral gavage dosing may induce stress, especially when given daily over several weeks, and cannot be performed by inexperienced personnel. Delivery in water bottles does not take multiple co-housed animals into account, leading to inaccurate dosing of individual rats. Moreover, slow consumption of the solutions over several hours may lead to variability in bacterial stability, and potential leftovers or clogging of the bottle further threaten the reliability of this method. To date, no method has been described that can provide non-stressful precise dosing of probiotics or prebiotics in individual rats. In accordance with the 3R principles (replace, reduce, refine), we propose syringe-feeding as a refinement method for simple yet accurate administration of probiotics. Animals hereby voluntarily consume the solution directly from a syringe held into their home cage, thereby enabling controlled dosing of individual animals. This method requires a short training phase of approximately 3 days, but is very fast thereafter, only taking seconds per rat. Since studies using probiotics are usually long-term experiments, we consider syringe-feeding the most appropriate probiotic delivery mode available to date.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLactobacillus 0aBifidobacterium 0alactic acid bacteria 0asynbiotics 0adrinking water1 aWegener, G.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2018 Feb. 27, v. 9, no. 2 p.311-315dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2017.01273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245007200174300001800246500002000264500000900284520172200293592002802015596004002043650001802083650001602101650001202117650001302129650000902142650001602151650001102167650001302178650001402191650001602205650001202221650001802233650001402251650001402265650001602279650001102295650002102306651001402327651001102341700001902352700002302371700002302394700001702417700002002434773013302454856008402587852000902671655001202680IND60665257220221121220622.0220805e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525722DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.12.07482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiering, Nicholas P.10aWinter Hardiness and Freezing Tolerance in a Hairy Vetch Collection  ap. 1594-1604.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aHairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) is a winter‐annual legume that is grown as a cover crop and for forage. Although more winter tolerant than most leguminous winter annuals, it does not reliably overwinter in the upper Midwestern United States. Our objectives were to screen a collection of accessions for winter hardiness and develop a screening method for freezing tolerance in a controlled setting. We evaluated 30 accessions (commercial germplasm and breeding populations) in multiple Minnesota environments. Average winter survival among accessions ranged from 13 to 73% and resembled a bimodal distribution, where two distinct phenotypic groupings were apparent. Commercial VNS (variety‐not‐stated) accessions were found to be highly variable for winter survival. Seed derived from Minnesota was generally winter hardy (>65% survival), and seed from Oregon was not (<39%). Due to large variation among and within field environments, a method of controlled freezing was developed to supplement winter hardiness evaluations. No differences in freezing tolerance were found among accessions without cold acclimation. However, large differences in freezing tolerance occurred when plants were first grown for 2 wk in greenhouse conditions (22°C, 16‐h photoperiod) and then cold acclimated for 4 wk (3°C, 10‐h photoperiod). Lethal temperatures were determined from six 24‐h programmed freezing treatments, where treatment temperatures ranged from −13 to −21°C. Accessions differed significantly for freezing tolerance, with median lethal temperature values ranging from −8.4 to −16.0°C. This method of controlled freezing correlated highly with winter survival in field evaluations (ρ = 0.77).  aPublisher supplied data  cMinnesota Department of Agriculture 3aVicia villosa 3aacclimation 3aannuals 3abreeding 3acold 3acover crops 3aforage 3afreezing 3agermplasm 3agreenhouses 3alegumes 3aoverwintering 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3atemperature 3awinter 3awinter hardiness 3aMinnesota 3aOregon1 aFlavin, Claire1 aSheaffer, Craig C.1 aHeineck, Garett C.1 aSadok, Walid1 aEhlke, Nancy J.0 tCrop science.g2018 July, v. 58, no. 4 p.1594-1604dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2017.12.07483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013700174300001800311520235700329592002802686650002002714650001902734650001902753700002402772700002602796700002402822773013802846856008502984852000903069655001203078IND60637251820221119103116.0190416e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063725182DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.15775802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatro, Ram Narayan10aDictionary-based classifiers for exploiting feature sequence information and their application to hyperspectral remotely sensed data  ap. 4996-5024.  aThe problem of classification is shared across various disciplines. Designing even less computationally demanding and more effective classifiers has been a key challenge for researchers for many years. No single classifier can be highly effective for all types of datasets and thus, depending on the data distribution, various classifiers have been proposed in the literature. To our knowledge, feature values have been vastly exploited as the base for discriminating classes, while feature sequence information has been somehow under-exploited so far. In the proposed approach normalised features are sorted and ranked, creating a sequence of finite numbers. The associated rank of the created sequence is used as an additional feature, which in a way defines the sample-specific intra-feature relationship. Three novel dictionary-based approaches such as Sequence Classifier (SC), Sequence-dictionary-based k-Nearest Neighbours Classifier (SDk-NN) and Combined-dictionary-based k-Nearest Neighbours Classifier (CDk-NN) are proposed in this paper. In the case of remotely sensed data, and specifically in Hyper-Spectral Images (HSI), the spectral features (Spectral signatures) represent a strong, object-specific spectral relationship, which is a key point in our proposed approach. In this case, indeed, the proposed classifiers were tested over various (five) HS datasets and found to be effective. Based on the classifiers features, two derived distance measures are proposed and validated for the HS dataset, namely: the Normalised Sequence Distance (NSD) measure and Combined Distance (CD) measure. These measures appear to overperform the conventional Normalised Euclidean Distance (NED) in this context. Also, validation for both binary and multi-class datasets are experimented and their performances are evaluated in terms of accuracy and other standard measures. Experimental results over 21 datasets revealed that the proposed approaches perform comparably, and in some cases even better than other classifiers. Stack-operated, class-specific sparse dictionaries are also introduced in order to reduce the computational complexity, which can be used as an active learning-based approach for optimal training sample selection. Additional tests were performed with variable levels of dictionary sparsity for assessing its impact on accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing1 aSubudhi, Subhashree1 aBiswal, Pradyut Kumar1 aDell’Acqua, Fabio0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 July 3, v. 40, no. 13 p.4996-5024dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.15775803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013800173300001400311520163100325592002801956650001401984650001901998650001202017650002202029650001502051650001502066650001402081650002002095650002702115650000902142650002102151650001502172650003202187650003202219650002002251650002902271650002602300650002502326653002802351653002102379653001602400653001702416700001902433700001402452700001802466700001702484773011002501856009002611852000902701655001202710IND60532547020221117210655.0190405e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053254702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStádník, L.10aRelationships between milk fatty acids composition in early lactation and subsequent reproductive performance in Czech Fleckvieh cows  ap. 75-79.  aIncrease of milk yield after calving causes changes in milk fatty acids (FA) composition and simultaneously corresponds with reproduction performance decrease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationships between milk FA group composition (SFA, saturated fatty acids; MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acids; and PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids) during the first 5 lactation weeks and subsequent reproductive results (INT, calving to first service interval; NUM, number of services per conception, and DO, days open) in Czech Fleckvieh cows. A total of 1231 individual milk samples from 382 cows were collected and subsequently analyzed. Simultaneously, body condition score (BCS) was weekly evaluated as well. Software SAS 9.1 was used for statistical analysis. Daily milk yields increased whereas BCS, milk fat and protein contents decreased during period observed. The reduction of basic milk components (% of fat, % of protein) was associated with increased SFA and decreased MUFA, respectively PUFA contents. Significant (P<0.01–0.05 days) increase in NUM (+0.15 to +0.29 AI dose) and DO (+8.16 to 15.44 days) were detected in cows with the lowest SFA content. On the contrary, cows with the highest content of MUFA presented significantly (P<0.01–0.05) higher values of NUM (+0.13 to +0.30) and DO (+7.26 to +15.35 days). Milk FA groups composition in early lactation potentially used as NEB indicators, especially SFA and MUFA proportion, affected subsequent reproductive results of Czech Fleckvieh cows. Therefore, its post-partum values could serve as predictors of potential fertility of dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSimmental 3abody condition 3acalving 3acomputer software 3aconception 3adairy cows 3adays open 3aearly lactation 3afatty acid composition 3amilk 3amilk fatty acids 3amilk yield 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprotein content 3areproductive performance 3asaturated fatty acids 3astatistical analysis 0aNegative energy balance 0aMilk composition 0aFatty acids 0aReproduction1 aDucháček, J.1 aBeran, J.1 aToušová, R.1 aPtáček, M.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2015 Apr., v. 155 p.75-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011600169300001500285520100000300592002801300650002001328650002101348650001901369650001501388650001701403653001601420653001901436653001101455653002701466653001101493653001001504700001701514700001801531700002201549700002401571700002001595700002401615700001901639773009501658856008001753852000901833655001201842IND60698707620221118054027.0200615e20121214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870762DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.15.33232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumschick, Sabrina12aA conceptual framework for prioritization of invasive alien species for management according to their impact  ap. 69-100.  aThe number of invasive alien species is increasing and so are the impacts these species cause to the environment and economies. Nevertheless, resources for management are limited, which makes prioritization unavoidable. We present a prioritization framework which can be useful for decision makers as it includes both a scientific impact assessment and the evaluation of impact importance by affected stakeholders. The framework is divided into five steps, namely 1) stakeholder selection and weighting of stakeholder importance by the decision maker, 2) factual description and scoring of changes by scientists, 3) evaluation of the importance of impact categories by stakeholders, 4) calculation of weighted impact categories and 5) calculation of final impact score and decision making. The framework could be used at different scales and by different authorities. Furthermore, it would make the decision making process transparent and retraceable for all stakeholders and the general public.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3ainvasive species 3aprioritization 3ascientists 3astakeholders 0astakeholder 0adecision maker 0aexotic 0ageneric scoring system 0aimpact 0avalue1 aBacher, Sven1 aDawson, Wayne1 aHeikkilä, Jaakko1 aAgnieszka Sendek, 1 aPluess, Therese1 aRobinson, Tamara B.1 aKühn, Ingolf,0 tNeoBiota.g2012 Dec. 14, v. 15 p.69-100dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.15.33233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013200208300001800340520136300358592002801721650002401749650001401773650002101787650000901808650002001817650001701837650001301854700001901867700001901886700002001905700001801925700002201943700001801965700002201983700002202005700002002027773013102047856008302178852000902261655001202270IND60749130020221120175207.0220708e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074913002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-021-07200-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacchioni, Fabio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7664-725210aAnisakid and Raphidascaridid parasites in Trachurus trachurus: infection drivers and possible effects on the host’s condition  ap. 3113-3122.  aThis study investigated the distribution of nematode larvae of Anisakidae and Raphidascarididae (genera Anisakis and Hysterothylacium) in Trachurus trachurus (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Ligurian and central-northern Tyrrhenian Seas. The relationship between the number of parasites and the length and weight parameters of the fish was assessed, and the possible effect of the parasites on the condition factor was evaluated. A total of 190 T. trachurus specimens were collected in July 2019. Parasites were found in 70 individuals. A total of 161 visible larvae were collected in the viscera. Morphological analysis revealed the presence of Anisakis spp. in 55 fish and Hysterothylacium spp. in 15 fish, while 5 fish showed coinfection with both genera. The specimens subjected to PCR (n = 67) showed that 85% of the Anisakis larvae analyzed belonged to the species A. pegreffii, while the remaining 15% belonged to hybrids of A. pegreffii-A. simplex (s.s.). A total of 58% (n = 7) of the Hysterothylacium larvae analyzed belonged to the species H. fabri, while 42% belonged to the species H. aduncum. Our results support the hypothesis that infection with these parasites does not affect the condition of the fish host analyzed, and that body size and depth are major drivers in determining infection levels with Anisakid and Raphidascaridid nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrachurus trachurus 3abody size 3acondition factor 3afish 3amixed infection 3aparasitology 3aresearch1 aTedesco, Perla1 aCocca, Vanessa1 aMassaro, Andrea1 aSartor, Paolo1 aLigas, Alessandro1 aPretti, Carlo1 aMonni, Gianfranca1 aCecchi, Francesca1 aCaffara, Monica0 tParasitology research.g2021 Sept., v. 120, no. 9 p.3113-3122dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07200-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009700163300001600260520122200276592002801498650001501526650002201541650002101563650001501584650003101599650002101630700001601651700001301667700001701680700001701697700001401714773010301728856008201831852000901913655001201922IND60091558720221119024829.0141103e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009155872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jing12aA “signal-on” electrochemical aptasensor for simultaneous detection of two tumor markers  ap. 249-252.  aIn this paper, we report a “signal-on” electrochemical aptasensor for simultaneous determination of two tumor markers MUC1 and VEGF₁₆₅, by using a ferrocene-labeled aptamer-complementary DNA (cDNA) as probe. Since the cDNA immobilized on an electrode surface can hybridize with both MUC1 aptamer and VEGF₁₆₅ aptamer to form a long double strand with ferrocene far away from the electrode surface, the probe cannot give electrochemical signal. Nevertheless, the presence of the two tumor markers will inhibit the hybridization of cDNA with the aptamers, thus the distance between ferrocene and the electrode is changed, and a “signal-on” electrochemical method to detect two tumor markers is developed. Experimental results show that the electrochemical signal increases with the addition of either tumor markers, but the biggest electrochemical signal can only be obtained when both tumor markers are present. Therefore, the proposed electrochemical aptasensor can not only detect the two markers but also distinguish their co-existence. It may also display high selectivity and sensitivity towards the detection of the tumor markers, so it might have potential clinical application in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acomplementary DNA 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aoligonucleotides1 aHe, Xiaolin1 aBo, Bing1 aLiu, Xinjian1 aYin, Yongmei1 aLi, Genxi0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 34, no. 1 p.249-252dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008400169300001800253520096600271592002801237650001201265650002301277650002101300650002801321650001201349650002301361650001601384650001701400650002101417650001801438650001301456650002601469700001901495700002301514773010801537856008401645852000901729655001201738IND60580139220171121000000.0170911e20170911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058013922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.7b007922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyström, Gustav10aIce-Templated and Cross-Linked Amyloid Fibril Aerogel Scaffolds for Cell Growth  ap. 2858-2865.  aAmyloid fibrils prepared from β-lactoglobulin were used to form freeze-dried and cross-linked aerogels. By varying the fibril concentration and freezing gradient, it was possible to control the pore structure and elastic modulus of the aerogels within one order of magnitude from ∼20 to ∼200 kPa. Using butane tetracarboxylic acid as cross-linker, these aerogels maintained their monolithic shape under aqueous conditions, displaying elastic behavior and a modulus in the range of ∼4–40 kPa. When explored as scaffolds for cell growth, the amyloid fibril aerogels demonstrated biocompatibility and led to the successful penetration and permeation of two epithelial cell lines (Caco-2 and HT29) throughout the scaffold. These soft, elastic, and water-stable biomaterials expand the scope of amyloid fibril aerogels, making them suitable for wet-state applications such as heterogeneous catalysis, purification membranes, and 3D matrices for cell growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abutanes 3acatalytic activity 3acell growth 3acrosslinking 3aepithelial cells 3afreeze drying 3afreezing 3amodulus of elasticity1 aFong, Wye-Khay1 aMezzenga, Raffaele0 tBiomacromolecules.g2017 Sept. 11, v. 18, no. 9 p.2858-2865dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biomac.7b007923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245011100183300001600294520152900310592002801839650001701867650004301884650001201927650002901939650002001968650002501988650002302013650002102036650005602057650001702113650002002130650002402150650002402174650005802198650004502256650005202301650005602353650004602409650003202455700002102487700001702508700002102525700001602546773014202562856008202704852000902786655001202795IND4472990720221120155844.0200312e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447299072DNAL7 a215381152pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3271-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Won-Heong10aEnhanced production of GDP-L-fucose by overexpression of NADPH regenerator in recombinant Escherichia coli  ap. 967-976.  aBiosynthesis of guanosine 5′-diphosphate-L-fucose (GDP-L-fucose) requires NADPH as a reducing cofactor. In this study, endogenous NADPH regenerating enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase (Icd), and NADP⁺-dependent malate dehydrogenase (MaeB) were overexpressed to increase GDP-L-fucose production in recombinant Escherichia coli. The effects of overexpression of each NADPH regenerating enzyme on GDP-L-fucose production were investigated in a series of batch and fed-batch fermentations. Batch fermentations showed that overexpression of G6PDH was the most effective for GDP-L-fucose production. However, GDP-L-fucose production was not enhanced by overexpression of G6PDH in the glucose-limited fed-batch fermentation. Hence, a glucose feeding strategy was optimized to enhance GDP-L-fucose production. Fed-batch fermentation with a pH-stat feeding mode for sufficient supply of glucose significantly enhanced GDP-L-fucose production compared with glucose-limited fed-batch fermentation. A maximum GDP-L-fucose concentration of 235.2 ± 3.3 mg l⁻¹, corresponding to a 21% enhancement in the GDP-L-fucose production compared with the control strain overexpressing GDP-L-fucose biosynthetic enzymes only, was achieved in the pH-stat fed-batch fermentation of the recombinant E. coli overexpressing G6PDH. It was concluded that sufficient glucose supply and efficient NADPH regeneration are crucial for NADPH-dependent GDP-L-fucose production in recombinant E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aglucose 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3amalate dehydrogenase 3abatch fermentation 3aEscherichia coli 2aEscherichia colixenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Engineering 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGuanosine Diphosphate Fucosexmetabolism 2aIsocitrate Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMalate Dehydrogenase (NADP+)xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxgenetics 2aNADPxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aChin, Young-Wook1 aHan, Nam Soo1 aKim, Myoung-Dong1 aSeo, Jin-Ho0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2011 Aug., v. 91, no. 4 p.967-976dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3271-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016000167300001800327520104500345592002801390650002201418650002501440650001601465650001601481650001001497650001501507650001401522650000901536650002701545700002201572700002301594700002401617700002901641700002701670700002301697773010801720856008401828852000901912655001201921IND60580139320221118182905.0170911e20170911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058013932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.7b007942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Linda
J.13aAn Evaluation of Optimal PEGylation Strategies for Maximizing the Lymphatic Exposure and Antiviral Activity of Interferon after Subcutaneous Administration  ap. 2866-2875.  aInterferon α2 is an antiviral/antiproliferative protein that is currently used to treat hepatitis C infections and several forms of cancer. Two PEGylated variants of interferon α2 (containing 12 and 40 kDa PEGs) are currently marketed and display longer plasma circulation times than that of unmodified interferon. With increasing realization that the lymphatic system plays an important role in the extrahepatic replication of the hepatitis C virus and in the metastatic dissemination of cancers, this study sought to evaluate PEGylation strategies to optimally enhance the antiviral activity and plasma and lymphatic exposure of interferon after subcutaneous administration in rats. The results showed that conjugation with a linear 20 kDa PEG provided the most ideal balance between activity and plasma and lymph exposure. A linear 5 kDa PEG variant also exhibited excellent plasma and lymph exposure to interferon activity when compared to those of unmodified interferon and the clinically available linear 12 kDa PEGylated construct.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantiviral properties 3ahepatitis C 3ainterferons 3alymph 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3arats 3asubcutaneous injection1 aFeeney, Orlagh M.1 aLeong, Nathania J.1 aMcLeod, Victoria M.1 aPorter, Christopher J.H.1 aWilliams, Charlotte C.1 aKaminskas, Lisa M.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2017 Sept. 11, v. 18, no. 9 p.2866-2875dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biomac.7b007943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245012200211520196500333592002802298650001802326650001102344650001202355650002202367650002002389650003002409650001402439650001502453650001502468650001602483650001602499650001102515650001702526653002902543653001902572653000902591653001902600653002102619700001802640700002102658700002602679773010602705856008202811852000902893655001202902IND60736784220221118014221.0210915e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tfp.2021.1000932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrüchtenicht, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0290-246510aReactions of three European oak species (Q. robur, Q. petraea and Q. ilex) to repetitive summer drought in sandy soil  aYoung trees of deciduous Quercus robur and Q. petraea and evergreen Q. ilex were grown together in a competition lysimeter experiment to assess i) – whether the observed growth differences between evergreen Q. ilex and the deciduous Q. robur and Q. petraea on sandy soil in the field and ii) – whether the different natural distribution of Q. robur and Q. petraea could be attributed to physiological differences between the species under experimental drought stress (DS). Half of the plants were subjected to long-term DS in two consecutive years and monitored for physiological and growth parameters. In the first year, water withholding for more than three months did not lead to significant drought stress, probably because of a sufficient residual water volume in the lysimeter for the relatively small plants. However, in the second year, 2018, which was warmer, the bigger plants now competed for the residual water and clear drought stress symptoms developed for more than two months in all trees in the DS lysimeter basin. Growth was only moderately (and mostly not significantly) affected by the DS in the second year, except for a smaller total leaf area in DS Q. ilex as compared to DS Q. robur and Q. petraea and smaller root collar diameter in DS Q. ilex compared to DS Q. robur. Under DS, the deciduous species revealed significant decreases in ΔVIP, indicating a negative effect on electron transport through PS I. Pₙ, PIₐbₛ and water relations parameters (ΨPD and LWC) all decreased to various extents under DS in all three species, leading to clear separation of the deciduous from the evergreen species by PCA. However, PCA did not separate the two deciduous species from each other. It is concluded that longer root growth in the two deciduous species as compared to Q. ilex ameliorates DS effects in Q. robur and Q. petraea and may be the key to understand the better performance of deciduous oaks on sandy soil in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus robur 3abasins 3adrought 3aelectron transfer 3aevergreen trees 3ageographical distribution 3aleaf area 3alysimeters 3aroot crown 3aroot growth 3asandy soils 3asummer 3awater stress 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aSummer drought 0aOaks 0aPhotosynthesis 0aDrought reaction1 aBock, Johanna1 aFeucht, Viktoria1 aBrüggemann, Wolfgang0 tTrees, forests and people.g2021 Sept., v. 5 p.100093-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27502x2666-71937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tfp.2021.1000933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245006600165300002000231520175200251592002802003650004402031650001502075650001202090650001902102650002502121650001502146650001202161650003702173650001202210650001902222650001102241650001102252650001102263650002302274650001702297700001802314700002002332700002402352700002102376700002002397700002402417773012902441856008202570852000902652655001202661IND60566932920221120032906.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b054752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutch, Greg A.10aCation Dependent Carbonate Speciation and the Effect of Water  ap. 17570-17578.  aCarbon storage in geological formations relies on knowledge of the effect of carbonate ligand formation for both dissolution and mineralization to permit realistic reservoir modeling and to enhance confidence in storage security both spatially and temporally. Reaction rates are intrinsically slow and thus are not amenable to in situ study, often determined from high pressure batch reactions providing largely bulk structural information through product analysis. Here we present a methodology to prepare silicate mineral analogues by placing reactive cations (Na and Ca) on the surface of amorphous silica, greatly enhancing the rate of carbonate formation. Traditional characterization techniques provide thorough structural and morphological information related to the effects of doping. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used to follow carbonate formation upon exposure to CO₂. Carbonate speciation is found to be cation dependent and sensitive to the presence of water. Speciation shows further dependence on whether water is present during CO₂ exposure or subsequently. Low pressure CO₂ adsorption isotherms (T = 35 °C) were measured to quantify carbonate formation, fitted to an empirical adsorption isotherm model, and related to cation coverage as determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). CO₂ uptake at low pressure was related to carbonate formation on the surface and at higher pressures was shown to depend on surface area as modified by cation adsorption. Although envisaged as mineralization analogues, this system provides information on the impact of water on the formations of carbonates relevant to wider carbon capture and storage processes at the fundamental molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbonates 3acations 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aligands 3amineralization 3amodels 3asilica 3asodium 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area1 aMorandi, Sara1 aWalker, Rebecca1 aAnderson, James A.,1 aVega-Maza, David1 aOperti, Lorenza1 aCerrato, Giuseppina0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 120, no. 31 p.17570-17578dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b054753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010100169300001400270520120600284592002801490650001801518650001401536650001201550650001001562650001501572650004301587650001301630650001201643650001301655700001801668700002101686700002201707773011001729856008001839852000901919655001201928IND60624995020221119090323.0181206e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062499502DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217103914792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, William A.10aUnderstanding Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose Among Individuals With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes  ap. 85-94.  aPurpose To evaluate self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) information deficits, motivational obstacles, and behavioral skills limitations in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and to assess the relationship of these deficits with SMBG frequency. Methods Individuals with type 1 (n = 208; 103 male, 105 female) and type 2 (n = 218; 107 male, 111 female) diabetes participated in an online survey assessing SMBG information, motivation, behavioral skills, and behavior. Results A substantial proportion of participants scored as SMBG uninformed, unmotivated, and unskilled on specific assessment items. SMBG information, motivation, and behavioral skills deficits were significantly correlated with SMBG frequency, such that individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who were less informed, less motivated, and less behaviorally skilled, reported lower frequency of SMBG. Conclusion Common and consequential SMBG information, motivation, and behavioral skills deficits were present, and patients with these gaps were less likely to test frequently. Clinical education focusing on relevant SMBG information, motivation to act, and behavioral skills for acting effectively may be a priority.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3aeducation 3afemales 3amales 3amotivation 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3asurveys 3ateachers1 aKohut, Taylor1 aSchachner, Holly1 aStenger, Patricia0 tDiabetes educator.g2011 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.85-94dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217103914793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008800176300001600264520115800280592002801438650002301466650002401489650001401513650002101527650000801548650002001556650001001576650001001586653001801596653001401614653000901628653001501637653002401652773010401676856008401780852000901864655001201873IND60122434020221120022751.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012243402DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2013.8423812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvaro, Pacheco-Ariza10aRelation between sleep quality and attention in students of business administration  ap. 131-142.  aSleep is important for cognitive restoration and quality of life in students. There are few studies about sleep quality (SQ) and effects of diurnal and nocturnal schedules upon students in Columbia. Objective: To assess and correlate SQ, sleepiness, and attention. Participants: 69 men and 88 women (mean age = 22.7 years, SD = 4.11), students of business administration. Instruments: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Toulouse-Piéron’s Attention Test. Results: 51% of the students did not have an optimal SQ, but this was not significantly different between diurnal and nocturnal schedules. Seventy-six percent of students showed some level of sleepiness and 59% of them with a moderate or marked level of sleepiness. Students on nocturnal schedules tended to be sleepier and have a worse SQ than those on diurnal schedules. Sleep latency showed a positive correlation with attention (Spearman’s rho = 0. 227, p = 0.004). It is recommended that future studies measure a wider range of variables to enable the issue of how broad are the effects of diurnal vs. nocturnal schedules to be focused upon more clearly.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological rhythms 3abusiness management 3acognition 3acollege students 3amen 3aquality of life 3asleep 3awomen 0asleep quality 0aattention 0aPSQI 0asleepiness 0auniversity students0 tBiological rhythm research.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 45, no. 1 p.131-142dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2013.8423813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016700160300001400327520103900341592002801380650002501408650001901433650001601452650002001468650002901488650001601517650000901533650001701542650001701559650000901576650001201585650001801597650000901615650001401624653003801638653001901676653002501695653003601720700001401756700001401770700001501784700001401799700001401813700001301827700001401840773009001854856008101944852000902025655001202034IND60544766520221118064612.0160901e20150408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Yi10aUltrasensitive and rapid screening of mercury(II) ions by dual labeling colorimetric method in aqueous samples and applications in mercury-poisoned animal tissues  ap. 45-52.  aRapid and ultrasensitive detection of trace heavy metal mercury(II) ions (Hg2+) are of significant importance due to the induced serious risks for environment and human health. This presented article reports the gold nanoparticle-based dual labeling colorimetric method (Dual-COLO) for ultrasensitive and rapid detection of Hg2+ using the specific thymine–Hg2+–thymine (T–Hg2+–T) as recognition system and the dual labeling strategy for signal amplification. Both qualitative and quantitative detections of Hg2+ are achieved successfully in aqueous samples. More importantly, the achieved detection limit of 0.005ngmL−1 (0.025nM) without any instruments is very competitive to other rapid detection methods even ICP-MS based methods. This Dual-COLO method is also applied directly for real water sample monitoring and, more importantly, applied in analysis of mercury poisoned animal tissues and body fluidic samples, indicating a potentially powerful and promising tool for environmental monitoring and food safety control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanimal tissues 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afood safety 3agold 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3aions 3amercury 3arapid methods 3arisk 3ascreening 0aDual labeling colorimetric method 0aHg2+ detection 0aSignal amplification 0aMercury poisoned animal tissues1 aWang, Xin1 aXue, Feng1 aZheng, Lei1 aLiu, Jian1 aYan, Feng1 aXia, Fan1 aChen, Wei0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Apr. 08, v. 868 p.45-52dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014200167300001800309520171500327592002802042653001502070653001002085653001402095653001102109653002502120653003002145653001702175700002202192700002102214700002202235700001802257773016902275856008102444852000902525655001202534IND60651145320221119172940.0190711e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065114532DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154180006442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovačić, Ines10aVariation of parasite and fungi infection between farmed and wild mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819) from the Adriatic Sea  ap. 1871-1879.  aInvestigation of parasites and diseases affecting molluscs of ecological and economic interest is critical for the management of native stocks and aquaculture. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to investigating the World Organisation for Animal Health listed infectious diseases, so that communities can be prepared to attend public health emergencies and avoid severe income losses. In this context, the health status of Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819 was analysed in two aquaculture sites (Strunjan Bay and Piran Bay, Slovenia), and in four natural mussel beds (Adriatic Croatia International Marinas Pula and Rovinj and St Catherine, Croatia; Marina Koper, Slovenia) along the coast of the northern Adriatic Sea. The mussels were sampled in February and April 2014, and processed for histological examination of several endosymbionts and pathogens that frequently occur in mytilid mussels. Endosymbionts and pathogens were not detected in farmed mussels. Prokaryotic inclusion bodies, the protozoan Nematopsis, Ancistrocoma-like ciliates, haplosporidian-like plasmodia, turbellarian Urastoma cyprinae, and basophilic inclusion bodies were observed in digestive gland cryosections of wild mussels from the coastal region of the northern Adriatic. Fungal spores of Psilocybe sp., Ulocladium sp. and Alternaria sp. were detected between the digestive tubules based on their morphology. Diagnostic PCR did not reveal infection with Marteilia refringens during the studied period, neither in wild nor farmed mussels. We confirmed the site effects on prevalence of infected mussels. Thus, we can conclude that wild areas are more exposed to endobionts and parasites than aquaculture sites.  aPublisher supplied data 0aendobionts 0afungi 0aparasites 0amussel 0aMarteilia refringens 0aMytilus galloprovincialis 0aAdriatic Sea1 aPustijanac, Emina1 aRamšak, Andreja1 aŠebešćen, Dora1 aLipić, Sanja0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2018 Dec., v. 98, no. 8 p.1871-1879dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154180006443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008400172500001400256520160200270592002801872650001401900650001801914650001701932650001001949650001001959650001501969650002401984650001202008650001302020650001602033650001002049650001002059650001002069650001102079650001302090650000902103650003302112650001202145650001102157650001402168650002102182650001902203650001302222650001102235650001302246650001802259650001202277650002002289651001602309653001602325653002202341653001502363653002602378653001802404653002002422700002602442700001902468700002302487700002202510700002702532700002202559700002302581700002102604773009502625856008402720852000902804655001202813IND60709537420221119024449.0210105e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2020.1020622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVančurová, Lucie10aSymbiosis between river and dry lands: Phycobiont dynamics on river gravel bars  aNAL-light  aRiver gravel bars are dynamic and heterogeneous habitats straddling the transition between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Periodic flooding, low nutrient concentrations, frost, lack of stable sites, drought, and ground surface heat significantly influence the biota of these habitats. Mutualistic symbiosis may be a successful strategy for organisms to survive and proliferate under such harsh conditions. The lichen genus Stereocaulon was selected as a model symbiotic system from among the organisms living on river gravel bars. The goal of the current study was to determine the effect of this dynamic environment on phycobiont (i.e., green eukaryotic photobiont) community structure. We analyzed 147 Stereocaulon specimens collected in the Swiss Alps using Sanger sequencing (fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA, algal ITS rDNA, and algal actin type I gene) and analyzed 8 selected thalli and 12 soil samples using Illumina metabarcoding (ITS2 rDNA). Phytosociological sampling was performed for all 13 study plots. Our analyses of communities of phycobionts, lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants indicated a gradual change in the phycobiont community along a successional gradient. The particularly large phycobiont diversity associated with Stereocaulon mycobionts included algae, here reported as phycobionts for the first time. Each of the two Stereocaulon mycobiont operational taxonomic units had a distinct pool of predominant phycobionts. The thalli selected for Illumina metabarcoding contained a wide range of additional algae, i.e., they showed algal plurality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3aDNA barcoding 3aStereocaulon 3aactin 3aalgae 3aarid lands 3acommunity structure 3adrought 3adynamics 3aenvironment 3afrost 3afungi 3agenes 3agravel 3ahabitats 3aheat 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alichens 3amodels 3amutualism 3anutrient content 3aphytosociology 3aresearch 3arivers 3asampling 3asoil sampling 3athallus 3avascular plants 3aAlps region 0aSpecificity 0aLichen phycobiont 0aSuccession 0aCommunity composition 0aMetabarcoding 0aAlgal plurality1 aKalníková, Veronika1 aPeksa, Ondřej1 aŠkvorová, Zuzana1 aMalíček, Jiří1 aMoya Cañas, Patricia,1 aChytrý, Kryštof1 aČernajová, Ivana1 aŠkaloud, Pavel,0 tAlgal research.g2020 Oct., v. 51 p.102062-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2020.1020623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008400175300001600259520093000275592002801205650001901233650001201252650000901264650001301273650002901286650002601315650001401341650001501355650001201370650000901382650001901391653000801410653002901418653001801447653001301465653001201478700001801490700002201508773011201530856008501642852000901727655001201736IND60515413520221119104352.0160315e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051541352DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2015.11179762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlho, Ana Margarida10aGuardians' Knowledge and Husbandry Practices of Feline Environmental Enrichment  ap. 115-125.  aFeline environmental enrichment can prevent numerous disorders including anxiety, stress, obesity, and feline idiopathic cystitis.

The main goal of this study was to assess guardians' knowledge concerning feline environmental enrichment and husbandry practices. A questionnaire was given to 130 companion animal guardians at the Lisbon Veterinary Faculty's Teaching Hospital. The applications of 22 environmental enrichment measures related to food/water, litter box, and space/entertainment areas were evaluated. The majority of the households studied (74.6%) had a moderately enriched environment. Hygiene-related measures were those most adopted by guardians, while those requiring guardians' commitment or previous awareness were the least implemented. A rating scale was proposed and applied to assess feline domestic environmental quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aanxiety 3acats 3acystitis 3aenvironmental enrichment 3aenvironmental quality 3ahospitals 3ahouseholds 3aobesity 3apets 3aquestionnaires 0aCat 0aenvironmental enrichment 0aquestionnaire 0abehavior 0awelfare1 aPontes, Joana1 aPomba, Constança0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 19, no. 2 p.115-125dRoutledgex1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2015.11179763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245002500166300001500191520189700206592002802103650002202131650001102153650001902164650002802183650001902211650001302230650001002243650001402253650001202267650001402279650004002293650001702333650001302350700002002363700002002383700001502403700002302418700002202441773011102463856008002574852000902654655001202663IND60624995120221119090335.0181206e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062499512DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217103922462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagee, Michelle14aThe ABCs of Diabetes  ap. 95-103.  aPurpose The purpose of the study was to examine the feasibility and impact of a concise community-based program on diabetes self-management education (DSME), according to frequency of emergency department visits and knowledge of, prescriptions for, and control of A1C, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Methods A free community-based DSME program was placed in a public library. Adults with diabetes (N, 360) consented to participate in this prospective nonrandomized cohort study with preintervention-postintervention design. The small-group interactive DSME (two 2.5-hour classes) focused on improving cardiovascular disease risk factors and facilitating communication with the primary care physician. Results An increase in knowledge of American Diabetes Association—recommended targets for A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol from baseline to postintervention was seen among participants. Significant clinical outcomes included reduction in self-reported emergency department visits and reduction in mean A1C. However, despite an increase in prescriptions written for lipid-lowering drugs, blood pressure and LDL cholesterol did not change. Participants who started on insulin were more likely to achieve or maintain A1C < 7% compared to those who either did not take or stopped taking insulin during the study. Conclusions Offering DSME classes for African Americans at a public library was feasible and significantly affected 6-month clinical outcomes, including a reduction in A1C, an increased likelihood of attaining a target A1C of < 7% if insulin was started during the study period, and a two-thirds reduction in emergency department visits for uncontrolled diabetes. Observed results suggest that partnering with community-based organizations such as public libraries offers an accessible and well-received location for offering DSME programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aadults 3ablood pressure 3acardiovascular diseases 3acohort studies 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3aeducation 3ainsulin 3alibraries 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3arisk factors 3ateachers1 aBowling, Andrea1 aCopeland, James1 aFokar, Ali1 aPasquale, Patricia1 aYoussef, Gretchen0 tDiabetes educator.g2011 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.95-103dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217103922463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00939naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245005700156300001200213520020900225592002800434650001600462650001100478650001900489773009700508856007100605852000900676655001200685IND60518557320221118230052.0160418e197209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855732DNAL7 a10.2307/19343222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerduin, Jacob10aCaloric Content and Available Energy in Plant Matter  ap. 982.  aCaloric content of plant matter, as indicated by bomb calorimetry, includes energy which is not available to metabolic processes of the plant.

They serve to transport endogenously synthesized lipids, mainly triglycerides (but also some cholesterol and cholesteryl esters) to peripheral tissues. VLDL is also the precursor of LDL. ApoB100 is absolutely required for VLDL assembly and secretion. The amount of VLDL triglycerides secreted by the liver depends on the amount loaded onto each lipoprotein particle, as well as the number of particles. Each VLDL has one apoB100 molecule, making apoB100 availability a key determinant of the number of VLDL particles, and hence, triglycerides, that can be secreted by hepatic cells. Surprisingly, the pool of apoB100 in the liver is typically regulated not by its level of synthesis, which is relatively constant, but by its level of degradation. It is now recognized that there are multiple opportunities for the hepatic cell to intercept apoB100 molecules and to direct them to distinct degradative processes. This mini-review will summarize progress in understanding these processes, with an emphasis on autophagy, the most recently described pathway of apoB100 degradation, and the one with possibly the most physiologic relevance to common metabolic perturbations affecting VLDL production.

The OTC adsorption process was better fitted with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The OTC adsorption process was better fitted with Redlich-Peterson model (R² > 0.99). High correlation coefficient (R² > 0.97) was also observed for Langmuir model, which showed the Qₘₐₓ of 23.43 mg g⁻¹.

The germination rates of the 23 families ranged from 38.57 to 76.50%. Seeds from the eight families germinating at the highest rates were then used for germination experiments under salt stress. Germination rate, germination potential, and germination index of these eight half-sib families decreased with increasing salt concentrations. The effects of four different hormones (6-benzylaminopurine, 6BA; gibberellin, GA₃; naphthalene acetic acid, NAA; and melatonin) at various concentrations on the germination of seeds from the eight half-sib birch families under salt stress were investigated. Treatments with 6BA and GA₃ alleviated the effects of salt stress on seed germination, whereas treatments with NAA and melatonin aggravated the effects of salt stress. The most effective treatments for alleviating the effects of salt stress on birch seed germination were 10 mg/L 6BA and 300 mg/L GA₃. This study provides practical information for screening birch families for salt tolerance at the seed germination stage, and for cultivation of birch in saline environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula subsp. mandshurica 3abenzyladenine 3agibberellic acid 3ahormones 3amelatonin 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3ascreening 3aseed germination 3aseeds1 aPei, Xiaona1 aYin, Shaopeng1 aLang, Xianbo1 aZhao, Xiyang1 aQu, Guan-Zheng0 tJournal of forestry research.g2019 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.779-787dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-018-0661-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010200168300001800270520144000288592002801728650001001756650001601766650001301782650001101795650001201806650001201818650003101830650001101861650002001872650001401892650001501906650002101921650001101942650000701953650001501960650002201975650001101997650001102008650001602019650002602035650001402061650000902075650001002084650001402094650000902108651002102117653001702138653002402155653001202179653001202191653003702203653001302240700001602253700005502269700002202324700002302346700002102369773013402390856008702524852000902611655001202620IND60610397820221119172926.0200117e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061039782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSari, Bilge10aNew xylanolytic enzyme from Geobacillus galactosidasius BS61 from a geothermal resource in Turkey  ap. 1017-1026.  aIn this study, isolation, conventional and molecular characterizations of ten thermophilic bacteria from Rize/Ayder were carried out. Xylanase from Geobacillus galactosidasius BS61 (GenBank number: KX447660) was purified by acetone precipitation, Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 chromatographies. The xylanase of G. galactosidasius BS61 in clarifying fruit juice was also investigated. Enzyme was purified 29.80-fold with 75.18% yield; and molecular weight was determined as 78.15 kDa. The optimum temperature of xylanase was 60 °C. The enzyme activity was maintained fully after 24 h and over 50% after 168 h at pH 4.0–10.0, while optimum pH was 7.0. Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ for beech wood xylan were measured as 3.18 mg mL⁻¹, 123 U mg protein⁻¹. In addition, Ca²⁺, Na⁺, Al³⁺, Zn²⁺, Cd²⁺, Mg²⁺, Ni²⁺, Cu²⁺ had decreasing effect on enzyme activity, while enzyme activity had been protected against anions, especially HSO³⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ stimulated enzyme activity. Xylanase applications (with 15 U/mL enzyme activity) in orange and pomegranate juices were increased; and the sugar and turbidity amounts were reduced 17.36% ± 1.18 and 30.52 ± 1.23, respectively. These results indicated that the xylanase of G. galactosidasius BS61 has biotechnological potential in juice clarification due to its stability against metal ions, chemicals and high pH-values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aGeobacillus 3aaluminum 3aanions 3acadmium 3acalcium 3aclarification (processing) 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3amagnesium 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3apH 3aphosphates 3apomegranate juice 3asodium 3asugars 3atemperature 3athermophilic bacteria 3aturbidity 3awood 3axylan 3axylanases 3azinc 3aTurkey (country) 0aThermophilic 0a16S rRNA sequencing 0aBOX-PCR 0aCloning 0aGeobacillus galactosidasius BS61 0aXylanase1 aFaiz, Ozlem1 aGenc, Berna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2790-95781 aSisecioglu, Melda1 aAdıgüzel, Ahmet,1 aAdiguzel, Gulsah0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Nov., v. 119 p.1017-1026dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010500168300001400273520112200287592002801409650002501437650002501462650001701487650001501504650002101519650001401540650002001554650002101574650005001595650002401645650001401669653000701683653001101690653000701701653000701708653000701715653000901722653000901731653000901740653000801749653000801757653000801765653000801773653005101781653002201832653001701854653001801871653001401889653002501903700002201928700001801950700002001968773009001988856008102078852000902159655001202168IND60544766820221118064536.0160901e20150408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinčič, Rok10aDevelopment of models for prediction of the antioxidant activity of derivatives of natural compounds  ap. 23-35.  aAntioxidants are important for maintaining the appropriate balance between oxidizing and reducing species in the body and thus preventing oxidative stress. Many natural compounds are being screened for their possible antioxidant activity. It was found that a mushroom pigment Norbadione A, which is a pulvinic acid derivative, shows an antioxidant activity; the same was found for other pulvinic acid derivatives and structurally related coumarines. Based on the results of in vitro studies performed on these compounds as a part of this study quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) predictive models were constructed using multiple linear regression, counter-propagation artificial neural networks and support vector regression (SVR). The models have been developed in accordance with current QSAR guidelines, including the assessment of the models applicability domains. A new approach for the graphical evaluation of the applicability domain for SVR models is suggested. The developed models show sufficient predictive abilities for the screening of virtual libraries for new potential antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aguidelines 3ain vitro studies 3amushrooms 3aneural networks 3aoxidative stress 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aregression analysis 3ascreening 0aAD 0aCP-ANN 0aED 0aGA 0aMD 0aMEDS 0aQSAR 0aRMSE 0aROS 0aSOM 0aSVM 0aSVR 0aQuantitative structure–activity relationship 0aPredictive models 0aAntioxidants 0aPulvinic acid 0aCoumarine 0aApplicability domain1 aKuzmanovski, Igor1 aWagner, Alain1 aNovič, Marjana0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Apr. 08, v. 868 p.23-35dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011600182520142600298592002801724650001001752650001701762650002501779650001201804650001901816650002301835650001501858650002301873650002001896650001301916650002201929650001101951650001401962650003001976650000902006650001702015650001402032653001402046653002302060653002802083653002702111700002102138700002402159700002202183700002502205700002002230700001802250773009902268856008502367852000902452655001202461IND60709537720221119024522.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.1011742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorán-Ordóñez, Alejandra10aFuture trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services in Mediterranean forests under global change scenarios  aMediterranean forests play a key role in providing services and goods to society, and are currently threatened by global change. We assessed the future provision of ecosystem services by Mediterranean pine forests under a set of management and climate change scenarios, built by combining different regional policies and climate change assumptions. We used the process-based model SORTIE-ND to simulate forest dynamics under each scenario. We coupled the outputs of SORTIE-ND with empirical and process-based models to estimate changes in harvested timber, carbon storage, mushroom yield, water provision, soil erosion mitigation and habitat for biodiversity by 2100, and assessed the trade-offs and synergies between services. Our results suggest that future provision of ecosystem services by Mediterranean forests will be more strongly determined by management policies than by climate. However, no management policy maximized the provision of all services. The continuation of the business-as-usual management would benefit some services to the detriment of water provision, but leads to higher vulnerability to extreme drought-events or wildfires. Managing for reducing forest vulnerability will balance the provision of services while reducing the risk of damage to forest functioning. We also found multiple spatial synergies between ecosystem services provision, likely driven by differences in site productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3abiodiversity 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconiferous forests 3acrop yield 3aecosystem services 3aforest dynamics 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3amushrooms 3apublic services and goods 3arisk 3asoil erosion 3awildfires 0aSORTIE-ND 0aEU-forest policies 0aMulti-functional forest 0aClimate-smart forestry1 aAmeztegui, Aitor1 aDe Cáceres, Miquel1 ade-Miguel, Sergio1 aLefèvre, François,1 aBrotons, Lluís1 aColl, Lluís,0 tEcosystem services.g2020 Oct., v. 45 p.101174-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.1011743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245017800170300001400348520130400362592002801666596005901694596005901753596005901812596005901871596007101930650001802001650002502019650001702044650001702061650003102078650002302109650001402132650001502146650001702161650001702178650000902195650001302204650001602217650001902233650002102252650002402273650001802297650002002315700001702335700001502352700001802367700001602385700001702401700001802418700001302436700001502449700001602464700001802480700001502498700001402513700005602527773012002583856008202703852000902785655001202794IND60746347820221118061829.0210731e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074634782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-021-00721-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuangfu, Liexiang10aIntegrated physiological, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses provide insights into the roles of exogenous melatonin in promoting rice seed germination under salt stress  ap. 19-31.  aMelatonin is an important phytohormone in plant development and stress responses. However, the functions of melatonin in rice salt tolerance during seed germination is largely undetermined. In this study, we investigated its potential molecular mechanism during rice seed germination under salinity through comprehensive transcriptome sequencing, metabolome profiling, and physiological assays. Transcriptome analysis revealed 4794 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after melatonin pretreatment under salinity, including 2843 upregulated and 1951 downregulated genes. Functional annotation showed that many DEGs were associated with antioxidative activity and phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction. Consistent with the transcriptome results, physiological analysis revealed enhanced activity of antioxidant capacity, increased indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) level, and reduced abscisic acid (ABA) level under melatonin pretreatment. The enhanced antioxidative activity was also supported by metabolome assay that melatonin pretreatment increased the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidant organic acids and amino acids. The results demonstrated that exogenous melatonin can enhance rice seed tolerance to salinity during germination via activating antioxidants and modulating phytohormones.  aPublisher supplied data  a32070558cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91535103cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31571608cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31601810cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBE2018325cJiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program 3aabscisic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression regulation 3aindole acetic acid 3amelatonin 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aplant growth 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aZhang, Zihui1 aZhou, Yong1 aZhang, Enying1 aChen, Rujia1 aFang, Huimin1 aLi, Pengcheng1 aXu, Yang1 aYao, Youli1 aZhu, Minyan1 aYin, Shuangyi1 aXu, Chenwu1 aLü, Yue,1 aYang, Zefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3465-85940 tPlant growth regulation.g2021 Sept., v. 95, no. 1 p.19-31dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-021-00721-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168300001600303520173700319592002802056650002502084650002302109650001402132650001002146650002202156650001602178653001602194653003002210653001802240653001402258653001302272653001502285653002702300700002102327700002002348700001902368773010402387856008402491852000902575655001202584IND60122434420221121043855.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012243442DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2013.7876852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarraya, Sana10aEffect of time of day and partial sleep deprivation on the reaction time and the attentional capacities of the handball goalkeeper  ap. 183-191.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the time of day and partial sleep deprivation on cognitive performances (i.e., attention and reaction time [RT]) of the handball goalkeeper (GK). The protocol involved 12 healthy GK volunteer males (age: 18.5 ± 1.7 years, level of experience: 8.3 ± 2.4 years, height: 1.80 ± 5.8 cm; body-mass: 79 ± 4.2 kg). They performed three cognitive tasks, i.e. the RT test, the Stroop test, and the barrage test, respectively, to evaluate the RT, the selective attention (SA), and the constant attention (CA) following the two situations of partial sleep deprivation, i.e. in the beginning (SDB) and the end (SDE) of the night, and a reference night which is a full night of habitual sleep. Resting oral temperature was measured at the beginning of each test session. Each of the three experimental conditions was separated by a 72-h period. The analysis of variance revealed a significant sleep deprivation × test-time effect on the RT, the SA, and the CA. These variables decreased significantly from morning to afternoon for all three experimental conditions. It seems that the RT is more affected by SDE than SDB (p < 0.05; −41% vs. 49% after SDE and SDB, respectively); however, SA and CA are more affected by SDB than SDE (p < 0.05; 63% vs. 47% for SA and 39% vs. 29% for CA after SDB and SDE, respectively). Furthermore, the partial sleep deprivation causes a phase advance of the core temperature. In addition, cognitive performances are not in phase with the rhythm of core temperature for all three experimental conditions. In conclusion, the partial sleep deprivation negatively affect cognitive performances in the handball goalkeeper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abiological rhythms 3acognition 3amales 3asleep deprivation 3atemperature 0atime-of-day 0apartial sleep deprivation 0areaction time 0aattention 0ahandball 0agoalkeeper 0acognitive performances1 aJarraya, Mohamed1 aChtourou, Hamdi1 aSouissi, Nizar0 tBiological rhythm research.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 45, no. 2 p.183-191dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2013.7876853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245008900176300001600265506011700281506007600398520152400474592002801998506003702026650001002063650001202073650001202085650001102097650002402108650003402132650000902166650000902175650001402184650001202198650001402210650001902224650002102243650001902264650001402283651001102297653001802308653001002326653001302336653000902349653001202358653001202370653001402382653001402396653002002410700002002430700002602450700001802476700001702494700006502511700002102576700001902597700002602616700002302642710003402665773009102699856009002790852000902880655001202889IND60582275420221207123729.0221004e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058227542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbuckle, Tye E.10aMaternal and fetal exposure to cadmium, lead, manganese and mercury: The MIREC study  ap. 270-282.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGiven the susceptibility of the fetus to toxicants, it is important to estimate their exposure. Approximately 2000 pregnant women were recruited in 2008–2011 from 10 cities across Canada. Cd, Pb, Mn and total Hg were measured in maternal blood from the 1st and 3rd trimesters, umbilical cord blood, and infant meconium. Nutrient intakes of vitamin D, iron, and calcium (Ca) were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and a dietary supplement questionnaire. Median concentrations in 1st trimester maternal blood (n = 1938) were 0.20, 8.79 and 0.70 μg/L for Cd, Mn and Hg, respectively, and 0.60 μg/dL for Pb. While the median difference between the paired 1st and 3rd trimester concentrations of Cd was 0, there was a significant decrease in Pb (0.04 μg/dL) and Hg (0.12 μg/L) and an increase in Mn (3.30 μg/L) concentrations over the course of the pregnancy. While Cd was rarely detected in cord blood (19%) or meconium (3%), median Pb (0.77 μg/dL), Mn (31.87 μg/L) and Hg (0.80 μg/L) concentrations in cord blood were significantly higher than in maternal blood. Significant negative associations were observed between estimated Ca intake and maternal Cd, Pb, Mn and Hg, as well as cord blood Pb. Vitamin D intake was associated with lower maternal Cd, Pb, and Mn as well as Pb in cord blood. Even at current metal exposure levels, increasing dietary Ca and vitamin D intake during pregnancy may be associated with lower maternal blood Pb and Cd concentrations and lower Pb in cord blood.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acities 3adietary supplements 3afood frequency questionnaires 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3atoxic substances 3aumbilical cord 3avitamin D 3aCanada 0aBiomonitoring 0aBlood 0aMeconium 0aLead 0aCadmium 0aMercury 0aManganese 0aPregnancy 0aNutrient intake1 aLiang, Chun Lei1 aMorisset, Anne-Sophie1 aFisher, Mandy1 aWeiler, Hope1 aCirtiu, Ciprian Mihai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7360-568X1 aLegrand, Melissa1 aDavis, Karelyn1 aEttinger, Adrienne S.1 aFraser, William D.2 athe MIREC Study Groupeauthor0 tChemosphere.g2016 Nov., v. 163 p.270-282dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245013300166300001600299520196600315592002802281650001102309650002302320650001802343650001902361650002802380650002102408650001302429650002902442650001102471650001402482650002002496650001402516650004002530650000802570650002302578650001702601650001902618650001302637650002102650650001602671650001002687700002502697700002002722700002402742773011302766856008002879852000902959655001202968IND60624995520221119090356.0181206e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062499552DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217114119302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, M.

Diabetes educators have expertise in diabetes self-management education; however, they are generally not prepared for delivery of chronic disease primary prevention. The purpose of this project was to determine if individuals at risk for diabetes who participate in an intervention delivered by trained diabetes educators in existing diabetes self-management education community-based programs can reduce risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Methods Diabetes educators in 3 outpatient-hospital programs (urban, suburban, and rural) received training and support for implementation of the Group Lifestyle Balance program, an adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention, from the Diabetes Prevention Support Center of the University of Pittsburgh. Adults with prediabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome were eligible to enroll in the program with physician referral. With use of existing diabetes educator networks, recruitment was completed via on-site physician in-services, informative letters, and e-mail contact as well as participant-directed newspaper advertisement. Results Eighty-one participants enrolled in the study (71 women, 10 men). Mean overall weight loss was 11.3 lb (5.1%, P < .001); in addition, significant decreases were noted in fasting plasma glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. Conclusions These results suggest that the Group Lifestyle Balance program delivered by diabetes educators was successful in reducing risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in high-risk individuals. Furthermore, diabetes educators, already integrated within the existing health care system, provide yet another resource for delivery of primary prevention programs in the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aat-risk population 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3adiabetes 3adisease control programs 3ae-mail 3aeducation 3ahealth services 3alifestyle 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3ateachers 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight loss 3awomen1 aMcWilliams, Janis R.1 aChen, Hsiang-Yu1 aSiminerio, Linda M.0 tDiabetes educator.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 5 p.659-668dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217114119303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100003100191245017800222300001600400506007600416520148700492592002801979506003702007650001802044650001602062650002302078650001902101650002902120650002102149650001002170650002802180650000902208650004802217650002502265650003402290650001902324700002202343700002502365700002102390700001902411700002602430773010402456856008402560852000902644655001202653IND60090001720221207091858.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.02.0072doi7 aPMC33404352pmcid7 a223704492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubbaiah, Papasani Venkata10aRegulation of plasma cholesterol esterification by sphingomyelin: Effect of physiological variations of plasma sphingomyelin on lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity  ap. 908-913.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant phospholipid in the plasma, next to phosphatidylcholine (PC), its physiological function in plasma is unclear. Here we employed plasma from various genetic models of mice which naturally differ in their plasma SM/PC ratios, to study the role of SM as a modulator of LCAT, the enzyme responsible for HDL maturation and the synthesis of cholesteryl esters (CE) in normal plasma. Serine palmitoyltransferase deficient mice, and SM synthase deficient mice, both of which have below normal SM/PC ratios, showed significantly elevated LCAT activities when assayed with the endogenous substrates. On the other hand, LDL receptor knockout mice, and apo E knockout mice, both of which have high SM/PC ratios, had markedly reduced (−80%) LCAT activities. The LCAT levels in plasma, as assayed with an exogenous substrate, were similar in all groups, except for a 45% decrease in apo E knockout mice. Plasma samples with high SM/PC ratios had lower percentage of 20:4, 22:5, and 22:6 CE all of which are formed by LCAT, and a higher percentage of the atherogenic 18:1 CE which is mainly derived from the action of liver ACAT, showing that in vivo, the contribution of LCAT to plasma CE is reduced while that of liver ACAT is increased. These results show that SM is a physiological modulator of LCAT activity as well as plasma CE composition, and this may contribute to the previously reported pro-atherogenic effect of high plasma SM levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3acholesterol 3acholesteryl esters 3aesterification 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aknockout mutants 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3amice 3aphosphatidylcholine-choline acyltransferase 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aserine C-palmitoyltransferase 3asphingomyelins1 aJiang, Xian-Cheng1 aBelikova, Natalia A.1 aAizezi, Buzulagu1 aHuang, Zhi Hua1 aReardon, Catherine A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 June, v. 1821, no. 6 p.908-913dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009200163300001400255520130400269592002801573650002901601650001201630650002201642650001201664650001001676650002201686650001501708650002701723650001301750650001401763650002401777651001601801651001601817653001401833653001401847653002001861653001701881700001601898773011101914856008202025852000902107655001202116IND60549242220221120142921.0160907e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054924222DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-02-11-00552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProspero, S.10aInvasion Genetics of the Chestnut Blight Fungus Cryphonectria parasitica in Switzerland  ap. 73-82.  aCryphonectria parasitica is the best-known example of an invasive forest pathogen in Europe. In southern Switzerland, chestnut blight was first reported in 1948 whereas, north of the Alps, it did not appear until the 1980s. Between 1995 and 2008, we sampled 640 C. parasitica isolates from nine populations south of the Alps and nine north of the Alps. Twelve historical isolates, collected between 1950 and 1972 in the south, were obtained from our collection. All 652 isolates were screened at 10 microsatellite loci to test for the existence of divergent genetic pools and to infer possible origins of haplotypes. In total, 52 haplotypes were identified. Structure software analysis indicated that 43 haplotypes (including all historical haplotypes) belonged to a main cluster, 6 haplotypes belonged to a different cluster, and 3 haplotypes had an intermediate allele pattern. All newly founded populations in northern Switzerland were initiated by one or just a few haplotypes from the main cluster, which probably came directly from the populations south of the Alps. Subsequently, genetic diversity increased through mutations, sexual reproduction, or new migrations. The highest increase in diversity was observed in populations where haplotypes from different genetic pools were encountered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3aalleles 3acomputer software 3aforests 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutation 3apathogens 3asexual reproduction 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland 0aadmixture 0aclonality 0afungal pathogen 0aintroduction1 aRigling, D.0 tPhytopathology.g2012 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.73-82dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-02-11-00553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245008200181300001600263500000900279520110500288592002801393650003801421650002201459650001401481650002101495650002401516650001801540650001101558650001901569650001501588650001401603650002201617650002301639650001201662700001601674700001901690773012101709856009701830852000901927655001201936IND60663395720221119161428.0191122e197905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066339572DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1979.00021962007100030030x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaskins, F.

Moench] has been questioned. In this study, first leaves of chamber-grown seedlings were compared with young leaves of field-grown tillers by means of the spectrophotometric assay of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde as an indicator of HCN-p. Absorption spectra of seedling and tiller leaf extracts indicated that the spectrophotometric method was more reliable with the seedling extracts. However, highly significant correlation coefficients were obtained in most comparisons of seedling HCN-p and tiller HCN-p. The r values varied greatly, depending to a considerable extent on whether the calculations were based on individual plant values, plot means, or cultivar means. With plot or cultivar means as the basis of calculation, r values in the range of 0.8 to 0.9 were not uncommon. It was concluded that assay of young seedlings with this method is useful in sudangrass [S. sudunense (Piper) Stapf] and sorghum breeding programs in which decreased HCN-p is an objective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3ahydrogen cyanide 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3aplant breeding 3aprediction 3aseedlings 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrophotometers 3atillers1 aGorz, H.

However, whereas only the α-position isoprene subunit is saturated in eukaryal dolichol phosphate, both the α- and ω-position isoprene subunits are reduced in the archaeal lipid. The agents responsible for dolichol phosphate saturation remain largely unknown. The present study sought to identify dolichol phosphate reductases in the halophilic archaeon, Haloferax volcanii. Homology-based searches recognize HVO_1799 as a geranylgeranyl reductase. Mass spectrometry revealed that cells deleted of HVO_1799 fail to fully reduce the isoprene chains of H. volcanii membrane phospholipids and glycolipids. Likewise, the absence of HVO_1799 led to a loss of saturation of the ω-position isoprene subunit of C₅₅ and C₆₀ dolichol phosphate, with the effect of HVO_1799 deletion being more pronounced with C₆₀ dolichol phosphate than with C₅₅ dolichol phosphate. Glycosylation of dolichol phosphate in the deletion strain occurred preferentially on that version of the lipid saturated at both the α- and ω-position isoprene subunits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHaloferax volcanii 3aglycolipids 3aglycosylation 3aisoprene 3amass spectrometry 3aoligosaccharides 3aphosphates 3aphospholipids1 aGuan, Ziqiang1 aEichler, Jerry0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 June, v. 1821, no. 6 p.923-933dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011500168500001400283520213200297592002802429650001302457650001102470650001202481650001902493650001902512650001602531650001302547650001502560650001402575650001602589650001602605650001302621650002302634650002202657650002302679650001602702650002502718650001202743653001402755653002402769653002502793773010902818856008302927852000903010655001203019IND60709538020221119024622.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wace.2020.1002782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Simon J.10aFuture changes in heatwave severity, duration and frequency due to climate change for the most populous cities  aNAL-light  aA novel approach to quantify the present and future heatwave hazard is presented which can discern characteristics beyond what can be achieved from current approaches, such as distributions of severity, duration and frequency, including very low probability events that may not have been seen. A statistical model is built that represents the seasonal cycle, climate change, magnitude and temporal behaviour of all temperatures above a moderately high time varying threshold at a site from which very large samples of temperature time series can be drawn. From these, user defined heatwaves can be extracted and precise empirical statistics calculated, allowing application to a wide range of problems such as heatwave impact on the pollination of food crops. Fitting the heatwave model to climate model simulations allows the changing severity, duration and frequency of heatwaves from the past to the future to be quantified. This approach is validated by reproducing the heatwave climatology of a pre-industrial 3 500 year GCM control run from a 110 year future emission run of the same GCM. Using this methodology, future heatwave changes for the most populous cities from 20 countries are derived from a 44 member ensemble of 28 GCMs from the CMIP5 archive forced with the RCP 8.5 emission scenario. Compared to 2006, absolute temperatures of 4–10 day long heatwaves are projected to be between 3.4 to 6.6 °C hotter in 2099, though the magnitude of the increases are independent of heatwave rarity and duration. For 13 of the cities no significant future changes in the distribution of durations are found relative to a contemporaneous threshold. Six cities show future heatwaves will have a tendency to be longer and one to be shorter. Half of the cities show increases in severity, the time integrated temperature anomalies above the contemporaneous threshold. The largest changes are found for Paris with 100 year return level severity changes equivalent to mean heatwave temperatures increasing by 3.4 °C or by 1.7 °C for 5 and 10 day heatwaves respectively, and the rate of 10 day heatwaves increasing by 130%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3acities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3aduration 3afood crops 3afrequency 3apollination 3aprobability 3asampling 3aseasonal variation 3asimulation models 3astatistical models 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aweather 0aHeatwaves 0aExtremal dependence 0aTime-series extremes0 tWeather and climate extremes.g2020 Dec., v. 30 p.100278-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23331x2212-09477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2020.1002783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245006300212300001800275506007600293520159900369592002801968506003701996650001102033650001702044650002202061650002902083650001102112650002202123650001002145650002802155650002202183650000902205650003002214650001802244650001502262650002102277650001202298700002102310700002702331700002402358700001702382773010602399856008402505852000902589655001202598IND60090002120221207081903.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.03.0062doi7 aPMC34604142pmcid7 a230754522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiederer, Monika10aImpact of endothelial lipase on cellular lipid composition  ap. 1003-1011.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUsing mass spectrometry (MS), we examined the impact of endothelial lipase (EL) overexpression on the cellular phospholipid (PL) and triglyceride (TG) content of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and of mouse plasma and liver tissue. In HAEC incubated with the major EL substrate, HDL, adenovirus (Ad)-mediated EL overexpression resulted in the generation of various lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) species in cell culture supernatants. While the cellular phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content remained unaltered, cellular phosphatidylcholine (PC)-, LPC- and TG-contents were significantly increased upon EL overexpression. Importantly, cellular lipid composition was not altered when EL was overexpressed in the absence of HDL. [¹⁴C]-LPC accumulated in EL overexpressing, but not LacZ-control cells, incubated with [¹⁴C]-PC labeled HDL, indicating EL-mediated LPC supply. Exogenously added [¹⁴C]-LPC accumulated in HAEC as well. Its conversion to [¹⁴C]-PC was sensitive to a lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) inhibitor, thimerosal. Incorporation of [³H]-Choline into cellular PC was 56% lower in EL compared with LacZ cells, indicating decreased endogenous PC synthesis. In mice, adenovirus mediated EL overexpression decreased plasma PC, PE and LPC and increased liver LPC, LPE and TG content. Based on our results, we conclude that EL not only supplies cells with FFA as found previously, but also with HDL-derived LPC and LPE species resulting in increased cellular TG and PC content as well as decreased endogenous PC synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3acell culture 3aendothelial cells 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahumans 3alipid composition 3aliver 3alysophosphatidylcholine 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aradionuclides 3athimerosal 3atriacylglycerols 3atritium1 aKöfeler, Harald1 aLechleitner, Margarete1 aTritscher, Michaela1 aFrank, Saša0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 July, v. 1821, no. 7 p.1003-1011dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011600160300001600276520156000292592002801852650002401880650003601904650002601940650002101966650001301987650002102000650001102021650001302032650003202045650001602077650001602093650001002109650001802119651001002137700001902147700001702166700001902183700001702202773013402219856008102353852000902434655001202443IND60638271320221118232609.0190427e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063827132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-018-0680-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Bo10aInfluence of genotypes and environmental factors on leaf triterpenoid content and growth of Cyclocarya paliurus  ap. 789-798.  aCyclocarya paliurus, an economically valuable tree species, has traditionally been used as a nutraceutical food or medicine in China. However, limited information is available on its genotype selection and cultivation under a wide range of environmental conditions for growth and targeted health-promoting substances. We studied the effects of genotype and environment, and their interaction on leaf triterpenoid content and tree growth for 12 genotypes of C. paliurus grown at four sites. We quantified the correlation between leaf triterpenoid accumulation and tree growth. The contents of cyclocaric acid B, cyclocarioside I, and arjunolic acid ranged from 0.06 to 3.89, 0 to 3.71, and 0.65 to 8.86 mg g⁻¹, respectively. Three individual triterpenoids were primarily influenced by genotype (variation ranged from 53.7 to 68.0%), while environment accounted for most of the variation in total triterpenoid content and tree growth (71.3–89.5%). Most tested environmental parameters were significantly correlated to total triterpenoid content, but not to the contents of the individual triterpenoids measured. Growth in tree height and diameter at breast height were significantly negatively correlated with total triterpenoid content but were non-significantly correlated with individual triterpenoid contents. We conclude that genotypic selection, manipulation of environmental conditions, and implementation of appropriate silvicultural operations would be important strategies for increasing the accumulation of health-promoting phytochemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyclocarya paliurus 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenvironmental factors 3afunctional foods 3agenotype 3ahealth promotion 3aleaves 3amedicine 3atree and stand measurements 3atree growth 3atree height 3atrees 3atriterpenoids 3aChina1 aFang, Shengzuo1 aShang, Xulan1 aFu, Xiangxiang1 aYang, Wanxia0 tJournal of forestry research.g2019 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.789-798dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-018-0680-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011200170520111200282592002801394650002101422650002601443650002901469650001301498650001801511650001101529650002501540650001601565650001301581650001901594650000701613650001601620650000901636650001601645653001601661653002101677653001701698653002101715653002701736700001601763700001801779700001901797700001401816700001301830700001601843773010601859856008701965852000902052655001202061IND60698606520221122045602.0200824e20201005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069860652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1251452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xinpeng10aSuperhydrophobic and antibacterial wood enabled by polydopamine-assisted decoration of copper nanoparticles  aWood veneer had been widely used in interior decoration or fitment, but its application was still limited due to deformation after absorbing water and bacterial erosion.

The water contact angle and sliding angle of obtained Cu coating reached 155.7° and 4°, respectively. Meanwhile, the as-prepared coating showed resistance to acid or base solutions with different pH values, different temperatures aging and mechanical damages, and also displayed a good self-cleaning ability. In addition, the modified wood exhibited outstanding antibacterial activities towards Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

In this article, we examine the underlying complexity of assumptions made in raceway experiments and we propose a statistical inference procedure tailored to this type of experimental protocol. As an example, experiments were performed to test if light of two different intensities affects the proximal behaviour (i.e. direct, local and immediate) of two species of crustaceans, the hermit crab (Pagurus bernhardus), and the green crab (Carcinus maenas). Individuals were collected in the vicinity of the Sven Loven Marine Center in Tjarnö (Sweden). Their movements in raceways were recorded and the statistical distance between the resulting experimental distribution and a simulated null distribution was used to compare their behaviour in two situations: dim (when they were expected to feed) and bright light (when they were expected to shelter). Initial tests indicated no differences of behaviour between dim and bright light for the two species. However, when compared with the reference state (here, a null distribution) the behaviour in dim light deviates significantly from the null distribution suggesting non-random behaviour. Our results suggest that efforts should be made to understand the behaviours of the individuals of these two species to establish a comprehensive reference state as a basis for comparison. This fundamental information should be a prerequisite before implementing experiments testing how potential disturbances affect individual organisms in behavioural ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrab individual behaviours 0alight pollution 0amicrocosms 0aprobability 0anull distribution1 aCoston-Guarini, Jennifer1 aDeprez, Tim1 aChauvaud, Laurent0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2019 Feb., v. 99, no. 1 p.1-7dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154170017833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014600166300001300312520135100325592002801676653002301704653001801727653003201745653001901777653001801796700002301814700002501837700002401862773016401886856008102050852000902131655001202140IND60651146120221119173022.0190711e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065114612DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154170017952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Fred B.10aAre biochemical composition parameters of sediment good tools for assessing the environmental quality of estuarine areas in tropical systems?  ap. 9-18.  aThe present study aims to assess the environmental quality of six estuaries in north-eastern Brazil, using biochemical composition and quantity of organic matter in tropical sediments. Samples were collected monthly during spring low tide from August 2011 to July 2012, in the mid-littoral. Concentrations of organic matter and its biochemical composition reflected the degree of anthropogenic pressure. Although total concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates were similar among estuaries with contrasting levels of anthropogenic pressure, the protein to carbohydrates (PRT : CHO) ratio effectively reflected the trophic state of these areas. PRT : CHO ratios >1 were observed in all studied areas suggesting eutrophic conditions or an initial stage of eutrophication in all of them. Low Chl-a/Phaeo ratios may be associated with the level of eutrophication of each area, however it may also reflect the natural productivity or the presence of mangrove debris. These results were compared with those obtained in previous environmental assessments of the same estuarine areas using the AZTI Marine Biotic Index and monitoring reports showing good agreement. The present study confirmed for the first time in tropical estuarine areas that the biochemical approach can be successfully used to assess the trophic state of the benthic compartment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMangrove sediments 0atrophic state 0aprotein/carbohydrates ratio 0aeutrophication 0aphytopigments1 aSilva, Janilson F.1 aBezerra, Ranilson S.1 aSantos, Paulo J.

This study proposes a cost-effective, rapid, and sensitive method for determining RNA integrity based on capillary electrophoresis that utilizes a cyan light-emitted diode-induced fluorescence as a separation tool. The capillary was initially coated with 0.1% Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (Mₐᵥₑ 1,300,000Da) to reduce electroosmotic flow and avoid RNA adsorption. When the capillary was filled with 0.4% poly(ethylene) oxide (Mₐᵥₑ 4,000,000) and a nucleic acid-specific fluorescent dye, SYTO 9, the baseline separation of the 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) in total RNA was accomplished within 15min. The lowest detectable concentration for the 18S and 28S rRNAs was estimated to be 50pg/μL. Some peaks longer than the 28S rRNA that migrated slowly were observed as long as the initial total RNA concentration was optimized. The temperature-induced degradation of the large RNA fragments (longer than the 28S rRNA) was faster than that of 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA. These large RNA fragments may serve as a promising marker for testing RNA integrity compared to the traditional method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3acost effectiveness 3afluorescence 3aribosomal RNA1 aZhang, Boling,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 May 25, v. 1239 p.78-84dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04189naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245024800168300001400416520216300430592002802593650002502621650001202646650001502658650001602673650001402689650002202703650001802725650001802743650001102761650001902772650003402791650001702825650002102842650002202863650002502885650001702910650001302927650002002940650002602960650002002986650001603006653002003022653003203042653001703074653002203091653006303113653002203176700002403198700001903222700005603241700002103297700002603318700002003344700001903364773009003383856008103473852000903554655001203563IND60544767420221118064549.0160901e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiménez, Estela10aQuantitative analysis of N-glycans from human alfa-acid-glycoprotein using stable isotope labeling and zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction capillary liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry as tool for pancreatic disease diagnosis  ap. 59-68.  aIn this work we demonstrate the potential of glycan reductive isotope labeling (GRIL) using [12C]- and [13C]-coded aniline and zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction capillary liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (μZIC-HILIC-ESI-MS) for relative quantitation of glycosylation variants in selected glycoproteins present in samples from cancer patients. Human α1-acid-glycoprotein (hAGP) is an acute phase serum glycoprotein whose glycosylation has been described to be altered in cancer and chronic inflammation. However, it is not clear yet whether some particular glycans in hAGP can be used as biomarker for differentiating between these two pathologies. In this work, hAGP was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) from serum samples of healthy individuals and from those suffering chronic pancreatitis and different stages of pancreatic cancer, respectively. After de-N-glycosylation, relative quantitation of the hAGP glycans was carried out using stable isotope labeling and μZIC-HILIC-ESI-MS analysis. First, protein denaturing conditions prior to PNGase F digestion were optimized to achieve quantitative digestion yields, and the reproducibility of the established methodology was evaluated with standard hAGP. Then, the proposed method was applied to the analysis of the clinical samples (control vs. pathological). Pancreatic cancer samples clearly showed an increase in the abundance of fucosylated glycans as the stage of the disease increases and this was unlike to samples from chronic pancreatitis. The results gained here indicate the mentioned glycan in hAGP as a candidate structure worth to be corroborated by an extended study including more clinical cases; especially those with chronic pancreatitis and initial stages of pancreatic cancer. Importantly, the results demonstrate that the presented methodology combining an enrichment of a target protein by IAC with isotope coded relative quantitation of N-glycans can be successfully used for targeted glycomics studies. The methodology is assumed being suitable as well for other such studies aimed at finding novel cancer associated glycoprotein biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaniline 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adigestion 3adisease diagnosis 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3ainflammation 3aisotope labeling 3amass spectrometry 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apancreatitis 3apatients 3apolysaccharides 3aquantitative analysis 3astable isotopes 3azwitterions 0aGlycan analysis 0aHuman α1-acid-glycoprotein 0aPancreatitis 0aPancreatic cancer 0aZwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry1 aBalmaña, Meritxell1 aFigueras, Joan1 aFort, Esther1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9584-12101 aBolós, Carme de1 aSanz-Nebot, Victòria1 aPeracaula, Rosa1 aRizzi, Andreas0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Mar. 25, v. 866 p.59-68dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245009800188300001800286520096300304592002801267650002801295650001301323650001501336650001201351650001001363650001501373650002601388650002901414650002701443650001201470650001501482650004201497650001101539650003101550650000901581650003001590650001701620650003601637653002401673653002301697653002101720653002401741653002401765700002501789773012101814856008701935852000902022655001202031IND60112352720221117015638.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011235272DNAL7 a239329642pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Imroze10aMale Drosophila melanogaster show adaptive mating bias in response to female infection status  ap. 1017-1023.  aGiven the non-trivial cost of reproduction for males and substantial variation in female quality, males have been predicted to show mating bias as an evolved strategy. Using a large outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster, we test this prediction and show that males may adaptively bias their mating effort in response to the infection status of females. Given a simultaneous choice between females infected with pathogenic bacteria and sham infected females, males preferentially mated with the latter, who had a higher reproductive output compared to infected females. This may provide evidence for pre-copulatory male mate choice. Assessment of the reproductive behaviour ensured that the observed pattern of mating bias was not due to differences in receptivity between females infected with pathogenic bacteria and sham infected females. Further, there was no evidence for post-copulatory male mate choice measured in terms of copulation duration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abacteria 3acopulation 3afemales 3amales 3aprediction 3areproductive behavior 3areproductive performance 2aAdaptation, Biological 2aAnimals 2aCopulation 2aDrosophila melanogasterxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aMale 2aMating Preference, Animal 2aReproduction 2aSerratia marcescensxphysiology 0aCopulation duration 0aFemale receptivity 0aMale mate choice 0aReproductive output 0aSerratia marcescens1 aPrasad, Nagaraj Guru0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2013 Oct., v. 59, no. 10 p.1017-1023dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04054naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245017400160300001600334520230700350592002802657650002302685650002602708650001802734650002602752650003802778650002202816650001102838650002602849650001802875650002002893650002002913650001602933650004302949650001502992650005203007650001503059650001103074650001003085650001203095650001903107651001503126651001003141653001903151653003503170700001803205700001503223700001803238700001503256773011303271856008203384961001303466852000903479655001203488IND60549242820221120121825.0160907e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054924282DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-05-11-01392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidal, E.10aCalculation of Diagnostic Parameters of Advanced Serological and Molecular Tissue-Print Methods for Detection of Citrus tristeza virus: A Model for Other Plant Pathogens  ap. 114-121.  aCitrus tristeza virus (CTV) is one of the most important virus diseases that affect citrus. Control of CTV is achieved by grafting selected virus-free citrus scions onto CTV-tolerant or -resistant rootstocks. Quarantine and certification programs are essential for avoiding the entry and propagation of severe strains of CTV. Citrus nurseries in Spain and central California (United States) maintain zero-tolerance policies for CTV that require sensitive, specific, and reliable pathogen-detection methods. Tissue-print (TP) real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was compared with the validated TP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using the CTV-specific monoclonal antibodies 3DF1 and 3CA5, for CTV detection. In total, 1,395 samples from healthy and CTV-infected nursery and mature tree plants were analyzed with both methods. The total agreement between both detection methods was substantial (Cohen's kappa index of 0.77 ± 0.03). The diagnostic parameters of each technique (i.e., the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios) were evaluated in a second test involving 658 Citrus macrophylla nursery plants. Mexican lime indexing was used to evaluate samples with discrepant results in the analysis. For TP-ELISA, a sensitivity of 0.8015, a specificity of 0.9963, and a positive and negative likelihood ratio of 216.42 and 0.199, respectively, were estimated. For TP real-time RT-PCR, a sensitivity of 0.9820, a specificity of 0.8519, and a positive and negative likelihood ratio of 6.63 and 0.021, respectively, were estimated. These diagnostic parameters show that TP real-time RT-PCR was the most sensitive technique, whereas TP-ELISA showed the highest specificity, validating the use of the molecular technique for routine CTV-detection purposes. In addition, our results show that the combination of both techniques can accurately substitute for the conventional biological Mexican lime index for the detection of CTV. The calculation of diagnostic parameters is discussed, as a necessary tool, to validate detection or diagnostic methods in plant pathology. Furthermore, assessment of the post-test probability of disease after a diagnostic result and CTV prevalence allows selection of the best method for accurate and reliable diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus macrophylla 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3acertification 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anursery crops 3aplant pathogens 3aplant pathology 3aprobability 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arootstocks 3ascions 3atrees 3aviruses 3azero tolerance 3aCalifornia 3aSpain 0aBayes' theorem 0adirect tissue blot immunoassay1 aYokomi, R.

For example, the seminal protein sex peptide (SP) causes females to lay more eggs, reduce receptivity to re-mating, consume more food and produce more concentrated excreta upon mating. It has been reported that SP indirectly increases food consumption as a result of its stimulation of egg production, but its role in producing more concentrated excreta in the mated female was reported to be independent of egg production. Additionally, it has been shown that SP’s effect on food consumption persists for several days after mating, while it is unknown whether this is true for its effect on excretion.SP can have both transient and long-term effects on mated females; the latter occur because of the peptide’s binding to, and slow release from, sperm in the female. Here we used timed measures of excretion by female flies that had mated to males mutant in SP or in its regulators, to test the duration of SP’s effect on excretion. We found that SP’s effect on excretion persists for at least ∼1week after mating, and that this persistence requires that SP bind to and be released from sperm. Although these binding/release requirements of SP are similar to those for increased egg production (and consequent increased food intake) following mating, we find that the long-term change in excretion phenotype is only partially dependent on the presence of eggs in the female. Our data indicate that a change in intestinal transit is part of the long-term post-mating response elicited by the gradual release of sperm-bound SP in the female after mating, even though it is not fully dependent on other long-term responses elicited by SP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abehavior change 3aegg production 3aeggs 3aexcreta 3aexcretion 3afemales 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3along term effects 3amales 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aCopulation 2aDrosophila Proteinsxphysiology 2aDrosophila melanogasterxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Transit 2aMale 2aOviparity 2aPeptidesxphysiology 2aSeminal Plasma Proteinsxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 0aDrosophila melanogaster 0aFeeding 0aExcretion 0aPost-mating response 0aSperm 0aSex peptide1 aWolfner, Mariana F.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2013 Oct., v. 59, no. 10 p.1024-1030dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245010300170300001600273520155900289592002801848650001001876650001801886650001901904650001301923650001401936650001201950650001501962650001701977650001001994650001402004650001502018650001302033650001802046650001902064650001002083650001302093650001202106651001102118700002602129700001902155700002802174700002102202773011202223856008002335852000902415655001202424IND60624996020221120043712.0181206e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062499602DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217114277872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHortensius, Johanna10aSelf-Monitoring of Blood GlucosebProfessional Advice and Daily Practice of Patients With Diabetes  ap. 101-107.  aPurpose This study investigated the advice given by diabetes educators in Europe, and the daily practice of Dutch patients with diabetes regarding the use of the first or second drop of blood and other aspects concerning self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Method During a diabetes conference in 2009, 96 European diabetes educators (including 46 Dutch educators) completed a single-item questionnaire about the use of the first or second drop of blood for glucose monitoring. A self-reported questionnaire with 20 questions about performing SMBG was filled out by 111 patients from an outpatient diabetes clinic of a Dutch hospital. Results Patients were advised to wash their hands with water and soap and use the first drop of blood by 89% of the Dutch and 72% of other European diabetes educators, while 58% of the patients reported to do this. When the patient cannot wash the hands, 85% of the Dutch and 52% of the other European educators advised to use the second drop of blood, while 26% of the patients reported always using the first drop without washing hands. Always using the side of the fingertip and using the lancet once, as advised in guidelines, was reported by only 41% and 55% of the patients, respectively. Conclusions There is no general agreement between professionals regarding the advice on aspects concerning SMBG. Patients also reported different acts in daily practice. Developing uniform international SMBG guidelines, education, and repeated evaluation of the process of collecting an accurate blood sample are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3ablood sampling 3adiabetes 3aeducation 3aglucose 3aguidelines 3ahand washing 3ahands 3ahospitals 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aprofessionals 3aquestionnaires 3asoaps 3ateachers 3awashing 3aEurope1 avan der Bijl, Jaap J.1 aKleefstra, N.,1 aHouweling, Sebatiaan T.1 aBilo, Henk J.

The objectives of this work were to describe validated in-season sensor-based algorithms presently being used in cereal grain production systems for improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and cereal grain yields. A review of research programs in the central Great Plains that have developed sensor-based N recommendations for cereal crops was performed. Algorithms included multiple land-grant university, government, and industry programs. A common thread in this review is the use of active sensors, particularly those using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for quantifying differences in fertilized and non-fertilized areas, within a specific cropping season. In-season prediction of yield potential over different sites and years is possible using NDVI, planting date, sensing date, cumulative growing degree days (GDD), and rainfall. Other in-season environment-specific inputs have also been used. Early passive sensors have advanced to by-plant N fertilization using active NDVI and by-plant statistical properties. Most recently, sensor-based algorithm research has focused on the development of generalized mathematical models for determining optimal crop N application. The development and promotion of fee-based modeling approaches for nutrient management continues. Nonetheless, several algorithms using active sensors for in-season N management are available from state and government sources at no cost and that have been extensively field tested and can be modified by producers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLand Grant universities 3aalgorithms 3adecision making 3afertilizer application 3agrain crops 3agrain yield 3agrains 3aheat sums 3aindustry 3amathematical models 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3anutrient management 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplanting date 3aprediction 3aproduction technology 3arain 3aresearch programs 3aGreat Plains region1 aKitchen, Newell1 aHolland, Kyle1 aSchepers, James1 aRaun, William0 tAgronomy journal.g2016 Sept., v. 108, no. 5 p.1775-1781dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2016.01.00413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245016300215300001600378506007600394520128500470592002801755506003701783650000801820650001501828650001401843650001401857650002501871650001701896650003101913650001001944650001101954650001501965650002601980650001402006650001902020650001702039650002602056700002102082700002102103700001402124700002002138700003302158773010402191856008402295852000902379655001202388IND60090002720221207091416.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.02.0022doi7 aPMC36143472pmcid7 a223492662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaynes, Teka-Ann S.10aDNA damage induces down-regulation of UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase, increases ceramide levels and triggers apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells  ap. 943-953.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA damaging agents typically induce an apoptotic cascade in which p53 plays a central role. However, absence of a p53-mediated response does not necessarily abrogate programmed cell death, due to the existence of p53-independent apoptotic pathways, such as those mediated by the pro-apoptotic molecule ceramide. We compared ceramide levels before and after DNA damage in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) and colon cancer (HCT116) cells that were either expressing or deficient in p53. When treated with mitomycin C, p53-deficient cells, but not p53-expressing cells, showed a marked increase in ceramide levels. Microarray analysis of genes involved in ceramide metabolism identified acid ceramidase (ASAH1, up-regulated), ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG, down-regulated), and galactosylceramidase (GALC, up-regulated) as the three genes most affected. Experiments employing pharmacological and siRNA agents revealed that inhibition of UGCG is sufficient to increase ceramide levels and induce cell death. When inhibition of UGCG and treatment with mitomycin C were combined, p53-deficient, but not p53-expressing cells, showed a significant increase in cell death, suggesting that the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism could be used to sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aapoptosis 3aceramides 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adrug therapy 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3amitomycin 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteosarcoma 3asmall interfering RNA1 aFilippov, Valery1 aFilippova, Maria1 aYang, Jun1 aZhang, Kangling1 aDuerksen-Hughes, Penelope J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 July, v. 1821, no. 7 p.943-953dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012000167300001600287520158600303592002801889650002501917650001501942650002001957650001601977650001301993650002602006650001502032650003102047650002802078650001702106650002402123650002602147650002602173650003002199700001502229700001702244700001402261700001402275700001602289700001602305700001602321773010402337856008402441852000902525655001202534IND60090002820221120152327.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Shutong10aMinimally modified low-density lipoprotein induces macrophage endoplasmic reticulum stress via toll-like receptor 4  ap. 954-963.  aMinimally modified low-density lipoprotein (mm-LDL) induces intimal foam cell formation, which is promoted by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), a cross-point to link cellular processes with multiple risk factors that exist in all stages of atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear whether mm-LDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophages involves ERS and its underlying mechanisms. We showed that mm-LDL induced the accumulation of lipid droplets in RAW264.7 macrophages with increased free cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum, which was markedly attenuated by pretreatment with an antibody against toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Additionally, mm-LDL stimulated the transport of Cy3-labeled activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key sensor to the unfolded protein response (UPR), from cytoplasm into nucleus. The expression of phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (p-IRE1), another sensor to the UPR, and its two downstream molecules, X box binding protein 1 and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), were significantly upregulated by mm-LDL. The alterations induced by mm-LDL were all significantly inhibited by antibodies against TLR4 or CD36. In addition, the upregulation of p-IRE1 and GRP78 and the nuclear translocation of ATF6 induced by mm-LDL were significantly attenuated by TLR4 siRNA. These results suggest that mm-LDL may induce free cholesterol accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently stimulate ERS and activate the UPR signaling pathway mediated by ATF6 and IRE1 in macrophages, a process that is potentially mediated by TLR4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aantibodies 3aatherosclerosis 3acholesterol 3adroplets 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afoam cells 3agene expression regulation 3alow density lipoprotein 3arisk factors 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factors 3aunfolded protein response1 aYang, Nana1 aSong, Guohua1 aSang, Hui1 aTian, Hua1 aMiao, Cheng1 aZhang, Ying1 aQin, Shucun0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 July, v. 1821, no. 7 p.954-963dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245017900164300001400343520145100357592002801808650002601836650002301862650001901885650002001904650004101924650001901965650001601984650003302000650002702033700001402060700001502074700001802089700001802107700001602125773009302141856008402234852000902318655001202327IND60112967020221116201304.0141111e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qin10aDispersive microextraction based on water-coated Fe₃O₄ followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry for determination of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol in edible oils  ap. 45-51.  aIn the present work, we developed a novel dispersive microextraction technique by combining the advantages of liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) and magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE). In this method, trace amount of water directly absorbed on bare Fe₃O₄ to form water-coated Fe₃O₄ (W-Fe₃O₄) and rapid extraction can be achieved while W-Fe₃O₄ dispersed in the sample solution. The analyte adsorbed W-Fe₃O₄ can be easily collected and isolated from sample solution by application of a magnet. It was worth noting that in the proposed method water was used as extractant and Fe₃O₄ served as the supporter and retriever of water. The performance of the method was evaluated by extraction of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) from edible oils. The extracted 3-MCPD was then derived by a silylanization reagent (1-trimethylsilylimidazole) before gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Several parameters that affected the extraction and derivatization efficiency were investigated. Our results showed that the limit of detection for 3-MCPD was 1.1ng/g. The recoveries in spiked oil samples were in the range of 70.0–104.9% with the RSDs less than 5.6% (intra-day) and 6.4% (inter-day). Taken together, the simple, rapid and cost-effective method developed in current study, offers a potential application for the extraction and preconcentration of hydrophilic analytes from complex fatty samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooking fats and oils 3acost effectiveness 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrophilicity 3airon oxides 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3asolid phase extraction1 aWei, Fang1 aXiao, Neng1 aYu, Qiong-Wei1 aYuan, Bi-Feng1 aFeng, Yu-Qi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 June 1, v. 1240 p.45-51dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245004000159300001600199520073100215592002800946650003300974650001301007650002201020700002101042773009701063856007101160852000901231655001201240IND60518558320221118225957.0160418e197209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855832DNAL7 a10.2307/19343022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGauch, H.

Owing to the high surface area and outstanding conductivity features provided by the combination of MgAl-LDH, NiMn₂O₄ and PANI nanoparticles, this ternary nanocomposite exhibited excellent electrochemical activity towards the detection of LD compared with the electrode modiﬁed by the pristine MgAl-LDH and MgAl-LDH/NiMn₂O₄ binary nanocomposite. In addition, enormous quantities of amine and imine functional groups on the surface of PANI lead to a strong affinity for attachment to organic molecules such as LD. The ternary nanocomposite modiﬁed electrode exhibited excellent analytical parameters such as wide linear response from 0.1 to 100 μM with very low detection limit of 0.005 μM, good reproducibility and long-term stability which are superior among the LD electrochemical sensors. Besides, the constructive sensor possessed acceptable selectivity for recognition of LD in the presence of a variety of potentially interfering species and can also effectively avoid the interference of dopamine (DA) and ascorbic acid (AA). Consequently, the LDH/NMO/PANI/GC electrode was effectively applied to detect LD in human plasma and urine samples with good recoveries, ranging from 98.0-100.1% and it shows potential usage in clinical researches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-dopa 3aascorbic acid 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahumans 3aimines 3ananocomposites 3apolyaniline 3asensors (equipment) 3asurface area 3aurine 0aLayered double hydroxide 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aLevodopa1 aDehghani, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8944-71990 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Oct., v. 194 p.111134-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1111343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245011300205300001600318520180700334592002802141650002202169650001602191650001802207650001402225650001002239650001902249650001502268650001802283650001502301650001002316653001302326653001302339653001802352653002102370700001702391700001802408773012502426856008302551852000902634655001202643IND60669782220221119075859.0200607e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066978222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.09.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikolov, Alex1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5079-027X10aNovel approach for calculating the equilibrium foam nanofilm-meniscus contact angle and the film free energy  ap. 591-597.  aThe film meniscus is a capillary system that is part of everyday observed phenomena, such as in foams, emulsions, liquid suspensions of nanoparticles (nanofluids), and liquid-wetting solids. The capillarity of a microscopic free foam lamella with a meniscus is important for a fundamental understanding of the role of the surface forces vs. thickness and stability of dispersed systems. The film-meniscus transition region, known as the Gibbs-Plateau border, and macroscopic contact angle, defined by the extrapolated meniscus Laplace surfaces, are the characteristics of capillary systems that reveal how the surface forces contribute to the stability of the dispersed systems. The foam nanofilm formed from a nanofluid due to nanoparticle self-layering under the film surface confinement thins in a multiple regular stepwise manner (not like soap films) above the CMC. The equilibrium thickness of the nanofilm is governed by the film area rather than the capillary pressure, as was reported for common and Newtonian films. Our video clip shows that the nanofilm thins layer by layer as the film area decreases. Our observation reveals that the nanofilm with a small film area remains at the equilibrium thickness with several layers. An iterative method is proposed to locate the film meniscus contact line. The film-meniscus profile of the transition region is examined using the reflected light interferometry and by applying the two radii of curvature. The micro- and macroscopic contact angles between nanofilm and meniscuses are calculated. The foam nanofilm’s structural free energy is calculated vs. the number of layers. The knowledge gained from this research will help to improve the understanding of the dispersion stability of foams, emulsions, and liquid suspensions of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acapillarity 3acontact angle 3aemulsions 3afoams 3ainterferometry 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3asoaps 0aNanofilm 0aMeniscus 0aContact angle 0aFilm free energy1 aWu, Pingkeng1 aWasan, D.

The morphology and structure of the resulting model lamellar crystals were characterized by transmission electron microscopy as well as electron and X-ray diffraction. By adequately controlling the crystallization parameters, all fatty acids could induce the formation of both 6- and 7-fold V-amylose single helices, indicating that the amylose conformation was independent of the chain length of the complexing molecule. Three allomorphs (V6I, V6II and V7) were identified individually or in mixtures. Higher concentrations of fatty acid and DMSO and a higher temperature promoted the formation of the more compact V6I structure. V6II and V7 preferentially formed with lower concentrations of fatty acids and DMSO and at lower temperatures. In the case of C5–C20 fatty acids, V7 was only obtained in the presence of DMSO. The polymorphism of V-amylose complexes with linear saturated fatty acids thus appears to be a more general phenomenon than previously reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamylose 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afatty acid composition 3amodels 3asaturated fatty acids 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPROA 0aBUTA 0aPENA 0aHEXA 0aOCTA 0aDECA 0aDODA 0aTEDA 0aHEDA 0aOCDA 0aICOA 0aDP 0aTEM 0aED 0aXRD 0aV-amylose 0aFatty acids 0aCrystallosolvates1 aChoisnard, Luc1 aWouessidjewe, Denis1 aPutaux, Jean-Luc0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Nov., v. 119 p.555-564dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.1633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245009300178300001600271520134900287592002801636650002101664650001101685650001501696650001701711650002101728650001601749650001701765650001401782650001601796650001501812651001801827653001501845653003701860653001701897653002701914653002401941700005801965700002802023700002802051700002302079700002202102773009102124856009002215852000902305655001202314IND60582276320221120094939.0221004e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058227632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCotillas, Salvador10aSynergistic integration of sonochemical and electrochemical disinfection with DSA anodes  ap. 562-568.  aThis work focuses on the disinfection actual urban wastewater by the combination of ultrasound (US) irradiation and electrodisinfection with Dimensionally Stable Anodes (DSA). First, the inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) during the sonochemical disinfection was studied at increasing ultrasound power. Results showed that it was not possible to achieve a complete disinfection, even at the highest US power (200 W) dosed by the experimental device used. Next, the electrodisinfection with DSA anodes at different current densities was studied, finding that it was necessary a minimum current density of 11.46 A m⁻² to reach the complete disinfection. Finally, an integrated sonoelectrodisinfection process was studied. Results showed a synergistic effect when coupling US irradiation with DSA electrodisinfection, with a synergy coefficient higher than 200% of the disinfection rate attained for the highest US power applied. In this process, hypochlorite and chloramines were identified as the main reagents for the disinfection process (neither chlorate nor perchlorate were detected), and the presence of trihalomethanes was far below acceptable values. Confirming this synergistic effect with DSA anodes opens the door to novel efficient disinfection processes, limiting the occurrence of hazardous disinfection by-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanodes 3abyproducts 3adisinfection 3aelectrochemistry 3airradiation 3aperchlorates 3asynergism 3aultrasonics 3awastewater 3aUnited States 0aUltrasound 0aDimensionally stable anode (DSA) 0aDisinfection 0aWastewater reclamation 0aProcess integration1 aLlanos, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6404-35771 aCastro Ríos, Katherin,1 aTaborda-Ocampo, Gonzalo1 aRodrigo, Manuel A.1 aCañizares, Pablo0 tChemosphere.g2016 Nov., v. 163 p.562-568dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01732naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245005600154300001600210520087600226592002801102650001801130650001201148650001201160650001501172650000901187650001401196650001501210650001601225773009701241856007101338852000901409655001201418IND60518558620221122113342.0160418e197209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855862DNAL7 a10.2307/19343082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd, P.

Moreover, the ever-enriching spatial data types and sensors create new conditions for visual localization. Based on the prior 3D model and the location sensor, the current study proposes a visual localization method using semantic information. This method integrates panoptic segmentation and the matching network to refine the sensor’s position and orientation and complete the target perception. First, the panoptic segmentation and the match network are used together to segment and match the 3D- model-rendered image and the truth image. The matching results are then optimized based on the semantic results. Second, the semantic consistency score is introduced in the RANSAC process to estimate the optimal 6 degree-of-freedom (6DOF) pose. In the final stage, the estimated 6DOF pose, the instance segmentation results, and the depth information are used to locate the target. Experimental results show that the proposed method is a significant improvement on advanced methods for the long-term visual localization benchmark dataset. Additionally, the proposed method is seen to provide improved localization accuracy and is capable of accurately perceiving the target for self-collected data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer vision 3adata collection 3amodels 3aspatial data1 aZhang, Yongsheng 1 aYu, Ying 1 aZhang, Zhenchao 1 aLi, Lei 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141639833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012000164300001800284520226500302592002802567650001202595650001902607650001902626650001202645700002302657700001902680700002002699773009602719856008102815852000902896655001202905IND60091555320221119024830.0150111e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009155532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-014-2091-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayr, Tobias14aThe eastward shift of the Walker Circulation in response to global warming and its relationship to ENSO variability  ap. 2747-2763.  aThis study investigates the global warming response of the Walker Circulation and the other zonal circulation cells (represented by the zonal stream function), in CMIP3 and CMIP5 climate models. The changes in the mean state are presented as well as the changes in the modes of variability. The mean zonal circulation weakens in the multi model ensembles nearly everywhere along the equator under both the RCP4.5 and SRES A1B scenarios. Over the Pacific the Walker Circulation also shows a significant eastward shift. These changes in the mean circulation are very similar to the leading mode of interannual variability in the tropical zonal circulation cells, which is dominated by El Niño Southern Oscillation variability. During an El Niño event the circulation weakens and the rising branch over the Maritime Continent shifts to the east in comparison to neutral conditions (vice versa for a La Niña event). Two-thirds of the global warming forced trend of the Walker Circulation can be explained by a long-term trend in this interannual variability pattern, i.e. a shift towards more El Niño-like conditions in the multi-model mean under global warming. Further, interannual variability in the zonal circulation exhibits an asymmetry between El Niño and La Niña events. El Niño anomalies are located more to the east compared with La Niña anomalies. Consistent with this asymmetry we find a shift to the east of the dominant mode of variability of zonal stream function under global warming. All these results vary among the individual models, but the multi model ensembles of CMIP3 and CMIP5 show in nearly all aspects very similar results, which underline the robustness of these results. The observed data (ERA Interim reanalysis) from 1979 to 2012 shows a westward shift and strengthening of the Walker Circulation. This is opposite to what the results in the CMIP models reveal. However, 75 % of the trend of the Walker Circulation can again be explained by a shift of the dominant mode of variability, but here towards more La Niña-like conditions. Thus in both climate change projections and observations the long-term trends of the Walker Circulation seem to follow to a large part the pre-existing dominant mode of internal variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aclimate models 3aglobal warming 3astreams1 aDommenget, Dietmar1 aMartin, Thomas1 aPower, Scott B.0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Nov., v. 43, no. 9-10 p.2747-2763dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2091-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001600153245011800169300001600287520210300303592002802406650001602434650001602450650001802466650001802484650002302502650001702525650001302542650002302555650001002578650001002588700001902598700001702617700001502634700002602649773009802675856008902773852000902862655001202871IND4451734620221121003644.0141112e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445173462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEghbali, M.10aTreating canola meal changes in situ degradation, nutrient apparent digestibility, and protein fractions in sheep  ap. 136-139.  aThe present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of three different treatment methods of canola meal (CM) on ruminal degradability of crude protein (CP) and dry matter (DM) in situ and apparent digestibility of nutrients in sheep. The fractionation of protein for treated CM was measured as well. Treatments were: T0=CM with no treatment (control); T1=treatment with formaldehyde; T2=treatment with acetic acid; and T3=heating treatment. The ruminal degradability of CP and DM was measured using four rumen fistulated Mehraban sheep. For digestibility trial twelve intact Mehraban sheep were used. The results showed that neutral detergent insoluble nitrogen (NDIN) contents were 5.28%, 5.29%, 6.25% and 5.16% and acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN) contents were 4.46%, 4.59%, 4.44% and 4.50% for T0, T1, T2 and T3, respectively (P>0.05). Considering nitrogen fractions, A+B₁ and B₂ showed differences among treatments (P<0.05) with B₃ and C being similar among treatments. The degradability kinetic parameters for DM (a, b and c) differed among treatments (P<0.05). The lowest effective degradability of DM was for control treatment. The parameters a, b and c for CP degradability also were affected by treatments (P<0.05). Ruminal degradation rates of DM and CP were decreased and the highest degradability for both DM and CP was observed in untreated CM. The digestibility of DM and OM showed no difference among treatments; however, CP digestibility was different among treatments (P<0.05). Regardless of CM treatment method, treated CM had greater B₂ and lower A+B₁ fractions compared with untreated CM and solubility of protein in CM decreased with different treatments. The results of the present study suggest that untreated CM has the greatest degradation rate in rumen and treating CM considerably decreased the solubility of protein and ruminal degradation rate. In conclusion the results suggest the treatment CM with formaldehyde to increase apparent digestibility of protein and the treatment CM with acetic acid to decrease ruminal degradation rate of protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acanola meal 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3aformaldehyde 3anitrogen 3aprotein solubility 3arumen 3asheep1 aKafilzadeh, F.1 aHozhabri, F.1 aAfshar, S.1 aKazemi-Bonchenari, M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2011 Apr., v. 96, no. 2-3 p.136-139dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2011.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245012200203500001900325520149300344592002801837650001101865650001201876650001301888650001801901650001101919650000901930650001401939650000901953650001901962650001301981651001001994653003102004653002302035653003402058653002702092653001702119700001302136700002002149773008902169856008502258852000902343655001202352IND60727625320221119155920.0210415e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072762532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1200502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0254-837110aStudy on the impacts of Shanghai crude oil futures on global oil market and oil industry based on VECM and DAG models  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study, the daily settlement data of Shanghai crude oil futures and world’s major crude oils are selected. The role of Shanghai crude oil futures is studied regarding its pricing power and hedging risk. The dynamic relation analysis between Shanghai crude oil futures and international oil market is conducted by using rolling window causality test. The vector error correction model (VECM) and directed acyclic graph (DAG) are used to explore the long-term relationship and identify the contemporaneous causality structure respectively. Then Shanghai crude oil futures’ impacts on other oil price fluctuations are analyzed by using variance decomposition method. The obtained analysis results show that the pricing power of Shanghai crude oil futures is limited compared with the international benchmark oil price, but it has begun to have a contemporaneous influence in the Asian oil market price transmission and better reflect oil supply and demand. Moreover, Shengli crude oil has stronger impact on the pricing mechanism after the listing of Shanghai crude oil futures. Furthermore, it also establishes an effective hedging tool for oil importers and refineries. Therefore, although the Shanghai crude oil futures is still in its initial development stage at present, it provides an important basis for becoming a regional benchmark in Asia and a useful instrument for energy market participants, influencing China’s oil industry in import price and consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aimports 3aindustry 3amarket prices 3amodels 3aoils 3apetroleum 3arisk 3asupply balance 3avariance 3aChina 0aShanghai crude oil futures 0aPrice transmission 0aVector error correction model 0aDirected acyclic graph 0aHedging risk1 aDi, Peng1 aFarnoosh, Arash0 tEnergy.g2021 May 15, v. 223 p.120050-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1200503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008800168300001800256520140000274592002801674650003101702650001601733650001201749650001601761650001601777650001201793700001801805773009601823856008101919852000902000655001202009IND60091555520221119025321.0150111e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009155552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-014-2093-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacagnina, Carlo10aEvaluation of clouds and radiative fluxes in the EC-Earth general circulation model  ap. 2777-2796.  aObservations, mostly from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology (ISCCP), are used to assess clouds and radiative fluxes in the EC-Earth general circulation model, when forced by prescribed observed sea surface temperatures. An ISCCP instrument simulator is employed to consistently compare model outputs with satellite observations. The use of a satellite simulator is shown to be imperative for model evaluation. EC-Earth exhibits the largest cloud biases in the tropics. It generally underestimates the total cloud cover but overestimates the optically thick clouds, with the net result that clouds exert an overly strong cooling effect in the model. Every cloud type has its own source of bias. The magnitude of the cooling due to the shortwave cloud radiative effect ([Formula: see text]) is underestimated for the stratiform low-clouds, because the model simulates too few of them. In contrast, [Formula: see text] is overestimated for trade wind cumulus clouds, because in the model these are too thick. The clouds in the deep convection regions also lead to overestimate the [Formula: see text]. These clouds are generally too thick and there are too few mid and high thin clouds. These biases are consistent with the positive precipitation bias and the overly strong mass flux for deep convective plumes. Potential sources for the various cloud biases in the model are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3acloud cover 3acooling 3atemperature 3atrade winds 3atropics1 aSelten, Frank0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Nov., v. 43, no. 9-10 p.2777-2796dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2093-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009600168300001600264520074400280592002801024650001201052650001101064650001701075653001901092653002401111653003501135653000801170653001601178700004101194700002201235773011301257856008601370852000901456655001201465IND60531652320221121133332.0180831e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053165232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRebai, Sonia12aA multi-attribute utility model for generating a sustainability index in the banking sector  ap. 835-849.  aThe study develops a performance evaluation model for banking while integrating sustainability.

Blending with nutrient-poor composts such as those from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste could reduce the risks of nutrient losses while maintaining the positive effects on soil organic matter. We conducted a 2-yr experiment with composts of diverse origin: organic fraction of municipal solid waste (MC), cattle feedlot manure (FC), poultry litter (PC) and biosolids (BC), alone or blended (FC-MC, PC-MC) in a sandy soil under the humid warm climatic conditions of NE Argentina. We studied the effects of a single application (40 Mg ha−1) on the surface soil (0–10cm) properties of a permanent subtropical pasture through annual chemical and biological analyses. On five dates, available N and P were also determined at 0–10cm and 55–65cm. Soil total C and N increased over time while potential N mineralization and CO2 emission decreased. All amendments resulted in similar increments of soil C and N despite marked differences in quantity and quality of organic matter inputs. Because MC had substantial amounts of Ca carbonates, it contributed to a reduction of available P from manure composts through dilution and precipitation. The release of available P from biosolids composts (where P is bound to Fe and Al) was lower than from manure composts (where P is bound by Ca phosphates). The highest environmental risk from compost application would likely be the leaching of soluble N produced during the composting process and released immediately after field application. Blending with N-poor MC would contribute to nitrate dilution.  aPublisher supplied data 3asandy soils 3acalcium phosphates 3aphosphorus 3arisk 3acarbon dioxide 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3airon 3abiosolids composts 3acomposted manure 3amineralization 3asoil organic matter 3acattle 3amunicipal solid waste 3aleaching 3apoultry manure 3abiosolids 3atropical pastures 3acalcium carbonate 3arisk reduction 3aclimatic factors 3amixing 3aaluminum 3acomposting 3aArgentina 0aorganic matter 0aAnimal manures 0aBiosolids 0aOrganic matter 0aNutrients 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aCompost mixtures 0aCa carbonates1 aSatti, Patricia1 aGonzález-Polo, Marina1 aIglesias, María C.1 aMazzarino, María J.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 May 15, v. 224 p.29-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245008400201300001800285500002000303520147500323592002801798596005601826596005501882650001301937650002301950650001401973650001301987650002102000650001502021650002902036650001702065650001502082650001402097650001402111773013102125856007902256852000902335655001202344IND60749127320221121211545.0210828e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074912732DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.156252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokuda, Gaku1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0645-619110aOrigin of symbiotic gut spirochetes as key players in the nutrition of termites  ap. 4092-4097.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTermites harbour symbiotic spirochetes in their hindguts, which have long been considered treponemes, although they represent separate lines of descent from known species of Treponema. ‘Termite gut treponemes’ have a mutualistic relationship with the host termites with their physiological properties including CO₂‐reductive acetogenesis, from which the resulting acetate fulfils most of the respiratory requirement of the host. Song and co‐workers showed that a spirochetal isolate (strain RmG30) from a Madeira cockroach represents the earliest branching lineage of extremely diverse termite (Treponema) cluster I and was a simple homolactic fermenter, suggesting that CO₂‐reductive acetogenesis exhibited by some members of termite cluster I originated via horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenomic and 16S rRNA sequence‐based phylogenetic analyses indicated a deeply‐branched sister clade containing termite cluster I was distinguishable as a family‐level lineage. In this context, a new family, ‘Termitinemataceae’ has been proposed for this clade. Strain RmG30 has been designated as the type strain of Breznakiella homolactica gen. nov. sp. nov. named after John A. Breznak, an American microbiologist distinguished in termite gut microbiology. The study has posed important questions for the future, including the actual roles of the termite spirochetes in each termite lineage and the evolutionary process of their physiological properties.  aPublisher supplied data  a17H01510cJapan Society of the Promotion of Science  aKAKENHIcJapan Society of the Promotion of Science 3aIsoptera 3aLeucophaea maderae 3aTreponema 3aacetates 3adigestive system 3afermenters 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amicrobiology 3anew family 3anutrition 3aphylogeny0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.4092-4097dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012500180500001900305520151100324592002801835650004401863650002201907650002201929650001101951650001301962650001901975650001901994650002202013650002102035650003702056653000802093653001802101653002302119653001802142700002702160700002102187700002802208773009202236856008602328852000902414655001202423IND60736781020221118013842.0210825e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e069832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbu Hurayra–Lizu, K.M.10aGO based PVA nanocomposites: tailoring of optical and structural properties of PVA with low percentage of GO nanofillers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGraphene-based polymer composites are gaining interest as a modish class of substance that holds promising angles on diverse applications. In this work, Graphene Oxide (GO) based Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites (PVA-GO) have been prepared by employing a facile solution casting method. Low concentrations of GO nanofiller (0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.0%) were used and the result of the use of them over the distinct substantial characteristics of the nanocomposites was evaluated. The different features of the as-synthesized nanocomposites such as optical, structural, chemical, and thermal properties were identified by UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), and Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. From the structural analysis of the crystallinity of the nanocomposite it is evident that a reduction in crystallinity caused by the amalgamation of the GO nanofiller. FTIR study shows improved interaction between the GO nanofiller and PVA matrix. The incorporation of GO was found to reduce the optical band gap of the nanocomposite both for the direct and indirect transition. The Urbach energy of the nanocomposite increases with the increase of the GO concentration suggests the formation of localized states causing a reduction in the optical band gap. PVA-GO nanocomposites with improved and tunable physical properties synthesized from a simple and economic route may pave a new horizon for polymer-based optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3athermogravimetry 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aPVA 0aNanocomposite 0aOptical properties 0aUrbach energy1 aBari, Md.

There is a need to investigate the long-term impact of successful weight loss maintenance on blood lipids and glucose concentrations in populations within Africa, where obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) rates are increasingly becoming a public health threat. The aim of this study was to compare the serum lipid and glucose concentrations of successful and unsuccessful weight loss maintainers who previously participated in the Nutriline Weight Loss Programme (NWLP) in Accra, Ghana. Methods. 112 participants were randomly selected to participate in this cross-sectional study. Baseline and end of weight loss programme anthropometric and programmatic data were accessed via the NWLP archival database. On follow-up, anthropometric data, physical activity, dietary behaviour, serum lipid, and glucose indices were taken. Successful weight loss maintainers (SWLM) were defined as those achieving at least 5% weight loss below the baseline weight at follow-up, otherwise unsuccessful (UWLM). Results. The adjusted serum total cholesterol (TC) concentration was significantly lower for SWLM (5.17 ± 0.99 mmol/L) compared to UWLM (5.59 ± 1.06 mmol/L). Serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations for SWLM versus UWLM did not differ significantly and were as follows: 3.58 ± 0.92 mmol/L versus 3.87 ± 0.99 mmol/L, 1.22 ± 0.38 mmol/L versus 1.17 ± 0.32 mmol/L, 4.48 ± 0.72 mmol/L versus 4.73 ± 1.00 mmol/L, and 5.52 ± 0.39% versus 5.59 ± 0.59%, respectively. Triglyceride (TG) concentration was significantly (P<0.001) lower for SWLM (0.79 ± 0.28 mmol/L) compared to UWLM (1.17 ± 0.51 mmol/L). After adjusting for covariates, it was no longer significant. Additionally, there was no significant association between weight loss maintenance success and having a normal status for selected lipids and glucose parameters. Conclusion. SWLM had a significantly lower serum TC compared to UWLM. In addition, a greater proportion of SWLM had normal values for TC, TG, HbA1c, and LDL out of the six parameters measured although not statistically significant.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol 3across-sectional studies 3adatabases 3aglucose 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3along term effects 3alow density lipoprotein 3anormal values 3anutritional behavior 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight loss 3aGhana1 aNti, Christiana1 aVuvor, Frederick1 aAdjimani, Jonathan1 aSteiner-Asiedu, Matilda0 tJournal of nutrition and metabolism.g2019 Apr. 1, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:21568x2090-07327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/47290403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007400170300001400244520122300258592002801481650001601509650002201525650001101547650001701558650001301575650001201588650001001600650002601610650001801636650001501654650002201669650001101691651002901702651001901731653001601750653002101766653002801787653001001815653001901825700002001844700002401864700001601888700002201904700001701926700001901943700002301962773012201985856008302107852000902190655001202199IND60525470620221120213917.0190318e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052547062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaley, Joanna T.10aLittle and late: How reduced hedgerow cutting can benefit Lepidoptera  ap. 22-28.  aHedgerows are a key semi-natural habitat for biodiversity in intensive agricultural landscapes across northern Europe and support a large invertebrate fauna. Management can have large effects on the value of hedgerows as a wildlife habitat, thus sensitive management is incentivised through agri-environment schemes (AES). We tested how current and potential future AES hedge management regimes affected the diversity and abundance of Lepidoptera species that utilise the hedge as a breeding resource, using a long term, multi-site, manipulative field experiment. Hedgerow management in some current AES options (reduced trimming frequency and cutting in winter) increased Lepidoptera abundance and the diversity of components of the Lepidoptera community linked with specific lifecycle traits. However, the most frequently applied hedgerow AES option currently applied in the UK (cutting once every 2 years in autumn) did not benefit Lepidoptera compared to standard hedgerow management outside AES (annual trimming in autumn). Decreasing the intensity of hedgerow trimming improves the diversity of the whole Lepidoptera assemblage, and should be considered as part of biodiversity conservation in farmed landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3aagricultural land 3aautumn 3abiodiversity 3abreeding 3acutting 3afauna 3afield experimentation 3ainvertebrates 3alandscapes 3awildlife habitats 3awinter 3aNorthern European region 3aUnited Kingdom 0aButterflies 0aBrown hairstreak 0aEntry level stewardship 0aMoths 0aThecla betulae1 aBotham, Marc S.1 aChapman, Roselle E.1 aAmy, Sam R.1 aHeard, Matthew S.1 aHulmes, Lucy1 aSavage, Joanna1 aPywell, Richard F.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 May 15, v. 224 p.22-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245015300156300001600309520162900325592002801954650001201982650002001994650002802014650002802042650001202070650001702082650001502099650001502114650001902129650001802148653001402166653002902180653001402209653001502223700001802238773012602256856007602382852000902458655001202467IND60749127620221121211428.0210831e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074912762DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2020.01692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGall, A.J.10aAnxiolytic effects of administration of a commercially available prebiotic blend of galacto-oligosaccharides and beta glucans in Sprague-Dawley rats  ap. 341-349.  aPrebiotics are nondigestible food agents that stimulate the growth of bacteria in the gut, whereas probiotics are live microorganisms that replace or restore beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract. Both agents have been shown to have beneficial qualities within the microbiota-gut-brain axis, but the behavioural effects of prebiotics have been less studied than probiotics. Whereas several studies have shown that prebiotics reduce inflammation and modulate anxiety in animals that are injected with lipopolysacccharides or chronically stressed animals, respectively, it is not yet known how they affect a healthy organism. Here, we tested the behavioural effects of galacto-oligosaccharides and beta glucan as a commercially available prebiotic blend in healthy, naïve Sprague-Dawley rats. We used the open field test and elevated plus maze to assess anxiety-like behaviour in controls and in rats that ingested the prebiotic blend in their drinking water. We also used the Morris Water Maze to assess spatial memory performance in controls and prebiotic treated rats. Rats treated with prebiotics spent more time in the intermediate zone of the open field test and in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and exhibited a shorter latency to enter each of these zones. No significant differences between groups were found in the Morris Water Maze. Our results suggest that whereas prebiotics significantly reduced anxiety-like behaviours, it had no effect on spatial memory performance. Altogether, our data indicate that commercially available prebiotic beta glucan blends have anxiolytic effects in healthy rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3adigestive tract 3aelevated plus-maze test 3agalactooligosaccharides 3aglucans 3ainflammation 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aspatial memory 3atranquilizers 0aprebiotic 0agalacto-oligosaccharides 0abehaviour 0amicrobiota1 aGriffin, G.D.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 12, no. 4 p.341-349dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2020.01693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006200174520075900236592002800995653004001023653002801063653001701091653002201108653001101130653001201141653001201153700001201165700001901177700001301196700006101209773009201270856008601362852000901448655001201457IND60736781320221118014007.0210825e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e069912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgustin, Ika Hesti14aThe reflexive edge strength on some almost regular graphs  aA function f with domain and range are respectively the edge set of graph G and natural number up to ke, and a function f with domain and range are respectively the vertex set of graph G and the even natural number up to 2kv are called a total k-labeling where k=max{ke,2kv}.

This was achieved by surveying 242 kiwi-orchards and 21 croplands and determining their nutrient inputs and outputs as well as the soil nutrient status for the over 2 years. The total inputs of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) from fertilizers, manures, deposition, and irrigation in kiwi-orchards were 1201, 268 and 615kgha−1yr−1, respectively, which were higher than the rates of 425, 59 and 109kgha−1yr−1 in wheat-maize fields. The mean annual apparent nutrient surpluses in kiwi-orchards were 1081kgNha−1yr−1, 237kg Pha−1yr−1 and 491kgKha−1yr−1. Within comparison to the croplands, the soil organic matter (SOM) and total N (TN) in the topsoil (0–20cm) increased in kiwi-orchards, and soil pH decreased. The average contents of Olsen-P, and available K in 0–20cm soils of the orchards were 86mgkg−1, and 360mgkg−1, which were higher than recommended levels. The nitrate-N accumulation in the 0–100cm and 0–200cm soil layers in kiwi-orchards were 466 and 793kgNha−1, respectively. The high proportion of nitrate-N in deeper soil profiles of kiwi-orchards poses a great risk for nitrate leaching and subsequent ground water pollution. It is concluded that changing arable crops to kiwi-orchards increased the environmental burden of the catchment due to excessive fertilizer application in kiwi-orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3acrops 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3agroundwater contamination 3airrigation 3aland use change 3aleaching 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aorchards 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arisk 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3asurpluses 3atopsoil 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aKiwi-orchard 0aNutrient input 0aSoil nutrients 0aNitrate accumulation1 aChen, Zhujun1 aKang, Tingting1 aZhang, Xiaojia1 aBellarby, Jessica1 aZhou, Jianbin0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 May 01, v. 223 p.270-277dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008600154520147700240592002801717650001601745650001501761650001401776650001101790650001901801650002001820650001501840651001001855700001701865700001501882700002201897773012901919856007502048852000902123655001202132IND60791090220221119071923.0220826e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079109022DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141639842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Yu 10aStable Regional Reference Frame for Reclaimed Land Subsidence Study in East China  aThis study implemented a stable Regional Reference Frame in Shanghai, East China (called SHRRF), using seven years of continuous GNSS observations from the Shanghai Continuously Operating Reference System stations (SHCORS) to examine reclaimed coast–land subsidence. A well−distributed core station network suitable for regional applications was derived. The instantaneous station coordinates and seven frame parameters (translations, rotations, and scale) were estimated at each epoch through minimum constraint during the process of aligning SHRRF to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF14). The average root mean square error (RMSE) of all stations under SHRRF was within 1.5 mm horizontally and 5 mm vertically for most epochs. Simultaneously, compared with the ITRF14 solutions, the average RMSE for each site at all epochs was reduced by ~30% horizontally and ~10% vertically. A temporal consolidation settlement model of the reclaimed soil under self−weight was established by combining a geotechnical−derived model with high precision permanent GNSS vertical solutions under SHRRF. The model indicates that ~50% of settlements occurred within 3.6 years, with the whole subsidence time being 46 years. SHRRF provides a precise regional reference frame for use in many East China geophysical applications besides reclaimed coast–land settlement including hydrologic loading, microplate motions, and critical structure deformation monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3ageophysics 3ahydrology 3amodels 3areclaimed land 3areclaimed soils 3asubsidence 3aChina1 aDong, Danan 1 aChen, Wen 1 aZhang, Chenglong 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141639843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245009900188300001600287520084100303592002801144650001001172650001701182650001601199650002601215650000901241650001201250650001601262650001401278650001301292650002101305650002101326650003001347650001201377650001101389650002101400650003301421650001801454650001601472650002201488700001801510700001401528700001901542773013301561856005501694852000901749655001201758IND4477316420221121003519.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447731642DNAL7 a211145432pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2010.01090.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiccione, G.10aDaily variations of serum lipids in Ovis aries under different lighting and feeding conditions  ap. 603-608.  aThe aim of this study was to discriminate the impact of lighting and feeding conditions on the regulation of lipid metabolism in Ovis aries. Six clinically healthy female Comisana ewes, not pregnant and not lactating were kept under different environmental conditions: 12:12 light–dark (LD) cycle, constant darkness and fasting. Blood samples were collected at the end of each period of treatment every 4 h for a 24‐h period. Blood concentration of triglycerides, total cholesterol and non‐esterified fatty acid showed robust daily rhythmicity in ewes maintained under 12:12 LD cycle and fed ad libitum. Conversely, either constant darkness or fasting had a deep impact on all lipid parameters investigated. Our results suggest that lighting and feeding conditions have an impact on daily variations in lipid metabolism in ewes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3aenvironmental factors 3aewes 3afasting 3afatty acids 3alactation 3alighting 3alipid metabolism 3atriacylglycerols 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivation 2aLipid Metabolismxphysiology 2aLipidsxblood 2aPhotoperiod 2aSheepxphysiology1 aGiannetto, C.1 aFazio, F.1 aBertolucci, C.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2011 Oct., v. 95, no. 5 p.603-608dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2010.01090.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245008100161300001600242520078700258592002801045650001101073650001201084650001101096650001401107650001101121650003201132650001901164653002201183653001701205653002401222653002801246653002301274700002101297700001701318700001801335700001501353773011001368856008001478852000901558655001201567IND60616455020221120202457.0181016e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061645502DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175176906262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeo, Eunah12aA wearable textile antenna for wireless power transfer by magnetic resonance  ap. 913-921.  aThe paper presents a wearable textile antenna embroidered on a fabric for wireless power transfer systems.

OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, we examined the effects of an IFCR diet on adipokine profile, body composition, and markers of CHD risk in obese women. METHODS: Subjects (n = 54) were randomized to either the IFCR-liquid (IFCR-L) or IFCR-food based (IFCR-F) diet for 10 weeks. RESULTS: Greater decreases in body weight and waist circumference were noted in the IFCR-L group (4 ± 1 kg; 6 ± 1 cm) versus the IFCR-F group (3 ± 1 kg; 4 ± 1 cm). Similar reductions (P < 0.0001) in fat mass were demonstrated in the IFCR-L (3 ± 1 kg) and IFCR-F group (2 ± 1 kg). Reductions in total and LDL cholesterol levels were greater (P = 0.04) in the IFCR-L (19 ± 10%; 20 ± 9%, respectively) versus the IFCR-F group (8 ± 3%; 7 ± 4%, respectively). LDL peak particle size increased (P < 0.01) in the IFCR-L group only. The proportion of small LDL particles decreased (P < 0.01) in both groups. Adipokines, such as leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) decreased (P < 0.05), in the IFCR-L group only. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFCR with a liquid diet favorably modulates visceral fat and adipokines in a way that may confer protection against CHD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aliquid diet 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3avisceral fat 3amyocardial ischemia 3awomen 3abody weight 3aleptin 3ainterleukin-6 3arisk factors 3awaist circumference 3afasting 3aparticle size 3alow density lipoprotein 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0arisk1 aKlempel, Monica C1 aBhutani, Surabhi1 aTrepanowski, John F1 aTangney, Christine C1 aVarady, Krista A0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.475-475dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-9-98  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245010200200520098600302592002801288596006001316596006601376596008301442650001901525650001601544650001101560650001201571650002301583650002001606650002901626650001601655700001701671700001701688700001601705773009501721856007601816852000901892655001201901IND60637245720221119231401.0190416e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063724572DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/56416432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Fangfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0125-537410aInvestigation and Validation of Detection of Storage Stability of Difenoconazole Residue in Mango  aTo investigate the stability of the pesticide residue in storage samples is a part of detection, which is also an improvement to the accuracy of analytical results. In this work, the UPLC-MS/MS method with perfect accuracy and stability was established for determining residues of difenoconazole in mango. The stability of the residue under different temperatures (4°C and −20°C) and media (fruit samples and pretreated sample solution) was investigated. At 0.1 mg/kg, the residue degraded in 6 months by 12% when at −20°C, while in a week by only 12.2% at 4°C. However, when pretreated and preserved in the solution, the residue remained more than 90% for 6–8 weeks. The results indicated that the main causes of degradation are biochemical factors, and the factors are affected by temperature. The findings also provided appropriate conditions for sample storage. This investigation promotes the accuracy in detection and hence guarantees food safety and quality.  aPublisher supplied data  a218QN259cNatural Science Foundation of Hainan Province  aCARS-31cEarmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System  a1630082017005 1630082019001cChinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences 3adifenoconazole 3afood safety 3afruits 3amangoes 3apesticide residues 3astorage quality 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature1 aLiu, Jingkun1 aHan, Bingjun1 aLuo, Jinhui0 tJournal of food quality.g2019 Apr. 1, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/56416433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010300166500001900269520188600288592002802174650003502202650001102237650001502248650000902263650001402272650001702286650000902303650002102312650002502333651001202358653003002370653001502400653003602415653003102451653002002482700002302502700001802525700001602543700001402559700001502573773009202588856008602680852000902766655001202775IND60736781620221118014026.0210825e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e069992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmar, H.A.10aEnvironmental and socioeconomic impacts of pipeline transport interdiction in Niger Delta, Nigeria  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOver the years, pipelines have been the most economic medium for transporting crude oil to production and distribution facilities in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria. However, damages to the pipelines in this area by interdiction have hampered the continuous flow of crude oil to the facilities. Consequently, the revenue of the government dwindles, and the environment is severely degraded. This study assesses the economic and environmental impacts of pipeline interdiction in the Niger Delta region. Data from National oil spills detection and response agency, Nigeria is used to map spatial distribution of oil spills using Kernel Density Estimation with Geographic Information System. Literature was assessed to synthesize the historical, socioeconomic, and environmental impacts of oil spills and pipeline interdiction. Soil samples were collected from study area to determine the types of hydrocarbon pollutants and their concentrations in comparison with uncontaminated sites in the area. Results show that the range of concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) for the impacted soil (IMP) was 17.27–58.36 mg/kg; remediated soil (RS) was 11.73–50.78 mg/kg which were higher than the concentrations of 0.68 mg/kg in the control samples (CS). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concentrations were in the range of 0.43–77.54 mg/kg for IMP, 0.42–10.65 mg/kg for RS, against CS value of 0.49 mg/kg while BTEX ranged between 0.02 – 0.38 mg/kg for IMP, 0.01–2.7 for RS against CS value of 0.01. The values of the PAH were higher than the limits of the Department of Petroleum Resources, Nigeria. This study also revealed that pipeline interdiction has affected the livelihood of the inhabitants of the study area and the revenue of the Nigerian government. The major hotspots for oil spills in the Niger Delta region are Bayelsa, Rivers and Delta states.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3aincome 3alivelihood 3aoils 3apetroleum 3ariver deltas 3asoil 3asoil remediation 3astatistical analysis 3aNigeria 0aEnvironmental degradation 0aOil spills 0aPipeline transport interdiction 0aEconomic impact assessment 0aOil exploration1 aAbdul Khanan, M.F.1 aOgbonnaya, C.1 aShiru, M.S.1 aAhmad, A.1 aBaba, A.I.0 tHeliyon.g2021 May, v. 7, no. 5 p.e06999-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e069993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002500181245013200206300001800338506007600356520185100432592002802283506003702311650003002348650002502378650000802403650001902411650001102430650001102441650001202452650001102464650000902475650002602484650001702510650001002527650001002537650001102547650001102558650001102569650001402580650003002594650000902624650000902633650002502642650001702667650001002684650001502694650005602709650001202765650005702777650001102834650001202845650000902857650001402866650001402880650004802894650002502942650001502967651001302982651001002995700003403005700002003039700002503059700002503084773013603109856004303245852000903288655001203297IND4468334420221207053530.0120419e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446833442DNAL7 a222869862pmid7 aPMC33188232pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.06564-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Fons, Francisco10aFactors Driving the Abundance of Ixodes ricinus Ticks and the Prevalence of Zoonotic I. ricinus-Borne Pathogens in Natural Foci  ap. 2669-2676.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnvironmental factors may drive tick ecology and therefore tick-borne pathogen (TBP) epidemiology, which determines the risk to animals and humans of becoming infected by TBPs. For this reason, the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of environmental factors on the abundance of immature-stage Ixodes ricinus ticks and on the prevalence of two zoonotic I. ricinus-borne pathogens in natural foci of endemicity. I. ricinus abundance was measured at nine sites in the northern Iberian Peninsula by dragging the vegetation with a cotton flannelette, and ungulate abundance was measured by means of dung counts. In addition to ungulate abundance, data on variables related to spatial location, climate, and soil were gathered from the study sites. I. ricinus adults, nymphs, and larvae were collected from the vegetation, and a representative subsample of I. ricinus nymphs from each study site was analyzed by PCR for the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA. Mean prevalences of these pathogens were 4.0% ± 1.8% and 20.5% ± 3.7%, respectively. Statistical analyses confirmed the influence of spatial factors, climate, and ungulate abundance on I. ricinus larva abundance, while nymph abundance was related only to climate. Interestingly, cattle abundance rather than deer abundance was the main driver of B. burgdorferi sensu lato and A. phagocytophilum prevalence in I. ricinus nymphs in the study sites, where both domestic and wild ungulates coexist. The increasing abundance of cattle seems to increase the risk of other hosts becoming infected by A. phagocytophilum, while reducing the risk of being infected by B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Controlling ticks in cattle in areas where they coexist with wild ungulates would be more effective for TBP control than reducing ungulate abundance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aDNA 3aIxodes ricinus 3aadults 3acattle 3aclimate 3acotton 3adeer 3aenvironmental factors 3aepidemiology 3afeces 3ahosts 3ahumans 3alarvae 3anymphs 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asoil 3astatistical analysis 3atick control 3aticks 3avegetation 2aAnaplasma phagocytophilumxisolation & purification 2aAnimals 2aBorrelia burgdorferi Groupxisolation & purification 2aCattle 2aClimate 2aDeer 2aEcosystem 2aGeography 2aIxodesxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPlantsxparasitology 2aPrevalence 0aPortugal 0aSpain1 aFernández-de-Mera, Isabel G.1 aAcevedo, Pelayo1 aGortázar, Christian1 aFuente, José de la,0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 78, no. 8 p.2669-2676dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.06564-11  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011800174500001900292520116700311592002801478650001301506650002601519650002301545650001101568651001001579653002101589653002101610653002401631653002401655653004101679653003401720700006401754700006001818773009201878856008601970852000902056655001202065IND60736781720221118013954.0210825e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e070002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrolia, Sangeeta10aModerating effects of academic involvement in web-based learning management system success: A multigroup analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhile several educational institutions in India, in accordance to global practices, have adopted Web-Based Learning Management Systems (WLMS) to supplement classroom courses, it is largely seen that these WLMSs fail in their objectives, leading to little or no return on investments. The study aims to define the factors that affect students’ acceptance of a web-based learning management system and test the moderating effect of their academic involvement in the success of a WLMS. 477 valid questionnaires were collected from university/college students to empirically test the research model using the structural equation modelling approach. The results concludes that indirect and direct effects account for 49% of the variation in the intention to use, which is explained by technical system quality, information quality, educational quality, service quality of the technical support team and user satisfaction. High academic involvement moderates the impact of different service qualities of the WLMS on user satisfaction, intention to use the system, and success of the WLMS. Based on the findings, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aconsumer satisfaction 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3aIndia 0aHigher education 0aIS success model 0aModeration analysis 0aStudent involvement 0aWeb-based learning management system 0aStructural equation modelling1 aAlagarsamy, Subburaj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1200-63811 aIndhu Sabari, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9718-05320 tHeliyon.g2021 May, v. 7, no. 5 p.e07000-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e070003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002000163245007400183300001600257500000900273520153100282592002801813650001301841650000901854650002001863650002601883650001001909650001401919650001201933650001501945650002201960650001201982650002201994700002002016700001602036700001902052773012002071856009802191852000902289655001202298IND60665255520221122064351.0191122e196603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525552DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1966.0011183X000600020018x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchrader, L.

From previous experiments, two groups of inbreds, ranked “high” and “low” with respect to seasonal mean NR activity were selected and used to obtain FI hybrids representing the following categories: “high ✕ high”, “high ✕ low”, and “low ✕ low”. The level of NR activity in the lq hybrid appeared to differ from category to category. In the “high ✕ high” category, the level of NR activity of the hybrids of all three sets of material was lower than the mean of the respective parental inbreds. In the “high ✕ low” category, the hybrids were essentially intermediate in NR activity with respect to their parental inbreds and lower, in all cases, than the higher inbred parent. Two hybrids of the “low ✕ low” category exhibited heterosis for this character. That is, the level of NR activity of the hybrids was significantly higher than the level of the higher inbred parent. Other hybrids of this category were not significantly different in NR activity than the mean of their respective inbred parents or the higher inbred. Since it is accepted that the mechanism of gene action is at the biochemical level through the control of protein synthesis, this work provides some insight into the mode of gene action and outlines an approach to the knowledgeable synthesis of hybrids with specified metabolic characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3agenes 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3ainbreeding 3anitrate reductase 3aparents 3aprotein synthesis1 aPeterson, D.

Using cell-tracking experiments, it has been demonstrated that mandibular neural crest cells, labelled during migration, extensively populate dental papillae of all tooth phenotypes of the lobe-finned fish, the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri). Here, I report on an extension of this experimental study that earliest migrating NC cells are able to differentiate into odontogenic ectomesenchyme. Using vital dye cell-tracking to mark the mesencephalic neural crest prior to migration, I have found that the corresponding population of earliest migratory cells selectively relocated to dental papillae of both temporary and permanent dentitions of Neoceratodus. I noticed a gradient in distribution of the labelled cells which populated posterior teeth, pterygoid and prearticular (including associated trabecular and Meckelian cartilages; major relocation) much more densely than those in anterior marginal positions, temporary and vomeral permanent teeth (minor relocation). Contrary to mice and zebrafish, the odontogenic potency of mesencephalic neural crest cells is already programmed at the onset of the migration event in lungfish. This may imply that the morphogenic potential of mesencephalic neural crest cells to form teeth has been heterochronically shifted and constrained to later migratory populations of neural crest cells during the developmental evolution of derived tetrapods, or/and arrested in their expression in the oral development of some modern osteichthyans.  aPublisher supplied data  a1/0853/17cVedecká Grantová Agentúra MŠVVaŠ SR a SAV  aITMS2014+: 313011V455cEuropean Regional Development Fund 3aDanio rerio 3aNeoceratodus forsteri 3adyes 3aepithelium 3aevolution 3afish 3amigratory behavior 3aneural crest0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2021 Oct., v. 108, no. 5 p.37-37dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl16697x0028-10427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-021-01750-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04492naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133024004300169040001800212100003500230245010300265300001400368506002800382506003600410506007600446506003100522520186100553592002802414596011302442596005702555596004502612596006002657506003702717650001602754650002202770650001902792650001702811650002602828650001402854650001602868650001202884650001502896650002102911650001702932650002302949650002602972650001502998650001703013650001703030650001503047650001703062650001103079650001303090650001503103650001603118650003003134650002503164650000903189650001703198650002203215650001003237653002103247653001703268653001803285653001803303653001603321653001703337653001003354700003003364700001803394700002403412773012203436856008303558903002403641852000903665655001203674IND60525471120221207092946.0190318e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052547112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0232chorus7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0232doi7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0232chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuintanilla-Tornel, Marisol A.10aEffects of mulching on above and below ground pests and beneficials in a green onion agroecosystem  ap. 75-85.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIn 2013 and 2014, different mulching systems were investigated for their potential to suppress above and below ground pests, and enhance beneficial arthropods and soil health in green onion (Allium cepa) plantings. Three types of mulch systems (organic, living and solarization mulch) were evaluated and compared. Green onions were grown in four pre-plant treatments: (1) organic mulch generated by flail mowing a sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) cover crop (SH) followed by a no-till cropping system, (2) soil solarization (Sol), (3) sunn hemp-solarization mulch in which the sunn hemp was incorporated into the soil followed by soil solarization (SHSol), and (4) bare ground with insecticides (BG). Sol, SHSol and BG were practiced in conventional tilled system. SH (in 2013 and 2014) and SHSol (in 2014) treatments included strips of buckwheat and cowpea along the crop border to serve as living mulch or insectary plants. Green onion plants in SH had lower thrips and leaf miners damage than other treatments in both study years. When insectary borders were added to SHSol in 2014, thrips and leaf miners damages were also reduced in SHSol compared to Sol and BG. Incidence of purple blotch was reduced in SH and SHSol treatments in 2014. The SH treatment contained an increased abundance and richness of detritivores, predatory arthropods, parasitoids and beneficial free-living nematodes (particularly bacterivores and fungivores). Although weeds and initial populations of plant-parasitic nematodes were lower in solarization (Sol, SHSol) than other treatments, green onion yield was greatest in SH organic mulch systems in both study years. Overall, the integration of surface organic, living and solarization mulches into a green onion agroecosystem provided multiple ecosystem services including suppression of above and below ground pest organisms.  aPublisher supplied data  cCollege of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources University of Hawaiidhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008782  cNIFA AER programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cWestern IPM programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000059990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAllium cepa 3aCrotalaria juncea 3aagroecosystems 3abacterivores 3abeneficial arthropods 3abuckwheat 3acover crops 3acowpeas 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3adetritivores 3aecosystem services 3afree-living nematodes 3afungivores 3agreen onions 3ainsecticides 3aleafminers 3alive mulches 3amowing 3amulching 3ano-tillage 3aparasitoids 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3apredatory arthropods 3asoil 3asoil quality 3asoil solarization 3aweeds 0aInsectary plants 0aOnion thrips 0aOrganic mulch 0aPurple blotch 0aSoil health 0aSolarization 0aWeeds1 aWang, K. -H.q(Koon-Hui),1 aTavares, Jane1 aHooks, Cerruti R.R.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 May 15, v. 224 p.75-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169100001700186245008200203300001600285520147900301650003001780650001201810650001101822650001401833650001501847650001101862650002001873650002101893650001501914650002701929650001901956651001501975700001801990700001402008700001402022700002002036773009502056852000902151856009202160930003302252945002502285946001302310655001202323IND4377493720221116224430.0060130e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437749372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.2005.00062.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWilson, J.T.10aStable isotope analysis of MTBE to evaluate the source of TBA in ground water  ap. 108-116.  aAlthough tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) has not been used as a fuel oxygenate in Orange County, California, the concentrations of TBA in ground water at gasoline spill sites are high compared those of the conventional fuel oxygenate methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). In the year 2002, the geometric mean concentration of TBA was 839 micrograms/L compared to 627 micrograms/L for MTBE. There are two plausible sources of TBA, the TBA originally present in the gasoline and biodegradation of MTBE to TBA. Thirteen sites where the concentration of TBA was >10 mg/L were selected for study. Biodegradation was evaluated by determining the stable carbon isotope ratio (delta13C) of MTBE in the ground water. If MTBE was biodegraded, the residual MTBE should be enriched in the heavier carbon isotope 13C. The historical highest concentration of MTBE in each monitoring well and the delta13C of MTBE in the ground water were used to estimate the concentration of TBA produced from biodegradation of MTBE. Then, the estimated concentration of TBA was compared to the measured concentration. At each site, comparisons were made for the well in the source area, and the well in the plume outside the source area, that had the highest concentration of TBA. In the wells in the source areas, the estimate of TBA production accounted for the majority of TBA at 4 of the 13 sites. In the wells in the plume outside of the source area, the estimate accounted for the majority of TBA at six sites. 3agroundwater contamination 3abutanol 3aethers 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3acarbon 3astable isotopes 3aisotope labeling 3amonitoring 3achemical concentration 3abiodegradation 3aCalifornia1 aKolhatkar, R.1 aKuder, T.1 aPhilp, P.1 aDaugherty, S.J.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g2005 Fall, v. 25, no. 4 p.108-116x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.2005.00062.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle03266naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245008300171300001600254500005400270520209600324650001902420650003002439650001702469650002902486650003102515650001302546651001802559653001602577653001902593653002102612773009702633852000902730856009402739930003302833945001302866946001302879655001202892IND2040302420221116224348.0940616e199412  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204030242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1994.tb00098.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbee, G.C.10aFate of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons in the vadose zone and ground water  ap. 129-140.  aVolume number given as IX on spine of this issue.  aThe large-scale production and use of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CHC) in the United States has resulted in numerous documented cases of soil and ground water contamination. Potential chronic exposure from contaminated soil and ground water, as well as from products used in the home, is sufficient reason to develop a thorough understanding of the environmental fate of these known and possible human carcinogens. Most CHCs are very mobile in the subsurface environment, either as volatilized Constituents in the vadose zone due to their high vapor pressure and low water solubility; as dissolved constituents in ground water since they are not strongly adsorbed by aquifer materials; and as dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in ground water, primarily because they have low water solubility and densities greater than water. As free-phase chemicals (i.e., DNAPLs), CHCs may pool on low-permeability subsurface stratum and cause shrinkage and cracking of clay minerals, thereby significantly increasing the stratum's hydraulic conductivity and allowing rapid CHC breakthrough and migration. Although laboratory and field studies have demonstrated this effect, additional investigations are needed to determine the impact CHC DNAPLs have on low-permeability in situ sediments. CHCs are persistent environmental contaminants because they resist chemical and biological degradation. The average half-life for CHC abiotic transformations ranges from two months to greater than 10(10) years. Chlorinated ethenes are the most resistant CHCs to abiotic degradation. Biodegradation half-lives for CHCs may vary considerably but range from about two weeks to eight months or more. Anaerobic reductive dehalogenation is recognized as a primary CHC biodegradation process in ground water, although aerobic CHC biodegradation may be a significant process in the shallow subsurface. Technological applications of remedial processes for stimulating in situ CHC biodegradation in soils and ground water need to be developed, particularly with regard to CHCs entrained as residual saturation. 3asoil pollution 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrocarbons 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aphysicochemical properties 3asampling 3aUnited States 0apersistence 0atransformation 0amovement in soil0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1994 Winter, v. 14, no. 1 p.129-140x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1994.tb00098.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02234naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245006500169300001600234520127400250650002701524650001601551650001901567650001501586650001601601650001601617700001601633773009701649852000901746856009401755930003301849945001301882946001301895655001201908IND2041168920221116223911.0940801e199404  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204116892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1994.tb00112.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllred, B.10aSurfactant-induced reductions in soil hydraulic conductivity  ap. 174-184.  aSurfactant solutions are being proposed for in situ flushing of organic contaminants from soils and aquifers. The feasibility of surfactant additives in remediation may depend in large part on how these chemicals affect the hydraulic conductivity of the porous media. While there is evidence in the literature of conductivity loss during surfactant flushing (Miller et al. 1975; Nash et al. 1987) there has been little research on quantifying the process for unconsolidated sediments. Surfactant-affected hydraulic conductivity reductions were measured in two soils (Teller loam and Daughtery sand). Testing was done with eight surfactants at a variety of concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-1) mole/kg), surfactant mixtures, and added solution electrolytes. The Teller was also tested with its organic mattaer removed. Maximum hydraulic conductivity decreases were 47 percent for the sanad and more than two orders of magnitude for the loam. Surfactant concentrations, surfactant mixtures, soil organic content, and added solution electrolytes all affected the degree of conductivity reduction. Results indicate that surfactant-affected hydraulic conductivity losses should be considered prior to in situ remediation and may preclude surfactant use in some fine grain soils. 3ahydraulic conductivity 3asurfactants 3asoil pollution 3aloam soils 3asandy soils 3aremediation1 aBrown, G.O.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1994 Spring, v. 14, no. 2 p.174-184x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1994.tb00112.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01977naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245009800172300001600270500001500286520088200301650001001183650001701193650000901210650002101219650001401240653001701254653002201271700001901293700001601312700001601328773009701344852000901441856009401450930003301544945001301577946001301590655001201603IND2045327320221116224352.0950330e199512  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204532732DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00510.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobbins, G.A.13aAn evaluation of soil-gas surveying for H2S for locating subsurface hydrocarbon contamination  ap. 124-132.  a2019-12-04  aA soil-gas survey was conducted at a gasoline service station and a former fire training facility to determine if surveying for hydrogen sulfide could be useful in locating nonaqueous phase hydrocarbon fuel in the subsurface. Relative to total organic vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide distributions, detectable hydrogen sulfide concentrations were much more restricted to the suspected source vicinity at both sites. Appreciable levels of soil-gas hydrogen sulfide, up to 600 Vppb, were observed in areas characterized by anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions having bulk oxygen levels below 4 percent. Based on the hydrogen sulfide distribution, nonaqueous phase hydrocarbon fuel was located at each site. These results suggest that soil-gas surveys for hydrogen sulfide may help locate mobile or residual gasoline and other nonaqueous phase hydrocarbons in the subsurface. 3agases 3ahydrocarbons 3asoil 3ahydrogen sulfide 3adetection 0acontaminants 0asubsurface layers1 aMcAninch, B.E.1 aGavas, F.M.1 aEllis, P.M.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1995 Winter, v. 15, no. 1 p.124-132x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00510.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01939naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001800099040001800117100001700135245006100152300001400213500001500227520048800242650001900730650001700749650001700766650001600783650001300799650001000812650001600822650006200838650003000900650001800930650002600948650001100974650001100985650004000996650003201036650000901068650001601077650002701093650001401120650000901134650001601143650001201159651001801171651001101189651001801200653001201218653002801230653001101258773005401269852000901323939003301332945000801365655001201373991593449890742620221116224137.0770301e197601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794409502DNAL7 a11061672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerko, Lars.10aRisk factors and coronary heart disease--facts or fancy?  ap. 87-98.  a2019-12-06  aMany well published epidemiologic studies on the philosophy of prevention of ischemic heart disease have led to this analysis of the background design and early results of three such studies, i.e., the Framingham Study, the National Pooling Project, and the Stockholm Prospective Study.

This precipitation may involve two possible error sources: non-fibre component co-precipitation and incomplete precipitation of SDF components such as pectins. Both possibilities are studied in the present work. Citrus pectins and pectin-organic acid (citric and oxalic) mixtures were dissolved in phosphate buffer and precipitated in 78% ethanol at different pH values. Incomplete recovery of pectins (84-89%, depending upon the pH of the solution) and significant co-precipitation of organic acids were observed. Dialysis has been studied as an alternative method for obtaining SDF. Both dialysis and precipitation techniques were carried out to determine SDF in fruits, legumes and cereals. The SDF values (neutral sugars plus uronic acids) obtained by dialysis were higher in all the samples than the values obtained by precipitation. These results show the incomplete determination of SDF with the present analytical methods. In addition, gravimetric methods can include a fraction of non-fibre constituents, such as organic acids, as fibre. 3asolubility 3afood analysis 3aethanol 3achemical precipitation 3amethodology 3adietary fiber 0aerrors1 aSaura-Calixto, F.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 47, no. 4 p.351-355x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02096naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245004000129300001600169520122200185650000901407650001101416650001501427650001201442650001301454650001101467650000701478650001601485650001801501650002401519700001601543700001601559700001401575773006701589852000901656930003301665945001301698946001101711655001201722IND2039919920221116223610.0940531s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203991992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorinstein, S.10aEnzymatic hydrolysis of sago starch  ap. 411-417.  aVarious enzyme hydrolysis procedures were employed in this study. A kinetic model presents sago starch hydrolysis by Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase (Termamyl 120L), Bacillus subtilis beta-glucanase (Cereflo 200L) and by Bacillus pullulanase (Promozyme 200L) at temperatures of 90 degrees C and 60 degrees C and substrate concentration of 15% solids. Quantitation of pH, temperature and enzyme dosage in different combinations was used in standard statistical techniques of experimental design and data analysis. Determination of the degree of hydrolysis was based on freezing point depression osmometry, high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction methods. Computer implementation of the model allows graphical evaluation and prediction in improvement of the conditions of enzyme hydrolysis of sago-resistant starch. Liquefaction and saccharification of sago starch were performed to establish the optimum conditions of enzymatic hydrolysis in comparison with other starches. Enzyme treatment resulted in a decrease in the degree of crystallinity of all hydrolysed starch samples. C-type crystals completely disappeared at 100 degrees C. 3asago 3astarch 3ahydrolysis 3aenzymes 3akinetics 3amodels 3apH 3atemperature 3adose response 3aBacillus (bacteria)1 aOates, C.G.1 aChang, S.M.1 aLii, C.Y.0 tFood chemistry.g1994, v. 49, no. 4 p.411-417x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01090naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245010100137300001400238520015500252650000900407650003700416650002100453650002100474650003100495651001000526653001500536700002500551700002400576700002100600773006500621852000900686930003300695945001300728946001100741655001200752IND2040021320221116224247.0940603s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Rodriguez, M.A.10aComposition of babaco, feijoa, passionfruit and tamarillo produced in Galicia (North-west Spain)  ap. 23-27.  aBasic compositional data are evaluated for the subtropical fruits (babaco, feijoa, passionfruit, and tamarillo) growing in Galicia (North-west Spain). 3aAcca 3aCarica heilbornii var. pentagona 3afood composition 3anutrient content 3aphysicochemical properties 3aSpain 0atamarillos1 aVazquez-Oderiz, M.L.1 aLopez-Hernandez, J.1 aSimal-Lozano, J.0 tFood chemistry.g1994, v. 49, no. 1 p.23-27x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02005naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010100125300001600226500001500242520106700257650001701324650002601341650001201367650002001379650001301399650001201412650002101424650001201445650001601457653002001473700001701493773006701510852000901577930003301586945001301619946001101632655001201643IND2039662320221116223531.0940520s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203966232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahiya, S.10aNutritional evaluation of home-processed weaning foods based on low cost locally available foods  ap. 179-182.  a2019-12-05  aFour supplements were developed from locally available least expensive food items, using home-processing methods of roasting and malting.

These tannins were supplemented at a level of 2% of the diet of high-cholesterol-fed Sprague Dawley rats for 9 weeks; the diets were compared with a diet without tannins control diet) and with a standard diet. Rats fed diets containing 1% cholesterol showed an increase in total and low-density lipoprotein plasma cholesterol and a decrease in plasma high-density lipoprotein. These changes were prevented by the addition of 2% polymeric grape tannins but not by monomeric tannins. Similarly, liver weight, liver lipids and total liver cholesterol were increased by dietary cholesterol and these increases were largely inhibited by the tannin polymers but not the monomers. The polymers significantly increased the fecal excretion of lipids and cholesterol. In conclusion, we have shown that polymeric grape seed tannins exert a hypocholesterolemic effect in high-cholesterol-fed rats. 3anutrient intake 3afatty acids 3ablood lipids 3aliver 3aprocyanidins 3aexperimental diets 3alipoproteins 3acholesterol 3atannins 3agrape seeds 3ablood plasma 3aexcretion 3arats 0adiet1 aBitri, L.1 aBesancon, P.1 aRouanet, J.M.0 tFood chemistry.g1994, v. 49, no. 4 p.403-406x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02592naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245007900167300001600246500010000262520128600362650001401648650001801662650001201680650001501692650001401707650001301721650001201734650001401746650001001760650003101770650001301801650001101814650001801825700001501843700001601858700001601874700001501890700001601905700001501921773014601936856005502082852000902137655001202146IND4533522120221116223642.0160212e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453352212DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYim, S.

For the investigation of possible use as functional materials, five Korean pear cultivars (âChuwhangbaeâ, âGamcheonbaeâ, âManpungbaeâ, âNiitakaâ, âHanareumâ) were studied at unripe stage to determine the physicochemical properties and chemical compositions. The cultivars were picked at 30 days after full bloom, and all samples were analyzed for external and physicochemical properties. The size of the fruit from all five cultivars was compared, and it was determined that fruit from âGamcheonbaeâ and âManpungbaeâ were large, while fruit from âChuwhangbaeâ were small. The moisture content ranged from 71.5-75.0%, with those of âHanareumâ being highest and âChuwhangbaeâ lowest. The contents of crude lipid (2.30-2.94%) and crude ash (4.57-4.89%) were significantly different among cultivars. Dietary fiber was 13.0-18.2%, significantly higher in âChuwhangbaeâ. The free sugar contents were 2.72-3.31% and were composed of sorbitol, fructose and glucose. Total phenolic and flavonoid content of 80% EtOH extract in âManpungbaeâ was higher than in other pears. 3acultivars 3adietary fiber 3aethanol 3aflavonoids 3aflowering 3afructose 3aglucose 3anutrients 3apears 3aphysicochemical properties 3asorbitol 3awastes 3awater content1 aKim, Y.

The disease is caused by the ascomycete Venturia inaequalis and V. pirina on apple and pear, respectively. Although they are two distinct species, their biological cycle is mainly the same. One distinction can be made, i.e., the appearance of twig scab on pears. Until now, most research concerning scab disease is performed on apples and as such, the disease management of pear scab is based on that of apple. However, we believe that the timing of the fungicides to control pear scab can be better positioned and that less fungicide spraying may be needed to control pear scab. For that reason an IWT (Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology)-funded research project to study pear scab in more detail during four years was performed. During this research infection moments of fruit were studied in more detail. Out of this research it became clear that on pears infections of fruit appear early in the season with delayed expression of the symptoms. 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aapples 3abranches 3adisease control 3aepidemiological studies 3afungicides 3aparasites 3apears 3aspraying1 aCeustermans, A.1 aCreemers, P.1 aBylemans, D.1 aMartens, D.1 aKeulemans, W.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 15, , no. 1094 p.457-461dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.60  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245005500176300001600231500010000247520085800347650002001205650002101225650001301246650001101259650001701270650001701287650001101304650002301315650002201338650001001360650001301370650001001383650002601393650001501419650001001434651001501444700001801459700001801477700001801495773014601513856005501659852000901714655001201723IND4533519920221116223838.0160211e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453351992DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Steenwyk, R.

Control of CM has relied on pheromone mating disruption combined with one or two insecticide applications. A large number of fruit remain in the trees after the final harvest and CM can infest these unharvested fruit. The majority of larvae that complete their development in these unharvested fruit will enter diapause and emerge the following year. If unharvested fruit can be removed and destroyed before CM can complete their larval development and enter diapause, then the diapausing population would be largely eliminated. Studies conducted in 1992 to 1994 on postharvest fruit removal demonstrated that diapausing larvae can be reduced up to 80% compared to unstripped orchards translating to a corresponding decrease in the CM moth flight the following year. 3aCydia pomonella 3acultural control 3adiapause 3aflight 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amating disruption 3amoths 3aorchards 3apears 3apesticide application 3apheromones 3atrees 3aCalifornia1 aFouche, C.

The nursery specialises in Proteaceae although the range is slowly expanding to complementary plant families. Except for two species which are propagated from seed the other cultivars currently in production are vegetatively propagated from mother stock. The mother stock is a high value section in the nursery and irrigation (fertigation) needs to be monitored very closely as these plants are sensitive to increased levels of nitrates and phosphate as well as water-logged conditions in winter and drying out during summer. Irrigation monitoring takes place by continuous logging soil moisture probes, weekly measuring of the total drainage water, and daily total irrigation water supplied, measuring the EC and checks by the nursery manager. Similar irrigation monitoring is done in the retail section (15-cm pots). Temperature is recorded by an automated weather station. The difference in EC calculated between the EC of the drainage water and EC of the irrigation water, as well as the soil moisture recorded with the probes, correlated well with mean daily and mean daily maximum temperature. Over time, analysis of data will improve the managerâs ability to make decisions concerning irrigation and reduce the risk. 3aProteaceae 3acoasts 3acontainer-grown plants 3acultivars 3acut flowers 3adata analysis 3adrainage water 3adrying 3aexports 3afarms 3afertigation 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3alogging 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3aplant nurseries 3arisk reduction 3asoil water 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweather 3awinter 3aSouth Africa0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 June 15, , no. 1085 p.9-12dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1085.2  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245005600134300001400190520087600204650000901080650001301089650001301102650001201115650001001127650001101137650000901148650001501157650001601172653001901188700001601207773006501223852000901288930003301297945001301330946001101343655001201354IND2040022520221116223537.0940603s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWanasundara, J.P.D.10aAlkanol-ammonia-water/hexane extraction of flaxseed  ap. 39-44.  aA two-phase solvent-extraction system consisting of alkanol-ammonia-water and hexane was employed for the simultaneous extraction of oil and detoxification of flaxseed meal. Alkanols used were methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol. The two-phase solvent extraction consisting of methanol-ammonia-water/hexane resulted in the highest protein enrichment of the meal. However, the process did not change the content of non-protein nitrogenous compounds to any great extent. The methanol-ammonia-water/hexane extraction system, in addition to reducing the content of cyanogenic glycosides, performed well in reducing the content of phenolic acids, condensed tannins, and soluble sugars of the meal. However, phytic acid was not removed from the meals (on a protein basis). The oil recovered from the non-polar phase of the solvent system had an unaltered fatty-acid composition. 3aflax 3aoilmeals 3aalcohols 3aammonia 3awater 3ahexane 3aoils 3aextraction 3amethodology 0adetoxification1 aShahidi, F.0 tFood chemistry.g1994, v. 49, no. 1 p.39-44x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02101naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245010600131300001400237520117900251650001801430650002001448650000901468650001101477650000901488650001701497650002001514650002101534650002101555700002201576700002201598773006501620852000901685930003301694945001301727946001101740655001201751IND2040023820221116223927.0940603s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno-Rojas, R.10aCopper, iron and zinc variations in Manchego-type cheese during the traditional cheese-making process  ap. 67-72.  aVariations in mineral content were determined throughout the process of making cheese by taking samples of natural, pasteurized milk, with additions of rennet, curd, whey, pressed curd, pressing whey, and cheese. The mean contents of copper, iron, and zinc in cheese were 1.03, 6.71, and 37.86 microgram/g, respectively, in fresh weight. The contribution of the consumption of this type of product to the daily-intake estimates in a Spanish diet are 3.22 microgram/day for copper, 20.9 microgram/day for iron, and 117.8 microgram/day for zinc. By an analysis of variance, the existence of statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) was confirmed in the products from the cheese-making for the three minerals, expressed as both fresh weight and dry weight. Certain differences were observed in the groups formed on using a Scheffe homogeneity test (p < 0.05) depending on whether the mineral content was expressed as fresh weight or as dry weight. Slight rises in the contents of the three minerals investigated as dry weight were attributed mainly to the retention time of the minerals by the curd and secondly, to possible contamination occurring during the process. 3awater content 3amanchego cheese 3azinc 3acopper 3airon 3acheesemaking 3amineral content 3afood composition 3anutrient content1 aAmaro-Lopez, M.A.1 aZurera-Cosano, G.0 tFood chemistry.g1994, v. 49, no. 1 p.67-72x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01347naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005500129300001400184500001500198520058800213650001300801650001400814650001100828650001500839653000900854653002300863700001600886773006500902852000900967930003300976945001301009946001101022655001201033IND2040024220221116223707.0940603s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWedzicha, B.L.10aKinetic effect of sulphite ion on ester hydrolysis  ap. 73-75.  a2019-12-05  aThe hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate at pH 6-8 is strongly catalysed by SO2-3 (rate/mol l-1 s-1 = 1.6[ester][SO2-3] at 28 degrees C; the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the uncatalysed reaction is of the order 10(-5) S-1 at pH 8).

No difference was found between the two fractions during the purification process. An eight-fold partially purified preparation was obtained after gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme has an optimum pH of 6.5. The apparent molecular weights, 30 000 +/- 5000 and 70 000 +/- 500, estimated by gel filtration are indicative of the presence of multiple forms. The thermal inactivation pattern agrees with the presence of two isoenzymes with different thermal stabilities, the values obtained for EA being 18 kJ/mol for the heat-resistant form. The greatest activity was found when 4-methyl catechol, catechol, pyrogallol, dopamine and L-dopa were used as substrates. The presence of trace quantities of dopamine in plantain pulp (2 micrograms/g of fresh matter) was established by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The plantain-polyphenol oxidase is inhibited by copper complexing agents and by reducing agents. One-hundred per cent inhibition was noted in the presence of sodium diethyl dithiocarbamate, L-cysteine, sodium metabisulphite and ascorbic acid (10(-3) M). At this concentration only 40% of inhibition was obtained with potassium cyanide. Determination of browning during flour preparation shows that the enzyme may be efficiently inactivated using sodium metabisulphite. This compound also prevents nonenzymatic browning during the slicing and drying steps of preparation of plantain flour. 3adopamine 3amolecular weight 3acatechol oxidase 3ainactivation 3aenzyme inhibitors 3amaturity stage 3apH 3aheat treatment 3aenzyme activity 3abananas 0apurification 0astability1 aSignoret, A.1 aCrouzet, J.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 4 p.341-347x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01959naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245520109600261650001601357650001401373650001601387650001301403650002101416653001901437653001501456700001501471700001401486773006701500852000901567930003301576945001301609946001101622655001201633IND2040036820221116224323.0940603s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204003682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammad, K.14aThe appropriateness of using cyanocobalamin as calibration standards in competitive binding assays of vitamin B12  ap. 423-425.  aThe forms of vitamin B12 that have been found in foods are cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, sulphitocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin. These cobalamins, with the exception of sulphitocobalamin, are also known to be present in serum and plasma. The addition of sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide, sodium metabisulphite or sodium nitrite in the extraction procedure employed for the determination of vitamin B12, however, can convert these cobalamins into derivatives which include dicyanocobalamin and nitritocobalamin. It was observed that cyanocobalamin has a binding affinity for hog intrinsic factor equal to that of methylcobalamin, dicyanocobalamin and nitritocobalamin, but not to that of hydroxocobalamin, sulphitocobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Thus, these latter three cobalamins cannot be measured accurately using a competitive binding assay which employs hog intrinsic factor as its binding protein and cyanocobalamin as the calibration standards unless they are converted to cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, dicyanocobalamin or nitritocobalamin before the assay. 3avitamin B12 3abioassays 3acalibration 3aaccuracy 3abinding proteins 0acyanocobalamin 0acobalamins1 aBriggs, D.1 aJones, G.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 4 p.423-425x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01517naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007600128300001400204520073600218650001700954650001200971650001900983650002101002650002201023700001901045700002001064773006501084852000901149930003301158945001301191946001101204655001201215IND2040221320221116223443.0940613s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204022132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitifer, L.A.10aAnalysis of pectin content and degree of polymerization in orange juice  ap. 29-32.  aA study was conducted where orange juice pectin and reducing endgroups were measured to determine the degree of polymerization of the pectic substances in freshly-squeezed orange juice.

Protein digestive acceptability of unprocessed and extruded cereals was determined using an in-vitro method of enzymatic hydrolysis. The most protein-digestible products were produced at extrusion combination: 15% feed moisture, 100 degrees C/150 degrees C product temperature and 100 rpm. This effect was significant when considered across all cereals.

Peanuts are high-risk agricultural commodities for natural contamination by aflatoxins. The present investigation highlights the fate of aflatoxin B1 during the industrial processing of naturally contaminated raw peanuts to edible defatted peanut protein flour, meant for human consumption. Raw peanuts were separated, defatted and further processed to produce edible peanut protein flour. Samples taken at each stage were analysed for aflatoxin B1. Shrivelled peanuts had the highest content of aflatoxin B1 (126 +/- 11 ppb), while the hand-picked selected peanuts had the lowest (9 +/- 4.2 ppb). Defatted peanut protein flour had a higher level of aflatoxin B1 (52 +/- 6.9 ppb) than the hand-picked selected peanuts. The possible mechanism for accumulation of aflatoxin B1 in the peanut protein flour, which is the final product of the industrial processing, is discussed. 3apeanut flour 3afood contamination 3aaflatoxins 3afood processing 3afood composition 3apeanut protein 0afood safety0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 4 p.349-352x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01730naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245005900155300001800214520076300232650000900995650004101004650002301045650001001068650001901078650001401097650001901111700001501130773010201145852000901247856007701256930003301333945001301366946001301379655001201392IND2124296920221116223804.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212429692DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960940w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtery, R.G.10a2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone in corn products  ap. 1306-1308.  a2,5-Dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (DHF) was identified (GC-MS) in canned, frozen (cooked), and fresh (cooked) sweet corn.

SDS-PAGE showed the affinity-purified enzyme to have two molecular forms, 57 and 53 kDa, together with their probable autolysates appearing as two small bands at 35 and 25 kDa. Compared with the other three bands, the 57 kDa band reacted strongly on western blot analysis. The affinity-purified oryzasin pH optimum for hydrolysis is 3.0 and is completely inhibited by pepstatin but not affected by other proteinase inhibitors such as EDTA, leupeptin, PMSF, and E-64. The milk-clotting activity of oryzasin was investigated using the crude enzyme obtained by precipitation at 30% and 60% (NH4)2SO4 saturation. The enzyme clotted a skim milk solution at pH 6.3, yielding the same kappa-casein digest pattern as those of chymosin and pepsin producing a 12 kDa band. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aWestern blotting 3aammonium sulfate 3aanion exchange chromatography 3achymosin 3acysteine proteinases 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3akappa-casein 3amilk clotting 3apH 3apepsin 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3arice 3aseeds 3askim milk1 aWatanabe, H.1 aAbe, K.1 aArai, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1070-1075x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960582x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03638naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001700180245016400197300001800361500002400379520108300403650002401486650002101510650001701531650003001548650001801578650004901596650001801645650001601663650002701679650001601706650002901722650002201751650001901773650001801792650001401810650001301824650002101837650002601858650004001884650004001924650002601964650002801990650002602018650003702044650002202081650004102103650005002144650002802194650002002222650003602242650001302278650002702291650003302318650001802351650003602369650003702405653002402442653002702466653002402493700001702517700001902534700002102553773011002574852000902684856009202693930003302785945002502818946001302843655001202856IND4425509920221116223421.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442550992DNAL7 a198954892pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01293.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2001 aMohan, Anand10aInactivation of Bacillus atrophaeus Spores with Surface-Active Peracids and Characterization of Formed Free Radicals Using Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy  ap.

Bacillus atrophaeus spores were injected directly into 3 different concentrations of the peracid disinfectant (1.1%, 1.3%, or 1.5%) for various times (5, 10, 15, or 20 s) at 3 different temperatures (50, 60, or 70 °C) to evaluate the sporicidal activity of the disinfectant mixture. Spectroscopy revealed that the combination of hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and octanoic acid were highly effective at forming a complex mixture of sporicidal, free radical intermediates including hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. Individual components of this mixture alone were not as effective as the final combination. This information has practical applications in the food industry for design of effective sanitation and disinfection agents and suggests that kinetic models could be developed to account for both the physical removal and localized inactivation of spores on food-contact surfaces. 3aBacillus atrophaeus 3abacterial spores 3ainactivation 3asurface active properties 3afree radicals 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3adisinfectants 3asurfactants 3achemical concentration 3atemperature 3aantibacterial properties 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aperacetic acid 3aoctanoic acid 3asynergism 3akinetics 3asuperoxide anion 3afood contact surfaces 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacillusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCaprylatesxchemistry 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Combinations 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aEquipment Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFree Radicalsxanalysis 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aOxidantsxpharmacology 2aPeracetic Acidxpharmacology 2aSpin Trapping 2aSpores, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemistry 0asporicidal activity 0ahydroxyl free radicals 0aalkyl free radicals1 aDunn, Joseph1 aHunt, MelvinC.1 aSizer, CharlesE.0 tJournal of food science.g2009 Sept., v. 74, no. 7 p.M411-M417dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01293.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091106b20091204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/10/15  aOther US 7aarticle03624naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002600180245011300206300001800319500002400337500001500361520089700376650001501273650002201288650001801310650002601328650002001354650001001374650002701384650001401411650002901425650001101454650002501465650002301490650001401513650001601527650001001543650002601553650001501579650001901594650001301613650002001626650001201646650002601658650003501684650003401719650001701753650004101770650005901811650006701870650003801937650001701975650002701992650001402019650001102033650003402044650003202078650003202110650004502142650002702187650003802214650003602252650004502288651001002333653001702343700002102360700002502381700001902406700002102425700003002446773011002476852000902586856009202595930003302687945002502720946001302745655001202758IND4425509720221116223534.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442550972DNAL7 a198954872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01290.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2021 aRuiz-Moyano, Santiago10aSafety and Functional Aspects of Preselected Enterococci for Probiotic Use in Iberian Dry-Fermented Sausages  ap.

The strain Enterococcus faecium SE906 was able to establish itself on the intestinal epithelium, inhibiting such pathogenic bacteria as Listeria monocytogenes in vitro. This strain was also considered safe to be used for its low aminogenic potential, and its antibiotic resistance pattern and virulence determinants, being identified as a potential probiotic meat starter culture suitable for manufacture of dry-fermented Iberian sausages. 3adried meat 3atraditional foods 3acell adhesion 3afunctional properties 3afermented foods 3afeces 3aListeria monocytogenes 3avirulence 3aantimicrobial properties 3ahumans 3aEnterococcus faecium 3astrain differences 3ahemolysis 3afood safety 3aswine 3aantibiotic resistance 3aprobiotics 3afood pathogens 3asausages 3abiogenic amines 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agents 2aBacterial Adhesionxphysiology 2aBiogenic Aminesxbiosynthesis 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEnterococcusxdrug effectsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aEnterococcus faeciumxdrug effectsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aEscherichia coli O157xphysiology 2aFermentation 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHemolysis 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxphysiology 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aProbioticsxadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aSalmonellaxphysiology 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aVancomycin Resistancexgenetics 2aVirulence Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 3aSpain 0aEnterococcus1 aMartin, Alberto.1 aBenito, María José1 aAranda, Emilio1 aCasquete, Rocío1 aCórdoba, María de Guía0 tJournal of food science.g2009 Sept., v. 74, no. 7 p.M398-M404dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01290.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091105b20091204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/10/15  aOther US 7aarticle01981naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245008600150300001800236520091200254650001601166650002301182650001001205650001601215650001301231650001801244650001301262650003501275700001601310700001801326700001501344773010301359852000901462856007701471930003301548945001301581946001301594655001201607IND2138029820221116224145.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802982DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960906h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeli, L.10aExtractable and nonextractable (bound) residues of acifluorfen in an organic soil  ap. 3677-3680.  aAcifluorfen (AC), 5-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-2-nitrobenzoic acid, was applied to an organic soil at 220 mg kg-1 in a laboratory incubation study. A conventional extraction method with solvents and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) were used to evaluate extractable and nonextractable (bound) residues of AC and its metabolites in the soil. Over an incubation period of 7 months, the soil contained 22% AC of the initially applied herbicide and the residues were almost completely extracted with aqueous methanol. Only 0.8% AC was found in the bound form. Seventy-five percent AC applied was degraded to aminoacifluorfen (AAC) (due to reduction of nitro group to amino group) of which 60% was extracted by aqueous methanol, and 15% was in the bound form, mainly associated with the humin fraction of the soil organic matter. No further transformation of AAC to other metabolites was observed. 3aacifluorfen 3aherbicide residues 3ahumin 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3aorganic soils 3asolvents 3asupercritical fluid extraction1 aGennari, M.1 aSchnitzer, M.1 aKhan, S.U.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3677-3680x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960906h3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01904naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245010300153300001800256520073900274650001801013650001101031650004301042650001501085650002801100650002101128650001701149650001801166650001601184700001401200700001501214700001601229700001301245773010301258852000901361856007701370930003301447945001301480946001301493655001201506IND2138027320221116223540.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802732DNAL7 a10.1021/jf97017042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, A.G.10aRapid determination of sugars, nonvolatile acids, and ascorbic acid in strawberry and other fruits  ap. 3545-3549.  aAn analytical procedure to determine major sugars and organic acids, including vitamin C, in fruits was developed using a C18 Sep-Pak cleanup process and an ion exclusion HPLC column.

Major) were investigated after beans were soaked in distilled water, citric acid, and sodium bicarbonate solutions. The soaking solution was discarded. The effect of cooking -- discarding both soaking and cooking solutions -- was also studied. Finally, a dry-heating process was examined. Soaking treatment produced a slight decrease of trypsin inhibitor activity. Cooking the presoaked seeds brought about the total or partial removal of TIA, depending on the soaking solution used. TIA was partially removed after dry-heating. Trypsin inhibitor activity analyses were completed with 28-day biological trials for raw and dry-heated faba beans. For 21 and 28 days of experimental time food intake, protein intake, and weight gain were similar for rats fed raw and dry-heated faba beans. However, after 28 days protein efficiency ratio (PER) and food transformation index (FTI) improved in rats fed dry-heated faba beans compared with those fed raw faba beans. This was related to lower TIA values found in dry-heated faba beans. 3aVicia faba 3acitric acid 3acooking 3afaba beans 3afood intake 3apresoaking 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aprotein intake 3arats 3aseeds 3asodium bicarbonate 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aweight gain1 aFrais, J.1 aDiaz-Pollan, C.1 aFernández, M.1 aLopez-Jurado, M.1 aUrbano, G.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3559-3564x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf97002363Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02175naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001400137245007200151300001800223520102900241650002201270650001201292650001601304650001101320650002301331650001901354650001901373650001701392650001901409650001901428650001601447650002101463700002001484700001401504773010201518852000901620856007701629930003301706945001301739946001301752655001201765IND2124302020221116223649.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212430202DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960499+2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, S.K.10aNovel slow-releasing micronutrient fertilizers. 2.

Kinetics of polymerization of cupric phosphate at various Cu:P ratios and temperatures were studied, and the products were characterized. The desired fertilizers were formulated by selecting the appropriate copper polyphosphates and then neutralizing them to improve their properties. The fertilizers were analyzed by chemical methods, IR, XRD, solubility studies, and plant growth experiments. They were observed to have short-chain P-O-P linkages and contain amorphous as well as crystalline phases. Their water solubility was < 5%, but in organic complexants, like citric acid or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, solubilities were > 90%, thereby indicating excellent plant availability. Plant growth experiments showed that copper calcium polyphosphate is an efficient source of copper, comparable to CuSO4; however, lower dosages are required with the former than with the latter. 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalcium 3acitric acid 3acopper 3acopper fertilizers 3acopper sulfate 3aneutralization 3aplant growth 3apolymerization 3apolyphosphates 3atemperature 3awater solubility1 aVaradachari, C.1 aGhosh, K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1447-1453x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960499+3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02047naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245013500154300001800289520084900307650002001156650001901176650002701195650001001222650002101232650001001253650001101263650004301274650001701317650001401334650001101348650002401359700001801383773010301401852000901504856007701513930003301590945001301623946001301636655001201649IND2138025320221116223848.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802532DNAL7 a10.1021/jf97015942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakasaki, S.10aFormation of protein-bound 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 5-S-cysteinyl-3,4,-dihydroxyphenylalanine as new cross-linkers in gluten  ap. 3472-3475.  aThe formation of protein-bound 5-S-cysteinyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (5-S-cysteinyldopa) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) as new cross-linkers in gluten was investigated. Gas-phase acid hydrolysis of gluten was carried out in the presence of 5% phenol. For identification of dopa and 5-S-cysteinyldopa, alumina extraction of catechols in the hydrolysates was performed. The presence of dopa and 5-S-cysteinyldopa in the hydrolysates of gluten was determined using HPLC equipped with an electrochemical detector. When mushroom tyrosinase, which has an oxidant-like effect on the physical properties of dough, was added to dough, the amount of protein-bound 5-S-cysteinyldopa increased. It is concluded that the oxidizing effect of tyrosinase is due to the formation of protein-bound 5-S-cysteinyldopa and dopa as cross-linkers of gluten. 3aacid hydrolysis 3aaluminum oxide 3adihydroxyphenylalanine 3adough 3aelectrochemistry 3agases 3agluten 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysates 3amushrooms 3aphenol 3aphysical properties1 aKawakishi, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3472-3475x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf97015943Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02137naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245012000153300001800273520100100291650001501292650001601307650001401323650001801337650001801355650002301373650000701396650001501403650003701418700001201455700001901467700001901486773010101505852000901606856007701615930003301692945001301725946001301738655001201751IND2163498720221116224057.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216349872DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960638n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaron, C.P.10aDirect measurement of lipid peroxidation in oil-in-water emulsions using multiwavelength derivative UV-spectroscopy  ap. 1741-1745.  aUsing second-derivative multiwavelength UV-spectral data (200-300 nm), it was possible to measure lipid peroxidation in oil-in-water lipid emulsions using a multivariate calibration method (partial least squares regression). For a linoleic acid emulsion (0.42 mM in phosphate buffer, pH 5.5-7.0), with metmyoglobin or ferrylmyoglobin as initiator, conjugated dienes could not be quantified by direct single-wavelength absorption spectroscopy (234, 244, or 280 nm) when compared to a reference method based on ether extraction and second-derivative spectroscopy at 234 nm. Direct multiwavelength absorption (200-300 nm) and second-derivative methods (234, 244, 280 nm, and 200-300 nm) provided superior results with high correlation coefficients (r ranged from 0.78 to 0.98) when compared to the standard extraction method. The multiwavelength second-derivative method (200-300 nm) gave the highest correlation and is recommended for on-line control of lipid peroxidation in heterogeneous systems. 3aabsorption 3acorrelation 3aemulsions 3aleast squares 3alinoleic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3apH 3aphosphates 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aBro, R.1 aSkibsted, L.H.1 aAndersen, H.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1741-1745x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960638n3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01640naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245011600155300001800271520063200289650001500921650001100936650001900947650003700966650001601003700002101019700002801040773010101068852000901169856007701178930003301255945001301288946001301301655001201314IND2163496520221116223516.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216349652DNAL7 a10.1021/jf96060602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranac, J.M.10aSpectrophotometric study of anthocyan copigmentation reactions. 3.

The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters obtained (K = 137 M-1, DeltaG degrees = -12.2 kJ/mol, DeltaH = -37.4 kJ/mol, DeltaS = -84.6 J/K mol) were correlated with the structure of the flavone used. 3aapigenin 3amalvin 3apH 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aPetranovic, N.A.1 aDimitric-Markovic, J.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1701-1703x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960612w3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02682naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245011000152300001800262520134400280650004401624650002301668650001701691650003801708650001101746650001301757650000901770650000901779650001901788650001101807650000701818650003201825650002201857650003701879700001301916700001501929700002001944700001401964773010101978852000902079856007702088930003302165945001302198946001302211655001202224IND2163488620221116224035.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216348862DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960622x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoye, J.I.10aMolecular and microstructural studies of thermal denaturation and gelation of beta-lactoglobulins A and B  ap. 1608-1618.  aThe thermal properties of beta-lactoglobulins (beta-lg) A and B at pH 3, 5, 7, and 8.6 were studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor changes in the secondary structure of the proteins when heated from 25 to 95 degrees C. The microstructure of beta-lg A and B gels made from 10% (w/v) protein solutions by heating at 90 degrees C for 30 min was studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. beta-Lg B had greater thermal stability and required more energy to denature than beta-lg A; denaturation of beta-lg B was also more cooperative. Infrared spectroscopy showed that beta-lg B had a higher proportion of beta-sheet than the A variant at pH 3 and 5. At pH 7 and 8.6 the secondary structures of the two variants were similar. At all four pH values, aggregation bands (1682 and approximately 1622 cm-1) were observed when the proteins were heated. Electron microscopy showed that the gel matrix of beta-lg B at both acid and alkaline pH was made up of larger aggregate structures than beta-lg A. The aggregates formed by both variants were large (1-2 micrometer) and globular at acid pH but much smaller (nanometer range) and amorphous at alkaline pH. This information provides a useful model for studying the relationship between protein structure and function. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3adenaturation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenergy 3agelation 3agels 3aheat 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3apH 3aprotein secondary structure 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMa, C.Y.1 aIsmail, A.1 aHarwalkar, V.R.1 aKalab, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1608-1618x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960622x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02028naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245010400155300001800259520097800277650002301255650001001278650001601288650001201304650002501316650001901341650002101360650001001381700001501391700001401406773010101420852000901521856007701530930003301607945001301640946001301653655001201666IND2163486620221116223832.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216348662DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960798z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco, Z.I.10aEnzymic availability of starch in cooked black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L) and cowpeas (Vigna sp.)  ap. 1548-1551.  aThe starch content of black beans and cowpeas was assessed enzymatically in freshly cooked as well as in cooked, stored, and reheated samples. The available starch contents of the variously treated seeds were greater in cowpeas (32-33%, dmb) than in black beans (25-28%, dmb). All samples exhibited relatively high levels of retrograded resistant starch (RS) (8-20%, total starch basis), although beans showed higher contents of this fraction. No major difference in RS formation was observed between conventional and microwave reheating. Total starch was slightly decreased in stored/reheated black beans compared to that in the freshly cooked seeds. In vitro enzymic hydrolysis indices (HI) and corresponding predicted glycemic indices (pGI) of cowpea samples were 2-fold greater than those registered for beans. Reheating, and particularly microwaving, increased the amylolysis course parameters of black beans without altering the enzymic availability of cowpea starch. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aVigna 3ablack beans 3acowpeas 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aglycemic index 3aresistant starch 3aseeds1 aRascon, A.1 aTovar, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1548-1551x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960798z3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02341naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245007500155300001800230520115500248650000801403650001501411650001601426650001601442650001701458650001501475650001101490650001201501650001001513650000901523700001601532700001401548700001801562700001501580700001601595700001701611700002101628773010101649852000901750856007701759930003301836945001301869946001301882655001201895IND2163512620221116223627.0980820e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216351262DNAL7 a10.1021/jf96065182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolognesi, C.10aGenotoxic activity of glyphosate and its technical formulation roundup  ap. 1957-1962.  aGlyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine) is an effective herbicide acting on the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants. The genotoxic potential of this herbicide has been studied: the results available in the open literature reveal a weak activity of the technical formulation. In this study, the formulated commercial product, Roundup, and its active agent, glyphosate, were tested in the same battery of assays for the induction of DNA damage and chromosomal effects in vivo and in vitro. Swiss CD1 mice were treated intraperitoneally with test substances, and the DNA damage was evaluated by alkaline elution technique and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) quantification in liver and kidney. The chromosomal damage of the two pesticide preparations was also evaluated in vivo in bone marrow of mice as micronuclei frequency and in vitro in human lymphocyte culture as SCE frequency. A DNA-damaging activity as DNA single-strand breaks and 8-OHdG and a significant increase in chromosomal alterations were observed with both substances in vivo and in vitro. A weak increment of the genotoxic activity was evident using the technical formulation. 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aamino acids 3abone marrow 3agenotoxicity 3aglyphosate 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliver 3amice1 aBonatti, S.1 aDegan, P.1 aGallerani, E.1 aPeluso, M.1 aRabboni, R.1 aRoggieri, P.1 aAbbondandolo, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1957-1962x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf96065183Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02251naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245011300155300001800268520112700286650001401413650001401427650002001441650002301461650000901484650001601493650002601509650002301535650001101558650001401569700001801583700001801601773010101619852000901720856007701729930003301806945001301839946001301852655001201865IND2163504120221116223621.0980820e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216350412DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960550+2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPastore, R.J.10aDimethyl sulfoxide extraction method for the liquid chromatographic analysis of microencapsulated vitamin D3  ap. 1784-1786.  aA more time efficient and simpler method than methods based upon AOAC procedure 979.24 was developed for the analysis of concentrated microencapsulated vitamin D3. The improved efficiency and simplicity begins with the use of a 10% water in DMSO solution to dissolve the sample matrix. A 2.0 mL DMSO volume is combined with 200 mg of microencapsulated vitamin D3 in a flask or bottle. The mixture stands without agitation for 10 min when testing a starch matrix sample and for 30-60 min when testing a cellulose matrix sample. Five minutes of sonication or heating is required for vitamin A/D combinations. Next, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) is pipetted into the DMSO solution-sample mixture. The isooctane volume used was proportional to the sample concentration; specific isooctane volumes relative to sample concentrations are provided. The mixture is stirred for ca. 5 min using a magnetic stirrer. The supernatant is filtered through a 0.2 micrometer PTFE membrane into a suitable LC vial and chromatographed. Validation data which support equivalence to traditional AOAC 979.24-based methodology are presented. 3aagitation 3acellulose 3acholecalciferol 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aheat 3aiso-octanes 3aliquid chromatography 3amicroencapsulation 3astarch 3avitamin A1 aDunnett, R.V.1 aWebster, G.K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1784-1786x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960550+3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01789naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245011400156300001800270520071500288650000901003650001001012650002301022650001201045650001101057650003101068651001001099700001601109700001301125700001601138700001501154773010101169852000901270856007701279930003301356945001301389946001301402655001201415IND2163508720221116223951.0980820e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216350872DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960266i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuadayol, J.M.10aExtraction, separation and identification of volatile organic compounds from paprika oleoresin (Spanish type)  ap. 1868-1872.  aIn the present work the extraction, separation, identification, and quantification of VOCs in paprika oleoresin were performed.

Microsatellite markers are generally more polymorphic than other types of molecular markers such as allozymes or SNPs because the insertions/deletions that give rise to microsatellite variability are relatively common compared to nucleotide substitutions. Nevertheless, direct evidence of microsatellite mutation rates (MMRs) is lacking in most vertebrate groups despite the importance of such estimates to key population parameters (e.g., genetic differentiation or θ = 4N e μ). Herein, we present empirical data on MMRs in eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum). We conducted captive breeding trials and genotyped over 1,000 offspring at a suite of microsatellite loci. These data on 7,906 allele transfers provide the first direct estimates of MMRs in amphibians, and they illustrate that MMRs can vary by more than an order of magnitude across loci within a given species (one locus had ten mutations whereas the others had none). 3aAmbystoma tigrinum 3aallozymes 3aamphibians 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aprogeny 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAmbystomaxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aMutagenesis 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic1 aMcCormick, Cory R.1 aGopurenko, David1 aWilliams, Rod N.1 aBos, David H.1 aDeWoody, J.

Using actinic light with a peak at 697 nm for preferential light absorption by Photosystem I while also stimulating Photosystem II to improve redox poising, the cyclic electron flux after 60 s of illumination was a substantial proportion (33-44%) of the total electron flux through PSI at irradiances up to ~1,070 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹. At the maximum irradiance, the cyclic electron flux changed little with the progressive water loss from leaf tissue up to ~60%; by contrast, the linear electron flux was approximately halved. A reason for this differential effect of water stress on the capacity for cyclic and linear electron flow could be the increased crowding of soluble proteins in the stroma due to chloroplast shrinkage. Indeed the confinement of soluble proteins to a smaller chloroplast volume was indicated by cryo-scanning electron microscopy. It is known that the diffusion coefficient of large proteins is decreased when the background concentration of small proteins is raised; by contrast, the diffusion coefficient of small proteins is not affected by increasing the concentration of a large protein (Muramatsu and Minton in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85:2984-2988, 1988). Therefore, we suggest that linear electron flow, being coupled to the Calvin-Benson cycle, is limited by the diffusion of large macromolecules, especially the ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase complex. By contrast, cyclic electron flow, involving relatively small macromolecules such as ferredoxin, is less susceptible to inhibition by crowding in the stroma. 3aCalvin cycle 3aabsorption 3aair 3adiffusivity 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectrons 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3alighting 3aphotosystem I 3aphotosystem II 3aproteins 3ashrinkage 3aspinach 3awater stress 3aUnited States1 aOguchi, Riichi1 aHope, Alexander B.1 aBarber, James1 aChow, Wah Soon0 tPlanta.g2008 Oct., v. 228, no. 5 p.803-812dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-008-0783-4 7aarticle02401naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002200136245010200158300001800260500002400278520144400302650001101746650001601757650001101773650001401784650001501798651001801813700002001831700001601851700002001867700001701887773011101904852000902015856003902024655001202063IND4459843620221116223356.0110708e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445984362DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.79962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Marwan A.10aSuspended sediment balance for the mainstem of Changjiang (Yangtze River) in the period 1964-1985  ap. 2339-2353.  aIncludes references  aSuspended sediment dynamics during the period 1964-1985 are examined along the mainstem of Changjiang (Yangtze River). The period represents a basin condition prior to major changes in land management policy and dam building on the river's mainstem. The downstream sediment dynamics reflect basin geology and topography and channel morphology. Sediment exchange within the mainstem was calculated by the development of reach sediment balances that reveal complex temporal and spatial patterns. There is relatively little sediment exchange in the upper, bedrock-controlled reaches, with systematic increases in the downstream alluvial reaches. Degrading, transfer, and aggrading reaches were identified. Relations between input and output in all reaches were significant but no relation was found between sediment exchange and input/output. Comparison between ‘short-term' (22 years) and ‘long-term' (52 years) records demonstrates the importance of the record length in studying the suspended sediment dynamics in a large fluvial system. The longer record yielded better correlation and different trends than the shorter record. Sediment transfer (output/input ratio) changes downstream: the dominance of the upstream contributing area in sustaining the appearance of net degradation through most of the river system highlights the importance of reach length on characterisation of suspended sediment dynamics in large fluvial systems. 3abasins 3aland policy 3arivers 3asediments 3atopography 3aYangtze River1 aChurch, Michael1 aYan, Yunxia1 aSlaymaker, Olav1 aXu, Jiongxin0 tHydrological processes.g2011 July 15, v. 25, no. 15 p.2339-2353dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7996 7aarticle02907naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194072000900203072000900212100002100221245008800242300001800330500002400348500001500372520098100387650002001368650002301388650003501411650002201446650001501468650001601483650002701499650001501526650001801541650001301559650001501572650002801587650005001615650001201665650001401677650004401691650002601735650002501761650003101786653003801817653002701855653002301882700001801905700002501923700002101948773012201969852000902091856008802100930003302188945002502221946001102246655001202257IND4425684720221116223424.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568472DNAL7 a195008912pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH000 0aJ500 0aL600 0aL810 0aL2101 aMann, Reinier M.10aAmphibians and agricultural chemicals: Review of the risks in a complex environment  ap. 2903-2927.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAgricultural landscapes, although often highly altered in nature, provide habitat for many species of amphibian. However, the persistence and health of amphibian populations are likely to be compromised by the escalating use of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. This review examines some of the issues relating to exposure of amphibian populations to these chemicals and places emphasis on mechanisms of toxicity. Several mechanisms are highlighted, including those that may disrupt thyroid activity, retinoid pathways, and sexual differentiation. Special emphasis is also placed on the various interactions that may occur between different agro-chemicals and between chemicals and other environmental factors. We also examine the indirect effects on amphibian populations that occur when their surrounding pond communities are altered by chemicals. The literature on the various mechanisms by which amphibians may be affected by agricultural chemicals is reviewed. 3awater pollution 3asexual development 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aimmunosuppression 3aamphibians 3afertilizers 3aenvironmental exposure 3apollutants 3aagrochemicals 3atoxicity 3apesticides 2aAgrochemicalsxtoxicity 2aAmphibiansxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effects 2aFertilizersxtoxicity 2aPesticidesxtoxicity 2aReproductionxdrug effects 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0agrowth and development 0aliterature reviews1 aHyne, Ross V.1 aChoung, Catherine B.1 aWilson, Scott P.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.2903-2927dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20090924b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02639naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001700185245009000202300001800292500002400310500001500334520104200349650002001391650002701411650001701438650001201455650001601467650002501483650002801508650002901536650003301565650002201598650004101620650002801661651001001689651001001699653001501709700001901724700001701743700001501760700001701775700001701792773012201809852000901931856008801940930003302028945002502061946001102086655001202097IND4425685720221116223126.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568572DNAL7 a195640642pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP2001 aFeng, Xinbin10aGeochemical processes of mercury in Wujiangdu and Dongfeng reservoirs, Guizhou, China  ap. 2970-2984.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe geochemical processes of mercury in Dongfeng (DF) and Wujiangdu (WJD) reservoirs, which were constructed in 1992 and 1979, respectively in Wujiang River, which is the upper branch of Yangtze River were investigated. One sampling site was chosen upriver of 1 km from the dam for each reservoir. Three sampling campaigns were conducted at these sampling sites in December 2003, April 2004 and July 2004, respectively. The distributions of different mercury species in the water column, sediment, and sediment pore water were studied. We found that the sediment is the net source of both inorganic and MeHg to the water column for both reservoirs. The MeHg diffusion fluxes in WJD reservoir at all sampling campaigns were significantly higher than those in DF reservoir. Our study demonstrated that the high primary productivity in the reservoir produced elevated organic matter content that would favor the methylmercury production in sediment. Surface sediment in the reservoirs is the active mercury methylating sites in the systems. 3awater pollution 3asediment contamination 3ageochemistry 3amercury 3amethylation 3aspatial distribution 3amethylmercury compounds 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aMercuryxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Supplyxanalysis. 3aChina 0aChina 0areservoirs1 aJiang, Hongmei1 aQiu, Guangle1 aYan, Haiyu1 aLi, Guanghui1 aLi, Zhonggen0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.2970-2984dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.06.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02836naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001400148245011800162300001800280500002400298520174200322650001702064650001902081650002002100650002302120650001102143650002002154650002302174700001902197700001502216700001602231700001602247700001602263700001502279773010802294852000902402856005102411655001202462IND4443108120221116223623.0101001e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444310812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2010.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLomba, A.10aOvercoming the rare species modelling paradox: A novel hierarchical framework applied to an Iberian endemic plant  ap. 2647-2657.  aIncludes references  aRare species have restricted geographic ranges, habitat specialization, and/or small population sizes. Datasets on rare species distribution usually have few observations, limited spatial accuracy and lack of valid absences; conversely they provide comprehensive views of species distributions allowing to realistically capture most of their realized environmental niche. Rare species are the most in need of predictive distribution modelling but also the most difficult to model. We refer to this contrast as the “rare species modelling paradox” and propose as a solution developing modelling approaches that deal with a sufficiently large set of predictors, ensuring that statistical models are not over-fitted. Our novel approach fulfils this condition by fitting a large number of bivariate models and averaging them with a weighted ensemble approach. We further propose that this ensemble forecasting is conducted within a hierarchic multi-scale framework. We present two ensemble models for a test species, one at regional and one at local scale, each based on the combination of 630 models. In both cases, we obtained excellent spatial projections, unusual when modelling rare species. Model results highlight, from a statistically sound approach, the effects of multiple drivers in a same modelling framework and at two distinct scales. From this added information, regional models can support accurate forecasts of range dynamics under climate change scenarios, whereas local models allow the assessment of isolated or synergistic impacts of changes in multiple predictors. This novel framework provides a baseline for adaptive conservation, management and monitoring of rare species at distinct spatial and temporal scales. 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aindigenous species 3aniches 3apopulation size 3astatistical models1 aPellissier, L.1 aRandin, C.1 aVicente, J.1 aMoreira, F.1 aHonrado, J.1 aGuisan, A.0 tBiological conservation.g2010 Nov., v. 143, no. 11 p.2647-2657dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2010.07.007 7aarticle04226naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170072000900179100002100188245017300209300001800382500002400400500001500424520162400439650002202063650003602085650001802121650002402139650002702163650001902190650001902209650001802228650001502246650002502261650001102286650002302297650002002320650003302340650001902373650002002392650002302412650001202435650002802447650001102475650001502486650000702501650002502508650004202533650004502575650002802620650002602648650004502674650004302719650003302762650004602795650003802841650004602879650002302925650001702948650003802965653001003003653002603013653003603039700001803075700002303093700002203116773010803138852000903246856008203255930003303337945002503370946001303395655001203408IND4425683220221116223248.0090908e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568322DNAL7 a196560522pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-22-9-11792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF831 0aF2001 aFelle, Hubert H.14aThe Mycorrhiza Fungus Piriformospora indica Induces Fast Root-Surface pH Signaling and Primes Systemic Alkalinization of the Leaf Apoplast Upon Powdery Mildew Infection  ap. 1179-1185.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe analyze here, by noninvasive electrophysiology, local and systemic plant responses in the interaction of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with the root-colonizing basidiomycete Piriformospora indica. In the short term (seconds, minutes), a constant flow of P. indica chlamydospores along primary roots altered surface pH characteristics; whereas the root-hair zone transiently alkalized--a typical elicitor response--the elongation zone acidified, indicative of enhanced H+ extrusion and plasma membrane H+ ATPase stimulation. Eight to 10 min after treating roots with chlamydospores, the apoplastic pH of leaves began to acidify, which contrasts with observations of an alkalinization response to various stressors and microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). In the long term (days), plants with P. indica-colonized roots responded to inoculation with the leaf-pathogenic powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei with a leaf apoplastic pH increase of about 2, while the leaf apoplast of noncolonized barley responded to B. graminis f. sp. hordei merely with a pH increase of 0.8. The strong apoplastic pH response is reminiscent of B. graminis f. sp. hordei-triggered pH shifts in resistance gene-mediated resistant barley leaves or upon treatment with a chemical resistance inducer. In contrast, the MAMP N-acetylchito-octaose did not induce resistance to B. graminis f. sp. hordei and did not trigger the primed apoplastic pH shift. We speculate that the primed pH increase is indicative of and supports the potentiated systemic response to B. graminis f. sp. hordei-induced by P. indica in barley. 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. hordei 3aion transport 3asignal transduction 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3achlamydospores 3aalkalinization 3aBasidiomycota 3aendophytes 3aintercellular spaces 3abarley 3agenetic resistance 3aHordeum vulgare 3asystemic acquired resistance 3apowdery mildew 3agene expression 3adisease resistance 3aprotons 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aleaves 3aroot hairs 3apH 2aAlkaliesxmetabolism 2aAscomycotaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBasidiomycotaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aHordeumxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aMycorrhizaexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aSpores, Fungalxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSurface Properties 2aTime Factors 2agamma-Cyclodextrinsxpharmacology 0aroots 0aPiriformospora indica 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei1 aWaller, Frank1 aMolitor, Alexandra1 aKogel, Karl-Heinz0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2009 Sept., v. 22, no. 9 p.1179-1185dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-22-9-11793Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle01984naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245005500167300001800222500001500240520083400255650001301089650001201102650001101114650001601125650001801141650002701159650004101186650003301227650002801260650003101288650002901319650003001348650004001378653001601418773008501434852000901519939003301528946001301561655001201574IND9300284320221116223544.0930114e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028432DNAL7 a14471502pmid7 aPMC2075002pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrueheart, J.14aThe a locus governs cytoduction in Ustilago maydis  ap. 7831-7833.  a2019-12-04  aWe have developed a cytoduction assay to measure cell fusion quantitatively in the basidiomycete corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis. This assay employs a mutation conferring resistance to oligomycin that exhibits non-Mendelian inheritance and presumably affects the mitochondrial genome. After auxotrophic olir cells are mixed with prototrophic olir cells, prototrophic olir cells can be detected at a significant frequency after several hours of incubation, reaching a maximum of 10% of the total prototrophs in the mixture after 18 h. We demonstrate that this cell fusion event occurs only if the mating partners have different alleles of the a mating-type locus and is not influenced by the b locus. These studies support the view that the a locus but not the b locus controls establishment of the filamentous, pathogenic state. 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3aassays 3acell fusion 3aUstilago zeae 2aCell Fusionxgenetics. 2aDrug Resistance, Microbialxgenetics 2aExtrachromosomal Inheritance 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aGenes, Mating Type, Fungal 2aMitochondriaxphysiology 2aOligomycinsxpharmacology 2aUstilagoxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0aconjugation0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1992 Dec., v. 174, no. 23 p.7831-7833x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02569naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245009000134300001600224520173600240650000901976650002501985650001202010650001002022650001502032650000902047700001502056700001902071700001702090773009302107852000902200939003302209946001302242655001202255IND9300284720221116223607.0930114e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarela-Moreiras, G.10aEffect of chronic choline deficiency in rats on liver folate content and distribution  ap. 519-522.  aWe have previously reported that folate and choline metabolism are interrelated. Total folate concentration was significantly diminished (31%) when rats were fed a choline-deficient diet for 2 weeks. Distribution among species of folates (differing in pteridine ring structure and/or in the number of glutamic acid residues) was not altered by this short-term dietary deficiency. In the present study we analyzed folate content and distribution in livers after 12 months on a choline-deficient diet. We found that this long-term deficiency did not significantly alter the total folate concentration in liver, however there was a significant difference between the control and deficient groups in the distribution of folate species. Whereas the major folates in the livers of control rats consisted of penta- and hexaglutamyl derivatives, those from the livers of the choline-deficient group were of longer chain lengths including hepta- and octaglutamyl derivatives. It is believed that chain elongation of the glutamate residues reflects, among other things, increased residence time of the folate molecule in the liver. A plausible interpretation of the previous and the present studies is that choline deprivation interferes with the assimilation of newly acquired folate by, the hepatic tissue. Initially, during choline deprivation hepatic folate losses due to normal turnover were not promptly replenished, hence, we observed a decrease in folate level. However, when the period of choline deficiency was extended, impairment in the assimilation of folate was probably compensated for by minimizing folate losses by decreasing folate turnover rates. Hence, we observed an elongation of the glutamate ends of folate molecules. 3adiet 3avitamin deficiencies 3acholine 3aliver 3afolic acid 3arats1 aSelhub, J.1 aDa Costa, K.A.1 aZeisel, S.H.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g1992 Oct., v. 3, no. 10 p.519-522x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02182naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007100127300001600198500001500214520143700229650002001666650001501686650001401701650001101715650000901726653000901735773009301744852000901837939003301846946001301879655001201892IND9300284920221116223214.0930114e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrumbo, P.R.10aBioavailability of pyridoxine in rats fed various levels of casein  ap. 543-548.  a2019-12-04  a[14C] pyridoxine (PN) was orally administered to male rats and lactating dams fed an 8%, 20%, or 50% casein diet. There was no effect of the level of dietary protein on plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) concentration. Analysis of fecal radioactivity indicated no dietary effect on the intestinal absorption of [14C]PN. There was greater retention of 14C in the liver when male and lactating rats were fed increased amounts of protein. Increased dietary protein resulted in reduced levels of 14C in the brain of the male rats. There was no dietary effect on the urinary excretion of total 14C or [14C]4-pyridoxic acid. Increasing the level of dietary protein resulted in increased retention of 14C in the liver of the lactating dams, however, the concentration of 14C and the 14C:protein ratio in milk was not affected. Although not significant, the level of 14C in the liver of the suckling pups was two to three times greater when dams were fed 8% protein than when dams were fed 20% or 50% protein. These results demonstrate that altered tissue distribution of vitamin B-6 occurs with varied protein intake without influencing the metabolic utilization and urinary excretion of vitamin B-6 or plasma PLP concentration, the primary assessment parameter for vitamin B-6 status. Furthermore, increased intake of protein by the lactating rat does not influence the concentration vitamin B-6 or the vitamin B-6:protein ratio in milk. 3abioavailability 3apyridoxine 3alactation 3acasein 3arats 0adiet0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g1992 Oct., v. 3, no. 10 p.543-548x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02037naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008300128300001600211520130400227650001801531650001001549650002001559650001601579650002101595653001501616773007301631852000901704939003301713946001301746655001201759IND9300281720221116223649.0930114e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfeffer, M.J.10aLabor and production barriers to the reduction of agricultural chemical inputs  ap. 347-362.  aAdvocates of sustainable agriculture consider farmer flexibility and innovativeness a key element in efforts to develop farm practices that reduce chemical inputs. In contrast to labor displacing technologies, farming with reduced chemical inputs may increase labor demands. Consequently, concerns about labor supply may affect farmer adaptability in reducing chemical inputs. This research addresses two specific questions. First, how concerned are farmers about the availability of labor needed to reduce chemical inputs? Second, do farmers view production problems as insurmountable without chemicals because of labor constraints? The majority of farmers surveyed agree that it is difficult to reduce chemical inputs because additional labor is hard to find, and their own labor inputs would have to increase. Results of OLS regression analysis show that whether the farmer hires workers affects the relationship between perceived labor and production barriers. Labor supply is less elastic for farmers who hire no labor, and they have less access to social networks that would provide them with sources of the additional workers needed if chemical inputs were reduced. The significance of these results for the development of sources of information that enhance farmer adaptability is discussed. 3aagrochemicals 3alabor 3afarm management 3afarm inputs 3aapplication rate 0aproduction0 tRural sociology.g1992 Fall, v. 57, no. 3 p.347-362x0036-01127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01666naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010000127300001600227500001500243520084100258650001901099650002501118650002101143650001001164651001801174653002701192700001701219773007301236852000901309939003301318946001301351655001201364IND9300281920221116223124.0930114e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuloff, A.E.10aAttitudes and bureaucrats: assessing the representativeness of local officials in New Hampshire  ap. 381-395.  a2019-12-04  aSince the late 1950s and 1960s, New Hampshire has experienced unprecedented growth. During the past two decades, this growth has begun to be felt in the state's North Country, particularly among its many small communities. As a result of developmental pressures in this region, numerous local problems related to the environment and socioeconomic conditions surfaced. The responsibility for meeting the challenges of such growth and development often fell on amateur bureaucrats. Relatively little is known about how representative such officials are of their local citizenry in terms of attitudes and opinions or sociodemographics. This paper presents the results of a study comparing demographic characteristics and assesses the congruence of attitudes of citizens and local government officials in the North Country of New Hampshire. 3apublic opinion 3aeconomic development 3alocal government 3atowns 3aNew Hampshire 0aattitudes and opinions1 aHodges, D.G.0 tRural sociology.g1992 Fall, v. 57, no. 3 p.381-395x0036-01127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02022naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004200126300001600168520125100184650001101435650001501446650002001461650002001481650002001501653001401521700001501535700001501550773010201565852000901667939003301676946001101709655001201720IND9300283120221116223844.0930114e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColonna, P.10aLimiting factors of starch hydrolysis  ap. 517-532.  aFoods appear as complex structures, in which starch may be present in different forms. These, including the molecular characteristics and the crystalline organization, depend on processing conditions and composition of ingredients. The main changes in starch macro- and microstructures are the increase of surface area to volume ratio in the solid phase, the modification of the crystallinity as affected by gelatinization and gelation, and the depolymerization of amylose and amylopectin. Starch modification may be estimated by different methodologies, which should be selected according to the level of structure considered. When amylose and amylopectin are in solution, rapid and total hydrolysis leads to the formation of a mixture of linear oligosaccharides and branched alpha-limit dextrins. However, starch usually occurs in foods as solid structures. Structural factors of starchy materials influence their enzymic hydrolysis. A better understanding of the enzymatic process enables the identification of the structural factors limiting hydrolysis: diffusion of enzyme molecules, porosity of solid substrates, adsorption of enzymes onto solid substrates, and the catalytic event. A mechanistic modelling should be possible in the future. 3astarch 3ahydrolysis 3afood processing 3aenzyme activity 3acrystallization 0astructure1 aLeloup, V.1 aBuleon, A.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Oct., v. 46, no. suppl.2 p.517-532x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03204naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194072000900203072000900212072000900221072000900230100001800239245011600257300001800373500002400391520101100415650001201426650001701438650002001455650001401475650002001489650001101509650001501520650002401535650002701559650002301586650001501609650003201624650001401656650001801670650001701688650002001705650001201725650002901737650004001766650004501806650003601851650002201887650006401909651001501973651001501988700001802003700001502021700001802036700001702054700001302071700001602084700001202100700001802112700001602130773012202146852000902268856008802277930003302365945002502398946001102423655001202434IND4425692320221116223005.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569232DNAL7 a194823982pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aM310 0aL600 0aM001 0aP200 0aP050 0aX100 0aX3801 aMelwani, A.R.10aSpatial trends and impairment assessment of mercury in sport fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed  ap. 3137-3149.  aIncludes references  aA three-year study was conducted to examine mercury in sport fish from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. More than 4000 fish from 31 species were collected and analyzed for total mercury in individual muscle filets. Largemouth bass and striped bass were the most contaminated, averaging 0.40 μg/g, while redear sunfish, bluegill and rainbow trout exhibited the lowest (<0.15 μg/g) concentrations. Spatial variation in mercury was evaluated with an analysis of covariance model, which accounted for variability due to fish size and regional hydrology. Significant regional differences in mercury were apparent in size-standardized largemouth bass, with concentrations on the Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers significantly higher than the central and western Delta. Significant prey-predator mercury correlations were also apparent, which may explain a significant proportion of the spatial variation in the watershed. Regional differences in sport fish mercury were found in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 3amercury 3aheavy metals 3afreshwater fish 3agame fish 3abioaccumulation 3arivers 3awatersheds 3awatershed hydrology 3ageographical variation 3atemporal variation 3aprediction 3apredator-prey relationships 3afood webs 3alinear models 3ahuman health 3arisk assessment 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFishesxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aMercuryxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aMusclesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia1 aBezalel, S.N.1 aHunt, J.A.1 aGrenier, J.L.1 aIchikawa, G.1 aHeim, W.1 aBonnema, A.1 aFoe, C.1 aSlotton, D.G.1 aDavis, J.A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3137-3149dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090928b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03336naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002000194245017700214300001800391500002400409500001500433520131800448650002001766650001401786650002501800650001601825650001801841650001701859650001501876650001201891650002901903650001201932650003201944650003801976650003602014650002902050650002902079650003502108650004102143650003402184650004502218651001702263653002702280700002102307700002802328700002302356700002102379700002202400773012202422852000902544856008802553930003302641945002502674946001102699655001202710IND4425692920221116223326.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569292DNAL7 a195154712pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL600 0aM0011 aStefania, Gorbi10aBiological effects of diethylene glycol (DEG) and produced waters (PWs) released from offshore activities: A multi-biomarker approach with the sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax  ap. 3166-3173.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDiethylene glycol (DEG) is largely used during oil and gas exploitation by offshore platforms. The aim of this work was to investigate if this compound induces direct molecular/cellular effects in marine organisms, or indirectly modulate those of produced waters (PWs). Sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were exposed to DEG dosed alone or in combination with PWs from an Adriatic platform. A wide array of analysed biomarkers included cytochrome P450-dependent enzymatic activity, bile metabolites, glutathione S-transferases, acetylcholinesterase, peroxisomal proliferation, antioxidant defences (catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione), total oxyradical scavenging capacity, malondialdehyde and DNA integrity (single strand breaks and frequency of micronuclei). Results did not reveal marked effects of DEG, while PWs influenced the biotransformation system, the oxidative status and the onset of genotoxic damages. Co-exposures caused only limited differences of biomarker responses at some experimental conditions, overall suggesting a limited biological impact of DEG at levels normally deriving from offshore activities. A biological risk for marine organisms can be excluded for DEG concentrations as those normally associated to produced waters discharged in the Adriatic Sea. 3awater pollution 3aeffluents 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3amarine fish 3adose response 3agenotoxicity 3abiomarkers 3aglycols 3aenvironmental monitoring 2aAnimals 2aBassxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiomarkersxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aBiotransformationxdrug effects 2aDNA Damagexdrug effects 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEthylene Glycolsxpharmacology 2aFish Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxpharmacology 3aAdriatic Sea 0aphysiological response1 aMaura, Benedetti1 aClaudia, Virno Lamberti1 aBarbara, Pisanelli1 aGinevra, Moltedo1 aFrancesco, Regoli0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3166-3173dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20090928b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02402naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002700135245016300162300001600325500002400341500001500365520104400380650002101424650001901445650002301464650001501487650002501502650002001527650001501547650002101562650002801583650001901611650002601630650001501656650001601671650001501687650001501702653001401717653001101731700002301742700002601765773010601791852000901897856003801906655001201944IND4451910420221116223621.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445191042DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.5582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöksal, Eyüp Seli̇m10aSpectral reflectance characteristics of sugar beet under different levels of irrigation water and relationships between growth parameters and spectral indexes  ap. 187-195.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe use of spectral vegetation indexes requires an experimental background. In this study field trials were conducted during 2004 and 2005 on sugar beet. Seven different irrigation treatments were applied. During the experiments soil water status, spectral reflectance, leaf area, plant dry weight and yield were observed and recorded. Water and yield relationships were determined and water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated. The relationships between spectral vegetation indexes and agronomic parameters were determined. According to the results, excessive irrigation does not increase yield and when nearly 500 mm water is used, maximum WUE is 7.2 kg m⁻³. The highest determination coefficients were calculated between LAI and simple ratio (SR, R² = 0.59), sugar beet yield and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI, R² = 0.91). Consequently, spectral indexes, which can be calculated from data obtained through either handheld spectroradiometers or satellites, could prove useful tools for agricultural monitoring and management. 3airrigation water 3aimage analysis 3aspectroradiometers 3asugar beet 3awater use efficiency 3aleaf area index 3acrop yield 3airrigation rates 3aagricultural management 3aremote sensing 3afield experimentation 3asoil water 3areflectance 3avegetation 3asatellites 0awater use 0aplants1 aGüngör, Yetki̇n1 aYildirim, Yusuf Ersoy0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2011 Apr., v. 60, no. 2 p.187-195dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1531-03537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.558 7aarticle03028naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100002500162245018800187300001800375500002400393500002300417520122600440650001801666650001001684650002601694650001801720650001301738650001301751650001701764650001801781650001301799650001501812650002401827650001901851653003701870653002201907700002201929700001801951700001701969700003101986700002302017700002702040700002402067700002102091700002002112700001902132773013402151852000902285856007502294930003302369945002502402946001102427655001202438IND4425690420221116223707.0090908e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569042DNAL7 a10.1139/X09-0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aK0011 aHargreaves, Cathy L.10aImproving initiation, genotype capture, and family representation in somatic embryogenesis of Pinus radiata by a combination of zygotic embryo maturity, media, and explant preparation  ap. 1566-1574.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aThe principal aim of this investigation was to improve somatic embryogenesis initiation and to enhance representation of families and genotypes within those families of Pinus radiata D. Don. A total of 19 open-pollinated seed families, many with unrelated and weakly related parents, were tested. Optimum stage of cone maturity for initiation success was tested by five collections made at 1 week intervals, spanning the developmental period from pro-embryo to cotyledonary embryos. Two media were compared; embryo-development media (EDM6) and a modified Litvay medium (Glitz). Two zygotic embryo explant-preparation techniques were tested; embryos with retained megagametophytes and excised embryos. Proliferating embryogenic tissues were obtained from all four treatments (2850 explants per treatment, 570 per collection time) for the 19 families. The best initiation rates were achieved with a combination of Glitz medium with excised zygotic embryos, with 55% of explants from all collections and all families combined giving rise to proliferating embryogenic tissue. At the optimal collection time for each of the families, this treatment gave a range of 47%-97% initiation success with an average of 70% per family. 3aPinus radiata 3atrees 3asomatic embryogenesis 3atree breeding 3aconifers 3agenotype 3acell culture 3aculture media 3aexplants 3acell lines 3agenetic improvement 3aembryo (plant) 0asomatic embryogenesis initiation 0aembryo maturation1 aReeves, Cathie B.1 aFind, Jens I.1 aGough, Keiko1 aJosekutty, Puthiyaparambil1 aSkudder, Dolina B.1 aMaas, Susan A. van der1 aSigley, Margaret R.1 aMenzies, Mike I.1 aLow, Charlie B.1 aMullin, Tim J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1566-1574dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-0823Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02671naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100002500171245007600196300001800272500002400290500002300314520132600337650001801663650001701681650001301698650002101711650001001732650002101742650001001763650002001773650001001793650001001803650001101813650001701824650001701841651000901858700002301867773013401890852000902024856007502033930003302108945002502141946001102166655001202177IND4425691120221116223119.0090908e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569112DNAL7 a10.1139/X09-0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF400 0aF821 0aK0011 aLombardo, Jeffrey A.10aSeed germination and seedling vigor of weevil-damaged acorns of red oak  ap. 1600-1605.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aAcorn weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are well-known predators of oak acorns in the eastern hardwood forest region of the United States. We examined the germination percentage of seeds, as well as the physical characteristics of seedlings, originating from both weevil-damaged and sound acorns of red oak (Quercus rubra L.) to determine if weevil depredation impacts seedling vigor. Seeds were grown under greenhouse conditions for a period of 8 weeks. X-ray imaging was used as a nondestructive method for determining seed condition prior to germination. The combined data set showed a reduction in germination percentage from 86% for sound acorns to 26% for those damaged by weevils. Seven seedling metrics were evaluated for differences between seedlings originating from sound and those from weevil-damaged acorns. Of these metrics, the number of leaf flushes, total number of leaves, root collar diameter, shoot length, and dry mass were significantly (P < 0.05) different. Two variables, root length and shoot diameter, were not significantly different. Early allocation of resources to root establishment likely explains these findings. Because of reduced stem height and leaf number, seedlings from weevil-damaged acorns are likely to be less competitive in the forest understory than those from sound acorns. 3aQuercus rubra 3aforest trees 3aCurculio 3ahardwood forests 3aseeds 3aseed germination 3avigor 3aseedling growth 3astems 3aroots 3ashoots 3aplant damage 3ainsect pests 3aOhio1 aMcCarthy, Brian C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1600-1605dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-0793Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03084naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245012100200300001400321500002400335520155300359650002001912650001301932650001601945650001801961650002301979650005802002650002202060650001902082650001702101650001602118650002302134650002702157650002002184651001002204700001702214773010202231852000902333856008502342856010602427930003302533945002502566946001102591655001202602IND4425707320221116223403.0090908e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442570732DNAL7 a247849662pmid7 a10.1080/026520309028589212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ206 0aW0001 aChung, S.W.C.10aTrimethylamine oxide, dimethylamine, trimethylamine and formaldehyde levels in main traded fish species in Hong Kong  ap. 44-51.  aIncludes references  aLevels of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA) and formaldehyde (FA) were studied in 266 different fishes, including fresh/frozen raw whole fishes of 89 different species that traded in Hong Kong, China. Determination of TMAO can confirm the source of DMA and FA if present in the sample. These samples were purchased from different commercial outlets between April and August 2007. All samples of raw whole fish were identified for their species by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. The content of TMAO was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a chemiluminescent nitrogen detector. The possible decomposition products of TMAO, DMA and TMA were analysed by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS), while FA was conducted by steam distillation then quantified by a HPLC. The range for TMAO of all samples was <5-3800 mg kg-1 with median of 970 mg kg-1, while the endogenous enzymatic cleavage products DMA, TMA and FA were in the range of <2-320, <1-190 and <1-160 mg kg-1, respectively. These cleavage products were mainly found in three fish species, Harpadon nehereus, Saurida elongata and Saurida tumbil, that belong to the family Synodontidae (Lizardfishes) and subfamily Harpadontinae. Besides, freshwater fish species, namely, Micropterus salmoides, Oreochromis niloticus niloticus and Siniperca chuatsi, were found to contain TMAO in the range of 510-760, 85-720 and 400-640 mg kg-1, respectively. 3afreshwater fish 3araw fish 3afrozen fish 3afood analysis 3aheadspace analysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3anatural toxicants 3atrimethylamine 3aformaldehyde 3amarine fish 3afood contamination 3aenvironmental exposure 3awater pollution 3aChina1 aChan, B.T.P.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.44-51dTaylor & Francisx1939-32107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520309028589213Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t783462596~db=all3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090926b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02475naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001200182245012800194300001400322500002400336500001500360520074000375650001501115650003501130650002201165650002601187650002701213650001701240650002301257650001701280650001201297650002101309650002201330650003501352650001201387651001001399653002701409700001301436700001201449700001301461700001201474700001301486700001401499700001301513773010201526852000901628856008501637856010601722930003301828945002501861946001101886655001201897IND4425707920221116223255.0090908e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442570792DNAL7 a247849702pmid7 a10.1080/026520309029916492doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aW0001 aYan, S.10aCadmium accumulation in pak choi (Brassica chinensis L.) and estimated dietary intake in the suburb of Hangzhou city, China  ap. 74-78.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe total content of cadmium and its distribution between leaves and roots were investigated for pak choi (Brassica chinensis L.), which was grown in a contaminated area of Hangzhou city, China. Results showed that cadmium concentrations in 90% of samples exceeded the Chinese tolerance limit for food. Although roots of pak choi had a higher concentration of cadmium than leaves, leaf tissue (the edible part) accumulated over 80% (on average) of the whole plant cadmium burden due to the greater biomass in leaf tissue. Since pak choi is the staple vegetable in the study area and of great relevance to human health, the dietary intake of cadmium and calculated risk indexes to local residents through the food chain were determined. 3avegetables 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3anatural toxicants 3aquantitative analysis 3amaximum residue limits 3aheavy metals 3afood contamination 3arisk factors 3acadmium 3adietary exposure 3amass spectrometry 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abiomass 3aChina 0aenvironmental exposure1 aLing, Q.1 aBao, Z.1 aChen, Z.1 aYan, S.1 aDong, Z.1 aZhang, B.1 aDeng, B.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.74-78dTaylor & Francisx1939-32107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520309029916493Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t783462596~db=all3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090926b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03169naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245010500197300001800302500002400320520151900344650002401863650002601887650001001913650004401923650002101967650002701988650002602015650001002041650001002051650002102061650001002082650003002092650001002122650001802132650002102150650002202171650001202193650004402205650001102249650002602260650000902286650003002295650003402325700001802359700003002377700002002407700002002427773010402447852000902551856005502560655001202615IND4446191720221116223232.0101208e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444619172DNAL7 a210546072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04892.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenskin, Clare McW.H.10aDiversity and temporal stability of bacterial communities in a model passerine bird, the zebra finch  ap. 5531-5544.  aIncludes references  aThe composition and dynamics of the gastrointestinal bacterial communities in birds is determined by both host-specific and environmental exposure factors yet these are poorly understood. We selected the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as the host species to examine the diversity and temporal stability of the faecal microflora in a bird, owing to its importance as a model organism in avian ecology, neuroscience and evolution studies. The stability of the gut bacterial community of individual male and female zebra finches was assessed through repeat faecal sampling via culture and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and partial sequencing of PCR-amplified eubacterial 16S rRNA gene products. Nineteen bacterial genera were detected across all samples (n = 99), with each bird carrying on average six operational taxonomic units. Using a novel statistical approach, we showed that bacterial assemblages and community richness varied between individual birds but remained stable over time within individuals. Neither the composition nor richness of bacterial communities differed significantly between the sexes. Our results show that zebra finches housed together under controlled conditions show consistent variation between individuals in their gut microflora that is not attributable to differences in host exposure to environmental microbial sources. Future studies could usefully explore the origin of this individual-specific variation and its consequences for host fitness and sexual selection. 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3abacterial communities 3abirds 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adigestive system 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3agenes 3ahost specificity 3ahosts 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amales 3aribosomal RNA 3asexual selection 3aspecies diversity 2aAnimals 2aDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis 2aFemale 2aFinchesxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics1 aRhodes, Glenn1 aPickup, R.

The increase in the values of released uronic acid (percent) and heat solubility of collagen (percent) was observed by chondroitinase ABC digestion of intramuscular connective tissue isolated from porcine longissimus dorsi muscles, indicating that collagen fibril-associated proteoglycan was involved in the thermal stability of intramuscular collagen. A proteoglycan was purified from the adult porcine intramuscular connective tissue by successive steps of an extraction with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation, DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography, and Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration. The isolated proteoglycan possessed an average molecular mass of 100 kDa and contained a core protein with mass of 48 kDa. Its constituent glycosaminoglycan chain was a dermatan sulfate, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of its core protein was identical to that of small proteoglycan (PG-II) from other tissues. These results indicate that the collagen fibril-associated proteoglycan isolated from adult porcine intramuscular connective tissue was the small proteoglycan containing a dermatan sulfate chain (DS-PG-II), namely decorin. 3aadults 3aagarose 3aamino acid sequences 3acollagen 3adigestion 3agel chromatography 3aglycosaminoglycans 3aguanidines 3aheat 3aion exchange chromatography 3alongissimus muscle 3amolecular weight 3aproteoglycans 3asolubility 3asulfates 3aswine 3athermal stability 3atissues 3aultracentrifugation 3auronic acids1 aFukuda, T.1 aNishimura, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.2978-2983x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970120z3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02609naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245014900153300001800302520130800320650002201628650002101650650003601671650001601707650001201723650001701735650001001752650002601762650002301788650000701811650001501818650002001833650002301853700001501876700001701891700002001908773010201928852000902030856007702039930003302116945001302149946001302162655001202175IND2124184520221116223437.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212418452DNAL7 a10.1021/jf96099012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAluko, R.E.10aStructural and functional properties of a partially purified cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) globulin modified with protein kinase and glycopeptidase  ap. 2907-2913.  aThe major globulin fraction in cowpea seed was partially purified by selective ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel chromatography. The partially purified protein was enzymatically phosphorylated or deglycosylated. Phosphate content increased from 5.81 micrograms/mg in the untreated protein to 10.55 micrograms/mg in the protein kinase treated protein. Fluorescence intensity and protein solubility were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) increased at pH 3-8 as a result of phosphorylation, while susceptibility to heat-induced coagulation was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) decreased. At 50% deglycosylation, fluorescence intensity was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) higher for the untreated protein than the treated protein. The intensity of the near-UV circular dichroism spectra of the deglycosylated protein was lower than that of the untreated protein at pH 3, 4, and 6, whereas the reverse was observed at pH 7 and 8. The deglycosylated protein was less soluble at pH 3, 4, 7, and 8 and was more susceptible to heat coagulation when compared to the untreated protein. Modification by protein kinase would allow use in foods where greater solubility is needed, while deglycosylation could enhance utilization in foods that require heat-induced coagulation. 3aVigna unguiculata 3aammonium sulfate 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acoagulation 3acowpeas 3afluorescence 3afoods 3afunctional properties 3agel chromatography 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein solubility1 aYada, R.Y.1 aLencki, R.W.1 aMarangoni, A.G.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.2907-2913x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf96099013Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01970naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245009000154300001600244520090700260650001901167650002401186650001301210650000701223650001501230650001001245650002201255650001201277700001701289700003001306700001501336773010001351852000901451856007701460930003301537945001301570946001301583655001201596IND2124056120221116223705.0980717e199703  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212405612DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960259u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgostini, E.10aProperties of two anionic peroxidase isoenzymes from turnip (Brassica napus L.) roots  ap. 596-598.  aTwo anionic peroxidase isoenzymes of turnip (Brassica napus L.) roots (A1 and A2) have been partially purified to study some properties which may be beneficial for their use in clinical and enzyme immunoassays. Both isoenzymes showed similar thermostability in preincubation tests or storage at 0-4 degrees C and -20 degrees C, which was comparable to that reported for other peroxidase isoenzymes. The optimum pH for the reaction with ABTS as substrate was 4.3 for both isoenzymes while it was 5.3 for A1 and 4.6 for A2 when omicron-dianisidine is used. Isoenzyme A1 showed higher affinities for the substrates omicron-dianisidine (K(m) 0.25 mM) and ABTS (S0.5 50 micromolar) than A2 (K(m) 0.37 mM and S0.5 158 micromolar, respectively). Nevertheless the affinity of both isoenzymes for ABTS was 80 and 25 times higher, respectively, than that described for commercially available anionic peroxidases. 3aBrassica napus 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aisozymes 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aroots 3athermal stability 3aturnips1 aMedina, M.I.1 aMilrad de Forchetti, S.R.1 aTigier, H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.596-598x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960259u3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02589naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001200137245009400149300001800243520125000261650002101511650002801532650002601560650001501586650001501601650001101616650001001627650001001637650001101647650001801658650001201676650001801688650001301706650002601719650001301745650001701758650001601775650002101791650002801812700002001840773010201860852000901962856007701971930003302048945001302081946001302094655001202107IND2124210920221116223024.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212421092DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970166s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, P.10aModification of milkfat physical properties by immobilized Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase  ap. 3343-3349.  aA bifunctional fusion protein was constructed by fusion of the streptavidin gene from Streptomyces avidinii to the lipase gene from Pseudomonas fluorescens, and the resulting streptavidin-lipase was expressed in Escherichia coli. Immobilized streptavidin-lipase was prepared by direct bioselective adsorption from crude cell lysates on biotinylated controlled-pore glass and used to catalyze interesterification of anhydrous butteroil. Changes in the triacylglycerol composition indicated that those with equivalent carbon numbers (ECN) ranging from 36 to 42 decreased, while those with ECN values from 48 to 50 increased following interesterification for 120 h in hexane at 42 degrees C. Both the melting temperatures and the solid fat content at various temperatures were lower as compared to those of the unmodified butteroil. Addition of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic, yielded modified butteroils with lower melting points and solid fat content, whereas addition of saturated fatty acids, palmitic and stearic, increased the solid fat content of the modified butteroil. The liquid butteroil could function as a solvent as well as the substrate; however, the interesterification reaction rate was much slower than in hexane. 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aStreptomyces avidinii 3aadsorption 3abutter oil 3acarbon 3agenes 3aglass 3ahexane 3alipid content 3amelting 3amelting point 3amilk fat 3asaturated fatty acids 3asolvents 3astreptavidin 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 3aunsaturated fatty acids1 aSwaisgood, H.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.3343-3349x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970166s3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02322naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245012700157300001800284520093600302650001901238650002101257650001201278650001601290650001601306650001801322650002601340650001601366650002201382650002101404650001201425650002901437650002401466650001101490650000901501650001001510650002201520700001701542700001901559700001501578773010201593852000901695856007701704930003301781945001301814946001301827655001201840IND2124193120221116223529.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212419312DNAL7 a10.1021/jf97001822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontanillas, R.10aEffect of feeding highly cis-monounsaturated, trans, or n-3 fats on lipid composition of muscle and adipose tissue of pigs  ap. 3070-3075.  aThe effects of feeding various fat sources on contents of trans fatty acids (TFA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and on cholesterol incorporation in muscle and adipose pork tissue were studied. Thirty castrated pigs, divided into three experimental groups receiving the same basal diet with a different 4% supplement of fat-hydrogenated oil (H), linseed oil (L), and pomace oil (O)-were slaughtered at 95 +/- 2.16 kg. No differences were observed in production performance and in carcass and meat characteristics. The pattern of dietary fatty acids was reflected in muscle and adipose tissues. In backfat, animals fed H had the highest TFA contents. Animals fed O had the highest MUFA contents. Animals fed L had the highest levels of n-3, greater contents of C20:5n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid) and C22:5n-3, and lower levels of arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6).

The method consists of an extraction on Empore membranes with strong cation exchange properties and a test strip immunoassay. The Empore extraction provides a fast and simple cleanup of the urines and a concentration step with recoveries ranging from 50-80% for the beta-agonists of the aniline type and around 10% for salbutamol and terbutaline. A test strip immunoassay is performed on the diluted extract. With the use of an antiperoxidase antibody, an internal negative control was included, to which all color reductions are compared. Although a portable colorimeter increased the sensitivity of the test, a visual interpretation was sufficient to give a correct yes/no answer. The whole test takes about 30 min and has a visual detection limit for clenbuterol of 1 ng/mL of urine. The test also shows good sensitivity for salbutamol, despite the low recovery with the Empore extraction. 3aaniline 3aantibodies 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3acation exchange 3acattle 3aclenbuterol 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aimmunoassays 3arapid methods 3aurine1 aArts, C.J.M.1 aPeteghem, C.H. van.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.3129-3137x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf96071673Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01874naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245014000154300001800294520080600312650002201118650001201140650001801152650001101170650001101181650001401192650001101206653002001217700001301237700001501250773010201265852000901367856007701376930003301453945001301486946001301499655001201512IND2124202320221116223803.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212420232DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960819p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJusino, M.G.10aFormation kinetics of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-methylpyrazne in a solid model system consisting of amioca starch, lysine, and glucose  ap. 3164-3170.  aA new analysis using the fractional conversion technique was applied to determine the formation kinetics of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-methylpyrazine in a solid model system containing 4.5% (w/w) lysine, 5.5% glucose, and amioca starch with 10% moisture (dry basis) from 80 to 120 degrees C. The reaction order and kinetic parameters (rate constants and activation energy) were determined through a parameter estimation technique based on least-squares fit. The formation rate of both pyrazines followed a first-order reaction model. No significant differences were observed for the activation energies and rate constants for 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-methylpyrazine, suggesting the production of these pyrazines was controlled by the same rate-limiting step. The activation energy was 13.5 kcal/mol. 3aactivation energy 3aglucose 3aleast squares 3alysine 3amodels 3apyrazines 3astarch 0akinetics models1 aHo, C.T.1 aTong, C.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.3164-3170x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960819p3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02228naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245008900153300001800242520095200260650001301212650000901225650001601234650001501250650001101265650001601276650001101292650001601303650001101319650001301330650001701343650002001360650001201380650001101392650001001403700002001413700001201433700001801445700001801463700001801481773010201499852000901601856007701610930003301687945001301720946001301733655001201746IND2124202020221116223751.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212420202DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970148a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVermaut, S.10aEffect of deoiled jojoba meal on feed intake in chickens: Satiating or taste effect?  ap. 3158-3163.  aJojoba is an oilseed shrub of the desert. Deoiled jojoba meal represents a potential ingredient for animal feed due to its high protein content. However, a jojoba-rich diet decreases feed intake. This study aimed to discriminate between satiation and palatability effects of jojoba meal in chickens. In a first experiment, broilers did not freely prefer jojoba meal-supplemented feed when they had another choice. A second experiment was based on a model that could differentiate satiety from palatability effects. A satiety factor inhibited feed intake to a lesser degree in fasted than in nonfasted chickens, whereas the reduction in feed intake due to an unpalatable tasting agent was less affected by hunger. When feed was supplemented with jojoba meal, the reduction in feed intake did not differ between fasted and nonfasted chickens. In conclusion, jojoba meal reduces feed intake in chickens by its taste rather than by inducing satiation. 3achickens 3adiet 3afeed intake 3afeed meals 3ahunger 3aingredients 3ajojoba 3ajojoba meal 3amodels 3aoilseeds 3apalatability 3aprotein content 3asatiety 3ashrubs 3ataste1 aConinck, K. de.1 aFlo, G.1 aCokelaere, M.1 aOnagbesan, M.1 aDecuypere, E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.3158-3163x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970148a3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02401naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001200137245006900149300001800218520136700236650002101603650001501624650001501639650001701654650001301671650001601684650000901700650001501709650002301724700001901747700001401766773010201780852000901882856007701891930003301968945001302001946001302014655001202027IND2124303120221116224017.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212430312DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960514a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, L.10aSorption-desorption of imidacloprid and its metabolites in soils  ap. 1468-1472.  aSorption-desorption of imidacloprid [1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-N-nitro- 2-imidazolidinimine] and metabolites 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-2-imidazolidinone (imidacloprid-urea), 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-4,5-dihydro- 1H-imidazol-2-amine (imidacloprid-guanidine), and 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-1H-imidazol-2-amine (imidacloprid-guanidine-olefin) in three soils was determined using the batch equilibration technique with initial concentrations for the four chemicals ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 micrograms mL-1, which corresponds to a field application rate of 0.2-1.0 kg ha-1.

Blackburn.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an atypical member of the FGF family that functions as an endocrine hormone. Pharmacologic studies show that FGF21 has broad metabolic actions in obese rodents and primates that include enhancing insulin sensitivity, decreasing triglyceride concentrations, and causing weight loss. In lean rodents, FGF21 expression is strongly induced in liver by prolonged fasting through a mechanism that involves the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. FGF21, in turn, induces the transcriptional coactivator protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator protein 1α and stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis. FGF21 also blocks somatic growth and sensitizes mice to a hibernation-like state of torpor. Thus, FGF21 plays a key role in eliciting and coordinating the adaptive starvation response. Interestingly, FGF21 expression is induced in white adipose tissue by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, which suggests that it also regulates metabolism in the fed state. This article highlights recent advances in our understanding of FGF21's pharmacologic and physiologic actions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendocrine system 3ainsulin resistance 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight loss 3agrowth factors 3afibroblasts 3alipolysis 3agluconeogenesis 3ahibernation 3aadipose tissue 3apharmacology 0aliterature reviews 0afibroblast growth factor 21 0aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor 0aketogenesis1 aMangelsdorf, David J.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.254S-257SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.28449B3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle03597naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072001700143072001700160100001700177245019800194300001400392500001500406520181300421650002002234650001602254650001602270650002302286650002302309650003302332650001702365650002402382650002902406650001502435650002402450650001902474650005302493650001102546650001702557651001802574653001702592700002202609700002302631700002302654700002002677700002702697700002102724773013502745852000902880856008302889930003302972945002503005946001303030655001203043IND4430066120221116222930.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443006612DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2009.284012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The contribution of these sources to usual intakes above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) (1000 μg/d) and to folate and vitamin B-12 status is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate usual folic acid intake above the UL and adjusted serum and red blood cell folate, vitamin B-12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine concentrations among US adults by 3 major folic acid intake sources--enriched cereal-grain products (ECGP), ready-to-eat cereals (RTE), and supplements (SUP)--categorized into 4 mutually exclusive consumption groups. DESIGN: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006 (n = 8258). RESULTS: Overall, 2.7% (95% CI: 1.9%, 3.5%) of adults consumed more than the UL of folic acid. The proportions of those who consumed folic acid from ECGP only, ECGP+RTE, ECGP+SUP, and ECGP+RTE+SUP were 42%, 18%, 25%, and 15%, respectively. Of 60% of adults who did not consume supplements containing folic acid (ECGP only and ECGP+RTE), 0% had intakes that exceeded the UL. Of 34% and 6% of adults who consumed supplements with an average of [less-than or equal to]400 and >400 μg folic acid/d, <1% and 47.8% (95% CI: 39.6%, 56.0%), respectively, had intakes that exceeded the UL. Consumption of RTE and/or supplements with folic acid was associated with higher folate and vitamin B-12 and lower homocysteine concentrations, and consumption of supplements with vitamin B-12 was associated with lower methylmalonic acid concentrations (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: At current fortification levels, US adults who do not consume supplements or who consume an average of [less-than or equal to]400 μg folic acid/d from supplements are unlikely to exceed the UL in intake for folic acid. 3anutrient intake 3avitamin B12 3ablood serum 3amethylmalonic acid 3aready-to-eat foods 3aTolerable Upper Intake Level 3aerythrocytes 3adietary supplements 3adietary nutrient sources 3afolic acid 3asmall cereal grains 3aenriched foods 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3ahomocysteine 3aUnited States 0asmall grains1 aCogswell, Mary E.1 aHamner, Heather C.1 aCarriquiry, Alicia1 aBailey, Lynn B.1 aPfeiffer, Christine M.1 aBerry, Robert J.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.64-72dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.284013Available from publisher's Web site  a20110110b20110205c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/08  aOther US 7aarticle03283naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011600146300001400262520143300276650001601709650001301725650002101738650002501759650002501784650002001809650001801829650000801847650001601855650002401871650001201895650006001907650001801967650001601985650002402001650001102025650002002036650002802056650002102084650002402105650003002129650002302159650003402182650001002216650003402226650001302260653001202273653002402285653002802309653001902337653001902356653001902375653001902394700001402413700001502427700002002442773009302462852000902555930003302564945001302597946001102610655001202621IND2061125620221116223332.0980107e199705  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206112562DNAL7 a91782692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaterkeyn, J.10aSequence analysis of a gene family encoding Taenia ovis vaccine antigens expressed during embryogenesis of eggs  ap. 75-84.  aThe 45W vaccine antigen of the cestode parasite Taenia ovis is a member of a small gene family estimated to comprise six members. All six genes were cloned and characterised. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the different family members identified a set of closely related genes exhibiting between 75.2 and 98.6% DNA sequence homology. Intron/exon structure for the various genes constituting the family was found to be conserved. Open reading frame analysis and pairwise alignments of predicted polypeptides from the various members of the family revealed that the encoded proteins share between 51.8 and 96.5% amino acid identity with the host-protective 45W antigen. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed which allowed amplification of individual family members in a transcript-specific manner. These were used to investigate gene expression in different developmental stages of the parasite by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All members of the gene family were expressed during the T. ovis life-cycle. 45W gene family transcription correlates with embryogenesis of eggs and expression is increased in activated eggs (oncospheres). One family member, ToW3S, was expressed in the early larvae (cysticercus) stages. Expression of genes closely related to the 45W vaccine antigen has important implications for immune evasion under selection from the application of a 45W-based vaccine. 3aTaenia ovis 3avaccines 3amultigene family 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aembryogenesis 3aova 3aoncospheres 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Helminthxbiosynthesisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aEmbryonic Induction 2aFemale 2aGenes, Helminth 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOocytesxphysiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSheep 2aTaeniaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aVaccines 0acloning 0aprotective antigens 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u75739 0agenbank/u75740 0agenbank/u75741 0agenbank/u757421 aGauci, C.1 aCowman, A.1 aLightowlers, M.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1997 May, v. 86, no. 1 p.75-84x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03465naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245009500185300001800280520164200298650001701940650001501957650001201972650002001984650001302004650000902017650001002026650001202036650001402048650001302062650001302075650001002088650001502098650001202113650001202125650001902137650002502156650002502181650001102206650002202217650002502239650000902264650002702273650001402300650002702314650002802341651001102369653003602380653002402416653002202440653001302462700001602475700001902491700001802510700001302528773011702541852000902658856009202667930003302759946001102792655001202803IND4429558520221116223031.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442955852DNAL7 a198784532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04395.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKautz, S.10aPolygynous supercolonies of the acacia-ant Pseudomyrmex peperi, an inferior colony founder  ap. 5180-5194.  aIn ant-plant protection mutualisms, plants provide nesting space and nutrition to defending ants. Several plant-ants are polygynous. Possessing more than one queen per colony can reduce nestmate relatedness and consequently the inclusive fitness of workers. Here, we investigated the colony structure of the obligate acacia-ant Pseudomyrmex peperi, which competes for nesting space with several congeneric and sympatric species. Pseudomyrmex peperi had a lower colony founding success than its congeners and thus, appears to be competitively inferior during the early stages of colony development. Aggression assays showed that P. peperi establishes distinct, but highly polygynous supercolonies, which can inhabit large clusters of host trees. Analysing queens, workers, males and virgin queens from two supercolonies with eight polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed a maximum of three alleles per locus within a colony and, thus, high relatedness among nestmates. Colonies had probably been founded by one singly mated queen and supercolonies resulted from intranidal mating among colony-derived males and daughter queens. This strategy allows colonies to grow by budding and to occupy individual plant clusters for time spans that are longer than an individual queen's life. Ancestral states reconstruction indicated that polygyny represents the derived state within obligate acacia-ants. We suggest that the extreme polygyny of Pseudomyrmex peperi, which is achieved by intranidal mating and thereby maintains high nestmate relatedness, might play an important role for species coexistence in a dynamic and competitive habitat. 3aPseudomyrmex 3aaggression 3aalleles 3agenetic markers 3ahabitats 3aloci 3amales 3anesting 3anutrition 3apolygyny 3asympatry 3atrees 2aAggression 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aAntsxgenetics 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 0aMexico 0aancestral states reconstruction 0aant-plant mutualism 0aintranidal mating 0apolydomy1 aPauls, S.U.1 aBallhorn, D.J.1 aLumbsch, H.T.1 aHeil, M.0 tMolecular ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 18, no. 24 p.5180-5194dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04395.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120324b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03836naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003200171245012900203300001600332520154700348650002101895650002101916650001201937650001701949650002301966650002201989650001602011650001202027650002302039650003102062650001002093650001102103650001902114650001402133650002202147650001302169650002602182650001602208650005202224650001202276650002302288650002102311650001702332650002202349650003602371650002102407650003502428650001402463650004202477650001502519650003602534653002202570653002802592653001602620653003502636700001402671700003002685700001302715700001702728700002302745700001602768700001402784700002202798773011302820852000902933856009202942930003303034946001103067655001203078IND4429541420221116223644.0091207e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442954142DNAL7 a197614422pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03018.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscamilla-Treviño, Luis L.10aSwitchgrass (Panicum virgatum) possesses a divergent family of cinnamoyl CoA reductases with distinct biochemical properties  ap. 143-155.  aThe down-regulation of enzymes of the monolignol pathway results in reduced recalcitrance of biomass for lignocellulosic ethanol production. Cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) catalyzes the first step of the phenylpropanoid pathway specifically dedicated to monolignol biosynthesis. However, plants contain multiple CCR-like genes, complicating the selection of lignin-specific targets. This study was undertaken to understand the complexity of the CCR gene family in tetraploid switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and to determine the biochemical properties of the encoded proteins. Four switchgrass cDNAs (most with multiple variants) encoding putative CCRs were identified by phylogenetic analysis, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the corresponding enzymes were characterized biochemically. Two cDNAs, PvCCR1 and PvCCR2, encoded enzymes with CCR activity. They are phylogenetically distinct, differentially expressed, and the corresponding enzymes exhibited different biochemical properties with regard to substrate preference. PvCCR1 has higher specific activity and prefers feruloyl CoA as substrate, whereas PvCCR2 prefers caffeoyl and 4-coumaroyl CoAs. Allelic variants of each cDNA were detected, but the two most diverse variants of PvCCR1 encoded enzymes with similar catalytic activity. Based on its properties and expression pattern, PvCCR1 is probably associated with lignin biosynthesis during plant development (and is therefore a target for the engineering of improved biomass), whereas PvCCR2 may function in defense. 3aEscherichia coli 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acomplementary DNA 3aengineering 3aenzymes 3aethanol production 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3aphylogeny 3aplant development 3aproteins 3asubstrate specificity 3atetraploidy 2aAldehyde Oxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAlleles 2aDNA, Complementary 2aEscherichia coli 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Variation 2aLigninxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMultigene Family 2aPanicumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolyploidy 2aSubstrate Specificityxgenetics 0aallelic variation 0acinnamoyl CoA reductase 0agene family 0aswitchgrass (Panicum virgatum)1 aShen, Hui1 aUppalapati, Srinivasa Rao1 aRay, Tui1 aTang, Yuhong1 aHernandez, Timothy1 aYin, Yanbin1 aXu, Ying.1 aDixon, Richard A.0 tNew phytologist.g2010 Jan., v. 185, no. 1 p.143-155dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03018.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03768naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245010600194300001600300500001500316520142100331650004401752650004301796650001401839650001801853650001901871650002201890650001801912650001901930650000901949650001301958650002501971650001901996650002202015650001602037650001602053650001402069650001302083650004102096650003402137650001402171650006302185650001402248650006102262650003002323650005502353650003702408650003902445650005502484651001102539651001102550653003602561653001702597653001402614653003702628700002902665700001902694700002502713700001902738700002202757773012202779852000902901856009202910930003303002946001103035655001203046IND4429549320221116222737.0091207e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442954932DNAL7 a198178642pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00788.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiepceron, Maïté10aBoth Cycloclasticus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. as PAH-degrading bacteria in the Seine estuary (France)  ap. 137-147.  a2019-12-04  aLike other highly urbanized and industrialized estuaries, the Seine estuary (France) has, for decades, received high inputs of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In order to estimate the bioremediation potentials and to identify the bacterial species involved in hydrocarbon degradation, we used microcosms containing seawater from the Seine estuary supplemented with either naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene or pyrene. In the microcosms enriched with naphthalene or phenanthrene, hydrocarbon biodegradation was significant within 9 weeks (43% or 46%, respectively), as shown by analyses in GC-MS. In similar microcosms incubated also with naphthalene or phenanthrene, analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences (DNA and cDNA) with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone libraries indicated that the PAH-degrading communities were dominated by Cycloclasticus spp., confirming their universal key role in degradation of low-molecular-weight PAHs in marine environments. However, in contrast to previous studies, we found that Pseudomonas spp. also degraded naphthalene and phenanthrene in seawater; this occurred only after 21 days, as was confirmed by real-time PCR. Although this genus has been abundantly described in the literature as a good PAH-degrading bacterial group in soil or in sediment, to our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a significant fitness in PAH degradation in seawater. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asediments 3aribosomal RNA 3aCycloclasticus 3acomplementary DNA 3aphenanthrenes 3abioremediation 3asoil 3aseawater 3anucleotide sequences 3abiodegradation 3aindustrialization 3anaphthalene 3aPseudomonas 3aestuaries 3abacteria 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEcosystem 2aGammaproteobacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPseudomonasxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRiversxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aSeawaterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxmetabolism. 3aFrance 0aFrance 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 0aphenanthrene 0amicrocosm 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aPortet-Koltalo, Florence1 aMerlin, Chloé1 aMotelay-Massei, Anne1 aBarray, Sylvie1 aBodilis, Josselin0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2010 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.137-147dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00788.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03757naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245010900189300001400298520173800312650002202050650002002072650001302092650001502105650002602120650001602146650003002162650004002192650005302232650001102285650003202296650001502328650006502343650001602408650004402424650003202468650004102500650002402541650001602565650003602581653000802617653000802625653001402633653000802647653001002655700002002665700002102685700001602706700002002722700002802742700001802770700001802788700002302806773014502829852000902974856009202983930003303075946001103108655001203119IND4429570920221116223354.0091207e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442957092DNAL7 a198955032pmid7 a10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00905.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Tianjun10aStructural Analysis of DFG-in and DFG-out Dual Src-Abl Inhibitors Sharing a Common Vinyl Purine Template  ap. 18-28.  aBcr-Abl is the oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase responsible for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Treatment of the disease with imatinib (Gleevec) often results in drug resistance via kinase mutations at the advanced phases of the disease, which has necessitated the development of new mutation-resistant inhibitors, notably against the T315I gatekeeper mutation. As part of our efforts to discover such mutation resistant Abl inhibitors, we have focused on optimizing purine template kinase inhibitors, leading to the discovery of potent DFG-in and DFG-out series of Abl inhibitors that are also potent Src inhibitors. Here we present crystal structures of Abl bound by two such inhibitors, based on a common N9-arenyl purine, and that represent both DFG-in and -out binding modes. In each structure the purine template is bound deeply in the adenine pocket and the novel vinyl linker forms a non-classical hydrogen bond to the gatekeeper residue, Thr315. Specific template substitutions promote either a DFG-in or -out binding mode, with the kinase binding site adjusting to optimize molecular recognition. Bcr-Abl T315I mutant kinase is resistant to all currently marketed Abl inhibitors, and is the focus of intense drug discovery efforts. Notably, our DFG-out inhibitor, AP24163, exhibits modest activity against this mutant, illustrating that this kinase mutant can be inhibited by DFG-out class inhibitors. Furthermore our DFG-out inhibitor exhibits dual Src-Abl activity, absent from the prototypical DFG-out inhibitor, imatinib as well as its analog, nilotinib. The data presented here provides structural guidance for the further design of novel potent DFG-out class inhibitors against Src, Abl and Abl T315I mutant kinases. 3acrystal structure 3adrug resistance 3amutation 2aBenzamides 2aComputational Biology 2aDrug Design 2aDrug Resistancexgenetics 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasmxgenetics 2aFusion Proteins, bcr-ablxchemistryxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aK562 Cells 2aLeukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positivexmetabolism 2aPiperazines 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProtein-Tyrosine Kinasesxmetabolism 2aPurinesxmetabolism 2aPyrimidines 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0aAbl 0aCML 0ainhibitor 0aSrc 0aT315I1 aCommodore, Lois1 aHuang, Wei-Sheng1 aWang, Yihan1 aSawyer, Tomi K.1 aShakespeare, William C.1 aClackson, Tim1 aZhu, Xiaotian1 aDalgarno, David C.0 tChemical biology & drug design.g2010 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.18-28dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895937x1747-02857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00905.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03047naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009400174300001600268500001500284520151700299650001401816650002401830650002401854650001301878650001301891650001301904650002601917650001501943650001001958650001401968650002001982650002502002650002602027650001802053650001802071650001402089650001002103650002102113651001202134653001102146653002602157653002302183700002002206700002802226773011802254852000902372856009202381930003302473946001102506655001202517IND4429563920221116222950.0091207e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442956392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01981.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHAILE, SOLOMON G.10aContribution of trees to carbon storage in soils of silvopastoral systems in Florida, USA  ap. 427-438.  a2019-12-04  aSilvopastoral systems that integrate trees in pasture production systems are likely to enhance soil carbon (C) storage in lower soil layers due to the presence of deep tree roots. To quantify the relative soil C contribution from trees (C3 plants) and warm season grasses (C4 plants) in silvopastoral systems, soil samples were collected and analyzed from silvopastures of slash pine (Pinus elliottii)+bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum), and adjacent open pasture (OP), at six depths down to 125 cm, at four sites representing two major soil orders (Spodosols and Ultisols) of Florida. The plant sources of C in whole (nonfractionated) and three soil fraction sizes (250-2000, 53-250, and <53 μm) were traced using stable C isotope signatures. The silvopasture sites contained higher amounts of C3-derived soil organic carbon (SOC) compared with OP sites, at all soil depths. Slash pine trees (C3 plants) seemed to have contributed more C in the silt+clay-sized (<53 μm) fractions than bahiagrass (C4 plants), particularly deeper in the soil profile. Spodosols sites contained more C in the <53 μm fraction at and below the spodic horizon (occurring between 15 and 50 cm) in silvopasture compared with OP. The results indicate that most of SOC in deeper soil profiles and the relatively stable <53 μm C fraction were derived from tree components (C3 plants) in all the sites, suggesting that the tree-based pasture system has greater potential to store more stable C in the soil compared with the treeless system. 3aC4 plants 3asoil organic carbon 3awarm season grasses 3aUltisols 3apastures 3aisotopes 3aproduction technology 3asoil depth 3atrees 3aSpodosols 3aPinus elliottii 3acarbon sequestration 3asilvopastoral systems 3asoil sampling 3asoil profiles 3aC3 plants 3aroots 3aPaspalum notatum 3aFlorida 0acarbon 0astable carbon isotope 0abahiagrass pasture1 aNair, Vimala D.1 aNAIR, P.K.

  1 aTing, Keh-Chuh10aGC/MS Screening Method for Phthalate Esters in Children's Toys  ap. 951-958.  a2019-12-04  aPhthalate esters are commonly added into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as softeners to make the plastic material flexible. Phthalates are suspected cancer-causing agents and possible teratogens; they have been linked to liver and kidney damage, as well as the underdevelopment of reproductive organs in humans and animals. Public safety concerns about human exposure to phthalates are on the rise because they do not chemically bond to PVC and leach from the material over time. Following the lead of the European Union and Japan in restricting the use of certain phthalates, a legal limit of 0.1% in children's toys was established by the California State Legislature (AB-1108). In addition to its mission to protect public health and the environment from toxic harm, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) has been delegated the role of lead agency for consumer product safety. To support DTSC's Green Chemistry activities, the Environmental Chemistry Laboratory Mobile Laboratory Team has developed an on-site screening method to monitor phthalates in children's toys. This method is simple, fast, and effective, with ample sensitivity to quantify the 6 restricted phthalates in children's toys at 100 ppm (limit of quantitation = 100 μg/g) which is 10 times lower than the legal allowable level of 0.1%. Additionally, the method has a high throughput capability and enables testing of approximately 6-10 samples per day, depending on the complexity of the sample matrix and concentration. This method is designed to survey the 6 phthalates in children's toys and other consumer products for compliance with the threshold of 0.1% (1000 ppm). 3achemical residues 3aconsumer protection 3atoys 3agas chromatography 3atoxic substances 3aphthalates 3amass spectrometry 3ascreening 2aConsumer Product Safetyxstandards 2aDiethylhexyl Phthalatexanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aPhthalic Acidsxanalysis 2aPlay and Playthings 0aconsumers1 aGill, Modan1 aGarbin, Orlando0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2009 , v. 92, no. 3 p.951-958x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20090930b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle03379naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002200146245010900168300001600277500001500293520189000308650002102198650002802219650001402247650000902261650002402270650001402294650001602308650001202324650003602336650001102372650002002383650003702403650002802440650003302468650002002501650002902521650001602550650002702566653001802593700002302611700001702634700001802651700001702669773008302686852000902769930003302778945002502811946001302836655001202849IND4425731520221116222650.0090909e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442573152DNAL7 a196103912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The assay was found to detect amoxicillin, ampicillin, cephapirin, cloxacillin, and penicillin G at levels below the FDA tolerance/safe levels but above the maximum sensitivity thresholds established by the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments. Results of the Part I (internal) and Part II (independent laboratory) dose-response studies using spiked samples were in very close agreement for all five drugs tested, with differences between the Part I and Part II 90/95% sensitivity values ranging from 0 to 1 ppb. The test was able to detect all five drugs at the approximate 90/95% sensitivity levels when present as incurred residues in milk collected from cows that had been treated with the specific drug. A sixth drug, ceftiofur, was found to be undetectable at levels of <=500 ppb (as total ceftiofur metabolites from incurred residues in milk samples). The selectivity of the assay was 100%, because no false-positive results were obtained in tests of >1000 control milk samples. The assay was found to be applicable to the testing of frozen raw milk samples. Results of ruggedness experiments established the operating parameter tolerances for the BetaStar US assay. Results of cross-reactivity testing established that the assay detects certain other beta-lactam drugs (dicloxacillin and ticarcillin), but it does not cross-react with any of 30 drugs belonging to other classes. Abnormally high bacterial or somatic cell counts in rawmilk produced no interference with the ability of the test to detect beta-lactams at tolerance/safe levels. 3aveterinary drugs 3abeta-lactam antibiotics 3abioassays 3amilk 3aantibiotic residues 3adetection 3afrozen milk 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aCattle 2aCross Reactions 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aReagent Kits, Diagnostic 2aTemperature 2abeta-Lactamsxanalysis 0adrug residues1 aSarzynski, Michael1 aWalsh, Aaron1 aWood, Heather1 aMozola, Mark0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2009 , v. 92, no. 3 p.959-974x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20090930b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle03591naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100002100193245009700214300001400311500002300325500001500348520132500363650002001688650002301708650002501731650002401756650002001780650002101800650002501821650002101846650001501867650002401882650002501906650001001931650001401941650001901955650001801974650001601992650001002008650001802018650002902036650002302065650001702088650001002105650000902115650002102124650002802145650004102173650002002214650004202234650001102276650001602287650001102303650002402314650001602338650003902354650002202393650001902415653002502434653002502459700002102484773012302505852000902628856008002637930003302717945002502750946001102775990002302786655001202809IND4430009020221116222550.0091215e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443000902DNAL7 a185380592pmid7 a10.3148/69.2.2008.662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Methods: Semi-structured, point-of-purchase interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 30 female grocery shoppers. Constant comparative data analysis was used to generate themes on shoppers' decision-making processes. Results: Women considered multiple issues in their dairy and dairy alternative food choice strategies: taste was most often associated with the fat and sugar content of foods; health concerns were centred on achieving an acceptable body weight and preventing osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, and women chose foods to satisfy other family members' needs and preferences and to obtain "god food value." Women prioritized their food choices by weighing the value of each issue, which led to a strategic process for "maximizing the value" of their food choices. The availability of a wide range of dairy and dairy alternative foods meant that in most instances, it was unnecessary for women to "trade off" one area of concern for another. Conclusions: Dietitians and nutrition educators can help women make dietary changes by helping them identify foods that they perceive as meeting a variety of needs. 3adiet counseling 3aconsumer education 3aconsumer preferences 3abone mineralization 3adecision making 3ahousehold income 3aConsumer Price Index 3ahealth promotion 3adietitians 3anutrition education 3aconsumer information 3abones 3agroceries 3adairy products 3asugar content 3afood prices 3ataste 3alipid content 3adecision support systems 3asensory properties 3afood choices 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCalcium, Dietary 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aDairy Productsxanalysisxeconomics. 2aDecision Making 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aHealth Food 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMiddle Aged 2aOsteoporosisxprevention & control 2aTastexphysiology 2aWomen's Health 0ahealthy food choices 0aconsumer expenditure1 aChapman, Gwen E.0 tCanadian journal of dietetic practice and research.g2008 Summer, v. 69, no. 2 p.66-70wJournal:12957x1486-38477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3148/69.2.2008.663Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/01/22  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03028naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001700149245010700166300001800273520115800291650002501449650002901474650002101503650002501524650001601549650002101565650002201586650001201608650002401620650001101644650002401655650003901679650002601718650002301744650001801767650005101785650001201836650002801848650002401876650004901900650002401949650003901973650002302012650003402035650004302069653002802112653002102140700001702161700001502178700001502193700001502208700001202223773009902235852000902334930003302343945001302376946001302389655001202402IND2205857720221116223331.0000718e199912  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220585772DNAL7 a105840162pmid7 aPMC917562pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwashita, K.14aThe bglA gene of Aspergillus kawachii encodes both extracellular and cell wall-bound beta-glucosidases  ap. 5546-5553.  aWe cloned the genomic DNA and cDNA of bglA, which encodes beta-glucosidase in Aspergillus kawachii, based on a partial amino acid sequence of purified cell wall-bound beta-glucosidase CB-1. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned bglA gene revealed a 2,933-bp open reading frame with six introns that encodes an 860-amino-acid protein. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, we concluded that the bglA gene encodes cell wall-bound beta-glucosidase CB-1. The amino acid sequence exhibited high levels of homology with the amino acid sequences of fungal beta-glucosidases classified in subfamily B. We expressed the bglA cDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and detected the recombinant beta-glucosidase in the periplasm fraction of the recombinant yeast. A. kawachii can produce two extracellular beta-glucosidases (EX-1 and EX-2) in addition to the cell wall-bound beta-glucosidase. A. kawachii in which the bglA gene was disrupted produced none of the three beta-glucosidases, as determined by enzyme assays and a Western blot analysis. Thus, we concluded that the bglA gene encodes both extracellular and cell wall-bound beta-glucosidases in A. kawachii. 3aAspergillus kawachii 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abeta-glucosidase 3acomplementary DNA 3aintrons 3aopen reading frames 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCell Wallxenzymology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGlucosidasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2abeta-Glucosidasexchemistryxgenetics. 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/ab0034701 aNagahara, T.1 aKimura, H.1 aTakano, M.1 aShimoi, H.1 aIto, K.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Dec., v. 65, no. 12 p.5546-5553x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle04237naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179072001700196100002400213245012800237300001800365500019300383500001500576520229400591650001802885650002102903650001802924650002302942650002302965650002002988650002603008650001303034650001803047650001703065650002403082651001803106651001403124651001103138653002303149653001703172653001503189700002803204700002403232700002903256700001903285700002003304700002303324700001703347700001903364773007703383852000903460856008503469930003303554945002503587946001103612655001203623IND4430039420221116222859.0091217s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443003942DNAL7 a10.1108/000707009109929342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHoefkens, Christine12aA literature-based comparison of nutrient and contaminant contents between organic and conventional vegetables and potatoes  ap. 1078-1097.  aIn the special issue: The added value of organic farming for environment and health: Facts and consumer perceptions / edited by Guido Van Huylenbroeck, Koen Mondelaers, and Joris Aertsens.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose - The increasing demand for organic foods is explained mainly by consumers' concerns about the quality and safety of foods and their perception that organically produced foods are healthier and safer than conventional foods. Based on internationally available concentration data of organic and conventional vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, lettuce and spinach) and potatoes, the paper aims to investigate the scientific validity of nutrition claims as "no vegetable/potato has higher amounts of nutrient X than organic vegetables/potatoes" and "no vegetable/potato has lower amounts of contaminant Y than organic vegetables/potatoes". Design/methodology/approach - Detailed nutrient and contaminant databases were developed for organic and conventional vegetables separately. Non-parametric (Mann-Whitney test) methods were used to detect significant differences between both types of vegetables. A chi-square test was used to compare the incidence of pesticide residues in organic and conventional vegetables. Findings - From a nutritional and toxicological point of view, organic vegetables and potato in general are not significantly better than conventional vegetables and potatoes. For some nutrients and contaminants organic vegetables and potatoes score significantly better but for others they score significantly worse. Therefore, it becomes difficult to justify general claims indicating a surplus value of organic over conventional vegetables and potatoes. More data from controlled paired studies are needed to reconsider the use of claims for these organic plant foods in the future. Research limitations/implications - Only a limited number of studies comparing the nutrient and/or contaminant concentration of organic and conventional vegetables are available ("paired studies"). Additionally, the majority of the studies are of moderate or poor quality. The implication is that more of those paired studies are heavily needed. Another limitation of the study is the fact that most pesticide residue data originated from the USA, the EU and Australia. Originality/value - So far only few studies compared both nutrient and contaminant contents between organic and conventional plant foods. This paper covers therefore an important, not well-explored research sub area. 3ahealth claims 3anutrient content 3ameta-analysis 3afood contamination 3apesticide residues 3anutritive value 3anutrition information 3apotatoes 3aorganic foods 3ahealth foods 3anutrition knowledge 3aUnited States 3aAustralia 3aEurope 0aliterature reviews 0afood quality 0avegetables1 aVandekinderen, Isabelle1 aMeulenaer, Bruno de1 aDevlieghere, F.q(Frank)1 aBaert, Katleen1 aSioen, Isabelle1 aHenauw, Stefaan de1 aVerbeke, Wim1 aCamp, John van0 tBritish food journal.g2009, v. 111, no. 10 p.1078-1097x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707009109929343Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02902naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100002700175242011600202245012900318300001600447500002400463520141800487650002101905650001701926650001801943650002501961650002101986650002202007650003402029650001702063650001602080650002502096651001102121700001902132773012302151852000902274856008102283930003302364945002502397946001102422990002302433655001202456IND4430046420221116222742.0091218e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND443004642DNAL7 a10.3148/69.3.2008.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Methods: Ninety-four subjects from various university programs participated in the study. The Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure perceived stress. A three-day food record and a food frequency questionnaire were used to measure food consumption and its frequency. Results: At T1, both first and fourth-year students show low levels of perceived stress. At T2, the perceived stress levels of St4 increase significantly (22,3±1,4; p=0,005). As stress increases, dietary profiles of students, measured according to the level of conformity to the Canada's Food Guide for Healthy Eating, show an increased consumption of milk and milk products for St1, T1 (p=0,05) and of breads and cereals for St4, T2 (p=0,02). Significant negative correlations were found among St4 between perceived stress and thiamine (r =-0,48; p=0,006) and zinc (r=-0,42, p=0,02) ingestion. No other correlations with perceived stress were found with either energy or other nutrient intakes. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the importance of intervening within the university student population and implementing information sessions on stress management and healthy eating behaviours among university students. 3acollege students 3ayoung adults 3aeating habits 3apsychological stress 3astress tolerance 3astress management 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood records 3afood groups 3apsychological stress 3aCanada1 aVillalon, Lita0 tCanadian journal of dietetic practice and research.g2008 Fall, v. 69, no. 3 p.133-140wJournal:12957x1486-38477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3148/69.3.2008.1333Available from publisher's Web site  a20091222b20100101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/01/15  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02959naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001600166245015800182300001600340500001500356520154500371650001401916650003001930650001801960650002201978650002302000650002702023650001002050650002202060650001702082650002502099651001002124651001002134653002302144653002602167700001502193700001302208700001402221700001502235773007202250852000902322856008702331930003302418945001302451946001302464655001202477IND2322501420221120230157.0010813e200107  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232250142DNAL7 a189429982pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.7.6802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Z.J.10aTransgressive segregation, heritability, and number of genes controlling durable resistance to stripe rust in one Chinese and two Italian wheat cultivars  ap. 680-686.  a2019-12-04  aWheat (Triticum aestivum) cvs. Libellula (LB), San Pastore (SP), and Xian Nong 4 (XN4) possess durable resistance to stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, and cv. Ming Xian 169 (MX169) is highly susceptible to the rust. Inheritance of stripe rust resistance was studied by crossing the four cultivars and evaluating the resistance of parental, F1, F2, backcross, and F3 plants in the fields. Transgressive segregation for resistance was observed in the resistant by resistant crosses of LB x XN4 and XN4 x SP, but not in cross LB x SP. These results indicate that (i) the resistance genes in XN4 are different from those in LB and SP, and (ii) LB and SP share common resistance genes. The number of genes segregating for the resistance was estimated by quantitative methods from the data of F2, backcross, and F3 populations. LB and XN4 appear to have two to three resistance genes, and SP appears to have two to four resistance genes when crossed with MX169. The resistance gene number in resistant by resistant cross LB x XN4 was four to five, approximately equal to the sum of the genes in LB and XN4. Similarly, the resistance gene number in cross XN4 x SP was approximately equal to the sum of the genes in XN4 and SP. Broad-sense heritability was high in all crosses except LB x SP. Compared with the three MX169-involved crosses, narrow-sense heritability was higher in LB x MX169 and SP x MX169 crosses than in the XN4 x MX169 cross. The LB x XN4 and XN4 x SP crosses showed moderate narrow-sense heritability. 3acultivars 3atransgressive segregation 3apathogenicity 3aTriticum aestivum 3adisease resistance 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aPuccinia striiformis 3aItaly 3aChina 0agenetic regulation 0abiological resistance1 aYang, G.H.1 aLi, G.H.1 aJin, S.L.1 aYang, X.B.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 July, v. 91, no. 7 p.680-686x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.7.6803Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02992naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001600166245011500182300001600297500001500313520153800328650002401866650001301890650001901903650003301922650002101955650001401976650002001990650001902010650001802029650002702047650002502074650002002099650001402119651001002133651001102143653001702154653001302171653001802184700001502202700001302217700001702230773007202247852000902319856008702328930003302415945001302448946001302461655001202474IND2322833320221120230254.0010831e200108  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232283332DNAL7 a189440282pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.8.7202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgugi, H.K.10aSimultaneous temporal progress of sorghum anthracnose and leaf blight in crop mixtures with disparate patterns  ap. 720-729.  a2019-12-04  aField studies were conducted at Alupe in western Kenya in 1995 and 1996 to evaluate the efficacy of crop and species mixtures for the management of sorghum anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum sublineolum) and leaf blight (caused by Exserohilum turcicum). The progress of these diseases developing simultaneously on a susceptible sorghum cultivar planted in inter- or intra-row mixtures of varying proportions with either maize or resistant sorghum was monitored. The effects of host type and mixture patterns on disease progress were compared by parameter estimates derived from fitted Lotka-Volterra competition equations and nonlinear logistic models. Competition coefficients were not significant and their confidence intervals included zero in most cases, suggesting that interactions between C. sublineolum and E. turcicum did not occur. Mixtures of the susceptible sorghum with either the nonhost maize or the resistant sorghum delayed the time when disease is first observed and reduced the rate of disease progress and carrying capacity for both anthracnose and leaf blight, with a more pronounced effect on the latter disease. The lower efficacy of mixtures in reducing anthracnose was attributed to an aggregated spatial pattern, coupled with higher rates of progress for this disease. Intra-row mixtures were more efficient than inter-row mixtures in reducing disease development in all years. The implications of these observations for the management of sorghum diseases under small-scale farming systems are discussed. 3amathematical models 3aZea mays 3adisease models 3aplant diseases and disorders 3acultural control 3aequations 3adisease control 3aColletotrichum 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3aSorghum bicolor 3ainfection 3aKenya 3aUganda 0aepidemiology 0asymptoms 0acrop mixtures1 aKing, S.B.1 aHolt, J.1 aJulian, A.M.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.720-729x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.8.7203Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02809naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001200170245012200182300001600304500002400320500001500344520118800359650001801547650001101565650001901576650003401595650001701629650003301646650002201679650002301701650002501724650003001749650000801779650001601787650002501803650001901828650002301847650004001870651001001910653001601920653003001936700001601966700001501982773011601997852000902113856007602122930003302198945002502231946001102256655001202267IND4383611420221120174818.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438361142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01151.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF833 0aF8211 aJiu, M.10aAcquisition and Transmission of two Begomoviruses by the B and a non-B Biotype of Bemisia tabaci from Zhejiang, China  ap. 587-591.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAcquisition and transmission was studied of Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) and Tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV) by the B and a non-B biotype (China-ZHJ-1) of Bemisia tabaci from Zhejiang, China. The frequency of TYLCCNV and TbCSV detection by PCR in whitefly adults increased with increasing length of feeding on virus-infected plants. The virus DNA was detected by PCR in 40% of the B biotype adults tested after a period of 30 min access to infected plants and in all adults after a 12-h period of access. All ZHJ-1 adults acquired TYLCCNV and TbCSV after a 48-h period of access to the virus-infected plants. Viruliferous B and ZHJ-1 adults retained TYLCCNV DNA for their entire life when placed on healthy cotton plants. Viruliferous ZHJ-1 adults retained TbCSV DNA for their entire life when placed on healthy cotton plants but the B biotype adults did not. Transmission of TYLCCNV was achieved with one B or ZHJ-1 adult per plant, and the probability of transmission reached 100% when the number of adults was increased to 10 per plant. The efficiency for TYLCCNV transmission to healthy plants by adults of both B and ZHJ-1 was much higher than that for TbCSV. 3aplant viruses 3acotton 3aBemisia tabaci 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3ainsect pests 3aplant diseases and disorders 3avector competence 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aBemisia argentifolii 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA 3aplant pests 3adisease transmission 3ainsect vectors 3amicrobial genetics 3aTomato yellow leaf curl China virus 3aChina 0aBegomovirus 0aTobacco curly shoot virus1 aZhou, X.-P.1 aLiu, S.

The way in which hunting of prey affects the sex ratio of the predator's offspring is not well understood. Female cicada-killer wasps are convenient for study because they specialise in capturing cicadas to provision their offspring. Cicada prey are nearly twice as heavy as the wasps that carry them, hence some degree of prey selectivity by the wasps is to be expected. It has been suggested that wasps bias their offspring towards females by foraging selectively for female prey, whereas there is some evidence that sex ratios are actually male-biased. This study was designed to establish the connection between foraging and offspring sex ratio. 2. Three, non-exclusive, hypotheses of selective predation were tested. The frequency of predation on different classes of prey in conjunction with their availability was estimated by intercepting the wasps on their way to their nests and by sampling cicadas in the environment. The hypothesis of selective predation was not supported; predation appears to be opportunistic and non-selective. Cicada prey weight was not a simple linear function of wasp weight, although the smallest wasps were constrained to carry small prey. 3. Wasp offspring (larvae) were excavated from subterranean nests and found to be male-biased (3 : 1 or 4 : 1) in 2 years. The observed ratios are close to expectation from Fisher's equal-investment model, taking account of sexual size dimorphism, and are evidently unrelated to the sex of the prey. A simple binomial probability rule of sex allocation provides a behavioural mechanism for producing the observed sex ratio of offspring. 3aSphecidae 3apredatory insects 3apredation 3aCicadidae 3apredator-prey relationships 3anesting 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3asex allocation 3asexual dimorphism 3abody size 0aprey sex 0aprey size 0anest provisioning 0asize dimorphism0 tEcological entomology.g2006 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.539-547dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00810.x3electronic resource  a20061107b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02916naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100002200179245010900201300001600310500002400326520141300350650001501763650002301778650002301801650002201824650002401846650001301870650001301883650002101896650002401917650001701941650001201958650003501970651001502005653001502020653001402035653001902049653002602068653002602094700001902120773010502139852000902244856007602253930003302329945002502362946001102387655001202398IND4383609920221120170027.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438360992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00805.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL001 0aK0011 aO'Donnell, Seán.10aMicroclimatic factors associated with elevational changes in army ant density in tropical montane forest  ap. 491-498.  aIncludes references  a1. The density (rate of encountering foraging raids) and species richness of army ants (Formicidae: Ecitoninae, and behaviourally convergent Ponerinae) was measured in montane tropical forest. Above-ground and subterranean army ant raids were sampled using standard protocols at four sites across an elevational gradient (1200-1650 m above mean sea level) in and near cloud forest in the area of Monteverde, Costa Rica. 2. Mean ambient temperature differed among sites, and decreased with elevation. For the above-ground foraging army ant species, raid rates also declined with elevation. Surface army ant raid rates, however, were not affected by day to day weather variation within sites (temperature, cloud cover, or precipitation). 3. For the underground foraging army ant species, raid rates did not vary directionally with elevation, and subterranean raid rates were not affected by day to day weather variation within sites. 4. Army ant species richness was not directionally related to elevation, and species sharing among sites was generally high. 5. Army ant community structure changes with elevation in Neotropical montane forest, and the results suggest that the strongest effects are of temperature regimes on the density of raids. These findings provide a baseline against which to detect changes in army ant communities that may accompany directional climate change in tropical cloud forests. 3aFormicidae 3ainsect communities 3apopulation density 3aspecies diversity 3acommunity structure 3aforaging 3aaltitude 3aclimatic factors 3aambient temperature 3amicroclimate 3aweather 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aCosta Rica 0aEcitoninae 0aPonerinae 0aarmy ant raids 0aabove-ground foraging 0asubterranean foraging1 aKumar, Anjali.0 tEcological entomology.g2006 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.491-498dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00805.x3electronic resource  a20061107b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03188naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100002200179245012100201300001600322500002400338500001500362520166900377650002002046650002302066650001802089650002302107650002502130650001702155650001302172650002202185650002302207650002102230650001702251651001502268653001502283653002302298653001902321653001302340653002402353700003402377773010502411852000902516856007602525930003302601945002502634946001102659655001202670IND4383610020221120165923.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438361002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00806.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL300 0aL0011 aHELLER, NICOLE E.10aSeasonal spatial dynamics and causes of nest movement in colonies of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile)  ap. 499-510.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a1. Colony organisation and movement behaviour of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) was studied over 3 years in field populations in California and in captive colonies in the laboratory. This invasive species is highly polydomous and unicolonial; colonies consist of expansive and fluid networks of nests and trails. The spatial and temporal organisation of colonies may contribute to ecological dominance. 2. Argentine ant nests and inter-nest trails shift in size, abundance, and location, so that colony networks are spatially contracted in the winter and expanded spring to autumn. Colonies occupy permanent sites; ants migrated to and from the same winter nest locations year after year, and occupied 30% of the same nests repeatedly during seasonal migrations. 3. Nests were moved on average 2-3 m. Forty-two per cent were occupied less than 1 month, 4% the entire study, and the other 54% lasted 3.9 ± 2.3 months (mean ± SD). 4. Nests were located within 2-4 m of woody plants, in warm sites in the winter and cool sites in the summer. Both humidity and food availability influenced nest-site choice in laboratory colonies. However, when faced with a trade-off between factors, the ants chose humid nest boxes over nest boxes near food, and ants moved nests only in response to changes in humidity and not distance to food. 5. The results indicate that L. humile colonies are seasonally polydomous, and that nest movements are driven by changes in microclimate. Colony organisation maintains high local density and increases food supply, which may improve the competitive ability of L. humile colonies and reduce opportunities for species coexistence. 3ainsect colonies 3aLinepithema humile 3anesting sites 3amigratory behavior 3aspatial distribution 3amicroclimate 3ahumidity 3afood availability 3aseasonal variation 3ainvasive species 3ainsect nests 3aCalifornia 0aant trails 0aseasonal migration 0afood proximity 0apolydomy 0apolydomous colonies1 aGordon, Deborahq(Deborah M.)0 tEcological entomology.g2006 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.499-510dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00806.x3electronic resource  a20061107b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03935naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001700189245020900206300001600415500002400431520215000455650002602605650000902631650002002640650001802660650001402678650002102692650002702713650001502740650001602755650002002771650001702791650001002808650002102818650002002839650001402859650001702873650001602890650001802906650001502924650001402939650001702953650002702970653002902997700001703026700001503043700001303058773009503071852000903166856007703175930003303252945002503285946001103310655001203321IND4383580220221120170120.0060915e20060929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438358022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aM001 0aM1201 aSubhadra, B.10aEffect of fish-meal replacement with poultry by-product meal on the growth, tissue composition and hematological parameters of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fed diets containing different lipids  ap. 221-231.  aIncludes references  aWe conducted a 12-week feeding trial with largemouth bass (LMB) to examine the interactive effects of non-fish dietary proteins with different lipid sources on the performance of LMB (3.4 g ± 0.05 g). Practical diets contained poultry by-product meal (PBM) in place of fish meal on a digestible-protein basis, and 12% blood meal (BM). Diets were supplemented with 10% lipid as canola (CAN), chicken (CHK), CHK + MFO (50 : 50), menhaden fish oil (MFO) or CHK + CAN (50:50). A commercial trout diet (SC) was included as a positive control. Growth, survival, feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), body composition, fatty acid composition of liver and muscle, hematological parameters and lysozyme and alternative complement activity (ACH50) were measured to assess diet effects. Weight gain (23.8 ± 1.8 g), survival (92 ± 4%), FI (44.3 ± 4.1 g), FCR (2.1 ± 0.1) and PER (1.3 ± 0.04) of LMB did not differ among the replacement diets. However, weight gain (38.5 ± 1.5), FI (53.9 ± 1.1), and PER (1.6 ± 0.1) of LMB fed the SC diet was higher and FCR (1.4 ± 0.1) was lower than that of fish fed the test diets. No signs of essential fatty acid deficiency were observed, although tissue concentrations of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids declined markedly in LMB fed diets without fish oil. Lymphocytes were elevated in fish fed diets with >or= 7% n-3 fatty acids. Fish fed diets with 10% MFO or CHK + MFO had higher ACH50 than fish fed the diet with 10% CHK. There were no differences in serum lysozyme activity among fish fed the test diets. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, ACH50, and lysozyme activity were higher in fish fed the SC diet than in those fed the test diets. Regardless of lipid source, the ACH50 and lysozyme activity were greatly reduced in LMB fed PBM diets compared to LMB fed diets with 30% fish meal in a previous trial. The amino acid composition of the PBM was similar to that of fish meal. However, the availability of some essential amino acids from PBM to LMB may have been limited, and poor diet palatability caused by BM also may have reduced feed intake and performance of LMB. 3aMicropterus salmoides 3abass 3afreshwater fish 3aanimal growth 3amortality 3abody composition 3afatty acid composition 3ahematology 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3afish feeding 3afeeds 3afeed composition 3adietary protein 3afish meal 3apoultry meal 3adietary fat 3alipid content 3acanola oil 3afish oils 3afish culture 3afreshwater aquaculture 0aprotein efficiency ratio1 aLochmann, R.1 aRawles, S.1 aChen, R.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Sept. 29, v. 260, no. 1-4 p.221-231dElsevier Pub.

Seeds collected in southern Sweden were subjected to several experiments. The seeds were dormant at maturity. Seeds sown outdoors after collection produced a small number of seedlings that emerged early in the spring. After long cold stratification or stratification outdoors over two winters, the maximum germination was 40-50%; germination occurring over a wide range of temperatures. Warm stratification preceding cold stratification had no effect on germination, but repeated warm and cold periods seemed to promote germination. Gibberellic acid (GA) stimulated germination, but full germination was only achieved after more than 2 months of incubation at the most suitable temperature regime tested. Excised embryos grew and developed into normal seedlings. With these results, the species does not fit into the currently used system for seed dormancy classifications. The response to GA and the growth of excised embryos indicate non-deep or intermediate physiological dormancy, but dormancy alleviation by stratification was not in line with the guiding principles for these classifications. Galeopsis speciosa has a strong dormancy that is sufficiently alleviated during the winter to allow germination of only part of a seed batch each year; hence a stepwise germination pattern occurs over a period of several years. 3aseed germination 3aseed dormancy 3aweed biology 3asoil temperature 3aembryo (plant) 3agibberellic acid 3abroadleaf weeds 3aannual weeds 3aseedling emergence 3aGaleopsis 3aburied seeds 3acold 3aSweden 0aseeds 0acold stratification 0aGaleopsis speciosa1 aERICSSON, JAL1 aMILBERG, P.0 tWeed research.g2006 Oct., v. 46, no. 5 p.353-361dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2006.00518.x3electronic resource  a20070103b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02511naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001800180245004500198300001600243520082600259650002201085650001901107650001901126650001201145650002301157650002201180650002001202650001701222650001101239650001501250650001701265650009001282650003501372650002101407650003601428650001101464650003201475650002201507650006401529650002701593650002401620651001201644700001301656700001801669700001901687700001701706700001501723700002101738773007201759852000901831930003301840945002501873946001101898655001201909IND4369689120221120073611.0050506e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436968912DNAL7 a157976072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Additionally the flavanone, (S)-4',5-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone, was isolated for the first time from L. tridentata or any member of the family Zygophyllaceae. All of the compounds were assessed for their growth inhibitory activity against human breast cancer, human colon cancer and human melanoma cell lines. The lignans had IC50 values of 5-60 micromolar with the linear butane-type lignans being the most potent, and it was found that colon cancer cells were the least sensitive cell type tested. The relative potency of linear butane type lignans against human breast cancer appears to correlate positively with the number of O-methyl groups present on the molecule. 3aLarrea tridentata 3aplant extracts 3aphytochemicals 3alignans 3achemical structure 3aspectral analysis 3astereochemistry 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aColonic Neoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aHumans 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aLarreaxchemistry 2aLignansxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aMelanomaxdrug therapy 2aMolecular Structure 3aArizona1 aSang, S.1 aDougherty, A.1 aCaldwell, C.G.1 aMeyers, R.O.1 aDorr, R.T.1 aTimmermann, B.N.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 Apr., v. 66, no. 7 p.811-815x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/06/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01916naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001600146245007900162300001800241520046400259650003000723650001400753650002600767650001500793650001700808650002500825650002200850650002300872650002200895650002000917650004100937650004600978650002401024650003601048650005401084650002701138700001501165700001301180700001701193700001601210700001701226700001401243773007501257852000901332930003301341945002501374946001101399655001201410IND4373586020221120062354.0050825e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437358602DNAL7 a159640382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGrun, S.10aEvolution of the indole alkaloid biosynthesis in the genus Hordeum : Distribution of gramine and DIBOA and isolation of the benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes from Hordeum lechleri  ap. 1264-1272.  a2019-12-05  aTwo indole alkaloids with defense related functions are synthesized in the genus Hordeum of the Triticeae. Gramine (3(dimethyl-amino-methyl)-indole) is found in H. spontaneum and in some varieties of H. vulgare, the benzoxazinoid 2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIBOA) is detected in H. roshevitzii, H. brachyantherum, H. flexuosum, H. lechleri. Biosynthesis of DIBOA and of gramine was found to be mutually exclusive in wild Hordeum species, indicating that there was selection against simultaneous expression of both pathways during evolution. The full set of genes required for DIBOA biosynthesis in H. lechleri was isolated and the respective enzyme functions were analyzed by heterologous expression. The cytochrome P450 genes Bx2-Bx5 demonstrate a monophyletic origin for H. lechleri, Triticum aestivum and Zea mays. HlBx2-HlBx5 share highest homology to the orthologous genes of T. aestivum. In contrast, the branch point enzyme of the DIBOA pathway, the indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase BX1, might have evolved independently in H. lechleri. In all Hordeum species that synthesize DIBOA, DNA sequences homologous to Bx genes are found. In contrast, these sequences are not detectable in the genomes of H. vulgare and H. spontaneum that do not synthesize benzoxazinoids. 3abiosynthesis 3awild plants 3acomplementary DNA 3agramine 3asubstrate specificity 3aplant proteins 3asecondary metabolites 3acytochrome P-450 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum 3anucleotide sequences 3aHordeum lechleri 2aAlkaloidsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBenzoxazines 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aHordeumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aIndole Alkaloidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Structure 2aOxazinesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aHordeum vulgare 0abenzoxazinoid 0aHordeum 0aindole alkaloids 0aHordeum flexuosum 0a2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one 0amolecular sequence data 0aHordeum brachyantherum 0aHordeum roshevitzii1 aFrey, M.1 aGierl, A.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 June, v. 66, no. 11 p.1264-1272x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20050916b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03390naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001600180245012200196300001800318500001500336520170000351650001402051650002202065650001702087650002302104650002502127650002102152650001702173650002702190650002002217650002502237650001602262650002102278650002002299650001802319650003802337650004302375650002402418650001402442650002402456653002502480653002802505700001402533700002302547700001602570700001502586700001602601700001802617773007502635852000902710930003302719945002502752946001102777655001202788IND4373295120221120062343.0050815e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437329512DNAL7 a159253942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMalonek, S.10aDistribution of gibberellin biosynthetic genes and gibberellin production in the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex  ap. 1296-1311.  a2019-12-05  aGibberella fujikuroi is a species-rich monophyletic complex of at least nine sexually fertile biological species (mating populations, MP-A to MP-I) and more than 30 anamorphs in the genus Fusarium. They produce a variety of secondary metabolites, such as fumonisins, fusaproliferin, moniliformin, beauvericin, fusaric acid, and gibberellins (GAs), a group of plant hormones. In this study, we examined for the first time all nine sexually fertile species (MPs) and additional anamorphs within and outside the G. fujikuroi species complex for the presence of GA biosynthetic genes. So far, the ability to produce GAs was described only for Fusarium fujikuroi (G. fujikuroi MP-C), which contains seven clustered genes in the genome all participating in GA biosynthesis. We show that six other MPs (MPs B, D, E, F, G, and I) and most of the anamorphs within the species complex also contain the entire gene cluster, except for F. verticillioides (MP-A), and F. circinatum (MP-H), containing only parts of it. Despite the presence of the entire gene cluster in most of the species within the G. fujikuroi species complex, expression of GA biosynthetic genes and GA production were detected only in F. fujikuroi (MP-C) and one isolate of F. konzum (MP-I). We used two new molecular marker genes, P450-4 from the GA gene cluster, and cpr, encoding the highly conserved NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase to study phylogenetic relationships within the G. fujikuroi species complex. The molecular phylogenetic studies for both genes have revealed good agreement with phylogenetic trees inferred from other genes. Furthermore, we discuss the role and evolutionary origin of the GA biosynthetic gene cluster. 3aanamorphs 3asequence analysis 3abiosynthesis 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3abiochemical pathways 3acytochrome P-450 3agibberellins 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3ateleomorphs 3amultigene family 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGibberellaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGibberellinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPhylogeny 2aSpecies Specificity 0aGibberella fujikuroi 0amolecular sequence data1 aBomke, C.1 aBornberg-Bauer, E.1 aRojas, M.C.1 aHedden, P.1 aHopkins, P.1 aTudzynski, B.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 June, v. 66, no. 11 p.1296-1311x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20050916b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03646naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245011200180300001800292500001500310520221100325650002502536650002802561650001902589650002302608650002602631650002202657650001202679650002502691650002202716650002402738650001402762650005202776650004602828653001502874653001602889700001502905700001702920700001602937700001702953700001702970773007502987852000903062930003303071945002503104946001103129655001203140IND4373294520221120062219.0050815e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437329452DNAL7 a159049422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPelser, P.B.10aFrequent gain and loss of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the evolution of Senecio section Jacobaea (Asteraceae)  ap. 1285-1295.  a2019-12-05  aPyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) of the macrocyclic senecionine type are secondary metabolites characteristic for most species of the genus Senecio (Asteraceae). These PAs are deterrent and toxic to most vertebrates and insects and provide plants with a chemical defense against herbivores. We studied the PA composition of 24 out of 26 species of Senecio section Jacobaea using GC-MS. The PA profiles of eight of these species have not been studied before and additional PAs were identified for most other species that were included in previous studies. With one exception (senecivernine) all 26 PAs identified in sect. Jacobaea can be regarded as derivatives of the biosynthetic backbone structure senecionine. Based on the PA profiles of the species of sect. Jacobaea and the results of previous tracer studies, we constructed two hypothetical biosynthetic scenarios of senecionine diversification. Both scenarios contain two major reactions: the conversion of the necine base moiety retronecine into the otonecine moiety and site-specific epoxidations within the necic acid moiety. Further reactions are site-specific hydroxylations, sometimes followed by O-acetylations, site-specific dehydrogenations, E, Z-isomerizations, and epoxide hydrolysis and chlorolysis. The GC-MS data and both biosynthetic scenarios were subsequently used to study the evolution of PA formation in sect. Jacobaea by reconstructing the evolutionary history of qualitative PA variation in this section. This was achieved by optimizing additive presence/absence data of PAs and types of enzymatic conversions on a maximum parsimony cladogram of section Jacobaea inferred from DNA sequence and morphological data. Besides showing large intra- and interspecific variation, PA distribution appears to be largely incidental within the whole clade. These results together with the finding that all but one of the PAs identified in sect. Jacobaea are also present in species of other sections of Senecio indicate that differences in PA profiles in Senecio can not be explained by the gain and loss of PA specific genes, but rather by a transient switch-off and switch-on of the expression of genes encoding PA pathway-specific enzymes. 3achemical composition 3apyrrolizidine alkaloids 3aphytochemicals 3achemical structure 3asecondary metabolites 3aspectral analysis 3aSenecio 2aBiological Evolution 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Structure 2aPhylogeny 2aPyrrolizidine Alkaloidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSenecioxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aAsteraceae 0asenecionine1 aVos, H. de1 aTheuring, C.1 aBeuerle, T.1 aVrieling, K.1 aHartmann, T.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 June, v. 66, no. 11 p.1285-1295x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20050916b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03013naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001200163245014200175300001800317500001500335520104100350650001401391650001701405650001601422650003601438650002001474650001201494650002501506650001301531650001401544650002001558650002401578650002501602650004201627650002001669650001701689650001801706650002601724650003001750650002501780650004701805650002801852650003801880650002801918650003201946650002801978650002602006650003702032653002402069653003402093700001202127700001202139700001102151700001302162700001102175773007502186852000902261930003302270945002502303946001102328655001202339IND4373586820221120062317.0050825e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437358682DNAL7 a159635402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Compared with the treatment of normal Mn (10 micromolar), excess Mn significantly increased H2O2 concentration and lipid peroxidation indicated by accumulation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. The leaves showed apparent symptoms of Mn toxicity and the plant growth was significantly inhibited by excess Mn. The addition of Si significantly decreased lipid peroxidation caused by excess Mn, inhibited the appearance of Mn toxicity symptoms, and improved plant growth. This alleviation of Mn toxicity by Si was related to a significant increase in the activities of SOD, APX, DHAR and GR and the concentrations of ascorbate and glutathione. 3amanganese 3aplant growth 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aCucumis sativus 3asilicon 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acucumbers 3avegetable crops 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aenzyme activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 2aAscorbate Peroxidases 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aCucumis sativusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Reductasexmetabolism 2aManganesexpharmacology 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aPeroxidasesxmetabolism 2aSiliconxpharmacology 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 0aguaiacol peroxidase 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH)1 aBao, Z.1 aZhu, Z.1 aHe, Y.1 aQian, Q.1 aYu, J.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 July, v. 66, no. 13 p.1551-1559x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20060104b20060202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/09/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02835naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001400146245008300160300001800243500001500261520111500276650002401391650002101415650000901436650002601445650001301471650002601484650002201510650001501532650003601547650002201583650001801605650001201623650001901635650006401654650003601718650001301754650002301767650002501790650002701815653002301842653001601865653002301881653003401904653003801938653001601976653001701992700001302009700001702022700001402039700001502053773007502068852000902143930003302152945002502185946001102210655001202221IND4373862220221120062212.0050901e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437386222DNAL7 a160541772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLongu, S.10aMechanism-based inactivators of plant copper/quinone containing amine oxidases  ap. 1751-1758.  a2019-12-05  aCopper/quinone amine oxidases contain Cu(II) and the quinone of 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (topaquinone; TPQ) as cofactors. TPQ is derived by post-translational modification of a conserved tyrosine residue in the protein chain. Major advances have been made during the last decade toward understanding the structure/function relationships of the active site in Cu/TPQ amine oxidases using specific inhibitors. Mechanism-based inactivators are substrate analogues that bind to the active site of an enzyme being accepted and processed by the normal catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. During the reaction a covalent modification of the enzyme occurs leading to irreversible inactivation. In this review mechanism-based inactivators of plant Cu/TPQ amine oxidases from the pulses lentil (Lens esculenta), pea (Pisum sativum), grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) and sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia,) are described. Substrates forming, in aerobiotic and in anaerobiotic conditions, killer products that covalently bound to the quinone cofactor or to a specific amino acid residue of the target enzyme are all reviewed. 3aenzyme inactivation 3aLathyrus sativus 3apeas 3aOnobrychis viciifolia 3atyramine 3aprimary-amine oxidase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3acytokinins 3aLens culinaris subsp. culinaris 3aenzyme substrates 3aPisum sativum 3alentils 3aplant proteins 2aAmine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)xantagonists & inhibitors 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aPlantsxenzymology 2aQuinonesxmetabolism 2aTyraminexpharmacology 0aplant biochemistry 0aalkylamines 0aliterature reviews 0a2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine 0aamine oxidase (copper-containing) 0atopaquinone 0aindoleamines1 aMura, A.1 aPadiglia, A.1 aMedda, R.1 aFloris, G.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 Aug., v. 66, no. 15 p.1751-1758x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20060130b20060202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/09/15  aNon-US 7aarticle01691naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001800146245009500164300001800259520040600277650001300683650001600696650001300712650002300725650001600748650002500764650002200789650001800811650002800829650001600857650002100873650002400894650002800918650002500946650003100971653002701002653003301029700002001062773007301082852000901155930003301164945002501197946001101222655001201233IND4371734320221120045029.0050624e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437173432DNAL7 a158963692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLopez-Molina, D.10aMolecular properties and prebiotic effect of inulin obtained from artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.)  ap. 1476-1484.  aA high molecular weight inulin has been prepared from artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) agroindustrial wastes using environmentally benign aqueous extraction procedures. Physico-chemical analysis of the properties of artichoke inulin was carried out. Its average degree of polymerization was 46, which is higher than for Jerusalem artichoke, chicory, and dahlia inulins. GC-MS confirmed that the main constituent monosaccharide in artichoke inulin was fructose and its degradation by inulinase indicated that it contained the expected beta-2,1-fructan bonds. The FT-IR spectrum was identical to that of chicory inulin. These data indicate that artichoke inulin will be suitable for use in a wide range of food applications. The health-promoting prebiotic effects of artichoke inulin were demonstrated in an extensive microbiological study showing a long lasting bifidogenic effect on Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521 cultures and also in mixed cultures of colonic bacteria. 3aCynara cardunculus subsp. cardunculus 3aartichokes 3ainulin 3aprebiotics 3aagricultural industry 3aindustrial wastes 2aBifidobacteriumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCynara scolymusxchemistry 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInulinxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Extractsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPolymers 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared1 aNavarro-Martinez, M.D.1 aRojas Melgarejo, F.1 aHiner, A.N.P.1 aChazarra, S.1 aRodriguez-Lopez, J.N.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 June, v. 66, no. 12 p.1476-1484x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20050916b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02145naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001400163245004500177300001800222520084700240650001301087650001901100650001501119650002301134650002201157650003001179650002401209650002101233650002401254650002701278651001301305653002501318653002501343653002601368653002301394700001501417700001601432700001701448700001701465700001701482773007401499852000901573930003301582945002501615946001101640655001201651IND4372413320221120045053.0050719e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437241332DNAL7 a159249182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSaito, N.10aAcylated peonidin glycosides from duskish mutant flowers of Ipomoea nil  ap. 1852-1860.  a2019-12-05  aFive acylated peonidin glycosides were isolated from the pale gray-purple flowers of a duskish mutant in the Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil or Pharbitis nil) as major pigments, along with a known anthocyanin, Heavenly Blue Anthocyanin (HBA). Three of these were based on peonidin 3-sophoroside and two on peonidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside as their deacylanthocyanins; both deacylanthocyanins were acylated with caffeic acid and/or glucosylcaffeic acids. By spectroscopic and chemical methods, the structures of the former three pigments were determined to be 3-O-[2-O-(6-O-(trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside], 3-O-[2-O-(6-O-(3-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-6-O-(4-O-(6-O-(3-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-trans-caffeoyl)-beta-glucopyranoside], and 3-O-[2-O-(6-O-(trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-6-O-(4-O-(6-O-(3-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside] of peonidin. The structures of the latter two pigments were also confirmed as 3-O-[2-O-(6-O-(trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside]-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and 3-O-[2-O-(6-O-(trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-6-O-(4-O-(6-O-(3-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-trans-caffeoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside]-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside of peonidin.

Ferreira, G. Gross, H. Kolodziej, and T. Yoshida.  a2019-12-05  aThe pantropical plant family Melastomataceae produces characteristic hydrolyzable tannin oligomers. The latter in this family are distinguished from those in other plant families by the fact that the oligomers from dimers to tetramers are composed of two different alternating monomeric units: casuarictin and pterocaryanin C. These oligomers are metabolites that are produced by intermolecular C-O oxidative coupling between the monomers (or their desgalloyl-or des-hexahydroxydiphenoyl derivatives) forming a valoneoyl group as the link between monomers. The chemotaxonomically significant oligomerization pattern of melastomataceous plants provided helpful suggestions for determining the structures of new oligomers (nobotanins Q-T and melastoflorins A-D) isolated from Monochaetum multiflorum, which belongs to this family. Melastoflorins A-D were characterized as pentamers, which are the largest hydrolyzable tannins composed of different monomeric units. 3achemical reactions 3aphytochemicals 3achemotaxonomy 3aellagic acid 3atannins 3aMelastomataceae 3aspectral analysis 3aplant taxonomy 3achemical structure 2aBiopolymersxchemistry 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aHydrolyzable Tanninsxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlantsxchemistryxclassification. 2aSpectrum Analysisxmethods 0aplant biochemistry 0acornusiin 0anobotanins 0amelastoflorins 0aMonochaetum multiflorum1 aIto, H.1 aHipolito, I.J.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 Sept., v. 66, no. 17 p.1972-1983x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03007naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001400197245008600211300001800297500013100315500001500446520112900461650001601590650001601606650002501622650001701647650002701664650002301691650002101714650002101735650001801756650001201774650001401786650001501800650002001815650001901835650002501854650002601879650001801905650003001923650003301953650006401986653002302050653002302073653002002096653002502116653001902141653001802160653002402178653001302202773007602215852000902291930003302300945002502333946001102358655001202369IND4375317520221117175042.0051019e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437531752DNAL7 a159826792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A necessary step toward this goal is to show how the parameters used in quantitative descriptions of a process (e.g., yield and maintenance coefficients) are related to those describing the metabolism [e.g., Y(ATP), (P/O)]. The "yield equation" approach to this problem involves dividing metabolism into the separate pathways for catabolism, anabolism, respiration, and product formation and balancing the production and consumption of reducing equivalents and ATP. The general approach, demonstrated previously for heterotrophic cell growth and products of fermentation, is illustrated by three new examples: the cell yield for chemoautotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria, the cometabolic degradation of chloroform by methanotrophic bacteria, and the theoretical yield of succinic acid from glucose. 3afermentation 3asuccinic acid 3acell growth 3aMethanobacterium 3airon 3abiological production 3ayields 0ametabolism 0abiotechnology 0aheterotrophic microorganisms0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1995 Spring, v. 51/52 p.329-338x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01890naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011500124300001600239500012800255520080100383650001901184650001601203650001101219650001401230650001001244650001301254650002201267650001201289650002301301653002401324700001801348773009401366852000901460930003301469945001301502946001301515655001201528IND2049913120221122055342.0960216e199504  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204991312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, J.W.10aBioelectronics and biometallocatalysis for production of fuels and chemicals by photosynthetic water splitting  ap. 295-305.  aPaper presented at the Sixteenth Symposium on Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals, May 9-13, 1994, Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  aBy inserting metallocatalysts (such as platinum, osmium, or ruthenium) at the reducing site of photosystem I (PSI), electrons that emerge from PSI can be channeled to various redox reactions that could potentially produce fuels and chemicals (such as H2 and CH4, and so forth) instead of NADP+ reduction, as in natural photosynthesis. We have recently developed a technique to photoprecipitate metallocatalysts in situ at the reducing site of PSI in thylakoid membranes, using water-soluble hexachloroplatinate, hexachloroosmiate, and hexachlororuthenate at biological temperature and neutral pH. This technique combined with "rewiring" of photosynthesis is a potentially important new field of biometallocatalysis. Potential applications of biometallocatalysis will be addressed in this article. 3aphotosynthesis 3aelectronics 3ametals 3acatalysts 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3aelectron transfer 3amethane 3amethane production 0aphotosynthetic cell1 aGreenbaum, E.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1995 Spring, v. 51/52 p.295-305x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03418naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002200134245011800156300001300274520201500287650002202302650003002324650001102354650001402365650001602379650001602395650001302411650001902424650001502443650002402458650002302482650001502505650001802520650002102538650001502559650002302574650001102597651001002608700001802618700002002636700002102656700002402677773009602701852000902797856007402806939003302880946001102913655001202924IND4479316020221121043620.0140401e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447931602DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.5962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarratt, James A.10aParameterisation, evaluation and comparison of pesticide leaching models to data from a Bologna field site, Italy  ap. 3-20.  aEffective prediction of pesticide fate using mathematical models requires good process descriptions in the models and good choice of parameter values by the user. This paper examines the ability of seven pesticide leaching models (LEACHP, MACRO, PELMO, PESTLA, PLM, PRZM and VARLEACH) to describe an arable field environment where sunflowers are grown in the Po Valley, northern Italy. Two pesticides were considered, aclonifen and ethoprophos. The models were evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce field data of soil water content and pesticide residues in the soil and ground water. The evaluation was based on a combination of calibrated and uncalibrated runs. The results from the models were compared with each other to explore the differences between the models. The models varied in their ability to predict soil water content in the summer: the capacity models PRZM, PELMO and VARLEACH predicted less drying than MACRO, PESTLA, PLM and LEACHP. The models varied in their ability to simulate the persistence of the pesticides in the soil. Differences in the simulated pesticide degradation rate were observed between the models, due to variations in the simulated soil water content and soil temperature, and also differences in the equation linking degradation rate to soil water content. There were large differences among the predictions of the models for the mean leaching depth of ethoprophos. PRZM, PELMO, PESTLA and LEACHP all showed similar mean leaching depth to each other, whereas VARLEACH predicted lower ethoprophos mobility and PLM and MACRO predicted greater mobility. All the models overpredicted dispersion of ethoprophos through the soil profile, as compared to the field data. None of the models was able to simulate the field data of rapid leaching of pesticide to ground water except PLM after calibration of the percentage of macropores in the mobile pore space. More work is required in the parameterisation of macropore flow for those models that include this process. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aPesticide Root Zone Model 3adrying 3aequations 3aethoprophos 3agroundwater 3aleaching 3amacropore flow 3amacropores 3amathematical models 3apesticide residues 3aprediction 3asoil profiles 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asummer 3aItaly1 aCapri, Ettore1 aTrevisan, Marco1 aErrera, Giuseppe1 aWilkins, Richard M.0 tPest management science.g2003 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.3-20wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.5963Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140401  aNon-US 7aarticle02384naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002100149245008500170300001800255300002300273520104500296650002301341650002501364650001801389650001201407650000901419650002501428650002401453650001801477650002301495650002701518650002101545650001301566650002801579650001401607650001301621650003001634650002501664650004201689700001701731700001401748773008501762852000901847939003301856946001301889655001201902IND8900163020221120040043.0890110e198812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890016302DNAL7 a31925092pmid7 aPMC2116412pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukhopadhyay, P.10aMolecular analysis of a pathogenicity locus in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae  ap. 5479-5488.  ap. 5479-5488. ill.  aOne of the chromosomal regions of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae encoding pathogenicity factors had been mapped into a 3.9-kilobase-pair fragment in previous studies. Promoter probe analysis indicated the existence of a promoter near one end of the fragment. DNA sequencing of this fragment revealed the existence of a consensus promoter sequence in the region of the promoter activity and two open reading frames (ORFs) downstream. These ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoded putative polypeptides of 40 and 83 kilodaltons, respectively. All ORF1::Tn5 as well as ORF2::Tn5 mutant strains were nonpathogenic on susceptible host bean plants and were unable to elicit hypersensitive reactions on nonhost tobacco plants. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 83-kilodalton polypeptide contained features characteristic of known integral membrane proteins. Fusion of the lacZ gene to ORF2 led to the expression of a hybrid protein inducible in Escherichia coli. The functions of the putative proteins encoded by ORF1 and ORF2 are unknown at present. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPseudomonas syringae 3apathogenicity 3amutants 3aloci 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPlasmids 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProtein Conformation 2aPseudomonasxgeneticsxpathogenicity.1 aWilliams, J.1 aMills, D.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Dec., v. 170, no. 12 p.5479-5488x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03218naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245013700162300001800299300002300317520183800340650002502178650001002203650001802213650001602231650001702247650003702264650003302301650002302334650001202357650003002369650001002399650002002409650001302429650001302442650002502455650001302480650004202493650002402535653002102559700001602580773008502596852000902681939003302690946001302723655001202736IND8900163920221120040049.0890110e198812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890016392DNAL7 a28480102pmid7 aPMC2116692pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, G.W.10aPhysical and functional analyses of the syrA and syrB genes involved in syringomycin production by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae  ap. 5680-5688.  ap. 5680-5688. ill.  aThe syrA and syrB genes involved in syringomycin production in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301D were identified from an EcoRI-pLAFR3 cosmid library and then physically and functionally analyzed in relation to plant pathogenicity. Homologous recombination of the genes required for syringomycin production from cosmids pGX183 (syrA) and pGX56 (syrB), respectively, introduced into nontoxigenic (Tox(-)) Tn5 mutants W4S2545 and W4S770 resulted in the concomitant restoration of toxin production and full virulence. The disease indices of the Tox(+) strains obtained by recombination of the cloned, homologous DNA into the corresponding Tn5 mutant were essentially equivalent to that of strain B301D-R and significantly higher than those of W4S2545 and W4S770. A 12-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment from pGX183 was subcloned (i.e., pGX15) and found to contain the sequences necessary for syringomycin production. A map of pGX15 prepared by a combination of restriction endonuclease digestions and Tn5 mutagenesis showed that the syrA sequence was 2.3 to 2.8 kb. Marker exchange of syrA::Tn5 from pGX15 into B301D-R yielded nonpathogenic phenotypes, indicating that syrA is a regulatory gene since it is necessary for both syringomycin production and pathogenicity. The 4.9-kb EcoRI fragment from pGX56 was subcloned (i.e., pGX4) and shown to carry the syrB sequence which was 2.4 to 3.3 kb. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of protein extracts from B301D-R associated five proteins, ranging from equivalent to 130,000 to equivalent to 470,000 in molecular weight, with syringomycin production. The syrA and syrB genes were required for the formation of proteins SR4 (equivalent to 350,000) and SR5 (equivalent to (130,000), which are believed to be components of the syringomycin synthetase complex. 3aPseudomonas syringae 3agenes 3apathogenicity 3aphytotoxins 3abiosynthesis 3agenetic techniques and protocols 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCosmids 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aGenes 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGenotype 2aMutation 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aPlasmids 2aPseudomonasxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aRestriction Mapping 0acharacterization1 aGross, D.C.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Dec., v. 170, no. 12 p.5680-5688x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02987naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245016400165300001600329300002100345520134400366650002701710650001301737650001301750650001001763650001701773650001901790650003001809650002101839650002501860650002401885650005001909650003301959650003101992650001802023650002302041650001502064650003102079650001002110650002102120650002302141650002802164650002102192650002402213653002302237700001702260700001902277773008202296852000902378939003302387946001302420655001202433IND8901220220221120040150.0890227e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890122022DNAL7 a26442052pmid7 aPMC2096172pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, L.F.12aA 20-kilodalton protein is required for efficient production of the Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis 27-kilodalton crystal protein in Escherichia coli  ap. 521-530.  ap. 521-530. ill.  aThe 27-kilodalton (kDa) mosquitocidal protein gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis has been cloned as a 10-kilobase (kb) HindIII fragment from plasmid DNA; efficient expression in Escherichia coli KM1 depends on a region of DNA located approximately 4 kb upstream (K. McLean and H.R. Whiteley, J. Bacteriol. 169:1017-1023, 1987). We have cloned the upstream DNA region and show that it contains a complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein with a molecular mass of 19,584 Da. Sequencing of adjacent stretches of DNA revealed two partial ORFs: one has 55.2% identity in an overlap of 319 amino acids to the putative transposase of IS231 of B. thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis, and the other, a 78-codon partial ORF, may be the carboxyl terminus of the 67-kDAa protein previously observed in maxicells of strain KM1. A 0.8-kb fragment containing only the 20-kDa protein gene greatly enhanced the expression of the 27-kDa protein in E. coli. The introduction of nonsence codons into the 20-kDa protein gene ORF abolished this effect, indicating that the gene product, not the mRNA or DNA, is required for the enhancement. The effect of the 20-kDa protein gene on various fusions of lacZ to the 27-kDa protein gene suggests that the 20-kDa protein acts after the initiation of translation of the 27-kDa protein gene. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aproteins 3acrystals 3agenes 3ainsect pests 3ainsect control 3abiological control agents 3aEscherichia coli 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEndotoxins 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aRestriction Mapping 0aopen reading frame1 aVisick, J.E.1 aWhiteley, H.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Jan., v. 171, no. 1 p.521-530x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02381naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011800126300001600244300002100260520140200281650002701683650002301710650001301733650001301746650003001759650001301789650001701802650001901819653002201838700001701860700001701877773008201894852000901976939003301985946001302018655001202031IND8901219320221120032601.0890224e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890121932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, B.D.10aInvolvement of Tn4430 in transfer of Bacillus anthracis plasmids mediated by Bacillus thuringiensis plasmid pX012  ap. 104-113.  ap. 104-113. ill.  aThe self-transmissible plasmid pX012 (112.5 kilobases [kb]), originally isolated from strain 4042A of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis, codes for production of the insecticidal crystal protein (Cry+). The mechanism of pX012-mediated plasmid transfer was investigated by monitoring the cotransfer of the tetracycline resistance plasmid pBC16 (4.2 kb) and the Bacillus anthracis toxin and capsule plasmids, pX01 (168 kb) and pX02 (85.6 kb), respectively. In matings of B. anthracis donors with B. anthracis and Bacillus cereus recipients, the number of Tcr transcipients ranged from 4.8 X 10(4) to 3.9 X 10(6)/ml (frequencies ranged from 1.6 X 10(-4) to 7.1 X 10(-2), and 0.3 to 0.4% of them simultaneously inherited pX01 or pX02. Physical analysis of the transferred plasmids suggested that pBC16 was transferred by the process of donation and that the large B. anthracis plasmids were transferred by the process of conduction. The transfer of pX01 and pX02 involved the transposition of Tn4430 from pX012 onto these plasmids. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments demonstrated that Tn4430 was located on a 16.0-kb AvaI fragment of pX012. Examination of Tra- and Cry- derivatives of pX012 showed that this fragment also harbored information involved in crystal formation and was adjacent to a restriction fragment containing DNA sequences carrying information required for conjugal transfer. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aBacillus anthracis 3aplasmids 3acrystals 3abiological control agents 3aproteins 3ainsect pests 3ainsect control 0aconjugal transfer1 aBattisti, L.1 aThorne, C.B.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Jan., v. 171, no. 1 p.104-113x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02685naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245010700164300001400271300001900285500001500304520118000319650001801499650002701517650002001544650001801564650001301582650002001595650007001615650003301685650001901718650003301737650001501770650002001785650001301805650003001818650002101848650005001869650002601919653001701945653002101962700001701983700001502000700001702015773008002032852000902112939003302121946001302154655001202167IND8901219020221120032721.0890224e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890121902DNAL7 a25366572pmid7 aPMC2095492pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisono, H.10aPurification and characterization of a dimeric phenylalanine dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus maris K-18  ap. 30-36.  ap. 30-36. ill.  a2019-12-05  aNAD+ -dependent phenylalanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.) was purified to homogeneity from a crude extract of Rhodococcus maris K-18 isolated from soil. The enzyme had a molecular mass of about 70,000 daltons and consisted of two identical subunits. The enzyme catalyzed the oxidative deamination of L-phenylalanine and several other L-amino acids and the reductive amination of phenylpyruvate and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The enzyme required NAD+ as a natural coenzyme. The NAD+ analog 3-acetylpyridine-NAD+ showed much greater coenzyme activity than did NAD+. D-Phenylalanine, D-tyrosine, and phenylethylamine inhibited the oxidative deamination of L-phenylalanine. The enzyme reaction was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and HgCl2. Initial-velocity and product inhibition studies showed that the reductive amination proceeded through a sequential ordered ternary-binary mechanism. NADH bound first to the enzyme, followed by phenylpyruvate and then ammonia, and the products were released in the order L-phenylalanine and NAD+. The Michaelis constants were as follows: L-phenylalanine, 3.8 mM; NAD+, 0.25 mM; NADH, 43 micro; phenylpyruvate, 0.50 mM; and ammonia, 70 mM. 3asoil bacteria 3aRhodococcus (bacteria) 3aoxidoreductases 3aphenylalanine 3akinetics 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Oxidoreductasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aChromatography 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aDurapatite 2aHydroxyapatites 2aKinetics 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMolecular Weight 2aRhodopseudomonasxclassificationxenzymology. 2aSubstrate Specificity 0apurification 0acharacterization1 aYonezawa, J.1 aNagata, S.1 aNagasaki, S.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Jan., v. 171, no. 1 p.30-36x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03313naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245010900164300001800273300002300291500001500314520176600329650000902095650001702104650001302121650002502134650001102159650002302170650002002193650003002213650002302243650002302266650003102289650001002320650002102330650002002351650003802371650003102409650003902440650002402479650002702503650003702530653001002567653002402577700001602601700001502617773008402632852000902716939003302725946001302758655001202771IND8901338420221120032728.0890303e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890133842DNAL7 a26442172pmid7 aPMC2096942pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalm, C.J.10aCotranscription of genes encoding indoleacetic acid production in Pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi  ap. 1002-1009.  ap. 1002-1009. ill.  a2019-12-05  aIndoleacetic acid (IAA) production by the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi is essential for tumor formation on olive and oleander. The bacterium produces IAA from tryptophan in reactions catalyzed by tryptophan monooxygenase and indoleacetamide hydrolase. The genetic determinants are, respectively, iaaM and iaaH. In oleander isolates, the genes encoding the IAA biosynthetic enzymes are located on a plasmid; in olive isolates, the genes occur on the chromosome. The IAA genes from the oleander isolate strain EW2009 are located within a 4-kilobase (kb) segment of the 52-kb plasmid pIAA1. Escherichia coli strains harboring a recombinant plasmid, pCJP3, which contains this 4-kb fragment, excreted IAA into culture media, and crude cell extracts had both trytophan monooxygenase and indoleacetamide hydrolase activity. In vitro coupled transcription-translation of pCJP3 demonstrated that this fragment coded for proteins of 62 and 47 kilodaltons which correspond to tryptophan monooxygenase and indoleacetamide hydrolase, respectively. Expression of these genes was dependent upon a vector promoter in pCJP3. However, in the absence of a vector promoter, E. coli containing recombinant plasmids with additional pIAA1 DNA in front of iaaM had high levels of tryptophan monooxygenase. Northern (RNA) hybridization experiments verified that iaaM and iaaH are cotranscribed as a portion of a ca. 4- to 5-kb transcript in vivo. Southern hybridization experiments with IAA plasmids from different oleander strains of P. syringae subsp. savastanoi revealed that all IAA plasmids contained a region of at least 10 kb of homology, with the IAA genes at one end. Repetitive DNA and a copy of IS51 were found at the end of this region of homology. 3aOlea 3abiosynthesis 3aplasmids 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aoperon 3aindole acetic acid 3aNerium oleander 2aAmidohydrolasesxgenetics 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Vectors 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxbiosynthesis. 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPseudomonasxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTryptophan Hydroxylasexgenetics 0agenes 0aphytotumorigenicity1 aGaffney, T.1 aKosuge, T.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Feb., v. 171, no. 2 p.1002-1009x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02833naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002000149245013300169300001800302300002300320500001500343520129800358650002401656650002801680650001301708650001201721650002401733650001501757650002701772650003901799650003401838650004801872650002201920650002901942650002501971650002401996650002102020650002502041653001402066653002102080653001502101700001702116700002002133700002302153773008402176852000902260939003302269946001302302655001202315IND8901338820221120032718.0890306e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890133882DNAL7 a29148652pmid7 aPMC2097112pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaagd, R.A. de.10aImmunological characterization of Rhizobium leguminosarum outer membrane antigens by use of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies  ap. 1136-1142.  ap. 1136-1142. ill.  a2019-12-05  aSurface antigens of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae strain 248 were characterized by using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. With Western immunoblotting as the criterion, an antiserum raised against living whole cells recognized mainly flagellar antigens and the O-antige-containing part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunization of mice with a peptidoglycan-outer membrane complex yielded eight monoclonal antibodies, of which three reacted with LPS and five reacted with various sets of outer membrane protein antigens. The observation that individual monocolonal antibodies react with sets of related proteins is discussed. Studies of the influence of calcium deficiency and LPS alterations on surface antigenicity showed that in normally grown wild-type cells, the O-antigenic side chain of LPS blocks binding of an antibody to a deeper-lying antigen. This antigen is accessible to antibodies in cells grown under calcium limitation as well as in O-antigen-lacking mutant cells. Two of the antigen groups which can be distinguished in cell envelopes of free living bacteria were depleted in cell envelopes of isolated bacteroids, indicating that the monoclonal antibodies could be useful tools for studying the differentiation process from free-living bacteria to bacteroids. 3alipopolysaccharides 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aantigens 3acalcium 2aAgglutination Tests 2aAntibodies 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aAntigen-Antibody Complexxanalysis 2aAntigens, Bacterialxanalysis 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxanalysis 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Membranexanalysis. 2aCell Wallxanalysis. 2aFlagellaxanalysis. 2aMolecular Weight 2aRhizobiumxanalysis. 0amembranes 0acharacterization 0aimmunology1 aRijk, R. de.1 aMulders, I.H.M.1 aLugtenberg, B.J.J.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Feb., v. 171, no. 2 p.1136-1142x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02814naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245009600166300001600262300002100278500001500299520144300314650001601757650001701773650001301790650002501803650004301828650003001871650003001901650005601931650003101987650004102018650002702059650001302086650001302099650002602112650002402138653000802162700001802170700001902188773008202207852000902289939003302298946001302331655001202344IND8901337620221120032715.0890303e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890133762DNAL7 a25366822pmid7 aPMC2096682pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBender, C.L.10aPlasmid-mediated production of the phytotoxin coronatine in Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  ap. 807-812.  ap. 807-812. ill.  a2019-12-05  aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato PT23.2 produces the chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin coronatine. Thirty-eight chlorosis-defective mutants of PT23.2 were previously generated by using the transposon Tn5. Five mutants contained Tn5 insertions in the indigenous plasmid pPT23A; the remaining 33 mutants either were missing pPT23A (29 mutants) or contained deletions in this plasmid (4 mutants). These results suggested that pPT23A was involved in coronatine production in strain PT23.2. This plasmid was introduced into P. syringae pv. syringae PS61, which does not produce coronatine. A bioassay for coronatine suggested that PS61(pPT23A) transconjugants were able to make this phytotoxin. In a chemical analysis, organic acids were isolated from PT23.2, PS61, and the transconjugant PS61(pPT23); these were derivatized to their methyl esters and analyzed by gas chromatography. The derivatized organic acids extracted from PT23.2 and PS61(pPT23A) contained peaks that corresponded to coronafacic acid, coronafacoylvaline, and coronatine, but these were absent in the extracts from the wild-type strain PS61. The identification of these components was confirmed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry. Therefore, the acquisition of pPT23A by PS61 resulted in biosynthesis of coronafacic acid, coronafacoylvaline, and coronatine, clearly demonstrating the involvement of pPT23A in coronatine production in P. syringae pv. tomato. 3aphytotoxins 3abiosynthesis 3aplasmids 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAmino Acidsxbiosynthesis 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aIndenesxbiosynthesis. 2aMutation 2aPlasmids 2aPseudomonasxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 0aDNA1 aMalvick, D.K.1 aMitchell, R.E.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Feb., v. 171, no. 2 p.807-812x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03113naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245008700168300001800255300002300273520147300296650002701769650002301796650002101819650002501840650001601865650001801881650002401899650002601923650001801949650002301967650002001990650005602010650003102066650002102097650002802118650002102146650003202167650001302199650002402212650002402236700001702260700001802277700002202295700001702317700001502334700001502349700001702364700001502381773008402396852000902480939003302489946001302522655001202535IND8901338620221120032736.0890303e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890133862DNAL7 a26442182pmid7 aPMC2096962pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobson, M.R.10aPhysical and genetic map of the major nif gene cluster from Azotobacter vinelandii  ap. 1017-1027.  ap. 1017-1027. ill.  aDetermination of a 28,793-base-pair DNA sequence of a region from the Azotobacter vinelandii genome that includes and flanks the nitrogenase structural gene region was completed. This information was used to revise the previously proposed organization of the major nif cluster. The major nif cluster from A. vinelandii encodes 15 nif-specific genes whose products bear significant structural identity to the corresponding nif-specific gene products from Klebsiella pneumoniae. These genes include nifH, nifD, nifK, nifT, nifY, nifE, nifN, nifX, nifU, nifS, nifV, nifW, nifZ, nifM, and nifF. Although there are significant spatial differences, the identified A. vinelandii nif-specific genes have the same sequential arrangement as the corresponding nif-specific genes from K. pneumoniae. Twelve other potential genes whose expression could be subject to nif-specific regulation were also found interspersed among the identified nif-specific genes. These potential genes do not encode products that are structurally related to the identified nif-specific gene products. Eleven potential nif-specific promoters were identified within the major nif cluster, and nine of these are preceded by an appropriate upstream activator sequence. A+T-rich regions were identified between 8 of the 11 proposed nif promoter sequences and their upstream activator sequences. Site-directed deletion-and-insertion mutagenesis was used to establish a genetic map of the major nif cluster. 3aAzotobacter vinelandii 3achromosome mapping 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3anitrogenase 3asoil bacteria 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAzotobacterxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCodonxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aPlasmids 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSpecies Specificity1 aBrigle, K.E.1 aBennett, L.T.1 aSetterquist, R.A.1 aWilson, M.S.1 aCash, V.L.1 aBeynon, J.1 aNewton, W.E.1 aDean, D.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Feb., v. 171, no. 2 p.1017-1027x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03414naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245011300163300001600276300002100292520184400313650001802157650002002175650002002195650001202215650003102227650002002258650001802278650003002296650006802326650001902394650003302413650001502446650002102461650002002482650002002502650002802522650001902550650001302569650003002582650002102612650002502633650002602658650002402684700001302708700001402721773008202735852000902817939003302826946001302859655001202872IND8901338220221120032636.0890303e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890133822DNAL7 a25366872pmid7 aPMC2096882pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, K.S.10aPurification and some properties of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter sp. strain JC1 DSM 3803  ap. 958-964.  ap. 958-964. ill.  aA brown carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from CO-autotrophically grown cells of Acinetobacter sp. strain JC1, which is unstable outside of the cells, was purified 80-fold in seven steps to better than 95% homogeneity, with a yield of 44% in the presence of the stabilizing agents iodoacetamide (1 mM) and ammonium sulfate (100 mM). The final specific activity was 474 micromol of acceptor reduced per min per mg of protein as determined by an assay based on the CO-dependent reduction of thionin.

One mole of native enzyme was found to contain 2 mol of each of flavin adenine dinucleotide and molybdenum and 8 mol each of nonheme iron and labile sulfide, which indicated that the enzyme was a molybdenum-containing iron-sulfur flavoprotein. The ratio of densities of each subunit after electrophoresis (alpha:beta:gamma = 1:2:6) and the number of each cofactor in the native enzyme suggest a alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 structure of the enzyme. The carbon monoxide dehydrogenase of Acinetobacter sp. strain JC1 was found to have no immunological relationship with the enzymes Pseudomonas carboxydohydrogena and Pseudomonas carboxydovorans. 3aAcinetobacter 3aoxidoreductases 3acarbon monoxide 3astrains 3aphysicochemical properties 3aenzyme activity 3asoil bacteria 2aAcinetobacterxenzymology 2aAldehyde Oxidoreductasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aChromatography 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aDurapatite 2aEnzyme Stability 2aHydroxyapatites 2aImmunodiffusion 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aIronxanalysis 2aKinetics 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMolecular Weight 2aMolybdenumxanalysis 2aMultienzyme Complexes 2aSpecies Specificity1 aRo, Y.T.1 aKim, Y.M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Feb., v. 171, no. 2 p.958-964x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02685naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245008000164300001800244300002300262520131900285650001601604650002901620650001301649650002001662650001701682650001901699650001401718650001701732650003501749650001801784650002401802650001301826650002501839650002101864650003201885650002001917650002901937650002701966650002701993650001402020700001802034773008402052852000902136939003302145946001302178655001202191IND8903486120221117183330.0890703e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890348612DNAL7 a24982902pmid7 aPMC2100662pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarr, D.B.10aProtein phosphorylation in Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroids and cultures  ap. 3420-3426.  ap. 3420-3426. ill.  aProtein phosphorylation was demonstrated in Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroids in vivo and in cultures in vivo and in vitro. Comparison of in vivo-labeled phosphoproteins of bacteroids and of cultured cells showed differences in both the pattern and intensity of labeling. In cultured cells, comparison of the labeling patterns and intensities of in vivo- and in vitro-labeled phosphoproteins showed a number of similarities. however, several phosphoproteins were found only after one of the two labeling conditions. The labeling intensity was time dependent in both in vivo and in vitro assays and was dependent on the presence of magnesium in in vitro assays. Differences in the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were noted for a number of proteins. The level of incorporation of 32P into protein was only 2% or less of the total phosphate accumulated during the in vivo labeling period. Several isolation and sample preparation procedures resulted in differences in labeling patterns. Phosphatase inhibitors and several potential metabolic effectors had negligible effects on the phosphorylation pattern. There were no significant changes in the phosphorylation patterns of cells cultured on mannitol, acetate, and succinate, although the intensity of the labeling did vary with the carbon source. 3aGlycine max 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aproteins 3aphosphorylation 3aroot nodules 3atissue culture 3asymbionts 3aheterotrophs 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCulture Media 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aKinetics 2aMannitolxmetabolism 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhosphoproteinsxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aRhizobiaceaexmetabolism 2aSoybeansxmicrobiology 2aSuccinatesxmetabolism 2aSymbiosis1 aEmerich, D.W.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 June, v. 171, no. 6 p.3420-3426x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02632naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245011000147300001600257520126800273650000901541650001101550650001401561650001601575650002801591650002901619650001401648650001001662650001201672650001101684650002301695650002801718650002801746650004201774650003001816650003901846650000901885650001401894650001001908700001701918700001401935700001501949700001701964773010201981852000902083939003302092946001302125655001202138IND9305387520221117183350.0930917e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930538752DNAL7 a84635112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKummerow, F.A.10aPlasma lipid physical properties in swine fed margarine or butter in relation to dietary magnesium intake  ap. 125-132.  aPlasma lipids obtained from swine which had been fed butter or margarine at two dietary magnesium (Mg) levels indicated that the level of dietary Mg was more significant to plasma total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than was the presence of butter or margarine.

Although at 247 mg Mg/kg plasma LDL-C was higher in swine fed margarine and HDL-C was higher in those fed butter, there were no significant differences in the order parameters of LDL and HDL. Studies in which the influences of dietary fats on plasma cholesterol were first noted were carried out on liquid diets deficient in Mg.

The anfA gene is located upstream from the nitrogenase-3 structural gene cluster (anfHDGK) and is preceded by a sequence that is potentially part of a ntrA-dependent promoter. The product of anfA appears to be required for expression of nitrogenase-3, since cells of the anfA deletion strain CA66 were unable to synthesize this nitrogenase when derepressed in N-free, Mo- and V-deficient medium. The vnfA gene was identified after determination of the nucleotide sequence of DNA flanking the Tn5 insertion in mutant strain CA46. Two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) were found located upstream from the vnfA gene, and a nifE-like ORF, preceded by a possible ntrA-dependent promoter, was found downstream from this gene. It is not known whether vnfA is expressed only under N2-fixing conditions. However, potential ntrA-dependent promoters were found immediately upstream from vnfA (within the 3' end of ORF2) and immediately downstream from ORF1. The region spanning ORF1 and ORF2 contained an A+T-rich sequence that was also found immediately upstream from the potential ntrA-dependent promoter of anfA. The product of vnfA appears to be required for the synthesis of nitrogenase-2, since cells of strain CA46 synthesized only nitrogenase-1 and -3 but not nitrogenase-2 when grown in the presence of vanadium. The product of nifA, which is required for synthesis of nitrogenase-1, is not required for synthesis of either nitrogenase-2 or nitrogenase-3. However, growth data indicate that nifA is required for a factor (or factors) necessary for maximal diazotrophic growth under Mo- and V-deficient conditions. 3anitrogen fixation 3aopen reading frames 3aAzotobacter vinelandii 3agenes 3anitrogenase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAzotobacterxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysis 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aNitrogenasexgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 0adiazotrophic growth 0anitrogenase-3 0anucleotide sequences 0anitrogenase-1 0anitrogenase-21 aJacobson, M.R.1 aBishop, P.E.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 June, v. 171, no. 6 p.3258-3267x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02922naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245013300165300001800298300002300316500001500339520127300354650001501627650001301642650002001655650002501675650001301700650001901713650002701732650001001759650002301769650004701792650002601839650002301865650002901888650003501917650003101952650002101983650003002004650004902034650001302083650003902096650002402135650002702159653001202186700001602198700001502214773008402229852000902313939003302322946001302355655001202368IND8903485920221117183405.0890630e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890348592DNAL7 a27227532pmid7 aPMC2100622pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukor, J.J.10aRecruitment of a chromosomally encoded maleylacetate reductase for degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by plasmid pJP4  ap. 3385-3390.  ap. 3385-3390. ill.  a2019-12-05  aWhen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1c or P. putida PPO200 or PPO300 carry plasmid pJP4, which encodes enzymes for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (TED) to 2-chloromaleylacetate, cells do not grow on TFD and UV-absorbing material with spectral characteristics of chloromaleylacetate accumulates in the culture medium. Using plasmid pRO1727, we cloned from the chromosome of a nonfluorescent pseudomonad, Pseudomonas sp. strain PKO1, 6- and 0.5-kilobase BamHI DNA fragments which contain the gene for maleylacetate reductase. When carrying either of the recombinant plasmids, pRO1944 or pRO1945, together with pJP4, cells of P. aeruginosa or P. putida were able to utilize TFD as a sole carbon source for growth. A novel polypeptide with an estimated molecular weight of 18,000 was detected in cell extracts of P. aeruginosa carrying either plasmid pRO1944 or plasmid pRO1945.

Recently, the genes encoding flavodoxin (nifF) and ferredoxin I (fdxA) were cloned and sequenced and mutants were constructed which are unable to synthesize either flavodoxin (DJ130) or ferredoxin I (LM100). Both single mutants grow at wild-type rates under N2-fixing conditions. Here we report the construction of a double mutant (DJ138) which does not synthesize either flavodoxin or ferredoxin I. When plated on ammonium-containing medium, this mutant had a very small colony size when compared with the wild type, and in liquid culture with ammonium, this double mutant grew three times slower than the wild type or single mutant strains. This demonstrated that there is an important metabolic function unrelated to nitrogen fixation that is normally carried out by either flavodoxin or ferredoxin. If either one of these proteins is missing, the other can substitute for it. The double mutant phenotype can now be used to screen site-directed mutant versions of ferredoxin I for functionality in vivo even though the specific function of ferredoxin I is still unknown. The double mutant grew at the same slow rate under N2-fixing conditions. Thus, A. vinelandii continues to fix N2 even when both flavodoxin and ferredoxin I are missing, which suggests that a third as yet unidentified protein also serves as an electron donor to nitrogenase. 3aAzotobacter vinelandii 3astrains 3agenes 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogenase 3amutation 2aAzotobacterxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aChromosomes, Bacterialxultrastructure 2aCloning, Molecular 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFerredoxinsxgenetics 2aFlavodoxinxgenetics 2aFlavoproteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 0acharacterization 0aferredoxin 0aelectron donors1 aBurgess, B.K.1 aLismaa, S.E.1 aSmartt, C.T.1 aJacobson, M.R.1 aDean, D.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 June, v. 171, no. 6 p.3162-3167x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02559naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245012300168300001800291300002300309500001500332520115600347650000901503650002801512650002001540650002101560650001301581650002001594650001001614650002101624650003301645650001301678650002601691650004101717650002401758650002401782653002101806653002701827653001401854700002101868700001901889700001701908773008501925852000902010939003302019946001302052655001202065IND8900802920221117183307.0890203e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890080292DNAL7 a31827312pmid7 aPMC2116242pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichiels, K.W.10aIsolation and characterization of Azospirillum brasilense loci that correct Rhizobium meliloti exoB and exoC mutations  ap. 5401-5404.  ap. 5401-5404. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe occurrence in Azospirillum brasilense of genes that code for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis was investigated through complementation studies of Rhizobium meliloti Exo- mutants.

We demonstrated that the exoC mutation of R. meliloti could be corrected for EPS production by several cosmid clones of a clone bank of A. brasilense ATCC 29145. However, the EPS produced differed in structure from the wild-type R. meliloti EPS, and the symbiotic deficiency of the exoC mutation was not reversed by any of these cosmid clones. The exoB mutation could be corrected not only for EPS production but also for the ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on alfalfa by one particular cosmid clone of A. brasilense. Tn5 insertions in the cloned DNA were isolated and used to construct Azospirillum mutants with mutations in the corresponding loci by marker exchange. It was found that these mutants failed to produce the wild-type high-molecular-weight EPS, instead produced EPSs of lower molecular weight. 3aloci 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aMedicago sativa 3aEnsifer meliloti 3amutation 3apolysaccharides 2aGenes 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMutation 2aNitrogenasexgenetics 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aSpirillumxgenetics 0acharacterization 0aSinorhizobium meliloti 0aisolation1 aVanderleyden, J.1 aVan Gool, A.P.1 aSigner, E.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Nov., v. 170, no. 11 p.5401-5404x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02473naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245014200163300001800305300002300323520114600346650000901492650001401501650001501515650001201530650002801542650001201570650002801582650001401610650002801624650006901652650000901721650002501730650003101755650002401786653001501810700001601825700001501841700001901856773008501875852000901960939003301969946001302002655001202015IND8900801620221117183313.0890202e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890080162DNAL7 a31827262pmid7 aPMC2115652pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, E.10aSubstrate utilization by Ehrlichia sennetsu and Ehrlichia risticii separated from host constituents by renografin gradient centrifugation  ap. 5012-5017.  ap. 5012-5017. ill.  aThe in vitro metabolic activities of two monocytic species of Ehrlichia were investigated. The Miyayama strain of Ehrlichia sennetsu and two strains of Ehrlichia risticii, isolated in Illinois and Maryland, were cultivated in a P388D(1), mouse macrophage cell line. The ehrlichia particles from heavily infected cultures were separated from host constituents by a Renografin gradient centrifugation procedure modified from those employed for rickettsiae and chlamydiae. The metabolic activities of the isolated ehrlichiae were measured by their formation of CO2 after incubation for 1 h or longer at 34 degree C with 14C-labeled substrates. Of the substrates tested, glutamine was utilized most vigorously. The greatest activity was obtained at pH 7.2 to 8.0, while the activity rapidly declined at pH below 7. The most favorable buffer was one that contained 0.05 M potassium phosphate as well as 0.2 M sucrose, thus affording some osmotic protection. Glutamate was utilized to a much lesser extent than glutamine, and glucose was not utilized at all. No consistent differences in metabolic activities among the three strains were observed. 3adogs 3aEhrlichia 3ametabolism 3astrains 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aCell Line 2aCentrifugationxmethods 2aEhrlichiaxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aRickettsiaceaexmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity 0asubstrates1 aDasch, G.A.1 aKang, Y.H.1 aWestfall, H.N.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Nov., v. 170, no. 11 p.5012-5017x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02697naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245010100165300001800266300002300284520111100307650002201418650002901440650002001469650001401489650001101503650002801514650001501542650001701557650001201574650001501586650002901601650003201630650001101662650003901673650003001712650004001742650003601782650002301818650001301841650002101854650001501875650003401890650002401924653002001948700001801968700001701986773008502003852000902088939003302097946001302130655001202143IND9000400620221117175618.0900125e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900040062DNAL7 a25302082pmid7 aPMC2104952pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguirre, J.10aOxidation of Neurospora crassa NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase by activated oxygen species  ap. 6243-6250.  ap. 6243-6250. ill.  aThe glutamine synthetase and the NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase activities of Neurospora crassa were lost in a culture without carbon source only when in the presence of air. Glutamine synthetase was previously reported to be liable to in vitro and in vivo inactivation by activated oxygen species. Here we report that NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase was remarkably stable in the presence of activated oxygen species but was rendered susceptible to oxidative inactivation when chelated iron was bound to the enzyme and either ascorbate or H2O2 reacted on the bound iron. This reaction gave rise to further modifications of the enzyme monomers by activated oxygen species, to partial dissociation of the oligomeric structure, and to precipitation and fragmentation of the enzyme. The in vitro oxidation reaction was affected by pH, temperature, and binding to the enzyme of NADPH. Heterogeneity in total charge was observed in the purified and immunoprecipitated enzymes, and the relative amounts of enzyme monomers with different isoelectric points changed with time of the oxidizing reaction. 3aNeurospora crassa 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies 2aAntigen-Antibody Complex 2aAscorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aCattle 2aDehydroascorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aGlutamate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aIronxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aNADPxmetabolism 2aNeurospora 2aNeurospora crassaxenzymology 2aOxidation-Reduction 0aoxygen radicals1 aRodriguez, R.1 aHansberg, W.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Nov., v. 171, no. 11 p.6243-6250x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02149naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245011400166300001800280300002300298520101600321650001301337650001201350650002301362650002301385650002301408650004101431650004501472650002101517650003101538650002401569700001501593700001501608773008501623852000901708939003301717946001301750655001201763IND9000399720221117175633.0900125e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900039972DNAL7 a25094242pmid7 aPMC2104582pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBancroft, I.10aPhysical and genetic maps of the genome of the heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120  ap. 5940-5948.  ap. 5940-5948. ill.  aA restriction map of the chromosome of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 was generated by the determination of the order of restriction fragments of the infrequently cleaving restriction endonucleases AvrII, SalI, and PstI.

Other infrequently cutting restriction endonucleases AhaII,Asp7l8, AsuII, BanII, BglII, BssHII, FspI, NcoI, NruI, SphI, SplI, SstII, and StuI) were identified that could prove useful for higher-resolution mapping. The chromosome was found to be 6.4 megabases in size and circular. Three apparently circular large plasmids (410, 190, and 110 kilobases) were also identified. A genetic map was constructed by hybridization with gene-specific probes. Genes encoding components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain were not within a single tight cluster. 3aAnabaena 3astrains 3achromosome mapping 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCyanobacteriaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Weight 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aRestriction Mapping1 aWolk, C.P.1 aOren, E.V.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Nov., v. 171, no. 11 p.5940-5948x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02635naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245014400167300001800311300002300329520114400352650002801496650001001524650002401534650001701558650001201575650002201587650001601609650001601625650002001641650001701661650001801678650001201696650003001708650002101738650003301759650001301792650003801805650002101843650001301864650001301877650002401890650004901914650001401963773008501977852000902062939003302071946001302104655001202117IND9000400320221117175615.0900125e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900040032DNAL7 a25536722pmid7 aPMC2104852pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriefer, U.B.10aGenes involved in lipopolysaccharide production and symbiosis are clustered on the chromosome of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae VF39  ap. 6161-6168.  ap. 6161-6168. ill.  aFour mutants of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae VF39 altered in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis were isolated upon random Tn5 mutagenesis. These mutants produced matt colonies on TY medium and showed autoagglutination and loss of motility. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, they lacked a slow-migrating carbohydrate band, corresponding to the complete LPS (LPSI). All four mutants formed small white nodules on Vicia hirsuta. These nodules were infected but showed no nitrogen-fixing activity and senesced prematurely. Three of the mutants were complemented by a wild-type cosmid to synthesis of normal LPS and induction of nitrogen-fixing nodules. By hybridization and in vivo cloning experiments, the mutations were mapped within different EcoRI fragments which could be localized on the VF39 chromosome. Cross-complementation analyses revealed that the three mutants were affected in different transcriptional units. The results indicate that a cluster of genes necessary for LPSI production and symbiotic efficiency is located within a defined region of 20 kilobases on the R. leguminosarum bv. viciae chromosome. 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3agenes 3alipopolysaccharides 3abiosynthesis 3amutants 3anitrogen fixation 3achromosomes 3anitrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3aroot nodules 3aVicia hirsuta 2aCosmids 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenotype 2aLipopolysaccharidesxbiosynthesis 2aMultigene Family 2aMutation 2aPlasmids 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRhizobiumxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSymbiosis0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 Nov., v. 171, no. 11 p.6161-6168x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03073naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245012000165300001800285300002300303520137400326650004301700650003201743650001001775650001301785650002501798650002501823650002901848650002401877650003901901650003301940650002101973650001801994650007002012650001502082650004202097650002302139650002802162650003002190650003302220650005402253650002202307650002702329653002802356700001902384773008502403852000902488939003302497946001302530655001202543IND9100132320221117175646.0910107e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910013232DNAL7 a17014262pmid7 aPMC2107802pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, K.L.10aIsolation of the second Bacillus thuringiensis RNA polymerase that transcribes from a crystal protein gene promoter  ap. 6682-6688.  ap. 6682-6688. ill.  aA crystal protein gene of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD-1-Dipel is transcribed in vivo from two overlapping promoters that are activated at different times during sporulation. We reported earlier (K. L. Brown and H. R. Whiteley, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:4166-4170,1988) that an RNA polymerase containing a sigma subunit with an apparent Mr of 35,000 cantranscribe in vitro from the promoter utilized from early to midsporulation. We now report the isolation of an RNApolymerase containing a sigma subunit with an Mr of ca. 28,000; this polymerase activates transcription in vitrofrom the promoter used from mid- to late sporulation. This form of RNA polymerase also directs transcriptionin vitro from promoters preceding two other crystal protein genes and a gene coding for a spore coatprotein. On the basis of a comparison of the four promoters, we propose the following consensus sequence for the -10region recognized by RNA polymerase containing the Mr-28,000 sigma subunit: 5'-TNATANNaTGag-3'. Noconsensus sequence could be derived for the -35 region. When the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the sigma28 polypeptide was aligned with the amino acid sequences of known sigma subunits, significant homology was foundwith the N terminus of the mature form of the sigmaK subunit of RNA polymerase isolated from sporulating cellsof Bacillus subtilis. 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3agenes 3aproteins 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacillus thuringiensisxenzymology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxins 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerasesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEndotoxins 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNA, Bacterialxbiosynthesis 2aSigma Factorxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSpores, Bacterial 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data1 aWhiteley, H.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1990 Dec., v. 172, no. 12 p.6682-6688x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03251naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245013600148300001600284520137400300650001101674650001801685650000801703650002501711650002501736650002401761650001201785650004101797650001801838650002201856650003201878650000801910650002901918650003101947650001701978650002801995650002102023650002402044650001302068650006402081650006602145650002402211650003402235653001202269653002802281653001902309653001902328653001902347653001902366700001702385700001802402700001802420700002102438700001702459773009602476852000902572939003302581946001102614655001202625IND9305413320221122233843.0930917e199306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930541332DNAL7 a83413172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalrymple, B.P.10aCloning and characterisation of cDNA clones encoding two Babesia bovis proteins with homologous amino- and carboxy-terminal domains  ap. 181-190.  aA dextran sulphate protein (DSP) fraction derived from Babesia bovis has previously been shown to induce a protective immune response in cattle. A B. bovis cDNA library was screened with both the complete anti-DSP serum and a subfraction of the anti-DSP serum affinity purified on a native B. bovis protein of approx. 80 kDa. cDNA clones encoding two different B. bovis proteins were identified. The product of one gene, Bv80, has a single divergent copy of a sequence of 149 amino acids (approx. 30% amino acid identity) in both the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. These domains are separated by an array of short variant repeat sequences rich in proline and glutamic acid. The product of the other gene. BvVA1 (homologous to the previously described 225-kDa B. bovis protein [19], is predicted to have a single divergent copy of a sequence of 170-171 amino acids (approx. 35% amino acid identity) in both the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. These domains are also separated by an array of repeats. The 73-amino acid repeat unit of this array is composed of a number of variant derivatives of shorter repeat units. Detailed analysis of genomic clones flanking two alleles of the gene encoding BvVA1/225 kDa identified further members of a multi-gene family. This region of the genome of B. bovis has been subject to a large number of amplification processes. 3acattle 3aBabesia bovis 3aDNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBabesia bovisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aDNA 2aDNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlasmids 2aProtozoan Proteinsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m80426 0agenbank/m87623 0agenbank/m87624 0agenbank/m931261 aPeters, J.M.1 aGoodger, B.V.1 aBushell, G.R.1 aWaltisbuhl, D.J.1 aWright, I.G.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1993 June, v. 59, no. 2 p.181-190x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01762naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245004900145300001800194520085800212650002201070650001101092650001901103651001801122653001601140700001801156700001701174700001401191700001701205700001601222700001701238700001701255773007301272852000901345939003301354946001301387655001201400IND9305412420221122233944.0930917e19930528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930541242DNAL7 a177554262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWofsy, S.C.10aNet exchange of CO2 in a mid-latitude forest  ap. 1314-1317.  aThe eddy correlation method was used to measure the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide continuously from April 1990 to December 1991 in a deciduous forest in central Massachusetts. The annual net uptake was 3.7 +/- 0.7 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year. Ecosystem respiration, calculated from the relation between nighttime exchange and soil temperature, was 7.4 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year, implying gross ecosystem production of 11.1 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year. The observed rate of accumulation of carbon reflects recovery from agricultural development in the 1800s. Carbon uptake rates were notably larger than those assumed for temperate forests in global carbon studies. Carbon storage in temperate forests can play an important role in determining future concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. 3adeciduous forests 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aMassachusetts 0arespiration1 aGoulden, M.L.1 aMunger, J.W.1 aFan, S.M.1 aBakwin, P.S.1 aDaube, B.C.1 aBassow, S.L.1 aBazzaz, F.A.0 tScience.g1993 May 28, v. 260, no. 5112 p.1314-1317x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01783naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245008700168300001600255300002100271520039300292650002800685650001100713650001200724650001300736650001900749650001700768650001300785650002500798650003100823650002100854650006500875650002100940650002000961650002700981650005201008650001301060650002501073650001401098653001301112653001101125700001601136773008201152852000901234939003301243946001301276655001201289IND9100215920221122174036.0910114e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910021592DNAL7 a18989252pmid7 aPMC2072012pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobson, E.S.10aCatecholamine uptake, melanization, and oxygen toxicity in Cryptococcus neoformans  ap. 401-403.  ap. 401-403. ill.  aOxygen sensitivity mutations of Cryptococcus neoformans were mapped to three genetic loci.

Two types of mechanosensory cells, several multipolar and many bipolar cells, were found in the posterior wall of the genital chamber. Females whose nerves from these sensory cells were severed failed to switch from the egg progression stage to the rest phase. The clustered multipolar cells spread their dendrites in the basement membrane of the epidermis of the genital chamber wall. More than 35 bipolar cells were scattered in the concerned area. Mechanical stimulation of these sensory cells evoked a tonic afferent response and a change in the efferent pattern. Consequently, the genital chamber contracted as a whole, and the frequency twitching of the spermathecal duct increased. The sperm may be squeezed out, by the intense twitch of the duct, to fertilize the egg. Contraction of the genital chamber forces the egg backwards. Thus, sensory information from the mechanosensory cells in die genital chamber terminates egg progression, and releases the rest phase, or the fertilization step. The link between the rest phase and the subsequent egg deposition step is also discussed. 3asexual behavior 3aTeleogryllus commodus 3aoviposition 3aova 3afemale genitalia 3aneurons 3areproductive behavior 3amechanoreceptors 3afertilization (reproduction) 0areproductive organs 0aanatomy and morphology0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1993 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.335-346x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02347naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002400149245007300173300001800246300002300264520098300287650002901270650001201299650001801311650001801329650001601347650001301363650001501376650001301391650001501404650003001419650003001449650002101479650004001500650001401540650003601554650003901590653002301629653001401652653001201666700001901678700001701697773008401714852000901798939003301807946001301840655001201853IND9103377620221122141402.0910826e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910337762DNAL7 a20135732pmid7 aPMC2078202pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeinot-Drebot, L.M.14aThe RSF1 gene regulates septum formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 2556-2561.  ap. 2556-2561. ill.  aSeptum formation in the mitotic cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs by conversion of the chitin ring, laid down at bud formation, into the primary septum. We show here that under certain conditions this septation is dependent on the newly identified RSF1 gene. However, cells harboring the rsf1-1 mutation accumulated in a postcytokinesis state, with delayed conversion of the chitin-rich annulus into the primary septum. This rsf1-1-mediated inhibition of septum formation only occurred under conditions of biosynthetic stress and was correlated with biosynthetically mediated inhibition of the cell-cycle regulatory step START. The RSF1 gene is distinct from the CHS2 chitin synthase gene that is responsible for septation, and thus RSF1 most likely encodes a regulator of chitin synthesis. We hypothesize that RSF] activity facilitates septum formation during times of biosynthetic stress, to allow efficient septation even under these conditions. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3astrains 3amorphogenesis 3acell division 3acell growth 3anitrogen 3astarvation 3amutation 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Divisionxphysiology 2aChitin Synthasexgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aNitrogenxdeficiencyxpharmacology. 2aPhenotype 2aReproduction, Asexualxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 0agenetic regulation 0amembranes 0atissues1 aJohnston, G.C.1 aSinger, R.A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1991 Apr., v. 173, no. 8 p.2556-2561x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02522naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245011000132300001600242300002100258520159100279650002901870650001201899650002201911650001601933653001501949653002201964700001901986700001302005700001402018700001502032773008202047852000902129939003302138946001302171655001202184IND9001001720221122141300.0900307e199001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900100172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Der Lelie, D.10aConjugal mobilization of streptococcal plasmid pMV158 between strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis  ap. 102-109.  ap. 102-109. ill.  apMV158, a non-self-transmissible plasmid encoding tetracycline resistance, was conjugally transferred from Enterococcus faecalis JH203 to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403.

In E. coli(pBAMY100), more than 86% of the active amylase was located in the periplasm, and TnphoA fusion experiments showed that the enzyme had a functional signal peptide. The B. fibrisolvens amylase is a calcium metalloenzyme, and three conserved putative calcium-binding residues were identified. The amylase showed high sequence homology with other alpha-amylases in the three highly conserved regions which constitute the active centers. These and other conserved regions were located in the N-terminal half, and no similarity with any other amylase was detected in the remainder of the protein. Deletion of approximately 40% of the C-terminal portion of the amylase did not result in loss of amylolytic activity. The B. fibrisolvens amylase was identified as an endo-alpha-amylase by hydrolysis of the Phadebas amylase substrate, hydrolysis of gamma-cyclodextrin to maltotriose, maltose, and glucose and the characteristic shape of the blue value and reducing sugar curves. Maltotriose was the major initial hydrolysis product from starch, although extended incubation resulted in its hydrolysis to maltose and glucose. 3aButyrivibrio fibrisolvens 3acalcium 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3abinding sites 3asignal peptide 3aenzyme activity 3aalpha-amylase 3arumen bacteria 0acloning 0arequirements 0a5' leader sequence 0aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m62507 0adeletions1 aRawlings, D.E.1 aLindsey, G.G.1 aWoods, D.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1991 July, v. 173, no. 13 p.4203-4211x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03178naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245013700165300001800302300002300320520143000343650001301773650002701786650002501813650001701838650002501855650002301880650002001903650003201923650002401955650004401979650004602023650001802069650002302087650002102110650002702131650001302158650002402171650003202195650003202227650002802259650003702287650002302324653001602347653001602363653001902379653002802398700001902426700001602445773008402461852000902545939003302554946001302587655001202600IND9103937420221122105022.0911008e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910393742DNAL7 a19005032pmid7 aPMC2077132pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoshino, T.10aIsolation of the braZ gene encoding the carrier for a novel branched-chain amino acid transport system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO  ap. 1855-1861.  ap. 1855-1861. ill.  aThe braZ gene for a novel branched-chain amino acid transport system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO was isolated and characterized. Determination of the nucleotide sequence showed that the braZ gene comprises 1,311 nucleotides specifying a protein of 437 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis suggested that the product is an integral membrane protein with 12 membrane-spanning segments. The amino acid sequence showed extensive homology to those of the braB and brnQ gene products, branched-chain amino acid carriers of P. aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium, respectively. By using the T7 RNA polymerase-promoter system, the braZ gene product was identified as a protein of an apparent Mr of 34,000 on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Properties of the transport system encoded by braZ were studied by using P. aeruginosa PAO3537, defective in both the high- and low-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport systems (LIV-I and LIV-II, respectively). The transport system encoded by braZ was found to be another effective branched-chain amino acid transport system in P. aeruginosa PAO and was thus designated as LIV-III. This system is specific for isoleucine and valine, giving the same Km value of 12 micromole for these amino acids. The system was found, however, to have a very low affinity for leucine, with a Km value of 150 micromole, which contrasts with the substrate specificities of LIV-I and LIV-II. 3abacteria 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic code 3anucleotide sequences 3anutrient transport 3anutrient uptake 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aIsoleucinexmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLeucinexmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aMembrane Transport Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxgenetics 2aValinexmetabolism 0addbj/d90222 0aembl/d90222 0agenbank/d90222 0amolecular sequence data1 aKose-Terai, K.1 aUratani, Y.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1991 Mar., v. 173, no. 6 p.1855-1861x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03589naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245012900167300001800296300002300314500001500337520169300352650000902045650002402054650001602078650002002094650001702114650002102131650001302152650002302165650002302188650002802211650001502239650002702254650002302281650002302304650001202327650003002339650002102369650002002390650002002410650004502430650003102475650003202506650001402538650001302552650004102565650002402606650002402630653001202654653003002666653001802696653001402714653002702728700001602755700001602771773008502787852000902872939003302881946001302914655001202927IND9103975620221122105006.0911010e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910397562DNAL7 a16480742pmid7 aPMC2080442pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharles, T.C.10andvF, a novel locus located on megaplasmid pRmeSU47b (pEXO) of Rhizobium meliloti, is required for normal nodule development  ap. 3981-3992.  ap. 3981-3992. ill.  a2019-12-05  aRhizobium meliloti strains carrying either of two overlapping deletions (delta 5408 and delta F114) of the megaplasmid pRmeSU47b form nodules on alfalfa which fail to fix N2 (Fix-). Strains carrying these deletions also fail to fluoresce on media containing calcofluor, indicating a defect in synthesis of the acidic exopolysaccharide (Exo-) of R. meliloti. We have isolated cosmid clones (pTH21 and pTH22) which complement the Fix- but not the Exo- phenotype of the strains carrying the delta 5408 and delta F114 deletions. In addition, cosmid clones which complement the Exo- phenotype fail to complement the Fix- phenotype of these deletions; thus, the Exo- phenotype is not related to the Fix- phenotype. A 5-kb region within a 7.3-kb BamHI restriction fragment was found to be required for complementation of the Fix- phenotype of the delta 5408 and delta F114 deletion strains. Tn5 insertions in the 5-kb region generated a Fix- phenotype when recombined into the wild-type genome. We have designated this locus ndvF, for nodule development. TnphoA mutagenesis of this region generated active alkaline-phosphatase gene fusions, indicating that ndvF encodes extracytoplasmic protein(s). Induction of nodules by the ndvF mutants was delayed by 2 to 3 days compared with induction by the wild-type strain. Light microscopy of nodules elicited by strains carrying the large 150-kb delta 114 deletion, a 12-kb deletion removing ndvF, or an individual ndvF::Tn5 insertion mutation demonstrated that many nodules contained few infected cortical cells, indicating that nodule development was blocked early in the infection process, before the release of bacteria from the infection threads. 3aloci 3arestriction mapping 3amutagenesis 3aMedicago sativa 3aroot nodules 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aplasmids 3alinkage (genetics) 3abacterial proteins 3agenetic complementation 3anodulation 3abiological development 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCosmids 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aMedicago sativaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPlasmids 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 0acloning 0aextracytoplasmic proteins 0aplant anatomy 0adeletions 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aNewcomb, W.1 aFinan, T.M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1991 July, v. 173, no. 13 p.3981-3992x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03281naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002100183245008100204300001800285500002400303506007600327520159100403506003701994650002502031650001402056650001902070650002202089650001102111650001502122650001602137650001502153650001702168650001102185650001402196650002502210650002802235650002502263650003902288650002302327650003802350650002402388650002402412650002802436700002402464700002502488700002802513773010702541852000902648856008202657655001202739IND4407494020221207053524.0080704e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440749402DNAL7 a185155012pmid7 aPMC24384562pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.108.0581312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowe, Heather C.10aBiochemical Networks and Epistasis Shape the Arabidopsis thaliana Metabolome  ap. 1199-1216.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenomic approaches have accelerated the study of the quantitative genetics that underlie phenotypic variation. These approaches associate genome-scale analyses such as transcript profiling with targeted phenotypes such as measurements of specific metabolites. Additionally, these approaches can help identify uncharacterized networks or pathways. However, little is known about the genomic architecture underlying data sets such as metabolomics or the potential of such data sets to reveal networks. To describe the genetic regulation of variation in the Arabidopsis thaliana metabolome and test our ability to integrate unknown metabolites into biochemical networks, we conducted a replicated metabolomic analysis on 210 lines of an Arabidopsis population that was previously used for targeted metabolite quantitative trait locus (QTL) and global expression QTL analysis. Metabolic traits were less heritable than the average transcript trait, suggesting that there are differences in the power to detect QTLs between transcript and metabolite traits. We used statistical analysis to identify a large number of metabolite QTLs with moderate phenotypic effects and found frequent epistatic interactions controlling a majority of the variation. The distribution of metabolite QTLs across the genome included 11 QTL clusters; 8 of these clusters were associated in an epistatic network that regulated plant central metabolism. We also generated two de novo biochemical network models from the available data, one of unknown function and the other associated with central plant metabolism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aepistasis 3agenetic traits 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3astatistical analysis 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEpistasis, Genetic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aModels, Statistical 2aModels, Theoretical 2aQuantitative Trait Loci1 aHansen, Bjarne Gram1 aHalkier, Barbara Ann1 aKliebenstein, Daniel J.0 tplant cell.g2008 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.1199-1216dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.108.0581313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02614naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100001700175245008200192300001600274500002400290520100100314650001201315650001401327650001001341650001301351650001201364650001701376650001001393650001601403650001701419650001601436650001501452650001501467650001001482650001101492650001201503650002001515650001001535650003101545650001101576650003401587650001001621650001101631650001601642650001601658650003201674700001501706700001901721700001301740773008201753852000901835856008701844930003301931945002501964946001101989655001202000IND4388988320221122063838.0070315e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438898832DNAL7 a170551112pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2006.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aFletcher, B.10aHow visual images of chocolate affect the craving and guilt of female dieters  ap. 211-217.  aIncludes references  aThis study asks whether exposure to images of chocolate induces cravings and guilty feelings in females. A further aim was to examine whether these effects are heightened in the case of dieters. The participants, 85 females, saw a series of enticing media images, either of chocolate or of non-food products. Two thirds of the sample were dieting or had dieted in the past; 15% had been on seven or more diets. After viewing the images all participants completed the Attitudes to Chocolate Questionnaire (ACQ) [Benton, Greenfield, & Morgan (1998). The development of the attitudes to chocolate questionnaire. Personality and Individual Differences, 24(4), 513-520]. The different conditions affected only those who dieted. Dieters had significantly higher ACQ scores after viewing the chocolate images than the non-dieters. It is suggested that dietary restriction increases desire for forbidden foods, in the form of craving, and may induce negative affect such as guilt, anxiety and depression. 3acraving 3achocolate 3awomen 3aemotions 3adieting 3afood beliefs 3agirls 3aadolescents 3ayoung adults 3aadvertising 3abody image 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAffect 2aArousal 2aBody Mass Index 2aCacao 2aDiet, Reducingxpsychology 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology. 2aGuilt 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhotography 2aSurveys and Questionnaires.1 aPine, K.J.1 aWoodbridge, Z.1 aNash, A.0 tAppetite.g2007 Mar., v. 48, no. 2 p.211-217dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2006.09.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/08/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03141naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175100002000184245007300204300001600277500002400293520145500317650001901772650001301791650001301804650002801817650001301845650000801858650001701866650003601883650002901919650002101948650002201969650001001991650003802001650002502039650002802064650002302092650002502115650002702140650001102167650000902178650002302187650003502210650002302245700001902268700001702287773008202304852000902386856008702395930003302482945002502515946001102540655001202551IND4388987820221122060253.0070315e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438898782DNAL7 a170951172pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2006.08.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aX3801 aBackhouse, S.H.14aThe influence of water ingestion during prolonged exercise on affect  ap. 193-198.  aIncludes references  aThis study examined the influence of water ingestion on affect and perceived exertion during sub-maximal running. Fifteen endurance-trained men performed two counterbalanced 90-min treadmill runs at 70% V.O(2) max. No fluid was ingested during one trial (NF-trial), whereas a single water bolus (5.0 mL kg-1 body mass) was ingested immediately preexercise and every 20 min during exercise (2.0 mL kg-1 bodymass) in a fluid replacement trial (FR-trial). Affect and perceived exertion were repeatedly assessed and physiological changes monitored. Perceived exertion and heart rate increased significantly during the run but there were no differences between conditions. Such similarities were not reflected in the pleasure--displeasure ratings, which were maintained above baseline levels during exercise in the FR-trial but declined below baseline during the NF-trial. A significant postexercise improvement in rated pleasure--displeasure was found only in the FR-trial, leading to significantly higher ratings of pleasure--displeasure during the recovery period compared to the NF-trial. Self-reported Energy was also enhanced postexercise only in the FR-trial. Body mass decrease was significantly larger and thirst ratings were significantly higher in the NF-trial compared to the FR-trial. In summary, water ingestion attenuated the during-exercise decrease in pleasure--displeasure and elicited an improvement after prolonged, submaximal running. 3adrinking water 3aexercise 3aemotions 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3asweating 3amen 3ayoung adults 3adehydration (animal physiology) 3aphysiological regulation 3abody temperature 3awater requirement 2aAdult 2aAffectxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDrinkingxphysiology 2aHeart Ratexphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPhysical Endurancexphysiology 2aThirstxphysiology1 aBiddle, S.J.H.1 aWilliams, C.0 tAppetite.g2007 Mar., v. 48, no. 2 p.193-198dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2006.08.0643Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/08/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02926naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100001900175245009500194300001600289500002400305520116000329650002501489650001901514650002701533650001001560650001701570650000801587650001001595650002301605650002501628650001201653650001501665650001001680650003601690650003701726650001101763650000901774650002101783650001101804650002301815650000901838650001601847650001501863650002301878650001601901650002201917653002801939653002401967700001401991700001902005700001702024773008202041852000902123856008702132930003302219945002502252946001102277655001202288IND4388987020221122060212.0070315e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438898702DNAL7 a170349022pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2006.07.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aStoeckel, L.E.10aMotivational state modulates the hedonic value of food images differently in men and women  ap. 139-144.  aIncludes references  aWe investigated visual alimentary alliesthesia in non-fasted (N=369) and fasted participants (N=257) viewing photographs of food.

The strongest evidence of alliesthesia was found in women. Fasting enhanced the pleasantness of food images for each of the food categories in women, although this alliesthesia effect was smaller in response to dessert foods compared to the less-pleasantly-rated food categories. In addition, non-fasting women exhibited significant positive correlations between hunger ratings and valence ratings of three of the five food categories. There was no significant difference in valence ratings of food between fasting vs. non-fasting men, but non-fasting men showed correlations between hunger and valence that were similar to those observed among the women. No evidence was found of hunger- or fasting-induced enhancement of hedonic ratings of non-foods in women or men, indicating the specificity of the alliesthesia effect for the food images only. 3apsychosocial factors 3ahuman behavior 3aattitudes and opinions 3afoods 3apalatability 3amen 3awomen 3agender differences 3adigestive physiology 3afasting 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAppetite Regulationxphysiology 2aFastingxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aFood 2aFood Preferences 2aHumans 2aHungerxphysiology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotivation 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aSex Factors 2aTastexphysiology 0aalimentary alliesthesia 0aphotographs of food1 aCox, J.E.1 aCook, E.W.

Both D. nigrescens and D. cochinchinensis β-glucosidases could hydrolyze conjugated soybean glycosides, but D. nigrescens β-glucosidase hydrolyzed both conjugated and nonconjugated glycosides in crude soybean extract more rapidly. The kinetic properties Km, kcat, and kcat/Km of the Dalbergia β-glucosidases toward conjugated isoflavonoid glycosides, determined using high-performance liquid chromatography, confirmed the higher efficiency of the D. nigrescens β-glucosidase in hydrolyzing these substrates. The D. nigrescens β-glucosidase could also efficiently hydrolyze isoflavone glycosides in soy flour suspensions, suggesting its application to increase free isoflavones in soy products. 3aDalbergia 3abeta-glucosidase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aglycosides 3aisoflavonoids 3asoybeans 3afood processing 3asoy flour 0aDalbergia cochinchinensis 0aDalbergia nigrescens1 aRimlumduan, T.1 aSvasti, J.1 aKetudat Cairns, J.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Mar. 21, v. 55, no. 6 p.2407-2412dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf062885p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070824b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle02329naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001400146245010400160300001800264500002400282520104300306650001501349650001301364650001701377650002101394650002001415650002101435650002001456650002701476650004801503653002001551700001301571700001601584773016201600852000901762856007701771930003301848945002501881946001301906655001201919IND4389532820221122060234.0070320e20070321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438953282DNAL7 a10.1021/jf062946j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1201 aXia, S.K.10aEnriched Selenium and Its Effects on Growth and Biochemical Composition in Lactobacillus bulgaricus  ap. 2413-2417.  aIncludes references  aSe-enriched Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) was generated by administration of sodium selenite (0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 mg/L, respectively) in MRS medium and enriched selenium manifestation in L. bulgaricus was investigated using transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and alterations of essential elements and amino acids in the organism were evaluated. We demonstrate that administration of sodium selenite in the dosage of 1-16 mg/L is suitable for selenium enrichment in L. bulgaricus and can enhance nutritive value in the organism by elevating the contents of essential elements including P, Mg, Mn, Zn, Ca, and total amino acids as well as reducing selenite to insoluble elemental selenium, an electron-dense and amorphous Se (0) granule, thereby depositing it both in the cytoplasm and in the extracellular space of L. bulgaricus.

After 168 h, uptake and translocation of [14C]tritosulfuron were reduced by 60 and 89%, respectively, when Na-bentazon was added to the mixture. Addition of (NH4)2SO4 or replacement of Na-bentazon with NH4-bentazon completely eliminated the negative effects on [14C]tritosulfuron uptake but not on its translocation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that a mixture of Na-bentazon plus tritosulfuron plus DASH HC (0.156%) formed a rough layer of grain-like crystals on the leaf surface, whereas the addition of (NH4)2SO4 or replacement of Na-bentazon with NH4-bentazon resulted in amorphous deposits that may be more easily absorbed. The antagonism of tritosulfuron's phytotoxicity by Na-bentazon involves two separate processes, chemical (uptake effect) and biochemical (translocation effect). 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3aphytotoxicity 3asulfonylurea herbicides 3abentazon 3apesticide mixtures 3aphysiological transport 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 0asodium bentazon 0atritosulfuron1 aStephenson, G.R.1 aMcLean, M.D.1 aSatchivi, N.M.1 aHall, J.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Mar. 21, v. 55, no. 6 p.2268-2275dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf062633o3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070823b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/23  aOther US 7aarticle02254naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001200155245006600167300001800233500002400251520096000275650001501235650002301250650001501273650001201288650002401300650002001324650001501344650000901359650002301368650001401391653002201405653002101427653002501448700001601473773016201489852000901651856007701660930003301737945002501770946001301795655001201808IND4389487520221122044809.0070320e20070321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438948752DNAL7 a10.1021/jf063048q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH0001 aKah, M.10aPrediction of the Adsorption of Ionizable Pesticides in Soils  ap. 2312-2322.  aIncludes references  aAdsorption of six acidic and four basic pesticides was measured in nine temperate soils. In general, sorption of acids was weak as compared to bases and followed the order dicamba < metsulfuron-methyl < fluazifop-P < metribuzin < 2,4-D < flupyrsulfuron-methyl < fluroxypyr < terbutryn < pirimicarb < fenpropimorph. Adsorption was negatively correlated with soil pH and positively correlated with organic carbon content. Statistical analysis against a wide range of soil and pesticide descriptors was used to identify the best combination of properties that describes the variation in adsorption. A regression equation including Log D (lipophilicity corrected for pH), the soil organic carbon content, and a pesticide descriptor (related to the van der Waals volume) was selected to predict the adsorption of acids (r2 = 72.1% on an independent dataset). The behavior of bases was more complex, and approaches specific to each compound seem to be required. 3apesticides 3apesticide residues 3aadsorption 3asoil pH 3asoil organic carbon 3atemperate soils 3aprediction 3aions 3aagricultural soils 3aequations 0aacidic pesticides 0abasic pesticides 0aionizable pesticides1 aBrown, C.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Mar. 21, v. 55, no. 6 p.2312-2322dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf063048q3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070824b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle03065naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001700155245013300172300001800305500002400323500001500347520165700362650002502019650004402044650002102088650002202109650001402131650002202145650002302167653001302190653008402203653002102287700001602308773016202324852000902486856007702495930003302572945002502605946001302630655001202643IND4389487420221122044934.0070320e20070321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438948742DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06254072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ5001 aSpaccini, R.10aMolecular Characterization of Compost at Increasing Stages of Maturity. 2.

Off-line thermochemolysis of both fresh and mature composts released various lignin-derived molecules, the quantitative measurement of which was used to calculate structural indices related to compost maturity. These indicated that most of the molecular transformation occurred within the first 60 days of the composting process, whereas slighter molecular variations were observed thereafter. Both 13C NMR spectra and offline pyrograms suggested that the process of compost maturity was characterized by a progressive decrease of alkyl components, whereas cellulose polysaccharides appeared to be more resistant and began to be transformed at a later composting period. The main components of the final mature compost were lignocellulosic material and hydrophobic alkyl moieties, inasmuch as that commonly found in well-humified organic matter of soils and sediments. The persistence of untransformed lignin-derived products and di- and triterpenoids throughout the maturity period suggested that these molecules are useful markers to both evaluate compost origin and trace its fate in the environment. Thermochemolysis provided the same characterization of molecules either unbound or bound to the compost matrix as that reached by a previously applied sequential chemical fractionation of the same compost materials, thereby indicating that thermochemolysis is a more rapid and equally efficient tool to assess compost molecular quality. 3achemical composition 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3acompost maturity 3aorganic compounds 3apyrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 0acomposts 0across-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0athermochemolysis1 aPiccolo, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 Mar. 21, v. 55, no. 6 p.2303-2311dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06254073Available from publisher's Web site  a20070824b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle02211naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245006000131300001800191500002400209520104100233650003101274650002101305650001701326650001201343650002501355650001901380650002901399650002201428650001401450650001301464650001101477650003301488650000901521650000901530650001401539650001701553650001801570650001401588650001701602650001001619773013901629852000901768655001201777IND4376889320221122044923.0051225e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437688932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParodi, Peter W.10aDairy Product Consumption and the Risk of Breast Cancer  ap. 556S-568S.  aIncludes references  aIt has been suggested in some reports that dairy product consumption may increase the risk of breast cancer. This review gives a brief overview of the etiology of breast cancer and in particular the roles of fat, bovine growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 and estrogens. Evidence from animal studies and epidemiology does not support a role for fat in the etiology of breast cancer. The daily intake of insulin-like growth factor-1 and biologically active estrogens from dairy products is minute in comparison to the daily endogenous secretion of these factors in women, whereas bovine growth hormone is biologically inactive in humans. On the other hand, milk contains rumenic acid, vaccenic acid, branched chain fatty acids, butyric acid, cysteine-rich whey proteins, calcium and vitamin D; components, which have the potential to help prevent breast cancer. Evidence from more than 40 case-control studies and 12 cohort studies does not support an association between dairy product consumption and the risk of breast cancer. 3abranched chain fatty acids 3abreast neoplasms 3abutyric acid 3acalcium 3acase-control studies 3acohort studies 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adairy consumption 3aestrogens 3aetiology 3ahumans 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amilk 3arisk 3asecretion 3asomatotropin 3avaccenic acid 3avitamin D 3awhey protein 3awomen0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2005 Dec., v. 24, no. 90006 p.556S-568SdAmerican College of Nutritionx0731-57247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245011700184300001800301500002400319520097800343650001501321650001201336650001401348650001801362650002501380650001201405650002301417650001701440650001801457650001501475650001901490650002601509650001101535650001101546650001501557650002301572650001201595650003601607650002501643650003801668650003201706650002301738650001501761650002201776650002201798650001301820700002101833700002001854700001601874773009901890852000901989856005301998655001202051IND4434862520221122034904.0100402e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443486252DNAL7 a200423292pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvira, P.10aPretreatment technologies for an efficient bioethanol production process based on enzymatic hydrolysis: A review  ap. 4851-4861.  aIncludes references  aBiofuel produced from lignocellulosic materials, so-called second generation bioethanol shows energetic, economic and environmental advantages in comparison to bioethanol from starch or sugar. However, physical and chemical barriers caused by the close association of the main components of lignocellulosic biomass, hinder the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose to fermentable sugars. The main goal of pretreatment is to increase the enzyme accessibility improving digestibility of cellulose. Each pretreatment has a specific effect on the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin fraction thus, different pretreatment methods and conditions should be chosen according to the process configuration selected for the subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation steps. This paper reviews the most interesting technologies for ethanol production from lignocellulose and it points out several key properties that should be targeted for low-cost and advanced pretreatment processes. 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3acellulose 3adigestibility 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymes 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3aproduction technology 3astarch 3asugars 2aAdsorption 2aAmmoniaxchemistry 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethodsxtrends. 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aHydrolysis 2aLigninxchemistry 2aOxygenxchemistry 2aPorosity1 aTomás-Pejó, E.1 aBallesteros, M.1 aNegro, M.J.0 tBioresource technology.g2010 July, v. 101, no. 13 p.4851-4861dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.093 7aarticle01395naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002400154245004500178300001400223500002400237520055500261650001500816650002500831650001100856650001500867650001200882700002300894773012200917852000901039856005701048655001201105IND4460575920221122023830.0110729e196901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446057592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1969.tb01958.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPANT, DIVYA DARSHAN10aOntogeny of stomata in some Gentianaceae  ap. 71-76.  aIncludes references  aThe mature epidermis and development of stomata in some species of Gentianaceae, viz.Canscora deccusata, C.diffusa, Hoppea dichotoma, Enicostema littorale, Nymphoides cristatum and Gentiana pedicellata, are described.

The functions of phenolic compounds in plant physiology and interactions with biotic and abiotic environments are difficult to overestimate. Phenolics play important roles in plant development, particularly in lignin and pigment biosynthesis. They also provide structural integrity and scaffolding support to plants. Importantly, phenolic phytoalexins, secreted by wounded or otherwise perturbed plants, repel or kill many microorganisms, and some pathogens can counteract or nullify these defences or even subvert them to their own advantage. In this review, we discuss the roles of phenolics in the interactions of plants with Agrobacterium and Rhizobium. 3aAgrobacterium 3aRhizobium 3abenzene 3abiosynthesis 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytoalexins 3apigments 3aplant development 3aplant protection 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPlantsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aRhizobiumxphysiology 2aSignal Transductionximmunology 2aStress, Physiological1 aSOOD, PRIYANKA1 aCitovsky, Vitaly.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2010 Sept., v. 11, no. 5 p.705-719dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00625.x 7aarticle03637naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002000182245017400202300001600376500002400392506007600416520131600492506003701808650002501845650002101870650001501891650001301906650001401919650001001933650001001943650001001953650001501963650002601978650001202004650001402016650002202030650001902052650004302071650006002114650002502174650003002199650007002229650002602299650003802325650003102363650006502394650001302459650001402472650002902486650004002515650002802555650002402583700002202607700001902629700002302648700002602671700001902697773011202716852000902828856008102837856003302918655001202951IND4391698920221207053139.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439169892DNAL7 a173841652pmid7 aPMC19138062pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.107.0955962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, Simone10aResistance to Botrytis cinerea Induced in Arabidopsis by Elicitors Is Independent of Salicylic Acid, Ethylene, or Jasmonate Signaling But Requires PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3  ap. 367-379.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOligogalacturonides (OGs) released from plant cell walls by pathogen polygalacturonases induce a variety of host defense responses. Here we show that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), OGs increase resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea independently of jasmonate (JA)-, salicylic acid (SA)-, and ethylene (ET)-mediated signaling. Microarray analysis showed that about 50% of the genes regulated by OGs, including genes encoding enzymes involved in secondary metabolism, show a similar change of expression during B. cinerea infection. In particular, expression of PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT3 (PAD3) is strongly up-regulated by both OGs and infection independently of SA, JA, and ET. OG treatments do not enhance resistance to B. cinerea in the pad3 mutant or in underinducer after pathogen and stress1, a mutant with severely impaired PAD3 expression in response to OGs. Similarly to OGs, the bacterial flagellin peptide elicitor flg22 also enhanced resistance to B. cinerea in a PAD3-dependent manner, independently of SA, JA, and ET. This work suggests, therefore, that elicitors released from the cell wall during pathogen infection contribute to basal resistance against fungal pathogens through a signaling pathway also activated by pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBotrytis cinerea 3acell walls 3aethylene 3aflagellin 3afungi 3agenes 3ahosts 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3apathogens 3apolygalacturonase 3asalicylic acid 2aArabidopsisxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBotrytisxphysiology 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMutation 2aOxylipins 2aPlant Diseasesxgenetics 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aSalicylatesxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction1 aGalletti, Roberta1 aDenoux, Carine1 aDe Lorenzo, Giulia1 aAusubel, Frederick M.1 aDewdney, Julia0 tPlant physiology.g2007 May, v. 144, no. 1 p.367-379dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.0955963Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle02541naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011100124300001500235500016300250520139700413650002101810650001001831650001301841650001001854650001801864650001201882650001301894650001501907650002401922650001101946651001701957700001401974773014301988856005102131852000902182655001202191IND4533792320221122023755.0150708e20150205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453379232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLotze, E.10aDeveloping a prediction model for seasonal harvest volumes for the peach preserve industry in South Africa  ap. 99-104.  aPaper presented at the IX International Symposium on Modelling in Fruit Research and Orchard Management held Jun 19-23, 2011 Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (Canada)  aThe local fruit industry depends heavily on exportation of products. Profit margins are small, even in good seasons. This is largely due to the costs of contract factory labor and supplies, like tins and sugar, which need to be in stock at the beginning of the season. If the crops are down from the estimated, and orders placed based on these data, supplies would need to be carried until the next season, and labor would still need to be paid, regardless of the crop volume, which impacts on the profit margin. Thus, the contribution of an accurate crop estimate, early in the season, for planning in the factory is evident. At present, technical advisors provide the crops estimates. As the accuracy depends heavily on the experience of these advisors, a need arose to supplement their expertise with a prediction model, to ensure that this prediction will still be available and accurate in future, should the expertise become unavailable. A model was developed using historical crop volumes and various climatic parameters, in a multi linear regression. Then, it was validated against the following seasonâs crop, as well as the crop estimates of the technical advisors. The accuracy of the prediction model was comparative to the technical estimate, and more accurate under specific climatic conditions that occurred irregularly. The model was applied commercially, during 2010/11. 3aclimatic factors 3acrops 3aindustry 3alabor 3alinear models 3apeaches 3aplanning 3aprediction 3aprofits and margins 3asugars 3aSouth Africa1 aBergh, O.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Feb. 5, , no. 1068 p.99-104dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1068/1068_11.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011900166300001600285500002400301520194000325650001902265650001702284650001402301650001102315650002102326650002002347650001202367650001102379650001002390650001202400650002302412700001602435700001602451773011002467852000902577856005502586655001202641IND4461191420221122005959.0110805e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446119142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2011.00343.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, M.K.10aEvaluation of key flavor compounds in reduced- and full-fat cheddar cheeses using sensory studies on model systems  ap. 278-290.  aIncludes references  aRecent flavor chemistry studies have identified flavor compounds at different concentrations in full- and low-fat Cheddar cheeses. The specific flavor contributions of these compounds in full- and low-fat cheese matrices have not been established. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensory response of Cheddar flavor compounds in model full-fat and 75% reduced-fat cheeses. Odor activity values (OAVs) for each compound in full- and reduced-fat cheeses were calculated. Each compound was then added to model cheeses created from 3-week-old full- and reduced-fat Cheddar cheeses. A trained sensory panel (n = 8) evaluated the sensory properties of the cheese models. The final combination of compounds was incorporated into reduced-fat cheese models, and consumers (n = 85) evaluated perceived-aged Cheddar cheese aroma. Based on OAVs and perception of the individual compounds in cheese models, 12 key flavor compounds were identified. Target ideal concentrations of specific cheese flavor compounds in 75% reduced-fat cheese were determined. According to consumers, the perceived aged Cheddar cheese aroma intensity of reduced-fat model cheese with these added compounds was not different (P > 0.05) from the perceived Cheddar cheese aroma intensity of commercial aged full-fat Cheddar cheeses. Practical Application: The market for reduced-fat Cheddar cheese is increasing as consumers become more health conscious. The structure and biochemistry of reduced-fat Cheddar cheeses are altered, and flavor and texture remain a challenge. This study established the role of 23 volatile compounds using descriptive analysis of cheese model systems. The impact of key compound concentration differences and how these differences affect sensory perception of cheese flavor in full- and 75% reduced-fat Cheddar cheeses were determined. These results provide guidance for mimicking aged Cheddar cheese flavor in reduced-fat cheese. 3aCheddar cheese 3abiochemistry 3achemistry 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3alow fat cheeses 3amarkets 3amodels 3aodors 3atexture 3avolatile compounds1 aDrake, S.L.1 aDrake, M.A.0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2011 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.278-290dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2011.00343.x 7aarticle03557naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245009400192300001600286500002400302520167300326650001901999650001702018650002602035650001802061650002102079650001802100650001102118650001902129650001802148650001302166650001602179650001902195650001202214650002802226650001302254650001502267650001802282650001102300650001002311650001502321650001202336650003702348650002402385650000902409650002002418650003002438650002402468650004402492650002302536700001802559700002702577700001402604700001702618700001502635700001702650700001502667700002002682773011702702852000902819856005502828655001202883IND4394766320221122005847.0070906e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439476632DNAL7 a178452232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00778.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgungpriyono, S.12aA Lectin Histochemical Study on the Testis of the Babirusa, Babyroussa babyrussa (Suidae)  ap. 343-348.  aIncludes references  aThe distribution of lectin bindings in the testis of babirusa, Babyrousa babyrussa (Suidae) was studied histochemically using 10 biotinylated lectins, Peanut agglutinin (PNA), Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA I), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA), Soybean agglutinin (SBA), Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA), Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA), Concanavalin A(Con A) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA I). Nine of 10 lectins showed a variety of staining patterns in the seminiferous epithelium and interstitial cells. The acrosome of Golgi-, cap- and acrosome-phase spermatids displayed various PNA, RCA I, VVA, SBA and WGA bindings, indicating the presence of glycoconjugates with d-galactose, N-acetyl- d-galactosamine and N-acetyl- d-glucosamine sugar residues respectively. No affinity was detected in the acrosome of late spermatids. LCA, PSA and Con A which have affinity for d-mannose and d-glucose sugar residues were positive in the cytoplasm of spermatids and spermatocytes. DBA was positive only in spermatogonia. In addition to DBA, positive binding in spermatogonia was found for VVA, WGA and Con A, suggesting the distribution of glycoconjugates with N-acetyl- d-galactosamine, N-acetyl- d-glucosamine, d-mannose and d-glucose sugar residues. Sertoli cells were stained intensely with RCA I, WGA and Con A. In Leydig cells, RCA I and Con A were strongly positive, while WGA, LCA and PSA reactions were weak to moderate. The present findings showed that the distribution pattern of lectin binding in the testis of babirusa is somewhat different from that of pig or other mammals reported previously. 3aLens culinaris 3aLeydig cells 3aMacrotyloma uniflorum 3aPisum sativum 3aRicinus communis 3aSertoli cells 3aSuidae 3aUlex europaeus 3aVicia villosa 3aacrosome 3aagglutinins 3aconcanavalin A 3apeanuts 3aseminiferous epithelium 3asoybeans 3aspermatids 3aspermatogonia 3asugars 3aswine 3awheat germ 2aAnimals 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aLectinsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aProtein Binding 2aSertoli Cellsxmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwinexanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aTestisxmetabolism1 aKurohmaru, M.1 aPrasetyaningtyas, W.E.1 aKaspe, L.1 aLeus, K.Y.G.1 aSasaki, M.1 aKitamura, N.1 aYamada, J.1 aMacdonald, A.A.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2007 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.343-348dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0340-20967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00778.x 7aarticle02502naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001600146245009400162300001800256500002400274500001500298520092500313650001601238650001401254650002201268650002301290650002901313650001401342650001401356650002501370650001401395650002101409650002101430653002801451653002201479653002601501653001701527700001701544700001801561700001901579700002601598700001501624700001401639773016201653852000901815856007701824930003301901945002501934946001301959655001201972IND4389533320221121231918.0070320e20070321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438953332DNAL7 a10.1021/jf063302e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aBelinha, I.10aQuercetin Increases Oxidative Stress Resistance and Longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 2446-2451.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aQuercetin, the major flavonol found in several fruits and vegetables, is a natural antioxidant with potential anticancer and antiaging activities. In this paper, the effect of quercetin in Sacharomyces cerevisiae cells submitted to oxidative stress was studied. Hydrogen peroxide resistance increased in cells pretreated with quercetin. Cellular protection was correlated with a decrease in oxidative stress markers, namely, levels of reactive oxygen species, glutathione oxidation, protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation. The acquisition of H2O2 resistance was not associated with the induction of antioxidant defenses or with iron chelation. Oxidative stress is a limiting factor for longevity. In agreement, quercetin also increased 60% chronological life span. These results support the utilization of yeast as a useful model to screen in vivo for natural antioxidants with putative health beneficial effects. 3aglutathione 3alongevity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abioassays 3aoxidation 3aantioxidant activity 3aquercetin 3aoxidative stress 3astress tolerance 0areactive oxygen species 0abiological models 0aprotein carbonylation 0aantioxidants1 aAmorim, M.A.1 aRodrigues, P.1 aFreitas, V. de1 aFerreira, P.

LISFLOOD is driven by meteorological input data and simulates river discharge in large drainage basins as a function of spatial information on topography, soils and land cover. Even though LISFLOOD is physically based to a certain extent, some processes are only represented in a lumped conceptual way. As a result, some parameters lack physical basis and cannot be directly inferred from quantities that can be measured. In the current LISFLOOD version five parameters need to be determined by calibration. We employ the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (SCEM-UA) global optimisation algorithm to automatically calibrate the model against daily discharge observations. The resulting posterior parameter distribution reflects the uncertainty about the model parameters after taking into account the discharge observations, and forms the basis for making probabilistic flow predictions. To overcome the computational burden the optimisation has been implemented using parallel computing. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate the methodology for the Meuse catchment upstream of Borgharen, covering approximately 21,000 km2. Results demonstrate the capabilities of the SCEM-UA algorithm to efficiently evolve to the target posterior distribution and to identify, except for the lower groundwater zone time constant, the LISFLOOD calibration parameters using daily discharge observations. It should be noted that the posterior parameter distributions are based on the assumption of independent errors. Analysis of the residuals revealed there is a strong evidence to reject this assumption. This will impact on the parameter posterior distributions and also lead to underestimation of the prediction limits. 3asimulation models 3aMonte Carlo method 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3awatershed hydrology 3aalgorithms 3aNetherlands 3aFrance 3aBelgium 0amathematical models 0aLISFLOOD model 0aShuffled Complex Metropolis model 0adistributed models1 aVrugt, J.A.1 aNuallain, B.O.1 aKnijff, J. van der1 aDe Roo, A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Jan. 15, v. 332, no. 3-4 p.276-289dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.07.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080827b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02533naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001700157245010800174300001600282500002400298500001500322520107000337650002301407650001701430650002201447650002301469650001601492650001401508650001301522650001701535650003001552650002601582650001901608650002101627651001201648653002001660653003201680653002301712700002301735700001701758700001701775773008501792852000901877856007201886930003301958945002501991946001102016655001202027IND4389558320221121231900.0070321e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438955832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2006.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aCutler, G.C.10aField efficacy of novaluron for control of Colorado potato beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) on potato  ap. 760-767.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aField trials were conducted in 2003 and 2004 to assess the effectiveness of novaluron (Rimon 10EC), a benzoylphenyl urea chitin synthesis inhibitor, for Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), management on potato. Foliar applications of novaluron did not significantly reduce numbers of L. decemlineata adults, egg masses, or first instar larvae, but second-fourth instars were greatly suppressed. Although an application rate of 12.5 g AI ha-1 provided unsatisfactory protection, rates of 25 and 50 g AI ha-1 proved effective when applied 2 days after second instars were first observed on plants. These rates were much less effective when applied 2 days after observance of egg masses. At 50 g AI ha-1, novaluron provided excellent, prolonged protection, whether applied twice a season, or once in alternation with imidacloprid. Defoliation was minimized, resulting in yields 3.8-5.2 times greater than those harvested from control plots. The results suggest that novaluron could be a valuable tool in future L. decemlineata management programs. 3aapplication timing 3ainsect pests 3aSolanum tuberosum 3afoliar application 3aplant pests 3anovaluron 3apotatoes 3aimidacloprid 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3afield experimentation 3ainsect control 3aapplication rate 3aOntario 0apest management 0achitin synthesis inhibitors 0abenzoylphenylureas1 aScott-Dupree, C.D.1 aTolman, J.H.1 aHarris, C.R.0 tCrop protection.g2007 May, v. 26, no. 5 p.760-767dButterworthx0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2006.07.0023electronic resource  a20070409b20070502c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/04/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02660naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001500181245011300196300001600309500002400325520135000349650001601699650001101715650003601726650001301762650001101775650001101786650001901797650002501816650001401841650000901855650001901864650002501883650001601908700001801924773010101942852000902043856006902052930003302121945002502154946001102179655001202190IND4389558520221121231959.0070321e20070212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438955852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2006.07.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL8401 aKumari, K.10aLipid lowering effect of S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide from Allium cepa Linn in high cholesterol diet fed rats  ap. 367-371.  aIncludes references  aThe lipid lowering action of S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide (SMCS) isolated from Allium cepa Linn (family: Liliaceae) was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats fed on 1% cholesterol diet, in comparison to the hypolipidemic drug gugulipid. Administration of SMCS at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight for 45 days ameliorated the hyperlipidemic condition. The lipid profile in serum and tissues showed that concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids were significantly reduced when compared to their untreated counterparts. The total lipoprotein lipase activity in the adipose tissue was decreased with also a decrease in the free fatty acid levels in serum and tissues. The activities of the lipogenic enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme as also of HMG CoA reductase in the tissues remained low on treatment indicating that both the drugs did not favor lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in the hyperlipidemic animals. The fecal excretion of bile acids and sterols was further increased upon treatment with the drugs. The results are directive to that both gugulipid and SMCS cause reduction of endogenous lipogenesis, increase catabolism of lipids and subsequent excretion of metabolic by-products through the intestinal tract. However, gugulipid is a better drug than SMCS at a low dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. 3aAllium cepa 3aonions 3achemical constituents of plants 3acysteine 3asulfur 3aoxides 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal properties 3abioassays 3arats 3alipemic effect 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alipogenesis1 aAugusti, K.T.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2007 Feb. 12, v. 109, no. 3 p.367-371dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2006.07.0453electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01088naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002800097040001800125100001400143245014100157300001600298520015100314650001200465653002100477700001400498700001700512700001600529700001700545773007300562852000900635856007800644939003300722945000800755946001100763655001200774991599026490742620221121221847.0840209e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840008842DNAL7 a10.1266/jjg.58.1932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanda, T.10aPhylogenetic interpretation and chromosomal polymorphism among nine strains of human malaria vectors of the Anopheles leucosphyrus group  ap. 193-208.  aphylogenetic interpretation, chromosomal polymorphism, and systematics among nine strains of human malaria vectors of Anopheles leucosphyrus group 3amalaria 0aVectors, Insecta1 aTakai, K.1 aChiang, G.L.1 aLoong, K.P.1 aSucharit, S.0 tIdengaku zasshi.g1983 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.193-208x0021-504X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1266/jjg.58.1933Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19840209c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03275naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001200167245012800179300001600307500002400323500001500347520176600362650001102128650002102139650001302160650003502173650001602208650001502224650002402239650001902263650001802282650002202300651001702322651001002339653001602349653002002365700001302385700001302398700001202411700001202423700001302435700001202448700001202460773009402472852000902566856008902575930003302664945002502697946001102722655001202733IND4389545720221121222000.0070321e20061215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438954572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aJia, Y.10aDevelopment of the WEP-L distributed hydrological model and dynamic assessment of water resources in the Yellow River basin  ap. 606-629.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDynamic assessment of water resources becomes desirable to reflect water resources variations in the basins under strong human impacts. A physically based distributed hydrological model, WEP-L, which couples simulations of natural hydrological processes and water use processes, is developed for the purpose. Concepts of special water resources (i.e., surface water resources and groundwater resources) and general water resources (i.e., the special water resources plus the precipitation directly utilized by ecosystem) are proposed, and an approach for dynamic assessment of water resources is suggested. Basin subdivision, classification of land covers, and deduction of water use spatial/temporal distributions in the Yellow River basin are carried out with the aid of remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The basin is subdivided into 8485 sub-watersheds and 38,720 contour bands, and the WEP-L model is verified by comparing simulated and observed discharges at main gage stations. Lastly, continuous simulations of 45 years (1956-2000) in variable time steps (from 1 h to 1 day) are performed for various land cover and water use conditions, and water resources assessment results under present condition of land cover and water use are compared with those under historical condition of land cover and water use. The study results reveal that: (1) the surface water resources reduced, but the groundwater resources non-overlapped with the surface water resources increased under the impact of human activities in the Yellow River basin; and (2) the special water resources reduced, but the general water resources increased accompanied with increase of the precipitation directly utilized by ecosystem in the basin. 3arivers 3awater management 3aland use 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3awatersheds 3awatershed hydrology 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3ahydrologic models 3aYellow River 3aChina 0aWEP-L model 0awater resources1 aWang, H.1 aZhou, Z.1 aQiu, Y.1 aLuo, X.1 aWang, J.1 aYan, D.1 aQin, D.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Dec. 15, v. 331, no. 3-4 p.606-629dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.06.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03080naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001500167245009300182300001600275500002400291520173600315650001102051650001102062650002402073650002002097651002202117651001102139651001802150651001602168653001602184653002002200653002102220653002302241653002502264700001602289700002002305700002402325773009402349852000902443856008902452930003302541945002502574946001102599655001202610IND4389545220221121221907.0070321e20061215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438954522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aM5001 aPinter, N.10aTrends in flood stages: Contrasting results from the Mississippi and Rhine River systems  ap. 554-566.  aIncludes references  aAn obstacle to testing human impacts on flooding is that anthropogenic and natural hydrologic changes occur simultaneously and are often indistinguishable. We attempted to isolate the impacts of overlapping mechanisms on flooding by analyzing 73-188 years of stage measurements from the Mississippi River system and the German Rhine. Although typically under-utilized in hydrologic analysis, stage data document the cumulative impacts of both upstream changes such and climate and land use as well as modifications of the river channel and floodplain. Analysis of trends in peak stages and flood frequencies shows contrasting results on the Mississippi and Rhine: increasing trends at most Mississippi stations, but no significant trends at most Rhine stations. On the Mississippi and its tributaries, statistically significant changes in peak stages and peak-stage frequencies were identified at 10 of 14 stations, with all but one exhibiting increased flooding. On the Rhine River, systematic change occurred at only 1 of 8 stations analyzed. On both river systems, channel and floodplain modifications dominated net hydrologic response, overwhelming the effects of climate change, land-use shifts, and dam construction. Specific-gage analysis, which isolates the impacts of instream river modifications, documented declining flow conveyance at all stations where flood levels and frequencies increased. Increased flooding at the Mississippi River sites appears to be driven by the history of aggressive channel engineering, in particular channel constriction to increase navigation depths. In contrast, navigation infrastructure on the Rhine has not substantially degraded the river's capacity to efficiently convey flood flows. 3arivers 3afloods 3awatershed hydrology 3astream channels 3aMississippi River 3aEurope 3aUnited States 3aRhine River 0aflood stage 0aflood frequency 0apeak flood stage 0ariver modification 0ariver channelization1 aIckes, B.S.1 aWlosinski, J.H.1 aPloeg, R.R. van der0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Dec. 15, v. 331, no. 3-4 p.554-566dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.06.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03292naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002100158245010000179300001600279500002400295500001500319520182700334650002002161650002202181650002802203650001302231650001502244650001602259650001502275650001002290650001202300650003002312650001302342650001402355650001302369650001702382650002802399651001202427653002102439653002002460653001502480700001802495773009402513852000902607856008902616930003302705945002502738946001102763655001202774IND4389542120221121190557.0070321e20061215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438954212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.05.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aSchoonover, J.E.10aLand cover impacts on stream nutrients and fecal coliform in the lower Piedmont of West Georgia  ap. 371-382.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAs urbanization infiltrates into rural areas, stream water quality is expected to decline as a result from increased impervious surface and greater sources for pollutants. Consequently, West Georgia's water quality is threatened by extensive development as well as other land uses such as livestock grazing and silvicultural activity. Maintenance of stream water quality, as land development occurs, is critical for the protection of drinking water and biotic integrity. A 2-phase, watershed-scale study was established to develop relationships among land cover and water quality within western Georgia. During phase 1, nutrient and fecal coliform data were collected within 18 mixed land use watersheds, ranging in size from 500 to 2500 ha. Regression models were developed that related land cover to stream water nutrient and fecal coliform concentrations. Nutrient and fecal coliform concentrations within watersheds having >24% impervious surface (IS) were often higher than those in nonurban watersheds (i.e., <5% IS) during both base flow (N: 1.64 mg/L versus 0.61 mg/L, and FC: 430 versus 120 MPN/100 ml) and storm flow (N: 1.93 mg/L versus 0.36 mg/L, and FC: 1600 versus 167 MPN/100 ml). Fecal coliform bacteria in urbanized areas consistently exceeded the US EPA's review criterion for recreational waters during both base flow and to a greater extent storm flow. During phase 2, regression models were tested based on data from six newly chosen watersheds with similar land use/cover patterns. Lastly, theoretical watersheds, based on land use percentages, were created to illustrate trends in water quality impairment as land development occurs. The models developed from this research could be used to forecast water quality changes under various land use scenarios in the developing Piedmont region of the US. 3awater pollution 3acoliform bacteria 3abacterial contamination 3anitrogen 3astormwater 3aurban areas 3aphosphorus 3afeces 3astreams 3anonpoint source pollution 3apiedmont 3anutrients 3aland use 3aurbanization 3aagricultural watersheds 3aGeorgia 0aurban watersheds 0afecal coliforms 0awatersheds1 aLockaby, B.G.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Dec. 15, v. 331, no. 3-4 p.371-382dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.05.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02220naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001400149245019100163300001400354520105600368650001001424650001801434650000901452650001701461650002601478650001401504650001401518650001001532650002501542650001301567700001401580773012201594852000901716856008901725939003301814946001101847655001201858IND4480593020221121123139.0140502e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448059302DNAL7 a10.1016/S0301-6226(02)00193-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, P.A.14aThe effect of commercially formulated, reduced crude protein diets, formulated to 11 apparent ileal digestible essential amino acids, on nitrogen retention by growing and finishing boars  ap. 89-98.  aTwo experiments were carried out to determine the nitrogen retention (NR) and gross efficiency of NR (NR/NI) of boars offered diets with reduced crude protein (CP) levels designed to decrease nitrogen excretion. Six diets were compared which differed in CP content, from 177 to 253 g/kg and from 151 to 229 g/kg for growing and finishing boars, respectively. All diets were isocaloric and formulated to minimum amounts of all 11 essential amino acids on a determined apparent ileal digestible basis (IEAA), calculated from the lysine:IEAA ratio required for Ideal Protein (IP). Formulating the diets to all 11 IEAA was not sufficiently accurate to maintain dietary IP content at the lowest CP levels (177 and 151 g/kg). These two diets significantly increased NR/NI for the boars (P<0.01) but this was not sufficient to maintain NR which was reduced in both the growing (13%; P<0.05) and the finishing (26%; P<0.001) boars. The two lowest CP diets also had a lower dietary electrolyte balance (dEB) which could have contributed to the reduction of NR. 3aboars 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aelectrolytes 3aessential amino acids 3aexcretion 3afinishing 3aileum 3alivestock production 3anitrogen1 aKay, R.M.0 tLivestock production science.g2003 May, v. 81, no. 1 p.89-98aLivestock production science (Online)x0301-62267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0301-6226(02)00193-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140502  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001400190245014800204300001600352500002400368520117400392650001301566650002101579650003601600650001901636650002501655650001401680650000901694650002801703650001401731650002001745650002201765650003401787650002101821651001001842651001101852653002601863700001401889700001601903700001401919700001401933700001601947773010101963852000902064856006902073930003302142945002502175946001102200655001202211IND4389562720221121123153.0070321e20070212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438956272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2006.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL840 0aF0001 aLin, Y.L.10aLigusticum chuanxiong prevents rat pheochromocytoma cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis through a protein kinase A-dependent pathway  ap. 428-434.  aIncludes references  aLigusticum chuanxiong (LC) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine used to treat various cardiovascular diseases. In this study, the butanol extract of LC was found to protect neuronal-like pheochromocytoma cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Both a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor and a specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor blocked the protective effect of LC. A transcription inhibitor (actinomycin D) and a protein synthesis inhibitor (cyclohexamide) also attenuated the protective effect of LC, suggesting the requirement of gene expression for the protection of LC. On the other hand, LC increased both the formation of cyclic-AMP and the phosphorylation of the cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a downstream target of PKA and a nuclear transcription factor known for neuroprotective mechanism. Furthermore, LC-induced CREB phosphorylation and protective effect could be blocked by a PKA inhibitor and overexpression of the dominant negative CREB, respectively. Taken together, the protective mechanism of LC in antagonizing serum deprivation-induced PC12 cell apoptosis might be mediated through a PKA/CREB-dependent pathway. 3aApiaceae 3amedicinal plants 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal properties 3abioassays 3arats 3acardiovascular diseases 3aapoptosis 3aprotein kinases 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aherbal medicines 3aChina 3aTaiwan 0aLigusticum chuanxiong1 aLee, Y.C.1 aHuang, C.L.1 aLai, W.L.1 aLin, Y.R.1 aHuang, N.K.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2007 Feb. 12, v. 109, no. 3 p.428-434dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2006.08.0123electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/04/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02422naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001400167245008800181300001600269500002400285520124900309650002401558650001501582650001101597650001501608650002201623650001401645650001101659653002801670653002201698700001201720700001901732773009401751852000901845856008901854930003301943945002501976946001102001655001202012IND4389560520221121123106.0070321e20070115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438956052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aLiang, D.12aA boundary-fitted numerical model for flood routing with shock-capturing capability  ap. 477-486.  aIncludes references  aThe shallow water equations (SWEs) are solved numerically in general curvilinear coordinates for predicting flood flows. Second-order accuracy is achieved both in time and space through the use of the MacCormack scheme, in conjunction with a total variation diminishing (TVD) modification. The method is highly efficient as no local characteristic transformation is needed. The possible numerical imbalance induced by the inconsistent evaluation of the flux gradient and source terms is removed by employing the non-conservative form of the SWEs. All of the flow regimes and their transitions can be modelled. Specific considerations have been given to simulating flows in practical environments. The friction-slope term is discretized semi-implicitly when the water depth is smaller than a prescribed value. The check for flooding/drying (wet/dry status of the cell) is performed at each time step. Validation tests include steady flows along a deflected wall and a converging channel, unsteady wave diffraction around a circular cylinder, and the Malpasset dam-break flood in 1959. The results indicate that the present model is able to predict accurately the shock fronts, even over initially dry beds with friction and abrupt slope changes. 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3afloods 3awater flow 3ahydrologic models 3aequations 3arivers 0ashallow water equations 0aMacCormack scheme1 aLin, B.1 aFalconer, R.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Jan. 15, v. 332, no. 3-4 p.477-486dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.08.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080828b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02809naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002100167245009600188300001600284500002400300520151300324650002401837650001501861650001601876650002001892650002201912650001501934650001701949650002501966650003501991650002902026651001602055653002102071700002202092773009402114852000902208856008902217930003302306945002502339946001102364655001202375IND4389560020221121123105.0070321e20070115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438956002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aBierkens, M.F.P.10aModelling non-linear water table dynamics and specific discharge through landscape analysis  ap. 412-426.  aIncludes references  aA method is presented to derive high resolution maps of water table dynamics and specific discharge through landscape analysis. The approach consists of deriving the parameters of a regionalized non-linear time series model on a detailed grid from information on topography, land use and geology. The resulting model is particularly suited for systems with deep permeable soils, shallow water tables and intensive drainage. The first step in parameterizing the model consists of deriving a topologically correct drainage network from a high resolution DEM in combination with a topographic layer with mapped water courses. The drainage network provides for pixels containing water courses the dimensions of the water course, bottom altitude and, for perennial water courses, their average stage. Next, from the drainage network and a geological map, drainage functions are derived for each pixel relating the local drainage base and the drainage resistance to the height of the water table. The result is a regionalized non-linear time series model of water table dynamics that can be used to generate time series of water table elevation for each pixel, as well a specific discharge, using time series of precipitation surplus (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) as input. The method is tested in a 10 x 10 km area in the North-East of the Netherlands. Predicted water table depth and discharge are compared with observations and with the results from a physically-deterministic groundwater flow model. 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3awater table 3asprings (water) 3ahydrologic models 3alandscapes 3ahydrogeology 3atime series analysis 3ageographic information systems 3adigital elevation models 3aNetherlands 0aspring discharge1 aStroet, C.B.M. te0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Jan. 15, v. 332, no. 3-4 p.412-426dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.07.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080828b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02876naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245014200185300001600327500002400343520158500367650001301952650002401965650001501989650001702004650002102021650002202042650001902064650002102083650001602104651001202120653004202132700001902174773009402193852000902287856008902296930003302385945002502418946001102443655001202454IND4389560420221121123146.0070321e20070115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438956042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aBoswell, J.S.10aModeling the hydrologic response of groundwater dominated wetlands to transient boundary conditions: Implications for wetland restoration  ap. 467-476.  aIncludes references  aA variably-saturated groundwater model, based on that of Freeze [Freeze, R.A., 1971. Three-dimensional, transient, saturated-unsaturated flow in a groundwater basin. Water Resources Research 7, 347-366.], was used to analyze the details of surface-groundwater interaction and resulting hydroperiods of a site undergoing wetland restoration (the Lake Station Wetland Restoration Site in Northwest Indiana, USA). The three-dimensional groundwater flow model couples the saturated and unsaturated zones through the use of van Genuchten's [van Genuchten, M.T., 1980. A closed-form equation for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils. Soil Science Society of America Journal 44, 892-898.] characteristic equations. Initial estimates of hydraulic parameters were refined through a calibration exercise aimed at minimizing the discrepancy between simulated and measured water levels in seven wells within the study. Numerical simulations using the calibrated model, and driven by annual time series of rainfall and potential evaporation, were used to generate hydroperiod maps of surface saturation and root-zone saturation over a three-year period of study. This allowed identification of regularly saturated areas that would support hydric plants, as well as more rarely saturated areas that would require more dry tolerant species or additional hydrological remediation. The simulations also revealed the critical roles that topography, rainfall history, and antecedent conditions play in the hydrology of degraded wetlands that have been targeted for restoration. 3awetlands 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3ahydrogeology 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrologic models 3asaturated flow 3aunsaturated flow 3awater table 3aIndiana 0asurface water-groundwater interaction1 aOlyphant, G.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Jan. 15, v. 332, no. 3-4 p.467-476dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.08.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080828b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02772naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011900144300001600263520122300279650002401502650001301526650001401539650001401553650002801567650002001595650001701615650001101632650001201643650002701655650002501682650001401707650001101721650001101732650001101743650001201754650003701766650002601803650002601829650002101855650005301876650001501929650003701944650001201981650002201993700002102015700001502036773009902051852000902150930003302159945001302192946001302205655001202218IND2181422720221121123125.0981130e199804  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218142272DNAL7 a97734852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeutsch, A.10aActivity of cellulolytic enzymes in the contents of reticulorumen and caecocolon of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)  ap. 925-930.  aSelective ruminants, which prefer easily digestible plants, cannot digest fibrous forage as well as grass eaters. Low enzyme activity or short retention time of ingesta particles in fermentation chambers appeared to be responsible for reduced cellulose breakdown. Seasonal activity of cellulolytic enzymes, cellulose concentration and protozoa population in reticulorumen (RR) and caecocolon (CC) of roe deer as a typical concentrate selector were investigated. Cellulase activities were lowest in winter when cellulose concentration in RR contents were highest. Highest enzyme activities and lowest cellulose concentration were measured in early spring. Cellulolytic activities were significantly correlated with the number of protozoa in RR. Only one entodinomorphic genus was identified in the RR. The enzyme activities in CC were far lower compared with those in RR. Low cellulose digestion in the RR cannot be compensated for by cellulose breakdown in the CC. The reduced cellulose digestion of roe deer may be attributed to the short retention time of food particles in spring and summer, whereas decreased colonisation of microorganisms in the rumen may be the main reason for low cellulose breakdown in winter. 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aProtozoa 3acellulose 3adigestion 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3aforage 3agrasses 3amicrobial colonization 3arumen microorganisms 3aruminants 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 2aAnimals 2aCecumxenzymologyxparasitology. 2aCellulasexmetabolism 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aDeerxmetabolism 2aEukaryotaxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aHydrolysis 2aRumenxenzymologyxparasitology. 2aSeasons 2aSheepxmetabolism1 aLechner-Doll, M.1 aWolf, G.A.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1998 Apr., v. 119A, no. 4 p.925-930x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03618naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245016800143300001600311520146700327650000801794650001301802650001501815650002401830650002501854650001801879650001601897650001301913650002001926650001201946650001401958650001001972650001901982650001602001650001602017650002502033650004202058650004202100650004302142650004602185650001202231650001502243650001802258650003002276650003202306650003202338650002602370650000902396650003302405650002902438650001302467650001602480650003302496650003502529650002802564650002802592700001702620700001502637700001802652700001702670700001402687700001602701773009902717852000902816930003302825945001302858946001302871655001202884IND2164402520221121090555.0981001e199802  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216440252DNAL7 a112489942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtgie, C.10aLipolytic and antilipolytic responses of the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus sungorus) white adipocytes after weight loss induced by short photoperiod exposure  ap. 503-510.  aShort day photoperiod promotes thermogenesis and extensive weight loss in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus sungorus). To determine whether a change in hormone-sensitive lipolysis occurs after short-photoperiod exposure, some lipolytic responses were measured on white adipocytes isolated from animals exposed in warm conditions to short or long daylight photoperiod. The body mass of male Siberian hamsters exposed during 11 weeks to short days (SD; light: dark, 6:18 hr) reached only 50% of those kept in long days (LD; 16: 8 hr). In SD-hamsters, adipose depot mass also represented approximately 50% of the LD group. A lower DNA content was observed in intra-abdominal fat pads of SD-hamsters. Lipolytic responses to noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoproterenol and ACTH were unchanged. However, sensitivity to the beta-3 adrenergic agonist, BRL 37344, was moderately increased. The major component of the adrenergic control of lipolysis was mediated by beta-3 adrenoceptors in both LD- and SD-Siberian hamsters. The limited antilipoltic effect of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, PYY or insulin was rather surprising in Siberian hamsters since these inhibitory systems are efficient in hibernants and other photoperiod-sensitive rodents. Our results show that, after short photoperiod exposure, white adipose tissue mass and DNA content are reduced, especially in the epididymal fat pad, with only minor changes in the adipocyte sensitivity to lipolytic hormones. 3aDNA 3aPhodopus 3aadipocytes 3aadrenergic agonists 3aadrenergic receptors 3acorticotropin 3aepinephrine 3ahamsters 3aheat production 3ainsulin 3alipolysis 3amales 3anorepinephrine 3aphotoperiod 3aweight loss 3awhite adipose tissue 2aAdipocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAdipose Tissuexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aAdrenergic beta-Agonistsxpharmacology 2aAdrenocorticotropic Hormonexpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCricetinae 2aDNAxanalysis 2aEpinephrinexpharmacology 2aEthanolaminesxpharmacology 2aIsoproterenolxpharmacology 2aLipolysisxphysiology 2aMale 2aNorepinephrinexpharmacology 2aPeptide YYxpharmacology 2aPhodopus 2aPhotoperiod 2aPropanolaminesxpharmacology 2aSympathomimeticsxpharmacology 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 2aWeight Lossxphysiology1 aLe Gouic, S.1 aHanoun, N.1 aCasteilla, L.1 aPenicaud, L.1 aAmbid, L.1 aCarpene, C.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1998 Feb., v. 119A, no. 2 p.503-510x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01584naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002900110245007200139300001600211520065100227650002300878650001100901650000900912650001200921650001100933650001500944650001300959650001000972650002100982653001601003700002001019700001601039773009901055852000901154930003301163945001301196946001301209655001201222IND2164402920221121090609.0981001e199802  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216440292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi-Del-Bianco, M.10aRespiratory metabolism of Camponotus rufipes ants: brood and adults  ap. 529-532.  aThe respiratory metabolism of immature forms (eggs, larvae, prepupae and pupae) of Camponotus rufipes (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) was studied at 25 degrees C, using a Warburg respirometer.

Male lambs were randomly divided into two groups. One group docked 3-4 h after birth, using rubber rings and the tails of other left intact (control). After weaning, 20 lambs from each group were divided into two subgroups, one subgroup was fed with a normal-energy diet (2.45 Mcal/kg ME) and the other one with a high-energy diet (2.73 Mcal/kg ME) for 84 days. Lambs were fed individually. At the end of the fattening period, 28 lambs were slaughtered for determination of carcass characteristics. Warm carcass weight (WCW) and fat depth at 12th rib was recorded. At 24 h postmortem samples of meat, omental fat and caudal fat were taken from chilled (4 °C) carcasses for the assessment of fatty acid (FA) composition. No significant difference was observed for WCW and omental fat between carcasses of docking and control lambs or lambs on two types of energy diets (P > 0.05). Under these circumstances, docked lambs produced leaner carcass than intact lambs (P < 0.05). Carcass fragments and fat depth at 12th rib, showed significant difference between carcasses of docking and control lambs (P < 0.05). Energy of diets can effect on vertebral column plus longissmus dorsi muscle weight significantly (P < 0.05). Results showed that the predominant FA in body fat of lambs was oleic acid but no significant difference was observed for percentage of FA composition between treatments (P > 0.05). The correlation coefficients among the FA showed strong negative correlation (-0.929) between stearic and oleic acids (P < 0.001). 3afatty acid composition 3acarcass weight 3alambs 3aoleic acid 3ahigh energy diet 3aruminant nutrition 3alivestock production 3atail docking 3amales 3asheep feeding 3amuscle tissues 3afinishing 3asheep breeds 3astearic acid 3abackfat 3alipid content 3ameat quality 3alean meat 3aIran 0asheep 0aBadghisian (sheep breed) 0acarcass composition0 tSmall ruminant research.g2007 May, v. 69, no. 1-3 p.208-216dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2005.12.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20071114b20071210c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03598naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100002700171245007100198300001600269500002400285500001500309520196500324650002302289650002102312650002002333650001502353650001002368650001102378650002702389650002402416650002402440650004502464650002702509650002402536650001402560650002402574650001202598653002602610653003202636653001802668700002402686700002502710700002102735700001702756773010002773852000902873856009302882930003302975945002503008946001103033655001203044IND4389581920221121090528.0070322e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438958192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2005.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL2101 aMartinez-Alvarez, L.E.10aSerum LH peak and ovulation following synchronized estrus in goats  ap. 124-128.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was aimed at comparing the temporal relationship between estrus, the LH peak and ovulation following estrous synchronization in goats using medroxiprogesterone acetate (MGA) or fluorogestone acetate (FGA). Twenty-four cyclic goats were randomly assigned to two treatments: MGA group (n = 12) that individually received a daily oral dose of 0.22 mg MGA for 12 days, and a FGA group (n = 12) treated for 12 days with intravaginal sponges containing 45 mg FGA. The goats from both groups were treated with a prostaglandin analogue (75 μg Cloprostenol i.m.) during the last day of their progesterone treatment. Estrous detection was carried out every 4 h after the end of the treatment, and blood samples for the determination of the serum LH concentrations collected at 2 h intervals for 24 h from the onset of estrus. Ovulation was detected with the aid of transrectal ultrasonography, performed every 4 h starting 15 h after the onset of estrus. All goats showed estrus. In the MGA group the onset of estrus occurred later and was more variable in relation to the end of treatment (86.7 ± 3.9 h), compared to the FGA group (44.4 ± 1.5 h; P < 0.01). The interval between the LH peak and ovulation was significantly (P < 0.05) longer in the MGA group (26.2 ± 1.1 h) than the FGA group (22.4 ± 0.8 h). There were no differences regarding the intervals from the onset of estrus to the LH peak (14.9 ± 1.8 and 15.3 ± 0.9 h) and to ovulation (40.1 ± 2.3 and 37.6 ± 0.5 h) for the MGA and FGA groups, respectively. The amplitude of the LH peak was not different between groups. It could be concluded that the timing of the LH peak and ovulation is not related to the end of treatment, but with the time of onset of estrus. The longer and more variable interval for estrous demonstration following MGA treatment, represents a serious limitation for its use in synchronization programs in goats, where mating is to be performed on a fixed-time basis. 3atemporal variation 3aestrus detection 3ablood chemistry 3abiomarkers 3agoats 3aestrus 3aestrus synchronization 3aluteinizing hormone 3ahormonal regulation 3acontrolled internal drug release devices 3aphysiological response 3aoral administration 3aovulation 3amedroxyprogesterone 3afemales 0afluorogestone acetate 0amedroxiprogesterone acetate 0aestrous cycle1 aHernandez-Ceron, J.1 aGonzalez-Padilla, E.1 aPerera-Marin, G.1 aValencia, J.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2007 May, v. 69, no. 1-3 p.124-128dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2005.12.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20071114b20071210c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03158naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245010300149300001600252520167600268650001401944650001301958650001101971650002901982650001402011650001802025650001702043650001502060650001402075650001202089650001102101650001602112650002602128650001202154650003002166650001702196650002402213650001402237650002202251650001502273650003102288653002102319653002302340653001902363700002102382700001902403700001502422773009902437852000902536930003302545945001302578946001302591655001202604IND2334342220221121090521.0031007e200310  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233434222DNAL7 a145117482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhandoker, A.H.10aCardiac rhythms of late pre-pipped and pipped chick embryos exposed to altered oxygen environments  ap. 289-299.  aDuring the final stages of embryonic development in chickens, diffusive gas exchange through the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is progressively replaced by pulmonary respiration that begins with internal pipping (IP) of the CAM. Late chick embryos going through the transition from CAM respiration to pulmonary respiration were exposed to hyperoxic (100% O2) and hypoxic (10% O2/N2) environments for 2-h and the responses of baseline heart rate (HR), and HR fluctuation patterns were investigated. 16- and 18-day-old (referred to as 18-d) embryos and 20-d externally pipped (EP) embryos were examined as pre-pipped embryos and pipped embryos, respectively. 19-d embryos were divided into two groups: embryos that had not yet internally pipped (Pre-IP embryos) and embryos that had internally pipped (IP embryos). IP was identified by detecting the breathing signal with a condenser microphone attached hermetically on the eggshell (i.e. acoustorespirogram) on day 19 of incubation. In the hyperoxic environment, HR baseline of pre-pipped embryos remained unchanged and that of pipped embryos was depressed. In the hypoxic environment, HR baseline of 16-d pre-pipped embryos was depressed and that of pipped (IP and EP) embryos elevated. These different responses in pipped embryos might be partially attributed to increased cholinergic input from the vagus nerve in hyperoxia and increased adrenergic response in hypoxia. While hyperoxia did not induce marked modification of instantaneous heart rate (IHR) fluctuation patterns, hypoxia tended to augment transient decelerations of IHR in late pre-pipped embryos and markedly depressed HR fluctuations in pipped embryos. 3abreathing 3achickens 3achicks 3achorioallantoic membrane 3aegg shell 3aembryogenesis 3agas exchange 3aheart rate 3ahyperoxia 3ahypoxia 3aoxygen 3avagus nerve 2aAllantoisxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aHypoxiaxphysiopathology. 2aChick Embryo 2aChorionxmetabolism 2aDiffusion 2aGasesxmetabolism 2aHeart Rate 2aHyperoxiaxphysiopathology 0ainternal pipping 0apre-pipped embryos 0apipped embryos1 aDzialowski, E.M.1 aBurggren, W.W.1 aTazawa, H.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2003 Oct., v. 136A, no. 2 p.289-299x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01868naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007100126300001800197520096000215650002501175650002201200650001501222650001301237650001201250650000901262650001501271650001701286700001301303700001801316700001501334773010101349852000901450930003301459945001301492946001301505655001201518IND2123706620221121090635.0980627e199712  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212370662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, M.L.14aThe spontaneous hemin release from Lumbricus terrestris hemoglobin  ap. 1241-1245.  aThe slow, spontaneous release of hemin from earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris, hemoglobin has been studied under mild conditions in the presence of excess apomyoglobin. This important protein is surprisingly unstable. The reaction is best described as hemin released from the globin into water, followed by quick engulfment by apomyoglobin. The energetics of this reaction are compared with those of other types of hemoglobins. Anomalously low activation energy and enthalpy are counterbalanced by a negative entropy. These values reflect significant low frequency protein motion and dynamics of earthworm hemoglobin and may also indicate an open structure distal to the heme. This is also supported by the infrared spectrum of the carbonyl hemoprotein, which indicates several types of distal interactions with the bound CO. The reported low heme to polypeptide ratio for this protein may be due to facile heme and hemin release by the circulating protein. 3aLumbricus terrestris 3aactivation energy 3aearthworms 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aheme 3ahemoglobin 3apolypeptides1 aPaul, J.1 aOhlsson, P.I.1 aPaul, K.G.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1997 Dec., v. 118A, no. 4 p.1241-1245x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03402naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001300171245016100184300001400345500002400359500001500383520168300398650002202081650001402103650001302117650001202130650001002142650002802152650002102180650002402201650001202225650003002237650002502267650001002292650001802302650002802320650001702348650000902365651001002374653002402384653001102408653001302419653002802432653002302460653002502483700001802508700001702526773009802543852000902641856009302650930003302743945002502776946001102801655001202812IND4389580720221121090528.0070322e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438958072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2005.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL7001 aWada, K.14aThe complete nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial genome in the Japanese Sika deer (Cervus nippon), and a phylogenetic analysis between Cervidae and Bovidae  ap. 46-54.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome in the Japanese Sika deer (Cervus nippon); Yeso (C. n. yesoensis), Honshu (C. n. centralis) and Yakushima Sika deer (C. n. yakushimae), and its genome sizes were 16,543, 16,663 and 16,440 bp, respectively. The D-loop was observed to have a various number of tandem repeats in the Japanese Sika deer (4-10 repeats). In the present study, the Honshu Sika deer collected from Okutama-city in Tokyo had 10 repeats, which was a novel number in the Japanese Sika deer. The similarity of entire nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial DNA ranged from 94.1 to 96.7%, and amino-acid sequence similarity was 98.5-99.4%. The phylogenetic tree that was inferred from nucleotide sequence of 13 peptide coding genes and amino-acid sequence of 12 peptide coding genes were presented topology that is, ((Cervidae) (Bovidae [cattle], Bovidae [sheep]), Equidae) with high bootstrap values. On the other hand, the cytochrome b (Cytb) gene that was often used in some mammalian phylogenetic analyses showed topology that is, ((Cervidae, Bovidae [sheep]) (Bovidae [cattle]), Equidae). In Cervidae, phylogenetic analyses were mainly conducted using a Cytb gene. Therefore, in order to provide conclusive phylogenetic relationships are required more comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analyses among Cervidae. We suggest that the molecular phylogeny of Cervidae should be reviewed carefully using 13 or 12 mitochondrial peptide coding genes. Our complete mitochondrial DNA data of the Japanese Sika deer will be useful information in phylogenetics, and will be available as basic data for the breeding and genetics in Cervidae. 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3apeptides 3aBovidae 3agenes 3ainterspecific variation 3agenetic distance 3adivergent evolution 3aEquidae 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aamino acid sequences 3araces 3aCervus nippon 3atandem repeat sequences 3acytochrome b 3adeer 3aJapan 0aspecies differences 0agenome 0aCervidae 0amolecular sequence data 0amolecular genetics 0anucleotide sequences1 aNishibori, M.1 aYokohama, M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2007 May, v. 69, no. 1-3 p.46-54dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2005.12.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20071114b20071210c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02601naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010000145300001500245520121800260650003301478650001201511650003001523650001001553650001801563650001301581650002001594650002301614650001201637650001001649650001001659650002501669650001601694650001201710650002201722650005701744650007101801650002301872650002501895650001501920700001701935773009901952852000902051930003302060945001302093946001302106655001202119IND2333737220221121090544.0030724e200209  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233373722DNAL7 a121608752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamanya, M.10aHistological alterations of intestinal villi in chickens fed dried Bacillus subtilis var. natto  ap. 95-104.  aTwo experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, chickens were fed dried Bacillus subtilis var. natto for 3 or 28 days. Growth performance and internal organs were not different from controls, but feed efficiency tended to be improved in the 28-day feeding. In these birds, blood ammonia concentration was decreased (P<0.05). Blood glucose concentration, and amylase and lipase activity in the intestinal content were not significantly different among dietary groups. These results suggest that the B. subtilis natto depressed ammonia concentration. In experiment 2, chickens were fed dietary B. subtilis natto for 28 days. These birds had a tendency to display greater growth performance and intestinal histologies, such as villus height, cell area and cell mitosis, than the controls. Flat cell outline on the duodenal villus surface in controls developed large, protruded cell clusters and cell protuberances after feeding of dietary B. subtilis natto. These results indicate that intestinal function was activated by the depressed blood ammonia concentration in the body of the chicken. The present results may suggest that the B. subtilis natto has the potential to be a beneficial microorganism in chickens. 3aBacillus subtilis var. natto 3aammonia 3abeneficial microorganisms 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3achickens 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3amitosis 3anatto 3avilli 2aAmylasesxmetabolism 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBacillus subtilis 2aChickensxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aIntestine, Smallxanatomy & histologyxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aProbiotics1 aYamauchi, K.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2002 Sept., v. 133A, no. 1 p.95-104x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03117naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001600177245007300193300001600266500023600282500002400518500001500542520118700557650001801744650002301762650001501785650001601800650001501816650001401831650002301845650001801868650001401886650001901900650001801919650002301937650002101960650000701981650000901988650001201997650001102009653001202020653000902032653003402041653001702075653002002092700001502112700001502127700001402142700001602156700001502172700001602187773009602203852000902299856009002308930003302398945002502431946001102456655001202467IND4389578420221121090638.0070322s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438957842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.05.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ206 0aQ506 0aQ3061 aPacquit, A.10aDevelopment of a smart packaging for the monitoring of fish spoilage  ap. 466-470.  aIn the special issue: "Innovations in traditional foods" / edited by P.

Emphasis is on the ones that would reflect and account for the products history and their storage conditions from “harvest-to-home”. The development of a “smart packaging” that monitors the microbial breakdown products in the headspace of packaged fish is described. When fish spoils it releases a variety of basic volatile amines which are detectable with appropriate pH indicating sensors. These are prepared by entrapping within a polymer matrix a pH sensitive dye that responds, through visible color changes to the spoilage volatile compounds that contribute to a quantity known as total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N). Laboratory trials on fresh fish filets showed that the sensor accurately tracks the increase in amines concentration in the package headspace. The response was also found to correlate to changing microbial populations (total viable count or TVC and Pseudomonas spp.). In addition, leaching of the dye was assessed over time to assess the suitability of the sensor formulation for food packaging application. 3afood spoilage 3avolatile compounds 3acod (fish) 3acolorimetry 3amonitoring 3araw foods 3aheadspace analysis 3afish products 3afreshness 3afood packaging 3arapid methods 3aseasonal variation 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3adyes 3awhiting 3aamines 0asensors 0afish 0atotal volatile basic nitrogen 0afood quality 0asmart packaging1 aFrisby, J.1 aDiamond D.1 aLau, K.T.1 aFarrell, A.1 aQuilty, B.1 aDiamond, D.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 102, no. 2 p.466-470dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.05.0523Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/08/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02670naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002400180245014900204300001600353520126800369650000901637650002001646650001601666650005301682650004701735650001201782650002001794650002501814650004601839650004801885650000901933650002201942650002401964700001501988700001502003700001502018773009902033852000902132930003302141945002502174946001302199655001202212IND4367534920221121090613.0050309e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436753492DNAL7 a156643202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The diets were formulated to contain the same amount of nitrogen and metabolizable energy and were made from casein, wheat starch, corn germ oil supplemented with vitamins, minerals and L-arginine. The influence of the different diets on the activity of two lipogenic enzymes, ATP-citrate lyase and malic enzyme, on delta13C values in the whole fish, the liver and their correlation was investigated. There was a strong positive correlation between delta13C values in the lipids of whole fish and those of their livers. The activities of lipogenic enzymes increased significantly with increasing trophic shift of C isotopes (delta delta13C(diet-fish) values) in the lipids. If the relationship between trophic shift and enzyme activity can be confirmed in situations where feed quantity and quality are not known, the determination of enzyme activities would enable better estimates of the trophic shift to be made thus significantly improving back-calculation of diets from stable isotope data. 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3ameasurement 2aATP Citrate (pro-S)-Lyasexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aLiverxchemistryxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMalate Dehydrogenasexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aNitrogen Isotopes 2aTilapiaxmetabolism1 aFocken, U.1 aAbel, H.J.1 aBecker, K.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2005 Jan., v. 140A, no. 1 p.117-124x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a20050311b20050401c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/03/11  aOther US 7aarticle02835naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245015100180300001600331520150500347650002501852650002401877650001201901650001501913650001101928650002501939650000901964650003401973650004902007650001602056650002802072650001902100650004002119700002002159700001702179700001402196773009902210852000902309930003302318945002502351946001302376655001202389IND4367484720221121064913.0050307e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436748472DNAL7 a155964002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRankin, S.M.14aThe effect of ventral nerve cord severance and male castration on female mating behavior, clutch size, and maternal care in the ring-legged earwig  ap. 533-541.  aMating is critical for the expression of oviposition and maternal care in the earwig, Euborellia annulipes; additionally, mating diminishes receptivity to additional mating and promotes a decline in juvenile hormone synthesis at the end of the gonadotrophic cycle (in contrast to most insect species wherein mating stimulates juvenile hormone production). We report here that severance of the ventral nerve cord of virgin females similarly promoted egg deposition and maternal care of eggs, diminished mating receptivity, and elicited a timely decline in juvenile hormone biosynthesis. Mating of intact females to adult males that were castrated as larvae did not abolish oviposition; however, clutch size was reduced, and no eggs developed. Such castrated males had smaller seminal vesicles than did intact males, presumably attributable to lack of sperm in castrated males. In contrast, mating of intact females to males castrated on day 1 of adult life did not reduce clutch size compared with those of sham-operated animals and did not abolish fertilization; in fact, these castrated males produced viable offspring after six matings. These results are consistent with the notion that ventral nerve cord severance mimicked mating in intact animals. Following mating, the ventral nerve cord likely is a conduit to release the brain from inhibiting oviposition and maternal care. The presence of sperm in the spermatheca is not necessary for release of this inhibition but may modulate clutch size. 3aEuborellia annulipes 3ainsect reproduction 2aAnimals 2aCell Count 2aFemale 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMaternal Behaviorxphysiology 2aNerve Tissuexinjuriesxphysiologyxsurgery. 2aOrchiectomy 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aOvumxcytology 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology1 aInnocenti, M.A.1 aEicher, C.A.1 aFurst, D.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2004 Dec., v. 139A, no. 4 p.533-541x1095-64337nnas  aDNAL  a20050308b20050401c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle02762naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001600190245015500206300001600361500002400377500001500401520092900416650001601345650001501361650001601376650002101392650001901413650001301432650002501445650001301470650001001483650002001493650002501513650001101538650002101549650002501570650001501595650001401610650000901624650001701633650003601650651001101686653002301697653001501720653001501735653002201750653002801772653002101800700001601821700001501837773010101852852000901953856006901962930003302031945002502064946001102089655001202100IND4389567020221121064915.0070321e20070212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438956702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2006.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL823 0aF0001 aBarbosa, E.10aIn vivo antigiardial activity of three flavonoids isolated of some medicinal plants used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of diarrhea  ap. 552-554.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMexican traditional medicine uses a great variety of plants in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea. In order to understand the properties of some of their chemical constituents, three flavonoids (kaempferol, tiliroside and (-)-epicatechin) isolated from Geranium mexicanum, Cuphea pinetorum, Helianthemum glomeratum, and Rubus coriifolius, were assayed to demonstrate their in vivo antiprotozoal activity; using an experimental infection of Giardia lamblia in suckling female CD-1 mice. Compounds tested showed antigiardial activity with values of ED50 (μmol/kg) 0.072 for (-)-epicatechin, 2.057 for kaempferol and 1.429 for tiliroside. The most active flavonoid was the (-)-epicatechin, its activity was higher than metronidazole and emetine, drugs used as positive controls.

All diets contained (% of dry matter) 21% alfalfa silage and 35% corn silage plus 1) 2% urea plus 41% high-moisture shelled corn (HMSC), 2) 12% SSBM plus 31% HMSC, 3) 14% CSM plus 29% HMSC, or 4) 16% CM plus 27% HMSC. Crude protein was equal across diets, averaging 16.6%. The CSM diet supplied the least rumen-degraded protein and the most rumen-undegraded protein. Microbial nonammonia N flow was similar among the true protein supplements but was 14% lower in cows fed urea. In vivo ruminal passage rate, degradation rate, and estimated escape for the 3 true proteins were, respectively, 0.044/h, 0.105/h, and 29% for SSBM; 0.051/h, 0.050/h, and 51% for CSM; and 0.039/h, 0.081/h, and 34% for CM. This indicated that CSM protein was less degraded because of both a faster passage rate and slower degradation rate. Omasal flow of individual AA, branched-chain AA, essential AA, nonessential AA, and total AA all were lower in cows fed urea compared with one of the true protein supplements. Among the 3 diets supplemented with true protein, omasal flow of Arg was greatest on CSM, and omasal flow of His was greatest on CSM, intermediate on CM, and lowest on SSBM. Lower flows of AA and microbial nonammonia N explained lower yields of milk yield and milk components observed on the urea diet in the companion lactation trial. These results clearly showed that supplementation with true protein was necessary to obtain sufficient microbial protein and rumen-undegraded protein to meet the metabolizable AA requirements of high-producing dairy cows. 3adairy cows 3amilk yield 3acow feeding 3aprotein supplements 3anutrient utilization 3aamino acid metabolism 3aHolstein 3aomasum 3asoybean meal 3acottonseed meal 3acanola meal 3arumen fermentation 3aalfalfa silage 3acorn silage 3acrude protein 3aurea 3amilk composition 3aamino acid requirements 3arumen microorganisms 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairying 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aEating 2aEukaryotaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOmasumxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aRandom Allocation1 aBroderick, G.A.1 aReynal, S.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1828-1841dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2007/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle03245naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001800147245010600165300001800271500002400289520131200313650001501625650001301640650001101653650002101664650003201685650001401717650001401731650002601745650002001771650001001791650001601801650001501817650001801832650002201850650002101872650002301893650002601916650001201942650002801954650003001982650002302012650004902035650004002084650002402124650002502148650001102173650004102184650003602225650004602261650001402307650001702321650002902338700001602367773012002383852000902503930003302512945002502545946001302570655001202583IND4389116320221121044923.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438911632DNAL7 a173692292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aKincaid, R.L.10aEffect of Cobalt Supplementation During Late Gestation and Early Lactation on Milk and Serum Measures  ap. 1880-1886.  aIncludes references  aThirty-six multiparous cows were assigned to a study to determine the effects of dietary Co supplementation during late gestation and early lactation on concentrations of Co in serum and liver, vitamin B₁₂ concentrations in serum and milk, and milk yield. Nonlactating cows received diets containing 0.15, 0.89, or 1.71 mg/ kg of Co (dry matter basis) from 55 d before parturition, and lactating cows received diets containing 0.19, 0.57, or 0.93 mg/kg of Co (dry matter basis) from parturition through 120 d postpartum. Serum vitamin B₁₂ concentrations declined sharply in all cows between 55 and 20 d prepartum. Dietary Co supplementation tended to cause an increase in the concentration of vitamin B₁₂ in colostrum and milk. Cobalt intake did not affect concentrations of Co in liver or serum, but increased the Co concentration of milk (0.089, 0.120, and 0.130 μg of Co/mL) at 120 days in milk. There was no effect of Co supplementation on dry matter intake or yield of milk and milk components. In conclusion, serum concentrations of vitamin B₁₂ are reduced in the early dry period, and added dietary Co may increase ruminal synthesis of vitamin B₁₂ as indicated by a tendency for increased vitamin B₁₂ concentrations in colostrum and milk of cows supplemented with dietary Co. 3adairy cows 3aHolstein 3acobalt 3afeed supplements 3adietary mineral supplements 3apregnancy 3alactation 3aparity (reproduction) 3ablood chemistry 3aliver 3avitamin B12 3amilk yield 3acow colostrum 3adry matter intake 3amilk composition 3arumen fermentation 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Chemical Analysis 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCobaltxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aColostrumxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aDietary Supplements 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aLiverxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aMilkxchemistryxdrug effectsxsecretion. 2aPregnancy 2aTime Factors 2aVitamin B 12xmetabolism1 aSocha, M.T.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1880-1886dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2007/06/08  aOther US 7aarticle03614naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001700156245012000173300001800293500002400311500001500335520163700350650001501987650001602002650002602018650001802044650002302062650002202085650002702107650002402134650001302158650002302171650002402194650002902218650002102247650002602268650001202294650002302306650001302329650002402342650002302366650004002389650001102429650004102440650002602481650003502507650002802542650004302570650003702613653002102650700002002671700001602691700001502707700001802722773012002740852000902860930003302869945002502902946001302927655001202940IND4389116020221121045002.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438911602DNAL7 a173692262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aW0001 aOdongo, N.E.10aEffect of Supplementing Myristic Acid in Dairy Cow Rations on Ruminal Methanogenesis and Fatty Acid Profile in Milk  ap. 1851-1858.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementing myristic acid in dairy cow rations on ruminal methanogenesis and the fatty acid profile in milk. Twelve multiparous Holstein dairy cows (710 ± 17.3 kg of live weight; 290 ± 41.9 d in milk) housed in a tie-stall facility were used in the study. The cows were paired by parity and days in milk and allocated to 1 of 2 treatments: 1) the regular milking cow total mixed ration (control diet), and 2) the regular milking cow total mixed ration supplemented with 5% myristic acid on a dry matter basis (MA diet). The cows were fed and milked twice daily (feeding, 0830 and 1300 h; milking, 0500 and 1500 h). The experiment was conducted as a completely randomized design and consisted of a 7-d pretrial period when cows were fed the control diet to obtain baseline measurements, a 10-d dietary adaptation period, and a 1-d, 8-h measurement period. The MA diet reduced methane (CH₄) production by 36% (608.2 vs. 390.6 ± 56.46 L/d, control vs. MA diet, respectively) and milk fat percentage by 2.4% (4.2 vs. 4.1 ± 0.006%, control vs. MA diet, respectively). The MA diet increased 14:0 in milk by 139% and cis-9 14:1 by 195%. There was a correlation (r = -0.58) between the 14:0 content in milk and CH₄ production and cis-9 14:1 and CH₄ production (r = -0.47). Myristic acid had no effect on the contents of CLA or trans-10 18:1 and trans-11 18:1 isomers in milk. These results suggest that MA could be used to inhibit the activities of methanogens in ruminant animals without altering the conjugated linoleic acid and trans-18:1 fatty acid profile in milk. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3aparity (reproduction) 3amyristic acid 3amethane production 3apollution control 3afatty acid composition 3atotal mixed rations 3aHolstein 3arumen fermentation 3amilk fat percentage 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3afeed supplements 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairying 2aDietary Supplements 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFatty Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMethanexbiosynthesis 2aMilkxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aMyristic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aRumenxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0amilk composition1 aOr-Rashid, M.M.1 aKebreab, E.1 aFrance, J.1 aMcBride, B.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1851-1858dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2007/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle03005naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001900147245009200166300001800258500002400276520130400300650001501604650003101619650002601650650002101676650001301697650002101710650001301731650001601744650001101760650001701771650002201788650001201810650001801822650001901840650001201859650002301871650001301894650002101907650002501928650002801953650001101981650004101992650002602033650002002059650002502079650003702104700001702141700001802158700001502176773012002191852000902311930003302320945002502353946001302378655001202391IND4389115220221121045059.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438911522DNAL7 a173692182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aDewhurst, R.J.10aApparent Recovery of Duodenal Odd- and Branched-Chain Fatty Acids in Milk of Dairy Cows  ap. 1775-1780.  aIncludes references  aThis study compared flows of odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (OBCFA) at the duodenum with corresponding yields in milk. Four mid-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were offered 4 dietary treatments, based on different ratios of ryegrass silage and concentrates (80:20, 65:35, 50:50, and 35:65 on a dry matter basis), in a 4 x 4 Latin square design experiment with 4-wk periods. Samples of milk and duodenal digesta were collected during the final week of each period and analyzed for fatty acids. Biohydrogenation of linoleic and α-linolenic acids (C18:2 and C18:3) was extensive for all treatments, with a tendency to be lower for C18:3 with increased concentrate feeding. The proportion of duodenal flows of these fatty acids that appeared in milk declined with increasing concentrate feeding. There was little change in the yield of OBCFA in milk in response to increasing level of concentrate inclusion and no significant relationship with the yield of microbial protein at the duodenum. The efficiency of transfer of iso C15:0 and anteiso C15:0 from the duodenum to milk was similar to that for C18:3, with a reduced proportion transferred into milk at higher flows. Yields of C15:0, C17:0, and iso C17:0 in milk were higher than duodenal flows, confirming synthesis in animal tissues. 3adairy cows 3abranched chain fatty acids 3aodd chain fatty acids 3abiohydrogenation 3aduodenum 3amilk composition 3aHolstein 3acow feeding 3aLolium 3agrass silage 3afeed concentrates 3adigesta 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairying 2aDietxveterinary 2aDuodenumxmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Contentsxchemistry 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aMilkxchemistry 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxmetabolism1 aMoorby, J.M.1 aVlaeminck, B.1 aFievez, V.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1775-1780dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2007/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle04391naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001500138245010100153300001800254500002400272500001500296520214500311650001402456650002802470650002102498650001802519650001702537650002502554650001502579650001902594650001802613650002202631650001902653650001702672650002602689650001602715650002102731650002002752650001402772650001502786650002002801650002902821650001402850650001702864650002802881650002602909650001202935650003402947650002202981650001103003650005003014650001303064650001103077650001803088650004203106650002603148650002203174650001103196650001403207650001703221650002103238653001503259653001703274700001603291700001703307700001703324700001603341700001603357773012003373852000903493930003303502945002503535946001303560655001203573IND4389114820221121045115.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438911482DNAL7 a173692142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aBionaz, M.10aPlasma Paraoxonase, Health, Inflammatory Conditions, and Liver Function in Transition Dairy Cows  ap. 1740-1750.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aParaoxonase (PON) is a liver protein with hydrolase activity that is released into the blood stream. Paraoxonase may serve as an index of liver function because it is drastically reduced in chronic liver damage. Sixty-seven periparturient dairy cows were used to evaluate the relationship between plasma PON, health problems, inflammatory conditions, and liver function. Baseline plasma PON concentrations during the first 30 d in milk (DIM) were retrospectively used to group cows into quartiles. Metabolic profile, lipid metabolites (e.g., nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate), inflammatory indices (haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin), low and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, vitamin A, vitamin E, reactive oxygen metabolites, total antioxidants, and PON in plasma were measured 2 wk before to 8 wk after calving. Weekly milk yield, body condition score, and all health problems were recorded. After parturition (7 DIM), cows in the lower PON group had the lowest plasma concentrations of negative acute phase proteins compared with the higher PON group for retinol binding protein (23.2 ± 2.86 vs. 36.0 ± 2.96 μg/dL of vitamin A), albumin (31.6 ± 0.73 vs. 33.9 ± 0.75 g/ L), total cholesterol (2.04 ± 0.30 vs. 2.45 ± 0.42 mmol/ L), and the highest concentrations of haptoglobin (0.67 vs. 0.24 ± 0.03 g/L; positive acute phase protein) and globulins (37.2 vs. 32.3 ± 1.4 g/L). Plasma bilirubin was highest in the cows (10.1 vs. 6.2 ± 0.6 μmol/L) in the lowest PON quartile. Plasma PON was negatively correlated with haptoglobin (r = -0.39) and bilirubin (r = -0.42) and positively correlated with retinol binding protein (r = 0.54), albumin (r = 0.38), and cholesterol (r = 0.55) fractions. A total of 82.3% of cows in the lower quartile and no cows in the upper quartile experienced serious inflammation. Lower quartile cows produced 28.1 ± 10.3 kg of milk/d; whereas upper quartile cows produced 38.3 ± 7.7 kg of milk/d during the first 30 DIM. A reduction in the ability of the liver to cope with the increased metabolic demand near parturition in dairy cows can be diagnosed using changes in baseline plasma PON. 3abilirubin 3areactive oxygen species 3afree fatty acids 3aanimal health 3aarylesterase 3aacute phase proteins 3adairy cows 3aliver function 3aserum albumin 3ahematologic tests 3abody condition 3ahaptoglobins 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aferroxidase 3alipid metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3avitamin A 3amilk yield 3aearly lactation 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3avitamin E 3ainflammation 3alow density lipoprotein 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aAryldialkylphosphatasexblood 2aBody Constitution 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxenzymologyxphysiopathology. 2aDairying 2aFemale 2aHealth Status 2aInflammationxenzymologyxveterinary. 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aTime Factors 2aVitamin Exblood 0aparoxonase 0aantioxidants1 aTrevisi, E.1 aCalamari, L.1 aLibrandi, F.1 aFerrari, A.1 aBertoni, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1740-1750dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2007/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle03854naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147072000900156100001700165245009300182300001800275500002400293520207900317650000902396650002202405650002002427650001102447650001302458650002002471650001902491650001302510650001602523650001202539650001502551650001802566650001702584650002002601650001902621650002402640650001902664650001202683650003302695650002302728650002202751650002102773650001102794650002102805650003202826650002602858650003902884650001702923700001702940700001902957700001602976773012002992852000903112930003303121945002503154946001303179655001203192IND4389114320221121045157.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438911432DNAL7 a173692092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL100 0aL800 0aL3001 aTucker, C.B.10aMilking Cows Once Daily Influences Behavior and Udder Firmness at Peak and Mid Lactation  ap. 1692-1703.  aIncludes references  aOur aim was to evaluate the effects of once-daily milking on the welfare of dairy cows in a pastoral-based farming system. There are concerns that cows milked only once daily may experience discomfort associated with udder distension. We evaluated the behavior, including lying time and postures, grazing patterns, and kicking behavior in the parlor, and measures of udder firmness in cows milked once daily in 2 experiments: 1) at peak lactation, comparing cows milked once (1x) or twice-daily (2x) from the time of calving (n = 4 groups; 1x and 2x treatments); and 2) during the transition from 2x to 1x milking at mid lactation (n = 12 groups; 1x, 2x, and 2x to 1x treatments or TRANS). At peak lactation, cows milked 1x were more likely to lie with their hind legs touching the body than cows milked 2x. There were no differences in udder firmness (1x: 10.0 vs. 2x: 9.9 ± 0.13 g of force) or kicking (1x: 25 vs. 2x: 24 ± 7.8%) behavior in the parlor. In the second experiment, milking frequency was reduced from 2x to 1x and this change resulted in an increase in udder firmness (1 x: 9.1, 2x: 9.3, and TRANS: 9.5 ± 0.14 g of force). Despite these differences in udder firmness, lying time (1x: 10.1, 2x: 9.5, and TRANS: 9.6 ± 0.38 h/24 h), postures, and concentrations of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (1x: 10.0, 2x: 10.5, and TRANS: 10.4 ± 0.49 ng/g of feces in the 3 d after transition) in cows milked 1x or 2x were similar. Although milking frequency did not influence total time spent grazing, the diurnal grazing pattern of cows milked 2x was disrupted by afternoon milking at both peak and mid lactation. Cows milked 2x were able to compensate for this by grazing more after the return to pasture (DIM 153 to 155, 1x: 52 vs. 2x: 66 ± 6.2 min/90 min of grazing). Cows milked 1x had slightly longer strides than 2x cows at mid lactation (1x: 0.73, 2x: 0.70, and TRANS: 0.70 ± 0.014 strides/m). In conclusion, under our experimental conditions, we found no overt changes in behavior or physiology to indicate that the welfare of cows milked 1x is impaired. 3acows 3amilking frequency 3aanimal behavior 3audders 3afirmness 3alactation stage 3aanimal welfare 3acortisol 3ametabolites 3agrazing 3alocomotion 3aanimal stress 3ahypothalamus 3apituitary gland 3aadrenal glands 3ahormonal regulation 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aGaitxphysiology 2aGlucocorticoidsxmetabolism 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aDalley, D.E.1 aBurke, J.-L.K.1 aClark, D.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1692-1703dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2007/06/07  aOther US 7aarticle03247naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198100001500207245009900222300001400321500002400335500001500359520091300374650003001287650002001317650001801337650002201355650003301377650001901410650002601429650001401455650001201469650002201481650002401503650002001527650001201547650004101559650001801600650002701618650004801645650001401693650004601707650002801753650003001781650002301811650002401834651001501858651000901873653001301882653002801895653002501923653002001948653003401968700001602002700001802018700001402036700002002050700002102070700001702091700001802108700001602126700001302142700001702155773011502172852000902287856007602296930003302372945002502405946001102430655001202441IND4389081520221121045028.0070318e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438908152DNAL7 a173739442pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2006.00660.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL200 0aL001 0aL7001 aWALTON, C.10aMolecular identification of mosquito species in the Anopheles annularis group in southern Asia  ap. 30-35.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Anopheles annularis group of subgenus Cellia Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) includes five currently recognized species in southern Asia: An. annularis Van der Wulp, Anopheles nivipes (Theobald) and Anopheles philippinensis Ludlow, which are widespread in the region, Anopheles pallidus Theobald, which is known in Sri Lanka, India and Myanmar, and Anopheles schueffneri Stanton, which occurs in Java and Sumatra. Identification of the four mainland species based on morphology is problematic. In view of the fact that the three widespread species are variously involved in malaria transmission in different parts of the region, we developed a species-specific polymerase chain reaction assay based on rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences to facilitate entomological and epidemiological studies of the four species. The method proved to be reliable when tested over a wide geographical area. 3ageographical distribution 3ainsect taxonomy 3aribosomal DNA 3agenetic variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ainsect vectors 3amolecular systematics 3aAnopheles 3amalaria 3asequence homology 3apest identification 3agenetic markers 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGeography 2aInsect Vectorsxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSpecies Specificity 3aSouth Asia 0aAsia 0ataxonomy 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aspecies complex 0ainternal transcribed spacer 21 aSOMBOON, P.1 aHARBACH, R.E.1 aZHANG, S.1 aWEERASINGHE, I.1 aO'LOUGHLIN, S.M.1 aPHOMPIDA, S.1 aSOCHANTHA, T.1 aTUN-LIN, W.1 aCHEN, B.1 aBUTLIN, R.K.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2007 Mar., v. 21, no. 1 p.30-35dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2006.00660.x3electronic resource  a20070404b20070502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/04/04  aNon-US 7aarticle04128naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175072000900193072000900202072000900211100001400220245009800234300001600332500002400348500001500372506007600387520197900463506003702442650001102479650001602490650002302506650001902529650001802548650002202566650001902588650001202607650002402619650001202643650003802655650002802693650003302721650003302754650001102787650003302798650000902831650003002840650002202870650001602892651001002908651001002918653003602928653002102964700001802985700001603003700001703019700001803036700001703054700001803071700001603089700001803105773011703123852000903240856007603249930003303325945002503358946001103383655001203394IND4389081020221207080015.0070318e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438908102DNAL7 a173739532pmid7 aPMC27053322pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2007.00672.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL300 0aL0011 aMANDA, H.10aDiscriminative feeding behaviour of Anopheles gambiae s.s. on endemic plants in western Kenya  ap. 103-111.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) is known to feed on plant sugars, but this is the first experimental study to consider whether it discriminates between plant species. Thirteen perennial plant species were selected on the basis of their local availability within the vicinity of human dwellings and larval habitats of An. gambiae s.s. in western Kenya. Groups of 100 or 200 mosquitoes were released into cages either with a cutting of one plant type at a time (single-plant assay) or with cuttings of all 13 plants simultaneously (choice assay), respectively, and left overnight. In the choice assay, direct observations of the percentages of mosquitoes perching or feeding on each plant were recorded over four 1-h periods each night. For both types of assay, mosquitoes were recaptured and the percentage that had fed on plants was assessed by testing them individually for the presence of fructose. To identify which plants the choice-assay mosquitoes had fed on, gas chromatography (GC) profiles of samples of mosquito homogenates were compared with GC profiles of extracts from relevant parts of each plant. Four of the plants that were observed to have been fed on most frequently in the choice assay (Parthenium hysterophorus L., Tecoma stans L., Ricinus communis L., and Senna didymobotrya Fresen) were also shown to have been ingested most often by mosquitoes in both types of assay, suggesting that An. gambiae is differentially responsive to this range of plants, regardless of whether the plants were presented singly or mixed together. Significantly more females than males fed on plants, with the exception of P. hysterophorus L., one of the plants most frequently fed on. For most plant species (ten of 13), GC profiles indicated that An. gambiae obtained sugars primarily from flowers. The exceptions were P. hysterophorus L., Lantana camara L. and R. communis L., on which An. gambiae fed more often from leaves and stems than from flowers.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asugars 3afood plants 3agender differences 3ainsect vectors 3asugar feeding 3aAnopheles gambiae 3anectar feeding 3amalaria 3afeeding preferences 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxphysiology 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aSex Factors 3aKenya 0aKenya 0aAnopheles gambiae sensu stricto 0afeeding behavior1 aGOUAGNA, L.C.1 aNYANDAT, E.1 aKABIRU, E.W.1 aJACKSON, R.R.1 aFOSTER, W.A.1 aGITHURE, J.I.1 aBEIER, J.C.1 aHASSANALI, A.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2007 Mar., v. 21, no. 1 p.103-111dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2007.00672.x3electronic resource  a20070406b20070502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/04/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03910naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001400173245013800187300001600325500002400341520195200365650002802317650001502345650002202360650003702382650002402419650007302443650004702516650002902563650006702592650004102659650004002700650004002740650002402780650003902804650004702843653002502890700001202915700001902927700001702946700001902963700001802982700001903000700001803019700001903037773012503056852000903181856008503190930003303275945002503308946001103333655001203344IND4389068120140723000000.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438906812DNAL7 a172116352pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-006-0199-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3501 aYu, C.

The present study focuses on the biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase system, which catalyzes the dioxygenation reaction. This enzyme has been shown to have a broad substrate range, catalyzing the dioxygenation of not only biphenyl, but also three- and four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Extracts prepared from biphenyl-grown B1 cells contained three protein components that were required for the oxidation of biphenyl. The genes encoding the three components (bphA4, bphA3 and bphA1f,A2f) were expressed in Escherichia coli. Biotransformations of biphenyl, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and benzo[a]pyrene as substrates using the recombinant E. coli strain resulted in the formation of the expected cis-dihydrodiol products previously shown to be produced by biphenyl-induced strain B1. The three protein components were purified to apparent homogeneity and characterized in detail. The reductase component (bphA4), designated reductaseBPH₋B₁, was a 43 kD monomer containing one mol FAD/mol reductaseBPH₋B₁. The ferredoxin component (bphA3), designated ferredoxinBPH₋B₁, was a 12 kD monomer containing approximately 2 g-atoms each of iron and acid-labile sulfur. The oxygenase component (bphA1f,A2f), designated oxygenaseBPH₋B₁, was a 217 kD heterotrimer consisting of α and β subunits (approximately 51 and 21 kD, respectively). The iron and acid-labile sulfur contents of oxygenaseBPH₋B₁ per αβ were 2.4 and 1.8 g-atom per mol, respectively. Reduced ferredoxinBPH₋B₁ and oxygenaseBPH₋B₁ each gave EPR signals typical of Rieske [2Fe-2S] proteins. Crystals of reductaseBPH₋B₁, ferredoxinBPH₋B₁ and oxygenaseBPH₋B₁ diffracted to 2.5 Å, 2.0 Å and 1.75 Å, respectively. The structures of the three proteins are currently being determined. 3aSphingomonas yanoikuyae 3aoxygenases 3abiotransformation 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCrystallizationxmethods 2aDioxygenasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFerredoxinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Structure 2aOxygenasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSphingomonadaceaexenzymologyxmetabolism. 0abiphenyl dioxygenase1 aLiu, W.1 aFerraro, D.

The key components of the GA signaling pathway have been identified over the past 10 years. The current view is that GA binds to a soluble GID1 receptor, which interacts with the DELLA repressor proteins in a GA-dependent manner and thereby induces DELLA protein degradation via the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFGID²/SLY¹. GA-dependent growth responses can generally be correlated with and be explained by changes in DELLA repressor abundance, where the DELLA repressor exerts a growth restraint that is relieved upon its degradation. However, it is obvious that other mechanisms must exist that control the activity of this pathway. This review discusses recent advances in the understanding of GA signaling, of its homeostasis, and of its cross-talk with other signaling pathways. 3aplant growth 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3agibberellic acid 3asignal transduction 3abinding proteins 3areceptors 3aprotein degradation 3abinding capacity 3aprotein-protein interactions 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGibberellinsxmetabolism 2aHomeostasisxphysiology 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aReceptor Cross-Talkxphysiology 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexmetabolism 2aSKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligasesxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 0aliterature reviews 0aDella repressor 0aplants0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2008 Feb., v. 11, no. 1 p.9-15dPergamonx1369-52667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2007.10.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080603b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03027naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001400180245008000194300001800274500001500292506007600307520088000383506003701263650001301300650002501313650002101338650002701359650002501386650001801411650002501429650003901454650002401493650001201517650005801529650002901587650002301616650002601639650003501665650001801700650003301718650002801751650001301779650001401792650002401806650003401830650001601864653002701880653002101907653001101928653002801939653001401967653001901981653001302000700001902013700001702032773014202049852000902191856008202200930003302282945001302315946001302328655001202341IND2040491820221207113340.0940623e19940315dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204049182DNAL7 a81343562pmid7 aPMC433172pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.6.21002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, X.10aCytoplasmic dynein is involved in nuclear migration in Aspergillus nidulans  ap. 2100-2104.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNuclear migration plays an important role in the growth and development of many organisms including the multinuclear fungus Aspergillus nidulans. We have identified four genes, nudA, nudC, nudF, and nudG, in which temperature-sensitive mutations affect nuclear distribution. In this report, we describe the cloning of the nudA gene by complementation of the mutant phenotype by using a chromosome VIII-specific cosmid library. A genomic fragment of nudA hybridized to an mRNA of approximately 14 kb. Sequencing analysis of nudA revealed four ATP-binding sites that are characteristic of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. The amino acid sequence of the nudA gene product shows 52% overall identity with the rat brain cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. Our study provides in vivo evidence that dynein, a microtubule motor molecule, plays a role in the nuclear migration process.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproteins 3aAspergillus nidulans 3astructural genes 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3anucleotide sequences 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAspergillus nidulansxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCytoplasmxmetabolism 2aDyneinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTemperature 0aAspergillus nidulellus 0anuclear movement 0anuclei 0amolecular sequence data 0anuda gene 0agenbank/u03904 0amovement1 aBeckwith, S.M.1 aMorris, N.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Mar. 15, v. 91, no. 6 p.2100-2104x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.6.21003Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03717naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001800180245009900198300001800297500001500315506007600330520149500406506003701901650002801938650002101966650001501987650001402002650002302016650002902039650001502068650002102083650001002104650002802114650004302142650006202185650002002247650002802267650001802295650003102313650002202344650002902366650002602395650002602421650005202447653001402499653003002513653002702543653002502570700001602595700001602611700001602627700001702643700001502660700001702675700002002692700001502712773014202727852000902869856008202878930003302960945001302993946001303006655001203019IND2040493520221207113333.0940623e19940315dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204049352DNAL7 a81343722pmid7 aPMC433372pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.6.21962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaehelin, C.10aPerception of Rhizobium nodulation factors by tomato cells and inactivation by root chitinases  ap. 2196-2200.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe bacterial genera Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, nitrogen-fixing symbionts of legumes, secrete specific lipo-chitooligosaccharides that induce the formation of nodules on their host plants. When preparations of such nodulation-inducing factors (Nod factors) were added to suspension-cultured tomato cells, a rapid and transient alkalinization of the culture medium occurred. Lipo-oligosaccharide preparations from Rhizobium or Bradyrhizobium treated with flavonoids, known inducers of Nod factor synthesis, were up to 100 times more potent in inducing alkalinization than the ones from untreated bacteria. The activity was absent from preparations of the mutant strain Rhizobium sp. NGR234 delta nodABC, unable to produce any Nod factors. Preparations of Nod factors from various bacteria as well as individual, highly purified Nod factors from Rhizobium sp. NGR(pA28) induced alkalinization in the tomato cell cultures at nanomolar concentrations. This demonstrates that Nod factors can be perceived by tomato, a nonhost of rhizobia. Using the alkalinization response as a sensitive bioassay, Nod factors were found to be inactivated by plant chitinases. Root chitinases purified from different legumes differed in their potential to inactivate differently substituted Nod factors produced by Rhizobium sp. NGR(pA28). This indicates that the specificity of the bacterium-host plant interaction may be due, at least in part, to differential inactivation of Nod factors by root chitinases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aalkalinity 3achitinase 3aRhizobium phaseoli 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3ahydrolysis 3aoligosaccharides 3aroots 3acell suspension culture 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aBacterial Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aCells, Cultured 2aChitinasesxmetabolism. 2aCulture Media 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aRhizobiaceaexphysiology 2aRhizobiumxphysiology 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aVegetablesxcytologyxenzymologyxmicrobiology. 0aRhizobium 0alipochitooligosaccharides 0aSinorhizobium meliloti 0alipoologosaccharides1 aGranado, J.1 aMüller, J.1 aWiemken, A.1 aMellor, R.B.1 aFélix, G.1 aRegenass, M.1 aBroughton, W.J.1 aBoller, T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Mar. 15, v. 91, no. 6 p.2196-2200x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.6.21963Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03528naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001600180245017200196300001800368506007600386520137900462506003701841650001601878650001801894650002501912650001401937650001401951650001201965650001501977650001301992650002002005650001802025650001502043650002402058650001202082650002202094650005402116650001402170650003402184650002002218650001402238650001502252650002502267650002402292650002802316650003102344650004102375650003002416650003302446650001702479650002202496653001702518700001502535700001302550773014102563852000902704856008202713930003302795945001302828946001302841655001202854IND2040579520221207101702.0940629e19940301dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204057952DNAL7 a81279092pmid7 aPMC432782pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.5.19322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMason, P.W.10aRGD sequence of foot-and-mouth disease virus is essential for infecting cells via the natural receptor but can be bypassed by an antibody-dependent enhancement pathway  ap. 1932-1936.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFoot-and-mouth disease virus appears to initiate infection by binding to cells at an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence found in the flexible beta G-beta H loop of the viral capsid protein VPI. The role of the RGD sequence in attachment of virus to cells was tested by using synthetic full-length viral RNAS mutated within or near the RGD sequence. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with three different RNAS carrying mutations bordering the RGD sequence produced infectious viruses with wild-type plaque morphology; however, one of these mutant viruses bound to cells less efficiently than wild-type. BHK cells transfected with RNAS containing changes within the RGD sequence produced noninfectious particles indistinguishable from wild-type virus in terms of sedimentation coefficient, binding to monoclonal antibodies, and protein composition. These virus-like particles are defined as ads(-) viruses, since they were unable to adsorb to and infect BHK cells. These mutants were defective only in cell binding, since antibody-complexed ads(-) viruses were able to infect Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing an immunoglobulin Fc receptor. These results confirm the essential role of the RGD sequence in binding of foot-and-mouth disease virus to susceptible cells and demonstrate that the natural cellular receptor for the virus serves only to bind virus to the cell.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAphthovirus 3acoat proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3ainfection 3areceptors 3akidneys 3acell lines 3ahamsters 3aimmunoglobulins 3abinding sites 2aAdsorption 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viral 2aAphthovirusxgeneticsximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aCHO Cells 2aCapsidxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCapsid Proteins 2aCell Line 2aCricetinae 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aGenetic Engineering 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aOligopeptidesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aReceptors, Fcxphysiology 2aReceptors, Virusxphysiology 2aTransfection 2aVirus Replication 0afc receptors1 aRieder, E.1 aBaxt, B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Mar. 1, v. 91, no. 5 p.1932-1936x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.5.19323Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02085naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245006700199300001600266506007600282520076200358506003701120650001101157650001301168650001401181650000901195650001101204650001801215650001101233650003401244700001401278700001501292700001701307700001901324700001601343700001601359773017101375852000901546856008301555946001301638655001201651IND4448354020221207101658.0110126e20110118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444835402DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10081571072doi7 aPMC30246792pmcid7 a210977062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuguet, T.10aSelf-assembly of metal nanostructures on binary alloy surfaces  ap. 989-994.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDeposition of metals on binary alloy surfaces offers new possibilities for guiding the formation of functional metal nanostructures. This idea is explored with scanning tunneling microscopy studies and atomistic-level analysis and modeling of nonequilibrium island formation. For Au/NiAl(110), complex monolayer structures are found and compared with the simple fcc(110) bilayer structure recently observed for Ag/NiAl(110). We also consider a more complex codeposition system, (Ni + Al)/NiAl(110), which offers the opportunity for fundamental studies of self-growth of alloys including deviations for equilibrium ordering. A general multisite lattice-gas model framework enables analysis of structure selection and morphological evolution in these systems.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3aevolution 3agold 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3anickel 3ascanning tunneling microscopy1 aHan, Yong1 aYuen, Chad1 aJing, Dapeng1 aÜnal, Barış1 aEvans, J.W.1 aThiel, P.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Jan. 18, v. 108, no. 3 p.989-994dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10081571073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02831naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001900180245011500199300001800314500001500332506007600347520093300423506003701356650001901393650001801412650001701430650002301447650001601470650002401486650001201510650002001522650002101542650002001563650001301583650002901596650002801625650004601653650001601699650002701715650003101742650004601773650005301819653001701872653000801889700002001897700001801917700001501935773014101950852000902091856008202100930003302182945001302215946001302228655001202241IND2040576420221207110947.0940629e19940301dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204057642DNAL7 a81278802pmid7 aPMC432462pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.5.17762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoringer, H.U.14aThe formation of mitochondrial ribonucleoprotein complexes involving guide RNA molecules in Trypanosoma brucei  ap. 1776-1780.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscripts from mitochondrial (maxicircle) genes of kinetoplastid organisms undergo RNA editing characterized by a series of reactions that insert and delete uridine nucleotides within the sequence of the pre-mRNAs. Guide RNAs, which complement fully edited mRNAs, provide the information for the edited sequence by an unknown mechanism. We report here that guide RNA molecules associate with other mitochondrial components to form four specific, stable ribonucleoprotein complexes. The complexes form very rapidly at a low monovalent cation concentration, and their formation is blocked by heparin or pretreatment of the mitochondrial lysate with SDS. ATP hydrolysis is not required but slightly stimulates complex association up to concentrations of 5 mM. The results are suggestive of a sequential assembly of the ribonucleoprotein complexes, and their possible involvement during the kinetoplastid RNA editing is discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anucleoproteins 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aRNA editing 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Protozoan 2aHot Temperature 2aKinetics 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Editing 2aRNA, Guidexmetabolism 2aRNA, Protozoanxmetabolism 2aRibonucleoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrypanosoma brucei bruceixgeneticsxmetabolism. 0ainteractions 0aRNA1 aKoslowsky, D.J.1 aMorales, T.H.1 aStuart, K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Mar. 1, v. 91, no. 5 p.1776-1780x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.5.17763Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02941naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011000126300001600236500001500252520176600267650004402033650002202077650003502099650000802134650002502142650001302167650002702180653001702207653002402224653003202248653002102280653002302301700001202324700001802336700001702354700001602371773006402387852000902451930003302460945001302493946001302506655001202519IND2057280820221119120243.0970523s1996    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205728082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoelens, R.10aStructure and dynamics of the DNA binding protein HU from Bacillus stearothermophilus by NMR spectroscopy  ap. 553-559.  a2019-12-05  aThe DNA-binding protein HU from Bacillus stearothermophilus (HUBst) is a dimer with a molecular weight of 19.5 kDa that is capable of bending DNA. An x-ray structure has been determined previously [Tanaka et al. (1984) Nature, Vol. 310, pp. 376-381], but no structure could be established for a large part of the supposed DNA-binding beta-arms. Distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics using nmr restraints were used to generate a set of 25 structures. These structures display a back-bone rms deviation (RMSD) of 0.36 angstrom for the well-defined region (residues 2-54 and 75-90). The structure of the core is very similar to that observed in the x-ray structure, with a pairwise RMSD of 1.06 angstrom. The structure of the beta-hairpin arm contains a double flip-over at the prolines in the two strands of the beta-arm. Heteronuclear 15N relaxation measurements indicate that the beta-arm and the tip of the beta-arm is flexible. This explains the disorder observed in the solution and x-ray structures of the beta-arm with respect to the core of the protein. Overlayed onto itself the beta-arm is better defined with an backbone RMSD of 1.0 angstrom calculated for residues 54-59 and 69-74. The tip of the arm adopts a well-defined 4 : 6 beta-hairpin conformation. Changes in amide 15N and 1H chemical shifts upon titrating DNA are most pronounced for the residues in the beta-hairpin arm and for the residues in the second half of the third alpha-helix. Heteronuclear 15N relaxation data for free and complexed HUBst show that the arms become structured upon DNA binding. Together with chemically induced nuclear polarization measurements on a mutant HUBst (M69Y: V76Y) this shows that the beta-hairpin arm is involved in direct DNA-interaction. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein structure 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding proteins 3adynamics 3amolecular conformation 0ainteractions 0aprotein-dna complex 0aBacillus stearothermophilus 0aprotein dynamics 0achemical structure1 aVis, H.1 aVorgias, C.E.1 aWilson, K.S.1 aKaptein, R.0 tBiopolymers.g1996, v. 40, no. 5 p.553-559x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02841naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245011000133300001600243520191300259650001802172650001702190650001302207650001502220650001302235650002202248650002002270650004302290653002302333700001502356773006402371852000902435930003302444945001302477946001302490655001202503IND2061896220221119120339.0980217s1996    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206189622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillet, Catherine.10aPeptide chemistry: development of high performance liquid chromatography and capillary zone electrophesis  ap. 265-317.  aThe development of relatively non-compressible supporting media of small particle size as well as pumps that deliver constant flow rates at high pressures has enabled investigators to perform rapid, high resolution liquid chromatography for more than two decades. Studies initiated in this laboratory in 1975, evaluating the compatibility of unprotected peptides with commercially available chromatographic supports and development of solvent systems ultimately led to separations not previously observed with both synthetic peptides and native peptides from tissue extracts. It was rapidly realized however, that recovery of certain molecules could be problematic. To meet the challenges presented by the isolation of natural hormones (such as corticotropin releasing factor and growth hormone releasing hormone) and proteins (such as inhibin and activin) and the need for large quantities of highly purified peptides for clinical investigations, our group invested heavily in identifying new supports (high carbon loading and 300 angstrom pore sizes) and solvent systems (triethylammonium phosphate and trifluoroacetic acid) compatible with reverse phase, size exclusion and ion exchange chromatographies from a pratical and economical perspective. More recently, we have contributed to the identification of unusual buffer systems (inclusive of organic modifiers) compatible with capillary zone electrophoresis that will both modulate the capillaries' selectivity, increase resolution and serve as an orthogonal approach to determining peptide purity. From a pragmatic point of view, in this paper we highlight the original and timely contributions (technical and strategical) of this laboratory in the field of analytical and preparative high performance liquid chromatography and capillary one electrophoresis of synthetic and native biologically active peptides and proteins over the past twenty years. 3aoligopeptides 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3aseparation 3asolvents 3achemical analysis 3aelectrophoresis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 0aliterature reviews1 aRivier, J.0 tBiopolymers.g1996, v. 40, no. 3 p.265-317x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02411naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245012500141300001600266500001500282520124700297650002301544650001401567650002601581650002201607650002101629650000801650650001901658650002101677650002901698650003201727650001401759653001801773653001701791653002301808700002101831773006901852852000901921930003301930945001301963946001301976655001201989IND2056926320221119120301.0970506e199612  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205692632DNAL7 a89468022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Y.10aVibrational analysis of nucleic acids.

The vibrational spectra are analyzed to develop a consistent set of assignments for the C-C-O-P(O2(-))-O-C-C network, which serves as a model for the nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone. The present study resolves previously conflicting vibrational assignments for the phosphodiester skeleton and provides a firm empirical basis for interpreting conformationally sensitive modes of DNA and RNA. Ab initio vibrational analyses have also been conducted on the above isotopomers of diethyl phosphate in the trans-gauche-gauche-trans conformation, optimized using the 3-21+G* basis set at the restricted Hartree-Fock level. The ab initio calculations are in good agreement with the empirical results, thus strengthening the proposed assignment scheme for Raman and infrared spectra. The present study provides a basis for improvement of empirical force fields utilized in previous normal coordinate analyses of the nucleic acid phosphodiester group. 3aRaman spectroscopy 3avibration 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3aDNA conformation 3aRNA 2aDNAxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aNucleic Acidsxchemistry 2aOrganophosphatesxchemistry 2aVibration 0anucleic acids 0aspectroscopy 0achemical structure1 aThomas, G.J.

Mutant Xanthomonas strains have been derived that produce xanthan gums with an altered or variant subunit chemical structure and different measured viscosities when compared with the wild type (wt) form of the polymer. Two variant gums were targeted as potentially interesting in this study, these being the nonacetylated tetramer (natet) and the acetylated tetramer (atet), which both lack a side-chain terminal mannose residue and in one case (natet) lacks an acetate group on an internal mannose residue. Solutions of these tetrameric gums possess viscosities higher (natet) and lower (atet) than the wt gum, and therefore we have attempted to determine whether these molecules possess unique conformational preferences when compared with the wt and with each other. In this manner we can initiate an understanding of how a polysaccharide's conformation contributes to its solution properties. The GEGOP software permits a sampling of the static and dynamic equilibrium states of carbohydrate molecules, and this software was employed to calculate equilibrium states of representative oligosaccharides with chemical structures representative of xanthan-like molecules. Energy minimization techniques revealed similar local minima for all three molecules. Some of these minima are comprised of elongate backbone conformations (A type) in which side chains fold onto backbone surfaces. Other minima with A backbones possessed side chains in less intimate backbone contact especially when calculations were performed with a low dielectric constant. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in the wt molecule where an increased number of negatively charged side-chain residues experience charge repulsion resulting in reduced side-chain-backbone contact. Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) dynamic simulations performed with an elevated temperature factor (1000 K) allowed a better qualitative representation of conformational space than 300 K simulations. Employing a nonhierarchical cluster analysis method (population density profile: PDP) coupled with a classification scheme, it was possible to partition resulting MMC data sets into conformational families. This analysis revealed that in simulations performed with different dielectric constant values (10, 25, and infinity) all molecules possessed primarily A-type backbones. Less elongate, more open helical backbone,forms (B, C, D, J, and Flat-a) did occur during the simulations but were populated to a lesser extent. In the natet molecule significantly open helical backbones existed (E, F, G, H, and I) that did not occur in the lower viscosity wt and atet molecules. PDP clustering methods and subsequent conformational classification applied to the first residue (mannose) of the side chain permitted a determination of side-chain orientation. Comparison of all three molecules indicated a larger population of side-chain conformational families in less direct backbone contact for the wt molecule than either of the variant molecules (natet/atet) suggesting that the side chains in the wt are more flexible. Thus, a major conformational difference between the high viscosity natet and the lower viscosities of the wt/atet is the increased amount of open helical backbone in the natet. In addition, the significant difference between the higher viscosity wt and the lower viscosity atet is the increase side-chain flexibility in the wt. We hypothesize that conformational differences of this kind could form a partial explanation of the observed differences in viscosity between these xanthan-like polymers. 3amolecular conformation 3amodels 3aMonte Carlo method 3aviscosity 3axanthan gum 2aCarbohydrate Conformation 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aMannosexchemistry 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aThermodynamics 2aViscosity 2aXanthomonas campestrisxchemistryxgenetics. 0acomputer simulation1 aSchuyler, S.C.1 aMaglothin, R.K.1 aStaehelin, L.A.0 tBiopolymers.g1996 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.251-272x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02464naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010000183300001600283500002400299520059500323650003200918650002400950650001000974650003700984650001301021650001401034650001201048650001201060650003401072650002101106650008601127650005001213650003701263650002701300650002801327650001401355650002501369650002701394650002201421650002001443650002901463650003801492651001001530651001001540700001301550700001301563700001401576700001201590700001801602700001301620700002101633700002001654773008201674852000901756856008501765655001201850IND4435666620221119120318.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443566662DNAL7 a202134862pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-010-0464-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jian-Ming10aGenetic analysis of strains of Japanese Encephalitis Virus isolated from swine in central China  ap. 357-361.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, four strains of Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of aborted fetuses or stillborn piglets collected randomly from a number of piggeries in central China.

DESIGN Observational study based on passive surveillance data. ANIMALS All animals submitted for rabies testing in the United States during 2015. PROCEDURES State and territorial public health programs provided data on animals submitted for rabies testing in 2015. Data were analyzed temporally and geographically to assess trends in domestic and sylvatic animal rabies cases. RESULTS During 2015, 50 states and Puerto Rico reported 5,508 rabid animals to the CDC, representing an 8.7% decrease from the 6,033 rabid animals reported in 2014. Of the 5,508 cases of animal rabies, 5,088 (92.4%) involved wildlife. Relative contributions by the major animal groups were as follows: 1,704 (30.9%) bats, 1,619 (29.4%) raccoons, 1,365 (24.8%) skunks, 325 (5.9%) foxes, 244 (4.4%) cats, 85 (1.5%) cattle, and 67 (1.2%) dogs. There was a 4.1% decrease in the number of samples submitted for testing in 2015, compared with the number submitted in 2014. Three human rabies deaths were reported in 2015, compared with only 1 in 2014. A 65-year-old man in Massachusetts was bitten by a rabid dog while abroad. A 77-year-old woman in Wyoming had contact with a bat. A 54-year-old man in Puerto Rico was bitten by a mongoose. The only connection among these 3 cases was that none received postexposure prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Laboratory testing of animals suspected to be rabid remains a critical public health function and continues to be a cost-effective method to directly influence human rabies postexposure prophylaxis recommendations. 3aChiroptera 3aHerpestidae 3aProcyon lotor 3acats 3acattle 3acost effectiveness 3adisease control 3adogs 3afoxes 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aobservational studies 3apublic health 3arabies 3askunks 3awildlife 3awomen 3aMassachusetts 3aPuerto Rico 3aWyoming1 aCleaton, Julie M.1 aMonroe, Ben P.1 aWadhwa, Ashutosh1 aOrciari, Lillian A.1 aYager, Pamela1 aBlanton, Jesse1 aVelasco-Villa, Andres1 aPetersen, Brett W.1 aWallace, Ryan M.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2017 May 15, v. 250, no. 10 p.1117-1130dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.250.10.1117  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001800180245013200198300001800330500001500348506007600363520128300439506003701722650004501759650002201804650002001826650002101846650002001867650003001887650001801917650001101935650002001946650002301966650002701989650002002016650002402036650001202060650001802072650002202090650001602112650001102128650002802139650002002167650002502187650003702212650000902249650002202258650002802280650003002308650003402338650003002372653001302402653001902415700001602434700002702450700002002477773014202497852000902639856008202648930003302730945001302763946001302776655001202789IND2040669120221207113207.0940705e19940329dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204066912DNAL7 a81461432pmid7 aPMC433932pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.7.24832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnipple, D.C.10aTight genetic linkage between the kdr insecticide resistance trait and a voltage-sensitive sodium channel gene in the house fly  ap. 2483-2487.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe kdr insecticide resistance trait in the house fly, Musca domestica, confers resistance to the rapid paralysis (knockdown) and lethal effects of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and pyrethroids. Flies with the kdr trait exhibit reduced neuronal sensitivity to these compounds, which are known to act at voltage-sensitive sodium channels of nerve membranes. To test the hypothesis that a mutation in a voltage-sensitive sodium channel gene confers the kdr phenotype, we have cloned genomic DNA corresponding to a segment of the house fly homologue of the para sodium channel gene of Drosophila melanogaster, identified restriction-site polymorphisms within this segment between the kdr strain 538ge and an inbred insecticide-susceptible lab stain, and developed a sensitive polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic procedure to determine the sodium channel genotype of individual flies. A genetic linkage analysis performed with these molecular markers shows that the kdr trait is tightly linked (within about 1 map unit) to the voltage-sensitive sodium channel gene segment exhibiting the DNA sequence polymorphism. These findings provide genetic evidence for a mutation at or near a voltage-sensitive sodium channel gene as the basis for kdr resistance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aperipheral nerves 3aDDT (pesticide) 3astructural genes 3aanimal proteins 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aion transport 3asodium 3aplasma membrane 3alinkage (genetics) 3ainsecticide resistance 3aMusca domestica 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDDTxpharmacology 2aDNA Primers 2aFemale 2aGenes, Insectxgenetics 2aGenetic Linkage 2aHousefliesxgenetics 2aInsecticide Resistancexgenetics 2aMale 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSodium Channelsxgenetics 0amutation 0anerve membanes1 aDoyle, K.E.1 aMarsella-Herrick, P.A.1 aSoderlund, D.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Mar. 29, v. 91, no. 7 p.2483-2487x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.7.24833Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02396naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003900145245008900184300001600273500002400289520132200313650001201635650001201647650001301659650002001672650002301692650001501715650001801730650001001748650001901758650001101777700002101788700002201809773010901831852000901940856008501949655001202034IND4435650020221119120456.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443565002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-010-0913-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRangel de Alvarenga Paes, Juliana.13aAn oligarchy of nest-site scouts triggers a honeybee swarm's departure from the hive  ap. 979-987.  aIncludes references  aAnimals that travel in groups must synchronize the timing of their departures to assure cohesion of the group. While most activities in large colonies of social insects have decentralized control, certain activities (e.g., colony migration) can have centralized control, with only a special subset of well-informed individuals making a decision that affects the entire colony. We recently discovered that a small minority of individuals in a honeybee colony—an oligarchy—decides when to trigger the departure of a swarm from its hive. The departure process begins with some bees producing the worker-piping signal (the primer for departure) and is followed by these bees producing the buzz-run signal (the releaser for departure). In this study, we determined the identity of these signalers. We found that a swarm's nest-site scouts search for potential nest cavities prior to the departure of the swarm from its hive. Furthermore, we found that the predeparture nest-site scouts are the sole producers of the worker-piping signal and that they are the first producers of the buzz-run signal. The control of the departure of a honeybee swarm from its hive shows how a small minority of well-informed individuals in a large social insect colony can make important decisions about when a colony should take action. 3aApoidea 3aanimals 3acohesion 3adecision making 3ahoney bee colonies 3ahoney bees 3anesting sites 3anests 3asocial insects 3aswarms1 aGriffin, Sean R.1 aSeeley, Thomas D.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2010 May, v. 64, no. 6 p.979-987dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-010-0913-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03450naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001700180245008600197300001800283506007600301520155200377506003701929650001401966650002401980650002202004650000802026650002002034650001202054650003202066650001302098650001802111650002102129650002202150650004702172650001502219650003702234650001802271650002102289650001202310650002002322650002802342650004302370650001102413650003002424650002602454651001502480653001102495653002102506700001702527773014202544852000902686856008202695930003302777945001302810946001302823655001202836IND2040669220221207110509.0940705e19940329dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204066922DNAL7 a81461452pmid7 aPMC433952pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.7.24932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodges, S.A.10aFloral and ecological isolation between Aquilegia formosa and Aquilegia pubescens  ap. 2493-2496.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHabitat preference and pollination syndrome have been suggested as major factors in reproductive isolation among plant species. The columbine genus Aquilegia contains species that have been used as classic examples of reproductive isolation due to ecological and floral factors. In this analysis Aquilegia formosa, Aquilegia pubescens, and natural hybrid populations between these two species were assayed for genetic and morphological variation. Clinal variation was evident for three "random amplified polymorphic DNA" loci and five morphological characters along a transect extending from a lower altitude A. formosa population, through an intermediate hybrid population, to a higher altitude A. pubescens population. Similar clinal variation was also discovered for a transect that included A. formosa-like, hybrid, and A. pubescens-like populations at a single elevation. The change in the frequency of both sets of markers was closely associated with change in habitat. The molecular markers indicate the presence of bidirectional introgression between these two species. In contrast, there was apparently selection against introgression of four of the five alternate floral characters. Selection against the incorporation of floral characters from one species into the other species was suggested by the introgression of the DNA markers with little or no introgression of the four floral characters. These findings suggest the importance of adaptations associated with both pollination syndromes and habitat preference on species integrity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAquilegia 3apopulation genetics 3agenetic variation 3aDNA 3agenetic markers 3ahybrids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aaltitude 3aintrogression 3aplant morphology 3anatural selection 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3apopulation 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aEcology 2aGenetic Markers 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlantsxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aPollen 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 3aCalifornia 0aclines 0aclinal variation1 aArnold, M.L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Mar. 29, v. 91, no. 7 p.2493-2496x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.7.24933Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02878naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245010300199300001800302506007600320520129300396506003701689650002701726650002101753650001201774650001501786650001501801650004201816650001201858650001701870650002601887650001601913700002601929700002301955700002501978700002502003700001902028700002902047700002502076700001702101773017302118852000902291856008302300946001302383655001202396IND4448354920221207110519.0110126e20110125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444835492DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10186951082doi7 aPMC30297612pmcid7 a212453132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chi10amut-16 and other mutator class genes modulate 22G and 26G siRNA pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 1201-1208.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArgonaute-associated siRNAs and Piwi-associated piRNAs have overlapping roles in silencing mobile genetic elements in animals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutator (mut) class genes mediate siRNA-guided repression of transposons as well as exogenous RNAi, but their roles in endogenous RNA silencing pathways are not well-understood. To characterize the endogenous small RNAs dependent on mut class genes, small RNA populations from a null allele of mut-16 as well as a regulatory mut-16(mg461) allele that disables only somatic RNAi were subjected to deep sequencing. Additionally, each of the mut class genes was tested for a requirement in 26G siRNA pathways. The results indicate that mut-16 is an essential factor in multiple endogenous germline and somatic siRNA pathways involving several distinct Argonautes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The results also reveal essential roles for mut-2 and mut-7 in the ERGO-1 class 26G siRNA pathway and less critical roles for mut-8, mut-14, and mut-15. We show that transposons are hypersusceptible to mut-16-dependent silencing and identify a requirement for the siRNA machinery in piRNA biogenesis from Tc1 transposons. We also show that the soma-specific mut-16(mg461) mutant allele is present in multiple C. elegans laboratory strains.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aRNA interference 3aanimals 3abiogenesis 3agerm cells 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amutants 3anull alleles 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransposons1 aMontgomery, Taiowa A.1 aGabel, Harrison W.1 aFischer, Sylvia E.J.1 aPhillips, Carolyn M.1 aFahlgren, Noah1 aSullivan, Christopher M.1 aCarrington, James C.1 aRuvkun, Gary0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Jan. 25, v. 108, no. 4 p.1201-1208dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10186951083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02193naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008200202300001800284506007600302520116100378506003701539650001201576650001401588650001101602773017301613852000901786856008301795946001301878655001201891IND4448355420221207110505.0110126e20110125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444835542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10153901082doi7 aPMC30297352pmcid7 a212203042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBongard, Josh10aMorphological change in machines accelerates the evolution of robust behavior  ap. 1234-1239.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMost animals exhibit significant neurological and morphological change throughout their lifetime. No robots to date, however, grow new morphological structure while behaving. This is due to technological limitations but also because it is unclear that morphological change provides a benefit to the acquisition of robust behavior in machines. Here I show that in evolving populations of simulated robots, if robots grow from anguilliform into legged robots during their lifetime in the early stages of evolution, and the anguilliform body plan is gradually lost during later stages of evolution, gaits are evolved for the final, legged form of the robot more rapidly--and the evolved gaits are more robust--compared to evolving populations of legged robots that do not transition through the anguilliform body plan. This suggests that morphological change, as well as the evolution of development, are two important processes that improve the automatic generation of robust behaviors for machines. It also provides an experimental platform for investigating the relationship between the evolution of development and robust behavior in biological organisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3aevolution 3arobots0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Jan. 25, v. 108, no. 4 p.1234-1239dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10153901083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03767naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001300180245009700193300001800290506007600308520169100384506003702075650002902112650001202141650001602153650002502169650002102194650002302215650001802238650002102256650002402277650002602301650002302327650003602350650002802386650003302414650003202447650001802479650002402497650002202521650002802543650001302571650004502584650003902629650004002668653002402708653001402732653003102746653002302777700001902800700001802819773014202837852000902979856008202988930003303070945001303103946001303116655001203129IND2040791420221207110505.0940712e19940215dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204079142DNAL7 a81084352pmid7 aPMC431842pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.4.14852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoos, J.12aA screen for yeast mutants with defects in the dolichol-mediated pathway for N-glycosylation  ap. 1485-1489.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDolichol in the form of dolichyl phosphate participates in the synthesis of N- and O-linked glycoproteins and phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this organism, as well as in higher eukaryotes, a number of the enzymes in the polyisoprenoid and glycoprotein biosynthetic pathways have not been identified. In this study, we have developed a convenient, highly sensitive assay that uses one of the end products of the dolichyl-phosphate synthetic pathway, oligosaccharide-diphosphodolichol, and a (125)I-labeled peptide substrate for N-linked glycosylation to screen a collection of temperature-sensitive yeast mutants for defects in protein glycosylation. By using a combination of biochemical and genetic procedures, the defective mutants were grouped into three categories: those containing defects in dolichyl-phosphate synthesis (class 1), lipid-linked oligosaccharide assembly (class 2), or oligosaccharide transferase activity (class 3). Among the mutants identified by this screen were sec59 (which encodes dolichol kinase) and a mutant that affects the activity of the ALG1-encoded mannosyltransferase that forms dolichol-PP-(GlcNAc)(2)Man(1). Of particular interest was a mutant that exhibits a temperature-sensitive defect in oligosaccharide transferase activity. This mutant, meg1 (microsomal protein essential for glycosylation 1) assembles a complete oligosaccharide chain and, therefore, is likely to be a class 3 mutant. We report the cloning of MEG1, the gene that rescues the oligosaccharide transferase activity defect in this mutant. A number of criteria distinguish this gene from previously described genes in this pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amutants 3amutagenesis 3aglycosyltransferases 3astructural genes 3achemical reactions 3aglycoproteins 3aoligosaccharides 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDolichol Phosphatesxmetabolism 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGlycopeptidesxbiosynthesis 2aGlycosylation 2aHexosyltransferases 2aMembrane Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aOligosaccharidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aTransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aphosphates (esters) 0ameg1 gene 0aoligosaccharyl transferase 0adolichyl phosphate1 aSternglanz, R.1 aLennarz, W.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Feb. 15, v. 91, no. 4 p.1485-1489x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.4.14853Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02225naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011100130300001600241520120400257650002201461650001601483650001401499650002701513650001601540650002301556650002701579650002001606650002301626700001401649700001801663700001501681700001901696773006801715852000901783930003301792945001301825946001301838655001201851IND2063019520221119120245.0980408e199705  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206301952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoncalves, M.P.10aStudies on kappa-carrageenan/locust bean gum mixtures in the presence of sodium chloride and sodium iodide  ap. 657-671.  aThe solution properties of kappa-carrageenan and kappa-carrageenan/locust bean gum mixtures have been studied by small deformation oscillation measurements and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the presence of sodium chloride and sodium iodide. Both salts induced the kappa-carrageenan to undergo a coil-helix conformational change as noted by an increase in the storage and loss moduli (G', G") and by an exothermic peak in the DSC cooling curves. The enthalpy delta Hc-h and temperature of the conformational transition Tc-h were higher in NaI compared to NaCl and Tc -h increased with increasing the concentration of both electrolytes. Gelation was not observed for carrageenan or carrageenan/locust bean gum mixtures in the presence of up to 200 mM NaI. Although carrageenan alone did not gel in the presence of 100 mM NaCl, a weak gel was obtained for a mixture containing 0.9%/0.1% carrageenan/locust bean gum. Furthermore, the mixture showed hysteresis in both the rheological and DSC cooling and heating curves. A strong gel was produced for carrageenan alone in the presence of 200 mM NaCl and the gel strength increased on adding a small proportion of locust bean gum (0.9%/0.1%). 3aCeratonia siliqua 3acarrageenan 3asolutions 3amolecular conformation 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3arheological properties 3asodium chloride 3apotassium chloride1 aGomes, C.1 aLangdon, M.J.1 aViebke, C.1 aWilliams, P.A.0 tBiopolymers.g1997 May, v. 41, no. 6 p.657-671x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02920naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245011800200300001800318506007600336520169000412506003702102650001202139650002102151650001102172650001202183650001802195650000902213650001802222650001102240700001702251773017302268852000902441856008302450946001302533655001202546IND4448355320221207100756.0110126e20110125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444835532DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10084111082doi7 aPMC30297312pmcid7 a212202932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Shengfa10aNonheme oxo-iron(IV) intermediates form an oxyl radical upon approaching the C-H bond activation transition state  ap. 1228-1233.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOxo-iron(IV) species are implicated as key intermediates in the catalytic cycles of heme and nonheme oxygen activating iron enzymes that selectively functionalize aliphatic C-H bonds. Ferryl complexes can exist in either quintet or triplet ground states. Density functional theory calculations predict that the quintet oxo-iron(IV) species is more reactive toward C-H bond activation than its corresponding triplet partner, however; the available experimental data on model complexes suggests that both spin multiplicities display comparable reactivities. To clarify this ambiguity, a detailed electronic structure analysis of alkane hydroxylation by an oxo-iron(IV) species on different spin-state potential energy surfaces is performed. According to our results, the lengthening of the Fe-oxo bond in ferryl reactants, which is the part of the reaction coordinate for H-atom abstraction, leads to the formation of oxyl-iron(III) species that then perform actual C-H bond activation. The differential reactivity stems from the fact that the two spin states have different requirements for the optimal angle at which the substrate should approach the (FeO)²⁺ core because distinct electron acceptor orbitals are employed on the two surfaces. The H-atom abstraction on the quintet surface favors the "σ-pathway" that requires an essentially linear attack; by contrast a "π-channel" is operative on the triplet surface that leads to an ideal attack angle near 90°. However, the latter is not possible due to steric crowding; thus, the attenuated orbital interaction and the unavoidably increased Pauli repulsion result in the lower reactivity of the triplet oxo-iron(IV) complexes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalkanes 3achemical bonding 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aferrous oxide 3aheme 3ahydroxylation 3aoxygen1 aNeese, Frank0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Jan. 25, v. 108, no. 4 p.1228-1233dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10084111083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02625naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245009700182300001800279500002400297520115700321650001701478650001201495650001201507650001301519650001301532650001801545650001001563650001901573650001201592650001301604650001401617650001401631650001301645650001201658650001301670650006901683650002501752650003401777650003901811650002501850650002201875650002601897773011401923852000902037856008502046655001202131IND4435636020221119120239.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443563602DNAL7 a201693422pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-010-2460-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatsuma, Koji10aMineralization of s-triazine herbicides by a newly isolated Nocardioides species strain DN36  ap. 1585-1592.  aIncludes references  aA novel s-triazine-mineralizing bacterium—Nocardioides sp. strain DN36—was isolated from paddy field soil treated with ring-U-¹⁴C-labeled simetryn ([¹⁴C]simetryn) in a model paddy ecosystem (microcosm). In a tenfold-diluted R2A medium, strain DN36 liberated ¹⁴CO₂ from not only [¹⁴C]simetryn but also three ring-U-¹⁴C-labeled s-triazines: atrazine, simazine, and propazine. We found that DN36 mineralized ring-U-¹⁴C-cyanuric acid added as an initial substrate, indicating that the bacterium mineralized s-triazine herbicides via a common metabolite, namely, cyanuric acid. Strain DN36 harbored a set of genes encoding previously reported s-triazine-degrading enzymes (TrzN-AtzB-AtzC), and it also transformed ametryn, prometryn, dimethametryn, atraton, simeton, and prometon. The findings suggest that strain DN36 can mineralize a diverse range of s-triazine herbicides. To our knowledge, strain DN36 is the first Nocardioides strain that can individually mineralize s-triazine herbicides via the ring cleavage of cyanuric acid. Further, DN36 could not grow on cyanuric acid, and the degradation seemed to occur cometabolically. 3aNocardioides 3aametryn 3aatraton 3aatrazine 3abacteria 3adimethametryn 3agenes 3amineralization 3apaddies 3aprometon 3aprometryn 3apropazine 3asimazine 3asimeton 3asimetryn 2aActinomycetalesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAtrazinexmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aHerbicidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSimazinexmetabolism 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTriazinesxmetabolism0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 86, no. 5 p.1585-1592dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2460-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02473naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012100161300001800282500002400300520148900324650002601813650002201839650002001861650002501881650001901906650002101925700002001946773011101966852000902077856008502086655001202171IND4435648820221119120109.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443564882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-010-0916-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Dani10aMixed messages: fertility signaling interferes with nestmate recognition in the monogynous ant Camponotus floridanus  ap. 1011-1018.  aIncludes references  aChemical communication is crucial for the organization of social insect colonies. However, with the heavy use of one communication modality, problems may arise such as the interference of different types of information. This study investigated how information about fertility and colony membership is integrated in the ant Camponotus floridanus. We introduced into mature, queenright colonies (a) the nestmate queen, (b) a nestmate worker, (c) a foreign, high-fertility queen, (d) a foreign, low-fertility queen, and (e) a foreign worker. As expected, workers did not attack their nestmate queen or a nestmate worker but responded aggressively to foreign workers and foreign, low-fertility queens. Surprisingly, workers did not attack foreign, high-fertility queens. Chemical analysis demonstrated that the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of C. floridanus encodes information about fertility status in queens and workers and colony membership in workers. We suggest that ants respond to this information in the cuticular hydrocarbon profile: individuals with strong fertility signals are accepted regardless of their colony membership, but individuals without strong fertility signals are tolerated only if their cuticular hydrocarbon profile matches that of colony members. Learning how social insects respond to multiple types of information presented together is critical to our understanding of the recognition systems that permit the complex organization of social insect colonies. 3aCamponotus floridanus 3achemical analysis 3ainsect colonies 3anestmate recognition 3asocial insects 3asocial structure1 aLiebig, Jürgen0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2010 May, v. 64, no. 6 p.1011-1018dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-010-0916-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01411naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006400125300001600189520061200205650001600817650001300833650001600846650001500862650002700877653001700904700001500921700001600936773007700952852000901029930003301038945001301071946001301084655001201097IND2199832220221119120034.0990722e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219983222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, C.C.10aSeparation of egg white lysozyme by anionic polysaccharides  ap. 962-965.  aAnionic polysaccharides (Na-alginate, Na-carboxyl-methyl-cellulose, high methoxy pectin and kappa-carrageenan) were evaluated for their suitability towards simple and more efficient separation of lysozyme from salted or fresh duck eggs and hen egg whites for use in foods.

Recently, we have proposed that the displacement of unfavorable waters by the ligand, replacing them with groups complementary to the protein surface, is the principal driving force for protein-ligand binding, and we have introduced the WaterMap method to account this effect. However, in spite of the adage "nature abhors vacuum," one can occasionally observe situations in which a portion of the receptor active site is so unfavorable for water molecules that a void is formed there. In this paper, we demonstrate that the presence of dry regions in the receptor has a nontrivial effect on ligand binding affinity, and suggest that such regions may represent a general motif for molecular recognition between the dry region in the receptor and the hydrophobic groups in the ligands. With the introduction of a term attributable to the occupation of the dry regions by ligand atoms, combined with the WaterMap calculation, we obtain excellent agreement with experiment for the prediction of relative binding affinities for a number of congeneric ligand series binding to the major urinary protein receptor. In addition, WaterMap when combined with the cavity contribution is more predictive than at least one specific implementation [Abel R, Young T, Farid R, Berne BJ, Friesner RA (2008) J Am Chem Soc 130:2817-2831] of the popular MM-GBSA approach to binding affinity calculation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3abinding capacity 3adrugs 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3aprediction 3aprotein binding1 aBerne, B.J.1 aFriesner, R.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Jan. 25, v. 108, no. 4 p.1326-1330dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10167931083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02719naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008800165300001800253500002400271500001500295520119100310650002901501650002401530650001301554650001801567650003001585650001901615650003301634650001901667650001601686650001101702650001501713650001001728650000701738650001501745650001601760650002101776650001501797650002101812653002901833700001701862700001901879700002501898700002001923700002001943700001801963773011401981852000902095856008502104655001202189IND4435634920221119120249.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443563492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-009-2395-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeya, Marimuthu10aCharacterization of β-glucosidase from a strain of Penicillium purpurogenum KJS506  ap. 1473-1484.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA novel β-glucosidase (BGL)-producing strain was isolated and identified as Penicillium purpurogenum KJS506 based on its morphology and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA gene sequence. When rice straw and corn steep powder were used as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, the maximal BGL activity of 12.3 U ml⁻¹, one of the highest levels among BGL-producing microorganisms was observed. The optimum temperature and pH for BGL production were 32 °C and 4, respectively. An extracellular BGL was purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography of P. purpurogenum culture supernatants, and the purified BGL showed higher activity (V max = 934 U mg protein⁻¹) than most BGLs from other sources. The complete ORF of bgl3 was cloned from P. purpurogenum by a modified thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction. The bgl3 gene consists of a 2,571-bp ORF and encodes a putative protein containing 856 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 89,624 Da. The putative gene product was identified as a member of glycoside hydrolase family 3. The present results should contribute to improved industrial production of BGL by P. purpurogenum KJS506. 3aTalaromyces purpurogenus 3aopen reading frames 3anitrogen 3aribosomal DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3achromatography 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicroorganisms 3aamino acids 3acarbon 3acorn straw 3agenes 3apH 3arice straw 3atemperature 3amolecular weight 3aglycosides 3abeta-glucosidase 0aPenicillium purpurogenum1 aJoo, Ah-Reum1 aLee, Kyoung-Mi1 aTiwari, Manish Kumar1 aLee, Kyoung-Min1 aKim, Sang-hwan.1 aLee, Jung-Kul0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 86, no. 5 p.1473-1484dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2395-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03022naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245013800198300001800336506007600354520162700430506003702057650002802094650001602122650001402138650002202152650001302174650002502187650001102212650001502223650001202238650001302250650001602263700001402279700002902293773017302322852000902495856008302504946001302587655001202600IND4448356320221207083743.0110126e20110125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444835632DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10128461082doi7 aPMC30296962pmcid7 a212059042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jian10aCrystallographic and online spectral evidence for role of conformational change and conserved water in cytochrome oxidase proton pump  ap. 1284-1289.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCrystal structures in both oxidized and reduced forms are reported for two bacterial cytochrome c oxidase mutants that define the D and K proton paths, showing conformational change in response to reduction and the loss of strategic waters that can account for inhibition of proton transfer. In the oxidized state both mutants of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides enzyme, D132A and K362M, show overall structures similar to wild type, indicating no long-range effects of mutation. In the reduced state, the mutants show an altered conformation similar to that seen in reduced wild type, confirming this reproducible, reversible response to reduction. In the strongly inhibited D132A mutant, positions of residues and waters in the D pathway are unaffected except in the entry region close to the mutation, where a chloride ion replaces the missing carboxyl and a 2-Å shift in N207 results in loss of its associated water. In K362M, the methionine occupies the same position as the original lysine, but K362- and T359-associated waters in the wild-type structure are missing, likely accounting for the severe inhibition. Spectra of oxidized frozen crystals taken during X-ray radiation show metal center reduction, but indicate development of a strained configuration that only relaxes to a native form upon annealing. Resistance of the frozen crystal to structural change clarifies why the oxidized conformation is observable and supports the conclusion that the reduced conformation has functional significance. A mechanism is described that explains the conformational change and the incomplete response of the D-path mutant.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3aX-radiation 3aannealing 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3alysine 3amethionine 3amutants 3amutation 3aproton pump1 aQin, Ling1 aFerguson-Miller, Shelagh0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Jan. 25, v. 108, no. 4 p.1284-1289dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10128461083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01601naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006400124300001800188520072400206650001200930650001700942650001900959650001600978650001800994650001401012650002701026700001601053700002101069700002601090773007901116852000901195930003301204945001301237946001301250655001201263IND2199841620221119120031.0990722e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219984162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbarz, A.10aHeating rates of peach juice in an agitated jacketed vessel  ap. 1045-1048.  aHeat transfer characteristics were studied on clarified depectinized peach juices heated in an agitated jacketed vessel.

Overall and internal heat transfer coefficients were also determined. For each agitator, a Nusselt number was statistically correlated as a function of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, and as the ratio of the fluid viscosity at the bulk temperature to the fluid viscosity at the wall temperature.

Here we report the characterization of the PAS10 gene and its product (PAS10) that is essential for the import of a large subset of proteins into the peroxisomal matrix, PAS10, a protein of 69 kDa, is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat, or snap helix, protein family, characterized by several direct repeats of a degenerate 34-amino acid motif (Sikorski, R. S., Boguski, M. S., Goebl, M. & Hieter, P. (1990) Cell 60, 307-317). Other members of this family are MAS70 (S. cerevisiae) and MOM72 (Neurospora crassa), which are mitochondrial receptors for protein import. A pas10 null mutant accumulates peroxisomal, leaflet-like membrane structures and exhibits deficient import of a number of peroxisomal matrix enzymes, particularly of proteins with an SKL-like import signal. In contrast, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase associated with these membranes is resistant in vitro to degradation by proteinase K, indicating true protein import. These results suggest that PAS10 is an essential component of a peroxisomal import machinery which mediates the translocation of a specific subset of proteins to the peroxisomal matrix with an SKL-like import signal.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aorganelles 3aproteins 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Fungalxisolation & purification 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMembrane Transport Proteins 2aMicrobodiesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlasmids 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 0amolecular sequence data1 aFranse, M.M.1 aElgersma, Y.1 aDistel, B.1 aTabak, H.F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1993 Dec. 15, v. 90, no. 24 p.11782-11786x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.90.24.117823Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01632naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007100126300001800197520071200215650002200927650003400949650001900983650001101002650001901013650001701032650001601049653001401065653001901079700002101098700001601119773007901135852000901214930003301223945001301256946001301269655001201282IND2199843320221119120125.0990722e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219984332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEliot, S.C.10aStability of shredded Mozzarella cheese under modified atmospheres  ap. 1075-1080.  aStability of Mozzarella cheese was studied under 8 modified atmospheres (air, vacuum and mixtures carbon dioxide/nitrogen) during 8 wk.

Modified atmospheres containing carbon dioxide efficiently stabilized lactic and mesophilic flora, while inhibiting staphylococci, molds and yeast.

The VirD1-VirD2 complex binds to 25-bp repeats at the borders of the T-DNA and catalyzes sequence-specific nicking of the conjugative DNA strand (the T-strand) at the third base of these repeats. Nuclear localization signals present in VirD2 target the T-strand to plant cell nuclei. In addition, VirD2 probably plays a role in the high-frequency integration of the T-DNA into the plant genome by illegitimate recombination. Whereas Agrobacterium transformation of dicots is very efficient, T-DNA integration in most monocots can barely be detected. To develop an artificial T-DNA delivery system for monocots, a technique for efficient in vitro production of T-strand DNAs was established by using VirD1 and VirD2 proteins purified from overexpressing Escherichia coli strains. The topoisomerase-like VirD2 enzyme was shown to mediate precise, sequence-specific cleavage of T-DNA border sequences carried by single-stranded DNA templates, even in the absence of VirD1 protein. During this reaction, VirD2 remains covalently bound to the 5' end of artificial T-strand DNAs. In contrast, VirD2, alone or in complex with VirD1, fails to nick linear double-stranded DNA templates in vitro.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3achemical reactions 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3atransfer DNA 3aplasmids 3aisomerases 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3avirulence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Single-Strandedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndodeoxyribonucleasesxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRhizobiumxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aVirulence Factors 0atopoisomerase 0aillegitimate recombination 0ain vitro 0ainteractions 0at-plasmid 0aDNA 0aconjugative dna strand 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0agenetic recombination1 aKoncz, C.1 aSchell, J.1 aSteinbiss, H.H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Jan. 18, v. 91, no. 2 p.694-698x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.2.6943Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03674naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003100130040001800161100001600179245012100195300001600316500001500332506007600347520157300423506003701996650002802033650001002061650003702071650001502108650001402123650002802137650001602165650001202181650001802193650002602211650003002237650003802267650003202305650001102337650001802348650002302366650002502389650000902414650002802423650003102451650003002482650003902512650002602551653002302577653001702600653001302617653001702630653001402647700001702661700001502678700001802693773014002711852000902851856008102860930003302941945001302974946001302987655001203000IND2039147520221207113204.0940429e19940118dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203914752DNAL7 a82905882pmid7 aPMC430202pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.2.7192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, A.G.10aNature screen: an efficient method for screening natural populations of Drosophila for targeted P-element insertions  ap. 719-722.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe efficiency of molecular techniques is making it increasingly necessary to rely on reverse genetics to understand the function of genes. Tissue-specific libraries allow one to identify numerous genes that can be cloned, sequenced, and mapped and whose temporal and tissue-specific pattern of expression are well characterized but whose function remains unknown. In such cases, it is desirable to generate targeted mutations to examine the phenotype of loss-of-function lesions. Here we describe a method for identifying naturally occurring variants of Drosophila melanogaster with specific genes tagged by a nearby P element. Imprecise P-element excision can then be used to generate a series of small deletions in or near the gene. In the method described here, large numbers of wild-caught males were crossed to balancer females, and inserts were identified in pooled samples by the polymerase chain reaction with one primer from each target gene and one primer from the P-element terminal repeat. We present the calculations for the probability of successfully tagging a gene and show that it is greatly improved by simultaneously screening inserts into several genes. If a large natural population is available, a nature screen is faster and easier than inducing P-element transposition in the laboratory, but the resulting lines, being genetically heterogeneous, may require more subsequent work to isolate. Using this method to screen the genomes of approximately 10,400 males, we found P-element inserts in dose proximity to 3 of 10 genes that were screened.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3apopulation 3ascreening 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atransposons 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aFemale 2aGene Deletion 2aGenetic Techniques 2aGenetics, Population 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSequence Tagged Sites 0atransposon tagging 0atarget genes 0amutation 0awild strains 0adeletions1 aSilveria, S.1 aMeyers, W.1 aLangley, C.H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Jan. 18, v. 91, no. 2 p.719-722x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.2.7193Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01763naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012000124300001600244500001500260520071600275650001100991650002501002650002101027650001401048650002501062653002201087653001801109653002301127653001901150653002301169700001801192700001501210700001801225773006601243852000901309930003301318945001301351946001301364655001201377IND2333802920221119120514.0030730s2002    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233380292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHritz, J.10aInfluence of structure of human, rat, and bovine serum albumins on binding properties of photoactive drug hypericin  ap. 251-254.  a2019-12-05  aFluorescence binding measurements and molecular modeling were employed to study the interaction of hypericin (Hyp) with human (HSA), rat (RSA), and bovine (BSA) serum albumins. Fluorescence emission data show the solubility of Hyp increasing in the order BSA, HSA, and RSA. Molecular modeling was used to construct the detailed structural models of the complexes and to explain the differences in the binding properties of Hyp. It was shown that the structures of Hyp/HSA and Hyp/RSA complexes are more similar and in some aspects different from those found for the Hyp/BSA complex. The role of the amino acid sequence in the IIA subdomains of HSA, RSA, and BSA is discussed to explain the observed differences. 3amodels 3aamino acid sequences 3ahydrogen bonding 3aHypericum 3abovine serum albumin 0aprotein structure 0aserum albumin 0amolecular modeling 0aligand binding 0achemical structure1 aKascakova, S.1 aUlicny, J.1 aMiskovsky, P.0 tBiopolymers.g2002, v. 67, no. 4/5 p.251-254x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03345naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245008600170300001600256500011100272520194100383650001302324650001002337650002102347650001202368650001202380650001102392650001402403650001502417650001302432650002402445650001102469650002102480650002602501650002202527650001202549650001002561650001802571651001002589651001002599651001002609651001802619700001702637773014502654856005502799852000902854655001202863IND60568381820221119120554.0170508e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056838182DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1143.422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahajan, V.10aBreeding white onion varieties for processing under short day conditions of India  ap. 303-310.  aPaper presented at the VII International Symposium on Edible Alliaceae held May 21-25, 2015, Nigde, Turkey  aIndia is second largest producer of onion in the world after China. The world trade of processed onion is more than 200,000 t. USA, China, India, and Egypt are the leaders in onion processing. India though started late in processing, is gaining momentum. About 60 big to medium processing plants were established and still more are coming up in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan which are competing in world market. Some of the Women Self Help groups also started processing of onion at small scale. Indian export of processed onion has increased from 4124 to 59134 t over last ten years. India has got special advantage being located in tropics as onion produced in tropical countries has got high pungency and flavor, which adds to processed products also. Present day processing industry is suffering from non availability of high TSS white onion varieties, irregular year round supply, poor seed supply, high post harvest losses, etc. There is need for averting the situation. Coordinated efforts of scientific research, Processing and Agriculture Ministry, processing units, progressive entrepreneurs and farmers have taken up a momentum in India. Some of the short day white onion varieties were developed by various research organizations in the country but they do not offer TSS range more than 12%. Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research has started research programme since last thirteen years for the development of high TSS white onion variety from available germplasm. In the year 2000 about 7199 bulbs were examined for TSS range. Only 2.72% bulbs recorded TSS more than 14%. 109 bulbs offering TSS range from 15 to 23% were selfed and populations were developed. After rejecting poor performing populations, 10 populations having 16 to 19% TSS are advanced. It would be possible to develop short day high TSS open pollinated varieties within 2 to 3 years time suitable for rabi and late kharif seasons. 3abreeding 3abulbs 3aentrepreneurship 3aexports 3afarmers 3aflavor 3agermplasm 3agovernance 3aindustry 3ainternational trade 3aonions 3aopen pollination 3aresearch institutions 3aresearch programs 3atropics 3awomen 3aworld markets 3aChina 3aEgypt 3aIndia 3aUnited States1 aGupta, A.

Furthermore, the assumptions and conclusions in previous 17O-NMR studies on the detection of discrete conformational states in peptides (V. Tsikaris et al., Biopolymers, 2000, Vol. 53, pp. 135-139) are reconsidered. Consistent examination of the method demonstrates that although 17O shieldings of peptide oxygens are very sensitive to hydrogen bonding interactions, the 17O-NMR shielding time scale is not advantageous compared to that of 1H-NMR, and thus it is not suitable for the detection of discrete hydrogen-bonded conformational states in peptides. 17O-NMR spectroscopy is prone to interpretation errors due to the formation of 17O-labeled impurities during the synthetic procedures (A. Steinschneider et al., International Journal of Peptide and Protein Research, 1981, Vol. 18, pp. 324-333). 3apeptides 3amolecular conformation 3ahydrogen bonding 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aOxygen Isotopes 2aPeptidesxchemistry 2aProtein Conformation 2aProteinsxchemistry0 tBiopolymers.g2001 Sept., v. 59, no. 3 p.125-130x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01928naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245007300168300001600241500002400257520115800281650001901439650001201458650001001470650002101480773009701501852000901598856005501607655001201662IND4407663020221119120427.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440766302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2338.2008.01222.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, P.10aDevelopment of National Reference Laboratories in the European Union  ap. 195-197.  aIncludes references  aSince 2004 discussions on the need for greater international co-operation and coordination between diagnostic laboratories have taken place at several meetings of the EU Heads of National Plant Protection Organisations (NPPOs) and of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO).

The meeting was attended by representatives from 13 Member States. The experts discussed the issues broadly and very actively and it was possible to elaborate an agreed Guidance Paper containing the main elements for the establishment of NRLs, including a priority list of individual pests for which such laboratories are needed. At their meeting in December 2007, the EU Heads of the NPPOs supported the establishment of NRLs as far as possible and where necessary.

The effects of substrate structure on halolactonization reactions and the interaction of those effects with the effects of catalyst structure have been investigated, leading to synthetically useful improvements in cyclization selectivity. The knowledge acquired was applied to the development of Lewis base catalyzed bromo- and iodocycloetherification reactions. The ability of some of the surveyed catalysts to influence the cyclization selectivity of halolactonization reactions demonstrates their presence in the transition structure of the product-determining cyclization step. This observation implies that chiral derivatives of these catalysts have the potential to provide enantioenriched products regardless of the rates or mechanisms of halonium ion racemization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3aenantiomers 3aenzyme substrates1 aBurk, Matthew T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 30, v. 107, no. 48 p.20655-20660dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10052961073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02827naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245009100204300002000295506007600315520148400391506003701875650002101912650001301933650001301946650001501959650002801974650001802002650002802020650001002048650001302058700002302071700002002094700002202114773017602136852000902312856008302321946001302404655001202417IND4445968220221207113346.0101203e20101130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444596822DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10138931072doi7 aPMC29964172pmcid7 a210599272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsteens, David10aForce-induced formation and propagation of adhesion nanodomains in living fungal cells  ap. 20744-20749.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding how cell adhesion proteins form adhesion domains is a key challenge in cell biology. Here, we use single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) to demonstrate the force-induced formation and propagation of adhesion nanodomains in living fungal cells, focusing on the covalently anchored cell-wall protein Als5p from Candida albicans. We show that pulling on single adhesins with AFM tips terminated with specific antibodies triggers the formation of adhesion domains of 100-500 nm and that the force-induced nanodomains propagate over the entire cell surface. Control experiments (with cells lacking Als5p, single-site mutation in the protein, bare tips, and tips modified with irrelevant antibodies) demonstrate that Als5p nanodomains result from protein redistribution triggered by force-induced conformational changes in the initially probed proteins, rather than from nonspecific cell-wall perturbations. Als5p remodeling is independent of cellular metabolic activity because heat-killed cells show the same behavior as live cells. Using AFM and fluorescence microscopy, we also find that nanodomains are formed within ~30 min and migrate at a speed of ~20 nm·min⁻¹, indicating that domain formation and propagation are slow, time-dependent processes. These results demonstrate that mechanical stimuli can trigger adhesion nanodomains in fungal cells and suggest that the force-induced clustering of adhesins may be a mechanism for activating cell adhesion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aadhesins 3aadhesion 3aantibodies 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell adhesion 3afluorescence microscopy 3afungi 3amutation1 aGarcia, Melissa C.1 aLipke, Peter N.1 aDufrêne, Yves F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 30, v. 107, no. 48 p.20744-20749dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10138931073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02561naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245005600202300002000258506007600278520125600354506003701610650002201647650002501669650001101694650001401705650002101719650001101740650001701751650001301768700002201781700002301803700002401826700002001850773017601870852000902046856008302055946001302138655001202151IND4445968020221207113340.0101203e20101130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444596802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10076021072doi7 aPMC29964482pmcid7 a210683712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Neil P.10aStructure and folding of a designed knotted protein  ap. 20732-20737.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA very small number of natural proteins have folded configurations in which the polypeptide backbone is knotted. Relatively little is known about the folding energy landscapes of such proteins, or how they have evolved. We explore those questions here by designing a unique knotted protein structure. Biophysical characterization and X-ray crystal structure determination show that the designed protein folds to the intended configuration, tying itself in a knot in the process, and that it folds reversibly. The protein folds to its native, knotted configuration approximately 20 times more slowly than a control protein, which was designed to have a similar tertiary structure but to be unknotted. Preliminary kinetic experiments suggest a complicated folding mechanism, providing opportunities for further characterization. The findings illustrate a situation where a protein is able to successfully traverse a complex folding energy landscape, though the amino acid sequence of the protein has not been subjected to evolutionary pressure for that ability. The success of the design strategy--connecting two monomers of an intertwined homodimer into a single protein chain--supports a model for evolution of knotted structures via gene duplication.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamino acid sequences 3aenergy 3aevolution 3agene duplication 3amodels 3apolypeptides 3aproteins1 aJacobitz, Alex W.1 aSawaya, Michael R.1 aGoldschmidt, Lukasz1 aYeates, Todd O.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 30, v. 107, no. 48 p.20732-20737dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10076021073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03412naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245009300204300002000297506007600317520169600393506003702089650002202126650001302148650001002161650001202171650001902183650001202202650001802214650001602232650002502248650001402273650001602287650002402303650001802327650001802345650001302363651002102376700001702397700002002414700003102434700001902465700002402484700002302508700002402531700002202555773017602577852000902753856008302762946001302845655001202858IND4445968520221207101534.0101203e20101130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444596852DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10069681072doi7 aPMC29964502pmcid7 a210683742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilver, Mary W.10aToxic diatoms and domoic acid in natural and iron enriched waters of the oceanic Pacific  ap. 20762-20767.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNear-surface waters ranging from the Pacific subarctic (58°N) to the Southern Ocean (66°S) contain the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), associated with the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia. Of the 35 stations sampled, including ones from historic iron fertilization experiments (SOFeX, IronEx II), we found Pseudo-nitzschia at 34 stations and DA measurable at 14 of the 26 stations analyzed for DA. Toxin ranged from 0.3 fg·cell⁻¹ to 2 pg·cell⁻¹, comparable with levels found in similar-sized cells from coastal waters. In the western subarctic, descent of intact Pseudo-nitzschia likely delivered significant amounts of toxin (up to 4 μg of DA·m⁻²·d⁻¹) to underlying mesopelagic waters (150-500 m). By reexamining phytoplankton samples from SOFeX and IronEx II, we found substantial amounts of DA associated with Pseudo-nitzschia. Indeed, at SOFeX in the Antarctic Pacific, DA reached 220 ng·L⁻¹, levels at which animal mortalities have occurred on continental shelves. Iron ocean fertilization also occurs naturally and may have promoted blooms of these ubiquitous algae over previous glacial cycles during deposition of iron-rich aerosols. Thus, the neurotoxin DA occurs both in coastal and oceanic waters, and its concentration, associated with changes in Pseudo-nitzschia abundance, likely varies naturally with climate cycles, as well as with artificial iron fertilization. Given that iron fertilization in iron-depleted regions of the sea has been proposed to enhance phytoplankton growth and, thereby, both reduce atmospheric CO₂ and moderate ocean acidification in surface waters, consideration of the potentially serious ecosystem impacts associated with DA is prudent.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillariophyceae 3aaerosols 3aalgae 3aanimals 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3acoastal water 3adomoic acid 3aenvironmental impact 3amortality 3aneurotoxins 3aocean acidification 3aphytoplankton 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3aAntarctic region1 aBargu, Sibel1 aCoale, Susan L.1 aBenitez-Nelson, Claudia R.1 aGarcia, Ana C.1 aRoberts, Kathryn J.1 aSekula-Wood, Emily1 aBruland, Kenneth W.1 aCoale, Kenneth H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 30, v. 107, no. 48 p.20762-20767dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10069681073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02899naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245013000201300002000331506007600351520155900427506003701986650001302023650001602036650001402052650001502066650001402081650002302095650001602118650001102134700001802145700001602163700001602179700001302195773017602208852000902384856008302393946001302476655001202489IND4445966120221207113644.0101203e20101130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444596612DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10044391072doi7 aPMC29964212pmcid7 a205668892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongming10aElucidation of the active conformation of cinchona alkaloid catalyst and chemical mechanism of alcoholysis of meso anhydrides  ap. 20625-20629.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aComplementary to enantioselective transformations of planar functionalities, catalytic desymmetrization of meso compounds is another fundamentally important strategy for asymmetric synthesis. However, experimentally established stereochemical models on how a chiral catalyst discriminates between two enantiotopic functional groups in the desymmetrization of a meso substrate are particularly lacking. This article describes our endeavor to elucidate the chemical mechanism and characterization of the active conformation of the cinchona alkaloid-derived catalyst for a desymmetrization of meso cyclic anhydrides via asymmetric alcoholysis. First, our kinetic studies indicate that the cinchona alkaloid-catalyzed alcoholysis proceeds by a general base catalysis mechanism. Furthermore, the active conformer of the cinchona alkaloid-derived catalyst DHQD-PHN was clarified by catalyst conformation studies with a designed, rigid cinchona alkaloid derivative as a probe. These key mechanistic insights enabled us to construct a stereochemical model to rationalize how DHQD-PHN differentiates the two enantiotopic carbonyl groups in the transition state of the asymmetric alcoholysis of meso cyclic anhydrides. This model not only is consistent with the sense of asymmetric induction of the asymmetric alcoholysis but also provides a rationale on how the catalyst tolerates a broad range of cyclic anhydrides. These mechanistic insights further guided us to develop a novel practical catalyst for the enantioselective alcoholysis of meso cyclic anhydrides.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCinchona 3aalcoholysis 3aalkaloids 3aanhydrides 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenantiomers 3amodels1 aLiu, Xiaofeng1 aWu, Fanghui1 aTang, Liang1 aDeng, Li0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 30, v. 107, no. 48 p.20625-20629dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10044391073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02834naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010400180300001600284500002400300520115600324650001401480650001601494650001401510650002601524650002401550650001501574650001701589650001201606650002401618650002101642650004601663650003401709650003501743650003301778650000901811650001501820650002201835650003701857650003801894650005201932651001801984700001402002700001302016700001702029700001102046700001202057773012902069852000902198856008502207655001202292IND4435587420221119114253.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443558742DNAL7 a202131932pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-010-9944-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, W.

Here we present the primary structure of a second subunit of the complex and present genetic and functional analyses. The TCP1 beta amino acid sequence, predicted from the cloned gene, bears 35% identity to TCP1, termed here TCP1 alpha, containing the same highly conserved residues found in the collective sequence of chaperonins. The predicted product was identified as the fastest-migrating species of the TCP1 complex purified from soluble extracts of yeast. The TCP1 beta gene, like TCP1 alpha, is essential. Strains containing lethal disruptions of either gene could not be rescued by additional copies of the other. Spores bearing disruption of either gene germinated as single, large-budded cells. Similarly, large-budded cells were observed following shift to 37 degrees C of strains carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in either TCP1 alpha or TCP1 beta. The arrested cells contained replicated DNA present in single nuclear masses, associated with abnormal tubulin staining patterns, supporting the assertion that mitotic spindle formation and function are impaired. We conclude that TCP1 beta supplies an essential function that partially overlaps with that of TCP1 alpha in acting as a molecular chaperone in tubulin and spindle biogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3astructural genes 3aproteins 3anucleotide sequences 3amutagenesis 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x77675 0amitotic spindle1 aCaplan, S.1 aMertens, D.1 aHynes, G.1 aPitluk, Z.1 aKashi, Y.1 aHarrison-Lavoie, K.1 aStevenson, S.1 aBrown, C.1 aBarrell, B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Mar. 29, v. 91, no. 7 p.2743-2747x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.7.27433Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03519naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001800180245015600198300001800354500001500372506007600387520157700463506003702040650001902077650001202096650001402108650001202122650002802134650002402162650001202186650002702198650003102225650004002256650001102296650003502307650004502342650002802387650002602415650007402441653001502515653001702530653001102547653001602558653001902574653001202593700001502605700001702620773014202637852000902779856008202788930003302870945001302903946001302916655001202929IND2040680720221207112915.0940706e19940329dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204068072DNAL7 a81461912pmid7 aPMC434542pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.7.27812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatunis, E.L.10aEssential role for a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleopro tein (hnRNP) in oogenesis: hrp40 is absent from the germ line in the dorsoventral mutant squid  ap. 2781-2784.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Drosophila melanogaster hrp40 proteins are abundant nuclear pre-mRNA-binding proteins that are similar to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A/B proteins of vertebrates. Recently, hrp40 has been shown to be encoded by the squid gene, which is required for dorsoventral axis formation during oogenesis. Eggs and embryos from homozygous squid mothers are severely dorsalized, and complete deletion of the squid gene results in lethality. Here we have examined the expression and localization of hrp40 in wild-type and squid mutant ovaries. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for hrp40, the same isoforms of hrp40 are detected in both wild-type and squid ovaries, but the amount of hrp40 is reduced in squid ovaries. Furthermore, immunolocalization of hrp40 in wild-type egg chambers shows that hrp40 is present in the nurse cells, oocyte, and follicle cells. In contrast, in squid mutant egg chambers, hrp40 is absent from the germ-line-derived nurse cells and oocyte, but it is detected in the somatic follicle cells. The absence of hrp40 from the germ-line-derived cells of developing egg chambers is likely to lead to the striking dorsalized phenotype of squid eggs. In addition, dramatic stage-specific changes in the cellular localization of hrp40 are seen; the protein found in the nurse cell nuclei during early stages of oogenesis migrates to the cytoplasm at later stages. These findings reveal dynamic patterns of expression and localization of hnRNP proteins during development and provide evidence for an essential role for hnRNP proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anucleoproteins 3aoocytes 3aoogenesis 3amutants 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aDecapodiformesxembryology 2aDrosophila melanogasterxembryology 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHeterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOogenesisxphysiology 2aRibonucleoproteinsximmunologyxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 0agerm cells 0aegg chambers 0anuclei 0anurse cells 0afollicle cells 0aovaries1 aKelley, R.1 aDreyfuss, G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Mar. 29, v. 91, no. 7 p.2781-2784x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.7.27813Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02493naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245006000189300001600249500002400265520120200289650003001491650001401521650001901535650001601554650001601570650001001586650002701596650002901623650002401652650001101676650003901687651000901726651000901735700002701744700002101771700002701792700001701819773012901836852000901965856008501974655001202059IND4435587920221119114354.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443558792DNAL7 a203061732pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-010-9950-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesdaghinia, Alireza10aMonitoring of Fluoride in Groundwater Resources of Iran  ap. 432-437.  aIncludes references  aFluoride concentration in groundwater resources that used as the source of drinking water in urban areas of Iran was determined. All of the groundwater wells located in urban areas were monitored in 2008. Fluoride concentration of water samples was measured using SPADNS method. The nationwide mean fluoride concentration in the groundwater resources was found to be 0.47 ± 0.28 (± standard deviation) mg/L. Only in Bushehr Province, the provincial mean fluoride level in the groundwater resources was higher than the WHO guideline value of 1.5 mg/L (1.86 ± 0.86 mg/L). At nationwide level, the portion of extracted groundwater with fluoride concentration lower than the minimum permissible level of 0.5 mg/L, desirable fluoride range of 0.5-1.5 mg/L and elevated fluoride level was 69.2, 29.3 and 1.4%, respectively. In the areas with low fluoride content drinking water, it is recommended that fluoride is absorbed by use of high fluoride content foods and beverages. The recommendations for the circumstances with excessive fluoride content of drinking water are provision of drinking water from alternative sources and defluoridation of drinking water by point-of-use systems, respectively. 3aWorld Health Organization 3abeverages 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3aurban areas 3awells 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFluoridesxanalysis 2aHumans 2aWater Supplyxanalysisxstandards. 3aIran 0aIran1 aVaghefi, Kooshiar Azam1 aMontazeri, Ahmad1 aMohebbi, Mohammad Reza1 aSaeedi, Reza0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2010 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.432-437dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-010-9950-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02181naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245014500149300001800294300003200312500001500344520056400359650002300923650002200946650002600968650001700994650003001011650001601041650004401057650002801101650000901129650001801138650002201156650002101178650001101199650002901210650001801239650001601257650002201273650001901295653001901314653002601333653004301359653003401402700001901436700002401455773009701479852000901576939003301585945000801618946001301626655001201639991562943250742620221119114625.0800915e198005  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800023152DNAL7 a69892272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbraira, C.10aComparison of unmeasured versus exchange diabetic diets in lean adults.

The oral contraceptive time interaction is significant for glucose and insulin levels. The oral contraceptive users had higher peak levels of glucose and insulin and took longer to return to fasting levels. The glucose and insulin responses of the oral contraceptive users are greater on the sucrose than on the starch diet. The response of the insulin/glucagon ratio to the sucrose load is not significantly affected by oral contraceptive use. The occurrence of abnormal glucose tolerance tests with oral contraceptive use increases with a history of abnormal glucose metabolism, diabetes, delivery of a large infant, obesity, or older women with parity. 3aglucose tolerance 3aglucose 3asucrose 3ainsulin 3afemales 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aContraceptives, Oralxpharmacology 2aContraceptives, Oral, Syntheticxpharmacology 2aDiet 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aGlucagonxblood 2aHumans 2aInsulin 2aStarchxdiagnostic use. 2aSucrosexdiagnostic use. 2aTime Factors 2aTriticum 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0ametabolism 0acarbohydrate modifications 0aContraceptives, oral1 aMoser, Phylis B.1 aKelsay, June L.1 aPrather, Elizabeth S.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 May, v. 33, no. 5 p.1041-1048x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02039naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002400133245006800157300001800225300003200243520054000275650002700815650001600842650001100858650002300869650001300892650000900905650000900914650002800923650001000951650001200961650003100973650002801004650003501032650003801067650003701105650003401142650002201176650000901198650000901207650003601216653002601252700002301278700002701301700002101328773009701349852000901446939003301455945000801488946001301496655001201509991562940890742620221119114701.0800915e198005  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800023092DNAL7 a73691532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Peter W.F.14aThe effect of dietary copper and zinc on cholesterol metabolism  ap. 1019-1025.  ap. 1019-1025. ill., charts.  aDietary copper and zinc, at normal diet level mixes, are not significant factors in cholesterol metabolism.

Diets containing varying amounts of protein were administered to 4 patients in two 5-day periods. A protein-free diet resulted in decreased levels of all amino acids except tryptophan. The 75g protein diet increased plasma levels slightly during the day. Absolute concentrations of methionine, tyrosine and phenylalanine were significantly elevated over normal subjects. The plasma ratios were similar to those of normal subjects in response to increased protein ingestion. Overall plasma ratios for leucine, isoleucine and valine were below normal in cirrhotic patients. The implications are that uptake of several of the large amino acids by the brain may be altered. 3anutrient intake 3ahematologic tests 3aexperimental diets 3amales 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 3amethionine 3aphenylalanine 3aprotein metabolism 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aDietary Proteins 2aHepatic Encephalopathyxblood 2aHumans 2aIsoleucinexblood 2aLeucinexblood 2aLiver Cirrhosis, Alcoholicxblood 2aMale 2aMethioninexblood 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhenylalaninexblood 2aProlinexblood 2aSerinexblood 2aThreoninexblood 2aTryptophanxblood 2aTyrosinexblood 2aValinexblood 0aTime factors 0aamino acids 0acirrhosis1 aWurtman, Richard J.1 aHammarstrom-Wiklund, Birgitta.1 aRand, William M.1 aMunro, Hamish N.1 aDavidson, Charles S.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Sept., v. 32, no. 9 p.1923-1933x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02621naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100002100181245004500202300001800247500001500265506007600280520081700356506003701173650002701210650002101237650002201258650002201280650001601302650001901318650002301337650003501360650004901395650002001444650002201464650003301486650001301519650002801532653001801560653002901578653001401607653002601621700001601647700001601663700001501679700001501694700001401709700001501723773014201738852000901880856008301889930003301972945001302005946001302018655001202031IND2041647120221207105524.0940825e19940524dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204164712DNAL7 a81971892pmid7 aPMC439352pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.11.50802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchiedlmeier, B.10aNuclear transformation of Volvox carteri  ap. 5080-5084.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStable nuclear transformation of Volvox carteri was achieved using the cloned V. carteri nitA+ gene (which encodes nitrate reductase) to complement a nitA- mutation.

Thus, V. carteri becomes one of the simplest multicellular organisms that is accessible to detailed molecular studies of genes regulating cellular differentiation and morphogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3astructural genes 3anitrate reductase 3adirect DNA uptake 3aChlorophyta 3areporter genes 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCell Differentiationxgenetics 2aChlorophytaxcytologyxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGenetic Markers 2aNitrate Reductase 2aNitrate Reductasesxgenetics 2aPlasmids 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aChlorophycota 0abiolistic transformation 0anita gene 0agenetic recombination1 aSchmitt, R.1 aMüller, W.1 aKirk, M.M.1 aGruber, H.1 aMages, W.1 aKirk, D.L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 May 24, v. 91, no. 11 p.5080-5084x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.11.50803Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03139naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245009400207300002000301506007600321520161400397506003702011650002802048650002302076650001402099650001102113650001402124650001502138650001202153650001102165650001402176700001602190700002402206700001802230700002302248700002102271700002902292700002002321700001502341700002002356773017602376852000902552856008302561946001302644655001202657IND4448183620221207112617.0110126e20101221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444818362DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10065911072doi7 aPMC30098012pmcid7 a211272702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrodland, G.

Here we describe a unique approach, video force microscopy (VFM), that allows detailed, dynamic force maps to be produced from time-lapse images. The forces at work in an embryo are considered to be decomposed into active and passive elements, where active forces originate from contributions (e.g., actomyosin contraction) that do mechanical work to the system and passive ones (e.g., viscous cytoplasm) that dissipate energy. In the present analysis, the effects of all passive components are considered to be subsumed by an effective cytoplasmic viscosity, and the driving forces are resolved into equivalent forces along the edges of the polygonal boundaries into which the region of interest is divided. Advanced mathematical inverse methods are used to determine these driving forces. When applied to multiphoton sections of wild-type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster embryos, VFM is able to calculate the equivalent driving forces acting along individual cell edges and to do so with subminute temporal resolution. In the wild type, forces along the apical surface of the presumptive mesoderm are found to be large and to vary parabolically with time and angular position, whereas forces along the basal surface of the ectoderm, for example, are found to be smaller and nearly uniform with position. VFM shows that in mutants with reduced junction integrity and myosin II activity, the driving forces are reduced, thus accounting for ventral furrow failure.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aanimal development 3acytoplasm 3aenergy 3amechanics 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3amyosin 3aviscosity1 aConte, Vito1 aCranston, P.

DNA recognition and functional output is thought to be controlled by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the topoisomerase DNA binding subunit (GyrA/ParC). The deeply rooted organism Aquifex aeolicus encodes one type IIA topoisomerase conflictingly categorized as either DNA gyrase or topo IV. To resolve this enzyme's catalytic properties and heritage, we conducted a series of structural and biochemical studies on the isolated GyrA/ParC CTD and the holoenzyme. Whereas the CTD displays a global structure similar to that seen in bone fide GyrA and ParC paralogs, it lacks a key functional motif (the "GyrA-box") and fails to wrap DNA. Biochemical assays show that the A. aeolicus topoisomerase cannot supercoil DNA, but robustly removes supercoils and decatenates DNA, two hallmark activities of topo IV. Despite these properties, phylogenetic analyses place all functional domains except the CTD squarely within a gyrase lineage, and the A. aeolicus GyrB subunit is capable of supporting supercoiling with Escherichia coli GyrA, but not DNA relaxation with E. coli ParC. Moreover, swapping the A. aeolicus GyrA/ParC CTD with the GyrA CTD from Thermotoga maritima creates an enzyme that negatively supercoils DNA. These findings identify A. aeolicus as the first bacterial species yet found to exist without a functional gyrase, and suggest an evolutionary path for generation of bacterial type IIA paralogs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAquifex 3aDNA 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aEscherichia coli 3aThermotoga maritima 3abacteria 3achimerism 3achromosomes 3aphylogeny 3atopology1 aLerman, Jeffrey C.1 aBerger, James M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Dec. 21, v. 107, no. 51 p.22055-22059dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10129381073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03471naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001300154245008800167300001600255500011100271520216000382650002502542650001002567650001102577650001002588650001202598650001102610650001602621650000902637650001802646650000702664650002302671650002202694650003002716650001602746650001202762651002102774700001702795700001602812773014502828856005502973852000903028655001203037IND60568380820221119114720.0170508e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056838082DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1143.322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoca, I.10aSome physical and chemical characteristics of Taşköprü and Chinese black garlics  ap. 221-226.  aPaper presented at the VII International Symposium on Edible Alliaceae held May 21-25, 2015, Nigde, Turkey  aBlack garlic, also called aged garlic, is a type of fermented garlic used as a food ingredient in Asian cuisine. It's made by fermenting whole bulbs of garlic at high temperature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate suitability of Taşköprü and Chinese garlic for black garlic manufacture and determine the antioxidant properties of these products. Taşköprü and Chinese garlic were harvested at 2014 in Taşköprü (Kastamonu, Turkey). They were kept to produce black garlic at 60°C and 70-90% relative humidity for 45 days. In this study, the color, dry matter, pH, penetration resistance, total phenolics and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values of both raw and black garlics were recorded. The L*, a*, b*, dry matter, pH, total phenolics and FRAP values in Taşköprü raw garlics were found as 70.71±2.80,  -0.77±0.21, +23.77±0.55, 35.09±0.08%, 6.38±0.02, 294.73±11.61 mg GAE kg-1 and 640.76±86.98 µmol Fe2+ g-1, respectively, while these values in Taşköprü black garlic were found as 29.53±1.45, +1.18±0.12, +1.83±0.21, 86.52±0.52%, 4.89±0.03, 308.77±30.65 mg GAE kg-1 and 2266.75±417.62 µmol Fe2+ g-1, respectively. The parameters in Chinese raw garlics were found as 70.34±1.09, -0.30±0.05, +24.06±0.13, 36.73±0.46%, 6.43±0.03, 359.81±2.85 mg kg-1 and 678.20±77.56 µmol Fe2+ g-1, respectively, while these values in Chinese black garlics were found as 28.86±0.73, +1.43±0.26, +1.97±0.35, 83.67±0.76%, 4.64±0.10, 424.49±100.37 mg GAE kg-1 and 2304.18±162.21 µmol Fe2+ g-1, respectively. The penetration resistance of the cloves were measured by Texture Analyzer, and the results were found as 31.29±4.42 N in Taşköprü raw garlics, 22.57±11.07 N in Taşköprü black garlics, 21.03±3.90 N in Chinese raw garlics and 17.46±15.04 N in Chinese black garlics. Generally, the antioxidant power and total phenolic contents of Chinese black garlic were higher than the values of Taşköprü black garlic, but it wasn't statistically significant (P>0.05). There was no difference between the other parameters except dry matter and pH values of Taşköprü and Chinese black garlics (P>0.05). 3aantioxidant activity 3abulbs 3acloves 3acolor 3acuisine 3agarlic 3aingredients 3airon 3amanufacturing 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3arelative humidity 3aresistance to penetration 3atemperature 3atexture 3aTurkey (country)1 aTekguler, B.1 aKoca, A.

They were initially found as exoproducts of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and described as a mixture of four congeners: α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-β-hydroxydecanoyl-β-hydroxydecanoate (Rha-Rha-C₁₀-C₁₀), α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-β-hydroxydecanoate (Rha-Rha-C₁₀), as well as their mono-rhamnolipid congeners Rha-C₁₀-C₁₀ and Rha-C₁₀. The development of more sensitive analytical techniques has lead to the further discovery of a wide diversity of rhamnolipid congeners and homologues (about 60) that are produced at different concentrations by various Pseudomonas species and by bacteria belonging to other families, classes, or even phyla. For example, various Burkholderia species have been shown to produce rhamnolipids that have longer alkyl chains than those produced by P. aeruginosa. In P. aeruginosa, three genes, carried on two distinct operons, code for the enzymes responsible for the final steps of rhamnolipid synthesis: one operon carries the rhlAB genes and the other rhlC. Genes highly similar to rhlA, rhlB, and rhlC have also been found in various Burkholderia species but grouped within one putative operon, and they have been shown to be required for rhamnolipid production as well. The exact physiological function of these secondary metabolites is still unclear. Most identified activities are derived from the surface activity, wetting ability, detergency, and other amphipathic-related properties of these molecules. Indeed, rhamnolipids promote the uptake and biodegradation of poorly soluble substrates, act as immune modulators and virulence factors, have antimicrobial activities, and are involved in surface motility and in bacterial biofilm development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBurkholderia 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aanalytical methods 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacterial motility 3abiodegradation 3abiosurfactants 3aenzymes 3aoperon 3asecondary metabolites 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGlycolipidsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Structure 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemistry1 aLépine, François.1 aDéziel, Eric0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 86, no. 5 p.1323-1336dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2498-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02962naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245014300184300001400327500002400341520118800365650001501553650001401568650001001582650002601592650000901618650002701627650001301654650001301667650001001680650001001690650003301700650003301733650004001766650002701806650002301833650004901856650001201905650002101917650003201938650003101970650002302001650003702024650002302061700002202084700002302106700002302129700002102152700002102173700002202194700001902216773008002235852000902315856004802324655001202372IND4429024820221119114725.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442902482DNAL7 a198209632pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-009-1027-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumur, Jérôme10aHomoeologous recombination within bread wheat to develop novel combinations of HMW-GS genes: transfer of the Glu-A1 locus to chromosome 1D  ap. 57-65.  aIncludes references  aIn an attempt to improve the bread-making quality within hexaploid wheat by elaborating novel high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) combinations useful in wheat-breeding programmes, a 1A chromosome fragment carrying the Glu-A1 locus encoding the subunit Ax2*, was translocated to the long arm of chromosome 1D. The partially isohomoeoallelic line, designated RR239, had a meiotic behaviour as regular as cv. Courtot. It was characterised using genomic in situ hybridization and microsatellite markers as well as biochemical and proteomic approaches. The translocated 1D chromosome had an interstitial 1AL segment representing in average 30% of the recombinant arm length that was confirmed by molecular analysis. The genetic length of the removed segment in chromosome 1DL was estimated to be at least 51 cM, and that of the interstitial 1AL translocation to be at least 33 cM. Proteome analysis performed on total endosperm proteins revealed variation in amounts, 8 spots and 1 spot being up- and downregulated, respectively. Quantitative variations in HMW-GS were observed for the Glu-A1 (Ax2*) and Glu-B1 (Bx7 + By8) loci in response to duplication of the Glu-A1 locus. 3abiomarkers 3aendosperm 3agenes 3ain situ hybridization 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aproteins 3aproteome 3awheat 2aBread 2aChromosome Pairingxgenetics 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGenetic Locixgenetics 2aGenetic Techniques 2aGlutensxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMeiosis 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aProtein Subunitsxgenetics 2aProteomexanalysis 2aRecombination, Geneticxgenetics 2aTriticumxgenetics1 aBranlard, Gérard1 aTanguy, Anne-Marie1 aDardevet, Mireille1 aCoriton, Olivier1 aHuteau, Virginie1 aLemoine, Jocelyne1 aJahier, Joseph0 tPlanta.g2009 Dec., v. 231, no. 1 p.57-65dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-1027-y 7aarticle02868naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245014000172300001600312500011100328520159300439650001602032650001102048650001002059650001302069650001402082650001102096650002402107650001402131650001102145650001302156650002502169651001002194700001702204700002302221700001702244773014502261856005502406852000902461655001202470IND60568380320221119114631.0170508e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056838032DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1143.272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorole, V.

Treatments were essentially recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) (T1), 75% RDF + 2 t ha-1 compost (T2), 50% RDF + 4 t ha-1 compost (T3), 25% RDF + 6 t ha-1 compost (T4), 8 t  ha-1 compost (T5), 75% RDF + 2 t ha-1 Biogas slurry (T6), 50% RDF + 4 t ha-1 Biogas slurry (T7), 25% RDF + 6 t ha-1 Biogas slurry (T8), 8 t ha-1 Biogas slurry (T9) and 10 t ha-1 Biogas slurry (T10). Half of these were applied as basal dose (at transplanting), 25% were applied 30 days after transplanting (DAT) and remaining 25%, 45 DAT. This experiment was carried out using Randomized Block Design (RBD) with three replications. White onion cultivar 'JISL-5' used in this study possesses high solids and is being used for dehydration. The results revealed that there were significant differences (p<0.05) in average bulb yield, bulb weight, average total soluble solids (TSS). Highest yield (16.98 t ha-1) was obtained from the plot treated with inorganic fertilizers (T1) followed by T6 (13.957 t ha-1), T10 (13.491 t ha-1) and T7 (13.329 t ha-1). Lowest yield was obtained in the treatment T4 (5.409 t ha-1). The inorganic fertilizers appear to have compensated with slow release of nutrients from the biogas slurry and their combined effects may have increased the yield. There were no significant differences in growth parameters such as plant height and number of leaves. 3aAllium cepa 3abiogas 3abulbs 3acomposts 3acultivars 3aleaves 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrients 3aonions 3aslurries 3atotal soluble solids 3aIndia1 aDhake, A.

The current work aim was to characterize GarV-D biologically and molecularly and estimate its effect on garlic yields. Virion modal lengths were calculated by comparison of 136 viral particles and estimated in 734 nm. Total RNA from a sample was extracted and sent for sequencing (HiSeq 1500 Illumina). The contig comparison based on GenBank showed the presence of a 8,418 nucleotides (nt) sequence corresponding to a GarV-D isolate. The comparison of replicase and coat protein gen with other GarV-D isolates showed 83.4 to 93.3% and 86.5 to 89.1% nt identity respectively. Yield of virus-free garlic, garlic only infected with GarV-D and plants infected with a viral mixture was evaluated in assays under anti aphid cages and in field. At the end of the growth cycle, significant differences in weight and cloves number of garlic bulbs cultivated in field were observed. The garlic infected with GarV-D isolate showed a reduction of 12.3% of weight, 6.7% of bulb caliber and 40.2% of number of cloves when compared with healthy garlics. Some plants of the virus-free and GarV-D isolated treatments maintained in the field showed infections with other viruses (OYDV, LYSV) which could have affected their yield. This situation may indicate that when GarV-D is isolated, no yield damage is produced, however when combined with others (as it happened with plants in field) synergic effect occurs and damage is more significant. 3aAphidoidea 3aCarlavirus 3aGarlic virus D 3aPotyvirus 3aRNA 3abulbs 3acages 3acloves 3acoat proteins 3acrop yield 3agarlic 3anucleotides 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3asynergism 3avirion 3aviruses1 aPerotto, M.

The unit, kinetic energy of throughfall (J m⁻² mm⁻¹), was found to be constant and independent of rainfall intensity, indicating that splash detachment can be related to both throughfall intensity and soil slope. The linear correlation coefficient was highly significant for both the maximum throughfall intensity over 1 h (RI₁h) and the average splash detachment of all splash cups, although individual cups varied widely. No consistent relationship was found between the splash detachment rate and slope angle for individual periods. This variation in the relationship between splash detachment and slope angle was attributed to the effect of soil crusting and ponding on splash detachment. Splash detachment on a gentler slope (14° ) exhibited a strong relationship with the maximum throughfall intensity lasting for short periods of 10-30 min. In contrast, the splash detachment from slopes > 35° highly correlated with the maximum throughfall intensity over 3 h. This suggests that a longer period is required to prevent the splash detachment due to ponded water on steeper slopes. On gentler slopes, prolonged rainfall may result in a higher ponding depth, thereby reducing raindrop impact and causing less splash detachment. Thus, under forest canopies, the effect of slope angle on the rainfall parameter should be incorporated into future splash erosion models. 3aenergy 3aforest canopy 3aforest plantations 3arain 3arain intensity 3araindrop impact 3asoil crusts 3asoil erosion models 3asplash erosion 3athroughfall 3aJapan1 aNanko, Kazuki1 aOnda, Yūichi.0 tHydrological processes.g2010 Feb. 28, v. 24, no. 5 p.576-587dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7552 7aarticle03186naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001700180245014700197300001800344506007600362520104500438506003701483650002901520650002501549650001501574650002601589650004201615650001801657650003001675650002701705650001501732650003701747650003201784650003001816650002801846650002001874650002901894650003801923650003601961650003101997650003802028650003202066650002702098653001702125653003102142700001902173700001702192700002002209700001902229700002002248773014202268852000902410856008202419930003302501945001302534946001302547655001202560IND2040906720221207105519.0940719e19940426dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204090672DNAL7 a81710142pmid7 aPMC436952pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.9.39262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBardwell, L.10aYeast RAD3 protein binds directly to both SSL2 and SSL1 proteins: implications for the structure and function of transcription/repair factor b  ap. 3926-3930.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe RAD3 and SSL2 gene products are essential proteins that are also required for the nucleotide excision repair pathway. We have recently demonstrated that the RAD3 gene product along with the SSL1 and TFB1 gene products are subunits of RNA polymerase H basal transcription factor b. Additionally, the SSL2 gene product physically interacts with purified factor b. Here we combine an in vitro immunoprecipitation assay and an in vivo genetic assay to demonstrate a series of pairwise protein-protein interactions involving these components. RAD3 protein binds directly to both SSL2 protein and SSL1 protein in vivo. SSL1 protein interacts with itself and with RAD3 and TFB1 proteins in living yeast cells. An N-terminal, possibly noncatalytic, domain of SSL2 protein is sufficient for the factor b-SSL2 interaction, and a product of a DNA repair-defective allele of SSL2 is not defective in binding to factor b. We present genetic evidence suggesting that the DNA-repair function of SSL2 protein is not dependent on its essential function.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aDNA repair 3atranscription factors 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxmetabolism 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Helicasesxmetabolism 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aDNA Repair 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Binding 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTranscription Factor TFIIH 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscription Factors, TFII 2aTranscription, Genetic 0ainteractions 0anucleotide excision repair1 aBardwell, A.J.1 aFeaver, W.J.1 aSvejstrup, J.Q.1 aKornberg, R.D.1 aFriedberg, E.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Apr. 26, v. 91, no. 9 p.3926-3930x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.9.39263Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02504naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245008000170300001200250500015900262520140700421650001301828650001601841650003501857650002301892650002601915650001501941650002001956650001301976773013801989856005402127852000902181655001202190IND60568382620221119114347.0170508e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056838262DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1144.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMannella, L.10aScience and social media: how to avoid feeding the troll and save your time  ap. 1-6.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Postharvest Pathology: Using Science to Increase Food Availability held June 7-11, 2015, Bari, Italy  aScientists are committed to face many issues in postharvest pathology and food safety, thus we wonder how they have ended up in dealing with internet trolls too. A troll being a person who overruns social media and websites' comments section with taunting and offensive content, the scientific community has quickly become a typical target of trolling. On the other hand, social media have turned into a thriving environment suitable for scientist-to-scientist and scientist-to-public communication. Facebook, Twitter and Google+ gather hundreds of millions of users worldwide, including scientists and science students, while ResearchGate, LinkedIn and other online services have evolved into professional tools for researchers. Moreover, social media can also help scientists debunk fake news, disseminate clear scientific knowledge and support debates over key issues of public interest (e.g., GMOs, organic agriculture and food safety). Indeed, public discussion on social media is no more a “one-way” interaction. A social media user can freely interact with public profiles of research institutions and scientists, urging them to build a solid online presence to communicate science. Therefore, researchers should pay great attention to the management of social media, although it is a time-consuming task. Eventually, how are scientists going to cope with social media and benefit from them? 3aInternet 3afood safety 3agenetically modified organisms 3aorganic production 3aresearch institutions 3ascientists 3asocial networks 3astudents0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 June, , no. 1144 p.1-6dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1144.1  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011900173300001400292500015900306520185300465650002502318650004102343650001102384650001802395650002302413650002402436650001702460650001502477650001002492650001402502650001202516650001402528650001402542650001302556650001302569650001502582650002802597650001202625650002902637650001402666700001902680700001402699700001602713700001402729700001402743700001502757773014002772856005402912852000902966655001202975IND60568382820221119114255.0170508e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056838282DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1144.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuron-Moles, G.10aProteomic and oxi-proteomic response of apple to a compatible (P. expansum) and a non-host (P. digitatum) pathogen  ap. 17-28.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Postharvest Pathology: Using Science to Increase Food Availability held June 7-11, 2015, Bari, Italy  aDespite the current use of chemical fungicides, Penicillium expansum still is one of the most devastating pathogens of pome fruit. In particular, P. expansum enters tissues through wounds causing large economic losses worldwide. To obtain new rational and environmental friendly control alternatives, it is fundamental to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the fruit defence responses and the pathogen virulence factors. The main objective of this work was to examine the protein abundance changes (proteome), as well as the protein carbonylation formed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (oxi-proteome) in 'Golden Smoothee' apple in response to wounding, P. expansum (compatible) and P. digitatum (non-host) pathogen. In addition, we evaluated the correlation between the transcript and protein abundances of six genes involved in wound and pathogen responses. Our results identified 26 proteins whose abundance changed in response to both abiotic and biotic stress. While many of these changes are constitutively observed in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, other proteins, as Mal d 1.03E and EF-Tu, were specifically induced in response to the non-host pathogen. Using our protein carbonyl detection method based on fluorescent Bodipy, we also identified 27 proteins as sensitive ROS targets (oxidized). In fact, ACC oxidase and two glutamine synthetases showed the highest protein oxidation level in response to P. digitatum infection. Finally, only one of the six studied genes showed a significant correlation at the transcript and protein level: Mal d 1.03E. This result supports the idea that studies only based on transcriptional changes may provide a partial view of the fruit response against external stresses. This methodology gives valuable information on how impaired protein functions affect fruit defense mechanisms. 3aPenicillium expansum 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3aapples 3abiotic stress 3adefense mechanisms 3afinancial economics 3afluorescence 3afungicides 3agenes 3aglutamine 3aligases 3aoxidation 3apathogens 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3areactive oxygen species 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence1 aWisniewski, M.1 aVinas, I.1 aTeixido, N.1 aUsall, J.1 aDroby, S.1 aTorres, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 June, , no. 1144 p.17-28dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1144.3  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245013000189300001600319500002400335520063000359650001200989650002001001650001201021650001901033650001301052650001101065650001201076650001401088650001101102650000901113650003501122650004501157650003601202650001601238650002301254650005401277651001101331651001801342651001101360651001801371700002401389700002701413773012901440852000901569856008501578655001201663IND4435589020221119114342.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443558902DNAL7 a203521842pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-010-9966-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscobar-Sánchez, O.10aMercury and Selenium Bioaccumulation in the Smooth Hammerhead Shark, Sphyrna zygaena Linnaeus, from the Mexican Pacific Ocean  ap. 488-491.  aIncludes references  aWe analyzed total mercury and selenium bioaccumulation in muscle tissue and cartilage fibers (fins) from smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena, caught off Baja California Sur, Mexico.

Activity of phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT; gene, bar; one cysteine) expressed under control of the TR1' or 35S promoter was not similarly affected, thus excluding a redox modulation of transcription as the mechanism of NPTII activation by dithiothreitol. Western-blot analyses showed an increase in the amount of protein in response to dithiothreitol, whereas neither the steady-state level of NFTII mRNA nor the specific activity of the purified enzyme was affected. The same type of modulation was observed for transiently expressed beta-glucuronidase nine cysteines) produced from a fusion with the 35S promoter, with or without a signal peptide. Limitation of cotranslational and/or early posttranslational steps by excessively oxidizing sulfhydryl/disulfide redox potentials is postulated to explain the low net accumulation of cysteine-rich proteins of bacterial origin (i.e., NPTII and beta-glucuronidase) when expressed in plant protoplasts, and the marked increase in such proteins in response to externally added dithiothreitol.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3aprotoplasts 3aredox potential 3arecombinant DNA 3aphosphinothricin acetyltransferase 3akanamycin kinase 3adithiothreitol 3agene expression 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3aenzyme activity 3athiols 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aCells, Cultured 2aCysteine 2aDithiothreitolxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aKanamycin Kinase 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)xchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistry 2aTobacco 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 0aorganic sulfur compounds 0agenetic regulation 0aneo gene 0abar gene 0aacyltransferases1 aGarcia-Olmedo, F.1 aDiaz, I.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Apr. 26, v. 91, no. 9 p.3867-3871x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.9.38673Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03195naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245011200187300001800299500002400317520130500341650001701646650001601663650002501679650002601704650001801730650002101748650002201769650001201791650001701803650001501820650001301835650000901848650002401857650001401881650001101895650002401906650002801930650002501958650003801983650003102021650002602052650001802078650006602096650001402162650001602176650002102192650002402213650003302237650002502270650002602295650002702321700002502348773011402373852000902487856008502496655001202581IND4435633020221119114223.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443563302DNAL7 a203061882pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-010-2529-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakushi, Toshiharu10aAlcohol dehydrogenase of acetic acid bacteria: structure, mode of action, and applications in biotechnology  ap. 1257-1265.  aIncludes references  aPyrroquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PQQ-ADH) of acetic acid bacteria is a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the acetic acid fermentation by oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde coupling with reduction of membranous ubiquinone (Q), which is, in turn, re-oxidized by ubiquinol oxidase, reducing oxygen to water. PQQ-ADHs seem to have co-evolved with the organisms fitting to their own habitats. The enzyme consists of three subunits and has a pyrroloquinoline quinone, 4 heme c moieties, and a tightly bound Q as the electron transfer mediators. Biochemical, genetic, and electrochemical studies have revealed the unique properties of PQQ-ADH since it was purified in 1978. The enzyme is unique to have ubiquinol oxidation activity in addition to Q reduction. This mini-review focuses on the molecular properties of PQQ-ADH, such as the roles of the subunits and the cofactors, particularly in intramolecular electron transport of the enzyme from ethanol to Q. Also, we summarize biotechnological applications of PQQ-ADH as to enantiospecific oxidations for production of the valuable chemicals and bioelectrocatalysis for sensors and fuel cells using indirect and direct electron transfer technologies and discuss unsolved issues and future prospects related to this elaborate enzyme. 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetic acid 3aacetic acid bacteria 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiotechnology 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afuel cells 3ahabitats 3aheme 3amechanism of action 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atechnology transfer 2aAcetic Acidxmetabolism 2aAlcoholsxmetabolism 2aBacteriaxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aBiosensing Techniques 2aBiotechnology 2aCarbohydrate Dehydrogenasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCatalysis 2aForecasting 2aHemexmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aProtein Subunitsxmetabolism 2aQuinonesxmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aUbiquinonexmetabolism1 aMatsushita, Kazunobu0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 86, no. 5 p.1257-1265dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2529-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03095naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245004900149300001500198520156200213650001801775650002001793650001401813650001301827650001601840650001301856650001101869650002401880650001201904650002301916650002701939650002701966650002701993650003002020650001202050650005602062650002802118650002502146650004402171650004602215650004502261653002802306653001202334653002202346653001402368700001302382700001502395773006302410852000902473930003302482945001302515946001302528655001202541IND2164070720221119114322.0980916s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216407072DNAL7 a92162462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeschemacher, H.10aMilk protein-derived opioid receptor ligands  ap. 99-117.  aMilk is a mammalian characteristic and is of particular importance for humans: Mother's milk or its substitutes from cows' milk are absolutely essential nutriments for the neonate and cows' milk also represents a basic foodstuff for adults. However, in addition to their well-known nutritive role, milk constituents apparently are also able to carry specific information from the milk producer's to the milk receiver's organism: Thus, a number of milk protein fragments has been shown to behave like opioid receptor ligands able to address opioidergic systems in the adult's or in the neonate's organism. With respect to the proteins, which they are derived off, these peptides have been named alpha-casein exorphins or casoxin D (alpha-casein), beta-casomorphins or beta-casorphin (beta-casein), casoxin or casoxin A, B, or C (kappa-casein), alpha-lactorphins (alpha-lactalbumin), (beta-lactorphin (beta-lactoglobulin) or lactoferroxins (lactoferrin). Only casoxins and lactoferroxins display antagonistic properties; the other peptides behave like opioid receptor agonists. Most of the information available so far has been collected about beta-casomorphins. These peptides obviously can be released from beta-casein in the adult's or in the neonate's organism, where they might elicit opioid effects in the frame of a regulatory role as "food hormones". Several synthetic beta-casomorphin derivatives have been shown to be highly specific and potent micro-type opioid receptor ligands which frequently have been used as standard tools in opioid research. 3amilk proteins 3aopioid peptides 3areceptors 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3aneonates 3aadults 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxchemistry 2aEndorphinsxmetabolism 2aLactalbuminxchemistry 2aLactoferrinxchemistry 2aLactoglobulinsxchemistry 2aLigands 2aMilk Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNarcotic Antagonists 2aOpioid Peptidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Opioidxagonistsxmetabolism. 0aphysiological functions 0aligands 0abeta-casomorphins 0aexorphins1 aKoch, G.1 aBrantl, V.0 tBiopolymers.g1997, v. 43, no. 2 p.99-117x0006-35257nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03518naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245005300172300001600225500011100241520208400352650001102436650001702447650001002464650001802474650001502492650001102507650001502518650001502533650002202548650001802570650001402588650002502602650002302627650001802650650001702668650001002685650001902695650001202714650001002726650002502736650001602761651002102777700001702798773014502815856005502960852000903015655001203024IND60568382220221119114525.0170508e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056838222DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1143.462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTekeli, F.

There have been many reports on the total number of plant species, each with varying numbers depending on the specific classification they used. The total number of plants is estimated to be about 400,000 species. Turkey has a broad biodiversity due to numerous microclimates because of its geomorphological structure causing diverse ecology. About 12,000 species are known to exist in Turkey including about 4,000 endemic species, both more than that of European countries. Regarding Nigde and its neighboring provinces, endemic species are reported to be 726 in Konya, 543 in Kayseri, 507 in Nigde, and 100 in Nevsehir. Some of these endemic species are classified as critically endangered (CR). Most of the endemic plants with narrow occurrence in steppe ecosystems fall into CR group. Turkey has numerous endemic plants, but some of them are endangered. About 600 endemic species in Turkey are classified in the CR group and about 700 in the group of Endangered (EN). As in some other countries, numerous endemic plant species were collected between 1992 and 1997, and conserved at the Gene Bank of Menemen, Turkey. The In-situ Conservation of Plant Genetic Diversity National Plan was implemented to employ in-situ conservation of the species that are imperative for agriculture, food, economy and culture. Endemic plant species should be conserved to have them in the future generation not only in Turkey, but also in other countries on the Globe. Therefore, multinational genetic resources programs are still needed, especially for conserving wild plant species. Wild plant species are used by varying communities on the Globe. Plant breeders all over the world use wild types or relatives as germplasm for economically important traits to improve the cultivated species.

Plant growth regulators (PGRs) play a key role in governing dormancy. Different pre- and postharvest techniques (viz. maleic hydrazide, low temperature, and controlled atmosphere) are commercially used to extend storability of onions. Alternative postharvest treatments, such as continuous ethylene supplementation and 1-MCP have a positive effect on storability. However, the effect of these treatments on the spatial phytohormone distribution in onion bulbs has not been studied in detail and, as consequence, was studied herein. Onions cv. Sherpa were treated before curing (20°C for six weeks) with 10 µL L-1 ethylene, 1 µL L-1 1-MCP and 10 µL L-1 ethylene (simultaneously), or post-curing with 1 µL L-1 1-MCP and 10 µL L-1 ethylene for 24 h at 20°C. The bulbs were then stored in air at 1°C for 31 weeks. PGRs (viz. ABA, zeatin riboside [ZR] and isopentenyladenosine [IPA]) were analysed at each sampling point (0, 6, 19 and 31 weeks) for both top and bottom section of onion bulbs. Concentrations of ABA, IPA and ZR were significantly higher in the bottom section (45.8, 93.4 and 253 ng g-1 DW, respectively) compared with the top section of the onion bulbs (32.0, 47.3 and 86 ng g-1 DW, respectively). Moreover, although the treatment effect was not significant (p>0.05), average values for all three phytohormone studied tended to differ more between treatments in the bottom samples than in the top samples. Further experiments will need to be carried out to elucidate this trend. 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aabscisic acid 3aair 3abulbs 3adormancy 3aethylene 3amaleic hydrazide 3aonions 3apostharvest treatment 3asprouting 3astorage quality 3atemperature 3azeatin1 aAlamar, M.

Some siderophores or killer toxins produced by marine yeasts have ability to inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria or kill pathogenic yeasts in marine animals. The virulent factors from marine pathogens can be genetically displayed on marine yeast cells, and the yeast cells displaying the virulent factors can stimulate marine animals to produce specific antibody against the pathogens. Some marine yeast cells are rich in proteins and essential amino acids and can be used in nutrition for marine animals. The marine yeast cells rich in lipid can be used for biodiesel production. Recently, it has been reported that some strains of Yarrowia lipolytica isolated from marine environments can produce nanoparticles. Because many marine yeasts can remove organic pollutants and heavy metals, they can be applied to remediation of marine environments.

The experimental approach involved the imposition of transmembrane electrical potentials (via K+ diffusion potentials) in populations of purified, right-side-out PM vesicles isolated from wheat roots. Using 45Ca2+ to quantify Ca2+ influx into the PM vesicles, the voltage-dependent characteristics of Ca2+ transport were found to be similar to those exhibited by L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in animal cells. The putative PM Ca2+ channel opened upon depolarization of the membrane potential, and Ca2+ flux increased to a maximum upon further depolarization and then decreased back to zero upon further successive depolarizations. This channel was found to be selective for Ca 2+ over Mg2+, Sr2+, K+, and Na+; was blocked by very low concentrations of La3+; Was unaffected by high concentrations of the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium; and exhibited Michaelis-Menten-type transport kinetics. Based on these transport properties, we argue that this transport system is a PM Ca2+ channel. We suggest that the use of radiotracer flux analysis of voltage-clamped PM vesicles derived from plant roots is a straightforward approach for the characterization of certain voltage-gated ion channels functioning in cellular membranes of higher plant cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplasma membrane 3acalcium 3aion transport 3aanions 3aTriticum aestivum 3aactive transport 3aroots 3amembrane potential 3ainorganic ions 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium Channelsxphysiology 2aCations, Divalent 2aCell Membranexphysiology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIon Channel Gating 2aKinetics 2aMembrane Potentials 2aTriticum 0aelectrophysiology1 aGrunes, D.L.1 aKochian, L.V.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Apr. 12, v. 91, no. 8 p.3473-3477x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.8.34733Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03146naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245012800203300002000331506007600351520128800427506003701715650001901752650003501771650001801806650002701824650001401851650001101865650001601876650001201892650001801904650002801922650002901950650001901979650002201998650001202020700001802032700002002050700002202070700002402092700001602116700002302132700002402155700002002179700001802199700002102217700002202238700002702260773017602287852000902463856008302472946001302555655001202568IND4445969120221207104455.0101203e20101130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444596912DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10080761072doi7 aPMC29964582pmcid7 a210716762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzumi, Taisuke10aHIV-1 viral infectivity factor interacts with TP53 to induce G2 cell cycle arrest and positively regulate viral replication  ap. 20798-20803.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aViral infectivity factor, an accessory protein encoded in the HIV-1 genome, induces G2 cell cycle arrest; however, the biological significance and mechanism(s) remain totally unclear. Here we demonstrate that the TP53 pathway is involved in Vif-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest. Vif enhances the stability and transcriptional activity of TP53 by blocking the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and nuclear export of TP53. Furthermore, Vif causes G2 cell cycle arrest in a TP53-dependent manner. HXB2 Vif lacks these activities toward TP53 and cannot induce G2 cell cycle arrest. Using mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the critical residues for this function are located in the N-terminal region of Vif. Finally, we construct a mutant NL4-3 virus with an NL4-3/HXB2 chimeric Vif defective for the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and show that the mutant virus replicates less effectively than the wild-type NL4-3 virus in T cells expressing TP53. These data imply that Vif induces G2 cell cycle arrest through functional interaction with the TP53/MDM2 axis and that the G2 cell cycle arrest induced by Vif has a positive effect on HIV-1 replication. This report demonstrates the molecular mechanisms and the biological significance of Vif-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest for HIV-1 infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aT-lymphocytes 3acell cycle checkpoints 3achimerism 3agenome 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3aphysiological transport 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitination 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aIo, Katsuhiro1 aMatsui, Masashi1 aShirakawa, Kotaro1 aShinohara, Masanobu1 aNagai, Yuya1 aKawahara, Masahiro1 aKobayashi, Masayuki1 aKondoh, Hiroshi1 aMisawa, Naoko1 aKoyanagi, Yoshio1 aUchiyama, Takashi1 aTakaori-Kondo, Akifumi0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 30, v. 107, no. 48 p.20798-20803dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10080761073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02349naa a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245005800149300001600207300002400223520083800247650000801085650002601093650001001119650001501129650001501144650001401159650001501173650001001188650001601198650000901214650003901223650001001262650002101272650001101293650001601304650002701320650001101347650001101358650002001369650002201389650000901411650001601420650002501436650001401461650004201475650001601517651001101533651001101544653001901555700001401574773009601588852000901684939003301693945000801726946001301734655001201747991562932550742620221119114631.0800916e198004  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800024172DNAL7 a71890902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoppner, K.10aFolate levels in human liver from autopsies in Canada  ap. 862-864.  ap. 862-864. charts.  aStudies of 560 livers obtained during autopsies in Canada show little evidence of severe folate deficiency regardless of age or cause of death.

Assuming accident victims to have liver folate levels representative of the general population, it is estimated that less than 10% of Canadians have a folate deficiency. 3aage 3anutrient deficiencies 3aliver 3aabsorption 3afolic acid 2aAccidents 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxmortality 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aFetal Death 2aFolic Acidxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasmsxmortality 2aPregnancy 2aRespiratory Tract Diseasesxmortality 2aSex Factors 3aCanada 0aCanada 0aClinical tests1 aLampi, B.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.862-864x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800916c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03284naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245011000180300001600290500002400306500001500330520141000345650001001755650001601765650001401781650002801795650001801823650001301841650001001854650002501864650001001889650001201899650002801911650002801939650001201967650002101979650001002000650001802010650002802028650003202056650009602088650001402184650003102198650002502229650002702254650001402281651001002295651001002305653002802315700001402343700001802357700001902375700001602394700001702410700001202427700001902439773008202458852000902540856008502549655001202634IND4435666820221119114458.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443566682DNAL7 a201460942pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-010-0452-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hualei10aGenomic characterization of the first class I Newcastle disease virus isolated from the mainland of China  ap. 365-371.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe complete genomic sequence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain NDV08-004, isolated from domestic ducks in China, was determined in this study. The genome is 15198 nucleotides (nt) in length, follows the “rule of six” and contains a 55-nt leader sequence at the 3′ end and a 114-nt trailer sequence at the 5′ end. Compared with the full genome sequences of Class II NDV strains, the NDV08-004 isolate has a 12-nt insertion (TGGGAGACGGGG) in the phosphoprotein gene between nucleotides 2381 and 2382 of the genome (numbered according to the genomic sequence of the La Sota strain, which consists of 15186 nt). Strain NDV08-004 has the motif ¹¹²E-Q-Q-E-R-L¹¹⁷ at the cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is typical of lentogenic NDV strains, and this is in agreement with the results of pathogenic tests based on the mean death time (MDT) and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). Phylogenetic analysis based on the full genome revealed that all the NDV strains studied could be divided into two distinct clades, namely class I and class II, and the NDV08-004 isolate characterized in this study was grouped in class I. Further phylogenetic analysis based on a 374-bp fragment of the F gene in class I strains of NDV demonstrated that NDV08-004 belongs to genotype 3, and should be therefore similar to strains obtained from live bird markets in Hong Kong in recent years. 3aducks 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3apathogenicity 3agenotype 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3adeath 3amarkets 2a3' Untranslated Regions 2a5' Untranslated Regions 2aAnimals 2aCluster Analysis 2aDucks 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNewcastle Diseasexvirology 2aNewcastle disease virusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aPhylogeny 2aPoultry Diseasesxvirology 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aVirulence 3aChina 0aChina 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aChen, Fei1 aZhao, Yunling1 aZheng, Dongxia1 aLi, Jinming1 aXu, Tiangang1 aQi, Lin1 aWang, Zhiliang0 tVirus genes.g2010 June, v. 40, no. 3 p.365-371dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-010-0452-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03206naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245008600178300001600264500002400280520153600304650002501840650001001865650001801875650002601893650001301919650001301932650001101945650002501956650001401981650001001995650001202005650002102017650001102038650002802049650001402077650002502091650007702116650006702193650002702260650002202287650002002309650002902329700001802358700001802376700002202394700001702416700001502433700001602448773008202464852000902546856008502555655001202640IND4435667020221119114436.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443566702DNAL7 a201577712pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-010-0454-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, S.10aFull genomic analysis and possible origin of a porcine G12 rotavirus strain RU172  ap. 382-388.  aIncludes references  aHuman group A rotavirus (GAR) G12 strains are regarded as potentially important pathogens for acute gastroenteritis. On the other hand, to date, the only report of detection of G12 in animals was that of a porcine G12P[7] strain RU172. Strain RU172 formed a separate G12 lineage, distinct from human G12 strains, and by analyses of deduced amino acid sequences, had a VP4, VP6, NSP4-5 of porcine origin. In the present study, we determined the full-length nucleotide sequences of VP1, VP3, and NSP1-3 genes and nearly full-length nucleotide sequence of VP2 gene of RU172. By nucleotide sequence identities and phylogenetic analyses, the VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5 genes of RU172 were assigned to G12-P[7]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1 genotypes, respectively. Within their respective genotypes, (i) VP1 gene of RU172 exhibited higher genetic relatedness to Wa-like human G12 GARs than porcine strains, (ii) VP2-3 and NSP2 genes clustered separately from the Wa-like human (including G12) and porcine clusters, while (iii) the VP6, NSP1 and NSP3-5 genes clustered with porcine and porcine-like human strains. These observations suggested that (i) the porcine G12 strain might have originated from porcine-human reassortment events, or alternatively, (ii) the Wa-like human and porcine G12 strains might have originated from a common ancestor, and eventually evolved (by genetic drift and shift) with time. Our findings provided important insights into the possible patterns of evolution of the porcine G12 strain. 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3agenetic drift 3agenetic relationships 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aCluster Analysis 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aReassortant Virusesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRotavirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology 2aSwinexvirology 2aViral Proteinsxgenetics1 aKobayashi, N.1 aNagashima, S.1 aChawla-Sarkar, M.1 aKrishnan, T.1 aGanesh, B.1 aNaik, T.

Sometimes high visual uncertainty translates into lack of confidence in our visual perception: We are aware of not seeing well. The mechanism by which we achieve this awareness--how we assess our own visual uncertainty--is unknown, but its investigation is critical to our understanding of visual decision mechanisms. The simplest possibility is that the visual system relies on cues to uncertainty, stimulus features usually associated with visual uncertainty, like blurriness. Probabilistic models of the brain suggest a more sophisticated mechanism, in which visual uncertainty is explicitly represented as probability distributions. In two separate experiments, observers performed a visual discrimination task in which confidence could be determined by the cues available (contrast and crowding or eccentricity and masking) or by their actual performance, the latter requiring a more sophisticated mechanism than cue monitoring. Results show that observers' confidence followed performance rather than cues, indicating that the mechanisms underlying the evaluation of visual confidence are relatively complex. This result supports probabilistic models, which imply the existence of sophisticated mechanisms for evaluating uncertainty.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3amonitoring 3aphysical properties 3aprobabilistic models 3aprobability distribution 3auncertainty 3avisual perception1 aMamassian, Pascal0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 30, v. 107, no. 48 p.20834-20839dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10077041073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02661naa a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245009600154300001600250300003000266500001500296520091100311650001301222650001101235650002701246650001601273650000801289650001601297650001801313650001201331650004501343650003301388650003701421650001601458650003701474650002001511650003801531650005501569650000901624650001201633650003801645650002601683650002401709653001001733653002601743700002201769700002401791700001901815700002301834700002101857700002201878773009601900852000901996939003302005945000802038946001302046655001202059991562930940742620221119114547.0800916e198004  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800024152DNAL7 a73617032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraser, Robin C.14aThe effect of variations in vitamin C intake on the cellular immune response of guinea pigs  ap. 839-847.  ap. 839-847. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aTests with guinea pigs show that very high doses of ascorbate elevate mitotic activity after 4 weeks of severely reduced food intake. The scorbutic (ascorbate deficient) group experienced a precipitate weight loss beginning about the 15th day. Lymphocytes from animals receiving 250 mg/day of ascorbate incorporated in vivo the highest amount of tritiated thymidine. Responses to lipopolysaccharide were inconclusive. In scorbutic animals, the percentage of B lymphocytes increased and that of T lymphocytes decreased continuously over the 4 weeks. The changes were exactly opposite in ascorbate-supplemented animals. These lymphocyte changes probably reflect the higher incidence of infection in the scorbutic group. The synthesis of DNA in lymphocytes from animals receiving megadoses of ascorbate was greater than for those receiving maintenance doses and considerably greater than in scorbutic animals. 3aimmunity 3ascurvy 3aanimal experimentation 3alymphocytes 3aDNA 3aweight loss 3aascorbic acid 2aAnimals 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aConcanavalin Axpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aGuinea Pigs 2aImmunity, Cellularxdrug effects 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aLymphocytesxdrug effectsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMitosis 2aPhytohemagglutininsxpharmacology 2aThymidinexmetabolism 2aTissue Distribution 0acells 0aBiochemical processes1 aPavlovic, Sreten.1 aKurahara, Carole G.1 aMurata, Akira.1 aPeterson, Nancy S.1 aTaylor, Keith B.1 aFeigen, George A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.839-847x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800916c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03388naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245010300175300001600278500015900294520177200453650002102225650001502246650001402261650003002275650002102305650002202326650001702348650002002365650001402385650002002399650001802419650001102437650001002448650001502458650001502473650001102488650001602499650002502515650001902540700001702559700001702576700001402593700001702607700002302624700001702647773014202664856005502806852000902861655001202870IND60568384220221119114549.0170508e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056838422DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1144.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanwalleghem, T.10aVaporization of biological control organisms in cold storage rooms to control postharvest diseases  ap. 121-128.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Postharvest Pathology: Using Science to Increase Food Availability held June 7-11, 2015, Bari, Italy  aStorage diseases can cause important losses on pome fruits. Disease management to control storage diseases includes several treatments with different fungicides in the weeks prior to harvest. Nowadays, the presence of residues on fruits becomes more and more a public and governmental concern. In order to reduce the chemical residue on fruits to a minimum, more and more research is performed on alternative disease management. In this respect, in 2013, a project concerning the 'Vaporization of biological control organisms (BCOs) in cold storage to control postharvest diseases', which was funded by the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT), has started at the research station for fruit cultivation (Pcfruit) in collaboration with the Institute for agricultural and fisheries research (ILVO) and the Catholic University of Leuven (KULeuven). In a first step, the influence of fungicides applied in the months prior to storage on different BCOs was tested in vitro and in vivo. Besides that, also the influence of additives on the efficiency of biological control organisms in their control of storage diseases caused by Neofabraea alba or Botrytis cinerea was investigated after artificial inoculation experiments. This pointed out that some fungicides can have important negative effects on the BCOs tested and that additives, like calcium chloride and calcium-D-gluconate, can enhance the efficacy of BCOs in the control of fungal storage diseases. Furthermore, out of different tests the vaporization device 'Swingtec Fontan Starlet' was selected for the vaporization of the BCOs and research is going on to optimize the homogeneous distribution of the BCOs in the cold storage room with the help of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aNeofabraea 3aadditives 3abiological control agents 3acalcium chloride 3achemical residues 3acold storage 3adisease control 3afisheries 3afluid mechanics 3afruit growing 3afruits 3afungi 3afungicides 3aharvesting 3amodels 3apome fruits 3apostharvest diseases 3avolatilization1 aDekeyser, D.1 aNuyttens, D.1 aTsige, A.1 aVerboven, P.1 aHemelrijck, W. van1 aBylemans, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 June, , no. 1144 p.121-128dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1144.17  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245007900173300001600252500015900268520132600427650002501753650002101778650001601799650001901815650003001834650001501864650001001879650001501889650001401904650002101918650001901939650001801958650002501976650001002001650002402011650001702035650001102052650001702063700001602080700001802096773014202114856005502256852000902311655001202320IND60568383920221119114718.0170508e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056838392DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1144.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoumeur, S.

An alternative to the use of synthetic fungicides to control postharvest diseases relies in the application of naturally occurring microorganisms. Among them, endophytes have been proposed as promising biocontrol agents. These organisms reside in the plant tissues as symbiotic microbes or opportunistic pathogens, and they can produce a plethora of compounds. This research aimed to study the activity of 12 endophytic fungi isolated from wormwood roots (Artemisia absinthium) against B. cinerea. All isolates except B16C39 were not able to infect intact or wounded berries. The antagonistic activity of all the isolated fungi was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In dual culture with B. cinerea, endophytes reduced radial fungal growth from 33 to 50%, with the highest inhibition halo found with isolate B11C29. All the biocontrol agents were effective during in vivo trials when used at 106 spores mL-1. Three of the fungal strains, B14C35, B6C18, preliminarly identified as Penicillium sp., and B9C22 (still not identified) significantly reduced both percentage of infected berries and lesion diameter as compared to the water treated control. Full identification of these promising biocontrol agents is in progress. 3aArtemisia absinthium 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aPenicillium 3aVitis vinifera 3abiological control agents 3aendophytes 3afungi 3afungicides 3agray mold 3amicrobial growth 3amicrosymbionts 3aplant tissues 3apostharvest diseases 3aroots 3asecondary infection 3asmall fruits 3aspores 3atable grapes1 aMancini, V.1 aRomanazzi, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 June, , no. 1144 p.101-104dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1144.14  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245012200207300002000329506007600349520101500425506003701440650001801477650001501495650001901510650001401529650001501543650002001558650002801578650002001606700002001626773017601646852000901822856008301831946001301914655001201927IND4448183920221207112747.0110126e20101221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444818392DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10163881082doi7 aPMC30097812pmcid7 a211352242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYudushkin, Ivan A.10aImaging T-cell receptor activation reveals accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated CD3ζ in the endosomal compartment  ap. 22128-22133.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhosphorylation of the T-cell receptor complex (TcR/CD3) mediates the survival and antigen-induced activation of T cells. TcR/CD3 phosphorylation is usually monitored using phospho-specific antibodies, which precludes dynamic measurements. Here, we have developed genetically encoded, live-cell reporters that enable simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation state and intracellular trafficking of CD3ζ, the major signal-transducing subunit of the TcR/CD3. We show that these reporters provide accurate readouts of TcR/CD3 phosphorylation and are sensitive to the local balance of kinase and phosphatase activities acting upon TcR/CD3. Using these reporters, we demonstrate that, in addition to the expected activation-dependent phosphorylation at the plasma membrane, tyrosine-phosphorylated CD3ζ accumulates on endosomal vesicles distinct from lysosomes. These results suggest that an intracellular pool of phosphorylated CD3ζ may help to sustain TcR/CD3 signaling after the receptor internalization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3amonitoring 3aphosphorylation 3aphysiological transport 3aplasma membrane1 aVale, Ronald D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Dec. 21, v. 107, no. 51 p.22128-22133dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10163881083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03425naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001800181245010800199300001800307500001500325506007600340520105200416506003701468650002701505650002201532650001401554650002201568650002001590650001701610650002101627650001001648650001901658650002801677650003301705650002401738650001201762650003201774650002301806650006301829650005101892650001701943650002001960650001101980650006401991650002802055650006302083650003402146650003402180650001602214653002902230653001302259653001202272653001002284653001702294700001902311700001602330700001602346700001802362700001802380773014202398852000902540856008302549930003302632945001302665946001302678655001202691IND2041525920221207112741.0940818e19940510dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204152592DNAL7 a81839532pmid7 aPMC438312pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.10.45892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, K.A.10aIdentification of Drosophila cytoskeletal proteins by induction of abnormal cell shape in fission yeast  ap. 4589-4593.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo clone metazoan genes encoding regulators of cell shape, we have developed a functional assay for proteins that affect the morphology of a simple organism, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A Drosophila melanogaster cDNA library was constructed in an inducible expression vector and transformed into S. pombe. When expression of the Drosophila sequences was induced, aberrant cell shapes were found in 0.2% of the transformed colonies. Four severe phenotypes representing defects in cytokinesis and/or cell shape maintenance were examined further. Each displayed drastic and specific reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton. Three of the cDNAs responsible for these defects appear to encode cytoskeletal components: the actin binding proteins profilin and cofilin/actin depolymerizing factor and a membrane-cytoskeleton linker of the ezrin/merlin family. These results demonstrate that a yeast phenotypic screen efficiently identifies conserved genes from more complex organisms and sheds light on their potential in vivo functions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3aSaccharomycetales 3aphenotype 3acomplementary DNA 3aanimal proteins 3acytoskeleton 3abinding proteins 3aactin 3afungal anatomy 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aActin Depolymerizing Factors 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aConserved Sequence 2aCytoskeletal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Library 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHumans 2aMicrofilament Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVertebrates 0aschizosaccharomyce pombe 0aprofilin 0acofilin 0aezrin 0acell biology1 aMontague, R.A.1 aShepard, S.1 aEdgar, B.A.1 aErikson, R.L.1 aKiehart, D.P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 May 10, v. 91, no. 10 p.4589-4593x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.10.45893Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02791naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245007500152300001600227300003000243500001500273520097200288650001901260650001301279650001301292650001401305650001401319650001601333650002101349650002501370650002301395650003901418650004901457650005001506650003601556650001101592650001101603650002801614650002801642650002801670650002401698650002801722650003001750650002801780650002501808650002901833650001401862650003001876653001901906653001301925653002501938700002201963700002101985773009602006852000902102939003302111945000802144946001302152655001202165991562927550742620221119114437.0800916e198004  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800024122DNAL7 a73617002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLonnerdal, Bo.10aEffect of oral contraceptives on composition and volume of breast milk  ap. 816-824.  ap. 816-824. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aTest results, though mixed, suggest that oral contraceptives should be used with caution and in the lowest possible doses during lactation.

Although these differences were not significant, the control group showed no decrease in milk production. Significant changes were observed in concentration of total protein, nonprotein nitrogen, and individual milk proteins, varying in magnitude between components studied and between pills (one a progestin type, the others mixtures of progestins and an estrogen). All changes were still within the normal ranges and not likely to be of nutritional importance.

Gene phylogenies were developed to examine the relationship between reproductive isolation, genetic divergence, and biogeography in oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus). Sequence data were obtained for two regions of DNA from populations belonging to eight intersterility groups (biological species). Phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the 5' portion of the nuclear encoded large subunit rDNA demonstrates an ancient origin for four intersterility groups of broad geographic distribution (worldwide), with a more recent radiation of several intersterility groups that are restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. An expanded analysis using sequence data from the more variable rDNA internal transcribed spacer region also reveals a phylogenetically based pattern of genetic divergence associated with allopatric speciation among populations from different continents in the Northern Hemisphere. The ability of rDNA sequences to resolve phylogenetic relationships among geographically isolated populations within intersterility groups illustrates the importance of biogeography for understanding speciation in Pleurotus. Patterns of geographic distribution among intersterility groups suggest that several species lineages evolved quite early, with recently evolved groups restricted to the Northern Hemisphere and older lineages occurring throughout the world. Based on phylogenetic evidence, analysis of historical biogeography using area cladograms shows that multiple dispersal and vicariance events are responsible for patterns of speciation observed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aribosomal DNA 3aphylogeny 3abiogeography 3asexual reproduction 3anucleotide sequences 3amating behavior 3aPleurotus ostreatus 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGeography 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolyporaceaexclassificationxgenetics. 0agenbank/u04074 0agenbank/u04081 0agenbank/u04086 0agenbank/u04059 0acompatibility 0agenbank/u04070 0agenbank/u04058 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u04071 0agenbank/u04078 0agenbank/u04072 0agenbank/u04060 0agenbank/u04077 0agenbank/u04065 0agenbank/u04066 0agenbank/u04061 0agenbank/u04087+ 0agenbank/u04084 0agenbank/u04085 0agenbank/u04064 0agenbank/u04076 0agenbank/u04069 0agenbank/u04067 0agenbank/u04075 0agenbank/u04082 0agenbank/u04063 0aspeciation 0agenbank/u04068 0agenbank/u04079 0agenbank/u04062 0agenbank/u04073 0agenbank/u04080 0agenbank/u040831 aSun, B.L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 May 10, v. 91, no. 10 p.4599-4603x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.10.45993Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03732naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001900181245018700200300001800387500001500405506007600420520132200496506003701818650002201855650002101877650002501898650002001923650002501943650002501968650001201993650000802005650001702013650002802030650002402058650003302082650001802115650001502133650003102148650003002179650004102209650004202250650002102292650003302313650002602346650002802372650001302400650003202413650002902445650003502474650004202509650003602551653001402587653002102601653002802622653001902650653001402669700001702683700001702700773014202717852000902859856008302868930003302951945001302984946001302997655001203010IND2041645420221207113502.0940825e19940524dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204164542DNAL7 a81971162pmid7 aPMC438482pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.11.46632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaminski, P.A.14aThe expression of nifA in Azorhizobium caulinodans requires a gene product homologous to Escherichia coli HF-I, an RNA-binding protein involved in the replication of phage Q-beta RNA  ap. 4663-4667.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the characterization of a mutant of Azorhizobium caulinodans, isolated after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. This Nod+ Nif- Fix- mutant is unable to synthesize 10 of 15 polypeptides normally induced under conditions of nitrogen fixation. By using lacZ fusions it was shown that nifA and nifA-regulated genes were not expressed in this strain. The mutation was complemented by a constitutively expressed nifA gene or by a 1.1-kb DNA fragment from the wild-type strain, whose nucleotide sequence revealed a single open reading frame of 255 bp coding for an 85-amino acid polypeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence is similar to that of HF-I, an RNA-binding protein of Escherichia coli, which is required for replication of bacteriophage Q beta RNA. The similarity can be extended to the function since hfq, the structural gene for HF-I, complemented the A. caulinodans mutant. The corresponding gene in A. caulinodans was termed nrfA (for nif regulatory factor). Inactivation of nrfA in the mutant was due to a missense mutation resulting in the replacement of a cysteine residue by arginine. A null mutant, constructed by disruption of nrfA, exhibited the same phenotype as the missense mutant. Thus, an additional factor can be added to the already complex system of nifA regulation in A. caulinodans.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anitrogen fixation 3astructural genes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aDNA-binding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3amutants 3aRNA 3aRhizobiaceae 2aAllolevivirusxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Viral 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aEthyl Methanesulfonatexpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHost Factor 1 Protein 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aRNA, Viralxbiosynthesis 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aRhizobiaceaexdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 0anrfa gene 0abinding proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x76450 0anifa gene1 aDesnoues, N.1 aElmerich, C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 May 24, v. 91, no. 11 p.4663-4667x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.11.46633Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01213naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245014800171300001600319500002400335520026100359650001400620650002200634650002200656650002300678650001100701650001400712773013100726852000900857856005700866655001200923IND4456096820221119114707.0110408e197606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445609682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1976.tb02634.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHASSAN, S.T.14aTHE Area of discovery of apanteles glomeratus (hymenoptera: braconidae), pteromalus puparum (pteromalidae) and brachymeria regina (chalcididae)  ap. 199-205.  aIncludes references  aThe areas of discovery of Apanteles glomerulus, Pteromalus puparum and Brachymeria regina were calculated using two different models.

The factorial method uses energy cost of different activities as taken from previous research, on each individual. The heart rate method derives heart rate energy expenditure regression lines from a number of activities during which both parameters are calculated for mean daily heart rate. The use of heart rate to predict energy expenditure is the best method available for measurement of habitual energy expenditure.

The dogs had sustained a prior experimental myocardial infarction from ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and a hydraulic cuff was implanted around the left circumflex artery at that operation. After recovery from that procedure the animals were tested during a treadmill exercise test. With compression of the left circumflex artery sensitive animals will predictably develop ventricular fibrillation (VF). In such prepared dogs an emulsion of fish oil fatty acids was infused i.v. over a 50- to 60-min period just before the exercise-plus-ischemia test, and the effect on development of VF was recorded. The infusion was 100 ml of a 10% (vol/vol) emulsion of a fish oil concentrate containing 70% omega 3 fatty acids with free eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid composing 33.9% and 25.0% of that total, respectively. Alternatively, some animals similarly received an emulsion containing 5 ml of the free fatty acid concentrate plus 5 ml of a triacylglyerol concentrate containing 65% omega 3 fatty acids with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid composing 34.0% and 23.6% of that total, respectively. In seven of eight animals the infusion of the fish oil emulsion completely prevented the acute occurrence of VF in the susceptible animals (P < 0.005). In five of five of these animals the subsequent exercise-plus-ischemia test after a similar infusion of an emulsion in which soy bean oil replaced the fish oil fatty acid concentrates resulted in prompt development of VF. Possible mechanisms for this protective effect of omega 3 fatty acids against exercise and ischemia-induced malignant arrhythmias are considered.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3amyocardial infarction 3adisease prevention 3adogs 3afish oils 3adiet therapy 2aAnimals 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aDogs 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aElectrocardiographyxdrug effects 2aEmulsions 2aExercise Test 2aFat Emulsions, Intravenous 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aFish Oilsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aInfusions, Intravenous 2aIschemiaxphysiopathology 2aPhysical Exertion 2aTime Factors 2aVentricular Fibrillationxetiologyxprevention & control. 0aischemia 0aheart diseases 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aHallaq, H.1 aLeaf, A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 May 10, v. 91, no. 10 p.4427-4430x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.10.44273Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03209naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245012100171300001600292500002400308520210400332650001302436650002302449650002102472650001002493650001102503650002102514650001302535650001202548650001502560650002002575650001002595650001602605700001702621773013102638852000902769856005702778655001202835IND4456091720221119114531.0110408e197506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445609172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1975.tb02370.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSAXENA, K.N.10aPatterns of relationships between certain leafhoppers and plants, part iii. range and interaction of sensory stimuli  ap. 194-206.  aIncludes references  aInformation on the range and interaction of certain sensory stimuli determining the orientational responses of Empoasca devastans to the host (cotton) and nonhost (castor) plants is given. These responses of the leafhoppers, resulting in their arrival on various plants during host selection, are determined by the sensory stimuli from both the plants and from their background. The responses differ qualitatively and quantitatively according to the combination patterns of the different sensory stimuli perceived. The humidity (water vapour) and odour stimuli from the plants attract the insects up to only 1 cm. The humidity from the background of the plants in an irrigated bed attracts the insects from a longer distance (180 cm). The visual stimuli from the plants, particularly colour, attract the insects from the maximum distance (360 cm). When presented the same stimuli, e.g., cotton plants, in two different directions at different distances, the insects show a greater attraction to the nearer plants. The background stimuli which influence the insects' orientational responses to the plants include light and humidity. The insects show a greater attraction to a plant in a higher intensity of light or humidity than to the plant in a lower intensity of light or humidity. Even the nonhost (castor) plant, under high intensity conditions, attracts the insects more than the host (cotton) plant under low intensity conditions. The possibility of manoeuvring the orientational behaviour of the leafhoppers for their control is considered.

Die Möglichkeit, diese Verhaltensweisen der Zwergzikaden für die Bekämpfung auszunutzen, wird erörtert. 3aEmpoasca 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aRicinus communis 3acolor 3acotton 3ahost preferences 3ahumidity 3ainsects 3airrigation 3alight intensity 3aodors 3awater vapor1 aSAXENA, R.C.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1975,  p.194-206dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw45846wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1975.tb02370.x 7aarticle01834naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245014400177300001600321520074700337650001601084650001601100650001201116650001901128653001901147653003101166700002301197700002001220773012101240852000901361856009201370930003301462946001301495655001201508IND4421069020221119114124.0090529e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442106902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7410.2009.00160.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharlina, Natalia A.10aJuxtaligamental system of the disc and oral frame of the ophiuroid Amphipholis kochii (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) and its role in autotomy  ap. 145-156.  aThe ophiuroid Amphipholis kochii is able to detach its central disc from the underlying oral frame in response to external stimuli.

However, little is known about BR signaling in monotyledons. Here, we characterized a rice dwarf and low-tillering (dlt) mutant and cloned the corresponding gene via map-based cloning. DLT encodes a new member of the plant-specific GRAS family. The dwarf phenotype of dlt is similar to BR-deficient or signaling mutants in rice. In addition, both lamina bending and coleoptile elongation assays show that dlt is insensitive or much less responsive to brassinolide (BL), the most active BR, suggesting that DLT is involved in BR signaling. Consistent with this conclusion, the accumulation of transcripts of BR biosynthesis genes in the dlt mutant indicated that DLT is involved in feedback inhibition of BR biosynthesis genes. In addition, transcription of several other BR-regulated genes is altered in the dlt mutant. Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element. Taken together, these studies have enabled us to identify a new signaling component that is involved in several specific BR responses in rice. 3aArabidopsis 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinolide 3acoleoptiles 3agels 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3aphenotype 3arice 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBrassinosteroids 2aCholestanolsxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSignal Transduction 2aSteroids, Heterocyclicxmetabolism 0aDLT 0abrassinosteroid signaling 0aGRAS 0adwarf1 aJin, Yun1 aLiu, Wenbo1 aLi, Feng1 aFang, Jun1 aYin, Yanhai1 aQian, Qian1 aZhu, Lihuang1 aChu, Chengcai0 tPlant journal.g2009 June, v. 58, no. 5 p.803-816dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03825.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090529b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02788naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009900128300001600227500001500243520153200258650001901790650001301809650001601822650001701838650001501855650002201870650002201892650001501914650001501929650002701944650002601971650002401997650001802021653001502039653001202054653002502066653002002091653001702111700001702128700001702145773008802162852000902250930003302259945001302292946001302305655001202318IND2199042020221119114005.0990601e199812  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219904202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffman, M.L.10aEffects of crop and weed management on density and vertical distribution of weed seeds in soil  ap. 793-799.  a2019-12-05  aCultural practices used for crop management can influence numbers of weed seeds in the soil seed bank. This paper reports results of field experiments conducted for 6 yr to examine changes in weed seed numbers due to management practices. We evaluated the effect of tillage, herbicide application, and interrow cultivation on weed seed numbers in a soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]/corn (Zea mays L.) rotation and in continuous corn. Treatment effects on weed seed numbers were more repetitive in soybean/corn than continuous corn. Foxtails (Setaria spp.) were the weed class most affected by treatment. Weed seeds were uniformly distributed among sampling depths in conventional tillage and concentrated near the soil surface in reduced tillage and no-tillage. We expected weed seeds to become more numerous in the top 5 cm of soil as tillage was reduced. Tillage, as a main effect, rarely influenced weed seed numbers; therefore, we inferred that weed seed losses at the surface must have increased in reduced-tillage plots. Seed numbers were uniform among soil depths if herbicides were broadcast, but differed if herbicides were banded or omitted, due to increased seed deposition at the surface. Tillage affected vertical distribution of seeds, while the quantity of weed seeds in the top 5 cm of soil was regulated by weed control practices. This indicates that reducing weed seed deposition could be helpful for maintaining weed seeds in reduced-tillage systems at numbers similar to those of intensively tilled systems. 3aband placement 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3aweed control 3ano-tillage 3aSetaria (Poaceae) 3aChenopodium album 3aherbicides 3asoil depth 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3afield experimentation 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 0aseed banks 0atillage 0ainterrow cultivation 0acrop management 0abroadcasting1 aOwen, M.D.K.1 aBuhler, D.D.0 tAgronomy journal.g1998 , v. 90, no. 6 p.793-799wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01311naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245005400133300001800187300002600205520031200231650001800543650001600561650001300577650001800590650001100608650001100619650001900630650003200649653002100681653002600702653002600728700002100754773009900775852000900874939003300883945000800916946001300924655001200937991562917150742620221119114308.0801031e197912  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800029072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDugdale, A.E.10aEstimating fat body mass from anthropometric data  ap. 2400-2403.  ap. 2400-2403. charts.  aThe estimation of fat body mass for boys and girls 4-19 can be done on height and weight, but the addition of skinfold thickness data to regression equations considerably increases accuracy.

Our objective was to determine, under field conditions, the effect of timing and method of termination on the pattern of N release from perennial alfalfa, and on N uptake and yield of subsequent wheat crops. Four field experiments were initiated on perennial alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) in southern Manitoba in 1992 and 1993. A factorial of three methods (herbicide, tillage, herbicide + tillage) and two times of termination (early summer, after first alfalfa cut, and late summer, after second alfalfa cut) was arranged in a randomized complete block design. A spring-applied herbicide treatment was also included. Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was established after alfalfa termination. Soil NO3(-) content, plant N uptake, and yield were then monitored for one to two years. In three of four experiments, plant-available N in the spring after termination was higher in tilled treatments than in treatments receiving only herbicides. Regardless of method, plant-available N in the spring after termination was reduced when termination was delayed from early to late season. Despite the lower short-term plant-available N supply in early- and late-summer herbicide treatments, wheat yields in herbicide treatments were similar to or greater than those in tillage treatments. Differences in the N content among treatments diminished with time; by the fall of the second growing season after termination, differences in the cumulative available N supply were no longer evident. These results suggest that termination of alfalfa with herbicides may improve the synchrony between N release and N demand of a subsequent spring wheat crop, thereby improving N use efficiency. 3aMedicago sativa 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3acover crops 3agreen manures 3aharvesting 3atillage 3aglyphosate 3adicamba 3a2,4-D 3aTriticum aestivum 3asoil fertility 3anitrates 3anutrient uptake 3acrop yield 3aresidual effects 3anitrogen content 3aapplication timing 3asplit application 3aManitoba 0ause efficiency 0acutting frequency1 aEntz, M.H.1 aJanzen, H.H.1 aBullied, W.J.0 tAgronomy journal.g1999 , v. 91, no. 4 p.622-630wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02247naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002700132245008700159300001800246300003200264520085100296650001601147650002301163650001201186650002001198650002201218650004901240650005201289650001201341650001101353650003701364650001101401650002501412650005001437650001301487653002701500700002201527700002201549700001901571700002501590773009901615852000901714930003301723945000801756946001301764655001201777991562915760742620221119113854.0801031e197912  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800029112DNAL7 a1165382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaterhouse, Christine.10aFree amino acid levels in the blood of patients undergoing parenteral alimentation  ap. 2423-2429.  ap. 2423-2429. ill., charts.  aArterial and venous plasma and whole blood amino acid levels were analyzed in 103 samples from 25 patients on parenteral feeding.

During infusion, levels increased for alanine, valine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, proline, threonine, serine, methionine, phenylalanine and lysine. The branched-chain amino acids were negatively correlated with the rate of glucose infusion; only alanine was positively correlated. There was no arteriovenous change across the forearm for any amino acid or glucose infusion rate, even though amino acid levels were in some instances 3 to 5 times normal; this may imply that the initial processing of amino acids occurs in other tissues. 3aamino acids 3aparenteral feeding 3aglucose 3aclinical trials 3ahematologic tests 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aAmino Acids, Essentialxadministration & dosage 2aCaseins 2aFibrin 2aGlucosexadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aParenteral Nutrition 2aProtein Hydrolysatesxadministration & dosage 2aRheology 0aAmino acids metabolism1 aClarke, Edward F.1 aHeinig, Robert E.1 aLewis, Anne M.1 aJeanpretre, Nicolas.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Dec., v. 32, no. 12 p.2423-2429x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03227naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245008000181300001600261500002400277520166200301650001101963650001101974650001301985650002301998650002102021650001902042650001202061650001202073650001302085650003502098650001302133650001702146650002402163650001702187650002802204650003002232650004102262650003602303650002102339700002202360700002302382700001602405700003202421700002002453700002502473700002202498773010802520852000902628856004802637655001202685IND4424982820221119114332.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442498282DNAL7 a195263712pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-009-0464-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shu-Biao10aMapping SNP-anchored genes using high-resolution melting analysis in almond  ap. 273-281.  aIncludes references  aPeach and almond have been considered as model species for the family Rosaceae and other woody plants. Consequently, mapping and characterisation of genes in these species has important implications. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a recent development in the detection of SNPs and other markers, and proved to be an efficient and cost-effective approach. In this study, we aimed to map genes corresponding to known proteins in other species using the HRM approach. Prunus unigenes were searched and compared with known proteins in the public databases. We developed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, polymorphic in a mapping population produced from a cross between the cloned cultivars Nonpareil and Lauranne. A total of 12 SNP-anchored putative genes were genotyped in the population using HRM, and mapped to an existing linkage map. These genes were mapped on six linkage groups, and the predicted proteins were compared to putative orthologs in other species. Amongst those genes, four were abiotic stress-responsive genes, which can provide a starting point for construction of an abiotic resistance map. Two allergy and detoxification related genes, respectively, were also mapped and analysed. Most of the investigated genes had high similarities to sequences from closely related species such as apricot, apple and other eudicots, and these are putatively orthologous. In addition, it was shown that HRM can be an effective means of genotyping populations for the purpose of constructing a linkage map. Our work provides basic genomic information for the 12 genes, which can be used for further genetic and functional studies. 3aPrunus 3aapples 3aapricots 3achromosome mapping 3ahypersensitivity 3alinkage groups 3amelting 3apeaches 3aproteins 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aunigenes 3awoody plants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Denaturation 2aPhysical Chromosome Mappingxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aPrunusxgenetics1 aTavassolian, Iraj1 aRabiei, Gholamreza1 aHunt, Peter1 aWirthensohn, M.q(Michelle)1 aGibson, John P.1 aFord, Christopher M.1 aSedgley, Margaret0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2009 Sept., v. 282, no. 3 p.273-281dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-009-0464-4 7aarticle02074naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245011300170300001400283500002400297520093700321650002001258650002101278650001801299650001301317650000901330650001201339650001301351650001101364650002301375650001301398650002301411650002401434650000901458700001401467773014101481852000901622856005701631655001201688IND4456162720221119114110.0110408e198307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445616272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1983.tb03290.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEVOT, G.W.10aInterference to egg and larval development of the australian sheep blowfly by three insect growth regulators  ap. 58-64.  aIncludes references  aOvicidal activities of BAY SIR 8514, diflubenzuron and CGA-72662, by topical application to gravid female Lucilia cuprina (Wied.), were measured in terms of hatching success and the proportion of larvae completing larval development. BAY SIR 8514 was the most effective ovicide, capable of completely inhibiting egg eclosion. Two diazinon-resistant strains were more susceptible to prevention of egg hatching, but one (Q-strain) exhibited some cross-resistance to both urea compounds in terms of larval survival. The same strain displayed resistance to CGA-72662 which, although not affecting hatching or as active as the urea compounds, did reduce the number of larvae completing development. For both urea compounds, oxygen consumption of eggs from treated females indicated apparently normal development until hatching time, but then a failure to hatch. Respiration of eggs from CGA-72662 treated females was similar to controls. 3aLucilia cuprina 3across resistance 3adiflubenzuron 3aeclosion 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahatching 3alarvae 3alarval development 3aovicides 3aoxygen consumption 3atopical application 3aurea1 aSHIPP, E.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1983, v. 34, no. 1 p.58-64dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw30959wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1983.tb03290.x 7aarticle03795naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001500180245009500195300001800290500001500308506007600323520164300399506003702042650001402079650001302093650002102106650002202127650002202149650001902171650001802190650001802208650001902226650002402245650002502269650002602294650001302320650002702333650004002360650003402400650001302434650006602447650002802513650005802541650002202599650002002621650006502641650002502706653001702731653002902748700001402777700001702791700001602808700001702824773014202841852000902983856008202992930003303074945001303107946001303120655001203133IND2041408320221207104242.0940811e19940412dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204140832DNAL7 a81597602pmid7 aPMC435852pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.91.8.34032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirsch, T.10aPurification and initial characterization of a potential plant vacuolar targeting receptor  ap. 3403-3407.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClathrin-coated vesicles are known to be involved in the transport of proteins from the Golgi to the vacuole in plant cells. The mechanisms by which proteins are directed into this pathway are not known. Here we identify an integral membrane protein of approximately 80 kDa, extracted from clathrin-coated vesicles of developing pea (Pisum sativum L.) cotyledons, that bound at neutral pH to an affinity column prepared with the N-terminal targeting determinant of the vacuolar thiol protease, proaleurain, and eluted when the pH was lowered to 4. The protein was not retained on a control column prepared with the N-terminal sequence of a homologous, secreted thiol protease, endopeptidase B. The 80-kDa protein also accumulated in a membrane fraction that is less dense than clathrin-coated vesicles. In vitro studies demonstrated a binding constant of 37 nM between the approximately 80-kDa protein and the proaleurain targeting determinant. A peptide with a vacuolar targeting determinant from prosporamin weakly competed for binding to the approximately 80-kDa protein, while a peptide carrying a single amino acid substitution known to abolish prosporamin vacuolar targeting had no measurable binding affinity for the protein. The binding protein is a glycoprotein with a transmembrane orientation in which the C terminus is exposed to the cytoplasm. The binding domain is located in the N-terminal luminal portion of the protein. These properties of the binding protein are consistent with the function of a receptor that would select proteins in the trans-Golgi for sorting to clathrin-coated vesicles and delivery to the vacuole.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3areceptors 3avacuoles 3abinding proteins 3amembrane proteins 3aprotein transport 3acell membranes 3aPisum sativum 3aglycoproteins 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aCell Compartmentation 2aClathrin 2aCross-Linking Reagents 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Precursorsxmetabolism 2aFabaceae 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aProtein Binding 2aReceptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclearxisolation & purification 2aVacuolesxmetabolism 0apurification 0aclathrin coated vesicles1 aParis, N.1 aButler, J.M.1 aBeevers, L.1 aRogers, J.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1994 Apr. 12, v. 91, no. 8 p.3403-3407x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.8.34033Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02988naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245009300178300001400271500001500285520140900300650002101709650002801730650001001758650001201768650001201780650001801792650001701810650002401827650001701851650001901868650001101887650001001898650002201908650001801930650001501948650001601963650001701979650001901996653002502015653002502040653001602065653002302081653002002104700002002124773009002144852000902234856007502243930003302318945002502351946001102376990002302387655001202410IND4426921920221119114320.0091006s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442692192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ninety laying hens of the Brown Nera strain in their 9th week of lay were randomly assigned to five dietary treatment in which BNS were incorporated at levels of 0 (control), 5, 10, 15 and 20 percent. There were eighteen birds per treatment and each treatment was replicated thrice in a Completely Randomized Design. The feeding trial lasted for 45 weeks during which each bird received 120g of feed/day. Results showed that final body weight, dressing percentage and residual weight were significantly affected by treatments (P<0.05). There was an observed increase in these parameters up to the 10 percent levels after which the values declined. Birds on the 10 percent BNS diets were superior in these parameters. Gizzard and liver weights increased significantly (P<0.05) as levels of BNS increased. Organoleptic investigations revealed that colour, taste and texture of the breasts muscle were significantly (P<0.05) affected by treatments. Birds on the 10 percent BNS diet had significantly higher colour value whereas taste and texture significantly increased as level of BNS in the diets increased. In conclusion, the results of this study reveal that BNS can be incorporated at 10 percent level in diet of laying hens without compromising carcass characteristics at end of lay. 3aplant byproducts 3acarcass characteristics 3aliver 3agizzard 3atexture 3abreast muscle 3achicken meat 3adressing percentage 3ameat quality 3aforage legumes 3aflavor 3acolor 3aVigna subterranea 3atissue weight 3aspent hens 3ahen feeding 3afeed rations 3aanimal tissues 0aresidual feed intake 0aBambara nut sievates 0abody weight 0asensory properties 0aresidual weight1 aOnyimonyi, A.E.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2008, v. 7, no. 1 p.81-84x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/7(1).htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/05  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03163naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245006900177300001600246520182000262650001702082650001002099650001602109650001202125650002402137650002602161650001302187650001502200650001302215650001702228650001602245650001002261651002502271653001802296653002802314653002702342653002802369653001802397700002202415773012302437852000902560856009202569930003302661946001102694655001202705IND4421072420221119114541.0090529e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442107242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01945.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aROBERTSON, OLIVER J.10aGap-crossing decisions of forest birds in a fragmented landscape  ap. 435-446.  aHabitat loss and fragmentation are recognized as primary drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. To understand the functional effects of habitat fragmentation on bird populations, data on movement across gaps in habitat cover are necessary, although rarely available. In this study, we used call playback to simulate a conspecific territorial intruder to entice birds to move through the landscape in a predictable and directional manner. We then quantified the probability of movement in continuous forest and across cleared gaps for two forest-dependent species, the grey shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica) and the white-throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaeus). Fifty-four playback trials were conducted for each species across distances ranging from 25 to 480 m in continuous forest and 15-260 m across gaps in a forest-agricultural landscape in southern Victoria, Australia. The probability of movement was significantly reduced by gaps in forest cover for both species. Shrike-thrushes were six times more likely to move 170 m in continuous forest than to cross 170-m gaps. The mean probability that treecreepers would cross any gap at all was less than 0.5, and they were three times less likely to move 50 m across a gap than through continuous forest. Both species displayed non-linear responses to increasing gap distance: we identified a gap-tolerance threshold of 85 m for the shrike-thrush and 65 m for the treecreeper beyond which individuals were most unlikely to cross. The presence of scattered paddock trees increased functional connectivity for the shrike-thrush, with individuals crossing up to 260 m when scattered trees were present. We conclude that gaps in habitat cover are barriers to movement, and that characteristics of the intervening matrix influence landscape permeability. 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acanopy gaps 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3apastures 3apermeability 3aprobability 3atrees 3aVictoria (Australia) 0acall playback 0aColluricincla harmonica 0aCormobates leucophaeus 0afunctional connectivity 0agap-tolerance1 aRADFORD, JAMES Q.0 tAustral ecology.g2009 June, v. 34, no. 4 p.435-446dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01945.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090529b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02773naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009900131300001600230500001500246520173100261650002101992650002702013650002102040650002002061650001102081650001802092650001302110650002202123650002302145651001202168653001202180700002302192700001602215773008802231852000902319930003302328945001302361946001302374655001202387IND2205187020221119114543.0000608e199909  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220518702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedreira, C.G.S.10aProductivity and nutritive value of 'Florakirk' bermudagrass as affected by grazing management  ap. 796-801.  a2019-12-05  a'Florakirk' bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] is a recently released cultivar for the lower southeastern USA, but its evaluation under grazing has been limited to southern Florida. Herbage accumulation, crude protein (CP), and in vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM) responses of Florakirk to grazing management were studied in 1993 and 1994 on a sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Ultic Haplaquod in northern Florida. Treatments were replicated twice in a randomized block design and consisted of all combinations of three lengths of grazing cycle (GC) (7, 21, and 35 d) and three postgraze stubble heights (SH) (8, 16, and 24 cm). Actual grazing periods were from 1 to 12 h. Herbage accumulation ranged from 6.9 to 17 Mg ha(-1) and was maximized when pastures were grazed to a 24-cm SH every 7 d in 1993, and to 24 cm every 35 d in 1994. Lowest herbage accumulation occurred when pastures were grazed to an 8-cm SH every 21 d. Treatment combinations involving GC 7 were associated with high herbage accumulation in both years of the study. Nutritive value varied relatively little across the range of treatments imposed. Crude protein concentration ranged from 96 to 113 g kg(-1) in 1993 and from 121 to 134 g kg(-1) in 1994. Lower CP was associated with longer GCs in both years. In vitro digestible organic matter concentration was greatest at short SHs for all but the shortest GCs in 1993 and was greatest at intermediate GCs in 1994. Florakirk herbage accumulation was affected primarily by SH, and nutritive value was affected primarily by GC. Grazing to a SH of approximately 20 cm every 14 d is predicted by regression models to result in near maximum levels of both herbage accumulation and nutritive value. 3arange management 3ain vitro digestibility 3aCynodon dactylon 3anutritive value 3aheight 3acrude protein 3aduration 3agrazing intensity 3abiomass production 3aFlorida 0agrazing1 aSollenberger, L.E.1 aMislevy, P.0 tAgronomy journal.g1999 , v. 91, no. 5 p.796-801wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03432naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245007400191300001600265500002400281520151000305650001201815650001001827650001601837650001101853650001301864650000901877650001001886650002601896650000901922650001801931650001201949650002601961650001001987650001401997650000902011650002602020650001702046650001102063650002402074650001202098650003302110650003502143650003802178650006602216650002802282650001402310650005302324650002802377650003202405650003102437650002302468650001202491700001802503700001802521700001702539700002002556700002202576773009602598852000902694856005502703655001202758IND4380035120221119074801.0060429e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438003512DNAL7 a166405942pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02714.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurata, Yoshiko12aA specific transporter for iron(III)-phytosiderophore in barley roots  ap. 563-572.  aIncludes references  aIron acquisition of graminaceous plants is characterized by the synthesis and secretion of the iron-chelating phytosiderophore, mugineic acid (MA), and by a specific uptake system for iron(III)-phytosiderophore complexes. We identified a gene specifically encoding an iron-phytosiderophore transporter (HvYS1) in barley, which is the most tolerant species to iron deficiency among graminaceous plants. HvYS1 was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 678 amino acids and to have 72.7% identity with ZmYS1, a first protein identified as an iron(III)-phytosiderophore transporter in maize. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the HvYS1 gene was mainly expressed in the roots, and its expression was enhanced under iron deficiency. In situ hybridization analysis of iron-deficient barley roots revealed that the mRNA of HvYS1 was localized in epidermal root cells. Furthermore, immunohistological staining with anti-HvYS1 polyclonal antibody showed the same localization as the mRNA. HvYS1 functionally complemented yeast strains defective in iron uptake on media containing iron(III)-MA, but not iron-nicotianamine (NA). Expression of HvYS1 in Xenopus oocytes showed strict specificity for both metals and ligands: HvYS1 transports only iron(III) chelated with phytosiderophore.

Salinity extent was measured at twelve sites using aerial photographs taken at 14 intervals between 1958 and 2004. Results showed that the area of salinity increased over the study period, and increased substantially after 1991. Cumulative patterns of rainfall and moisture surplus influenced salinity more than actual rainfall and surplus amounts over various preceding timeframes. Rainfall was correlated to total saline area over the whole study period (1958–2004) whereas soil moisture surplus and deficit were not. However, moisture surplus was more consistently linked with salinity than was moisture deficit over specific time periods, indicating that an oversupply of water had a stronger influence on salinity than a lack of water. Nevertheless, the severe drought of the early 1980s probably resulted in the rapid expansion of salinity between 1991 and 1996. The time lag between the drought and a salinity response was probably due to preceding and subsequent climate conditions as well as conditions during the drought. 3aaerial photography 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3arain 3asalinity 3asoil water 3aNew South Wales1 aDragovich, D.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2010 Oct., v. 74, no. 10 p.1216-1224dAcademic Pressx0140-19637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2010.04.0143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03612naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010300180300001600283500002400299500001500323520206300338650001302401650002102414650001802435650002402453650001702477650001002494650001902504650002502523650001302548650001902561650001402580650001402594650001802608650004602626650002702672650002802699650004602727650004102773650003802814650001302852651001502865651001502880653001902895700002002914773009102934852000903025856004803034655001203082IND4391504620221119074859.0070522e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439150462DNAL7 a173451412pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-006-9148-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHewson, Ian10aCharacterization of Lysogens in Bacterioplankton Assemblages of the Southern California Borderland  ap. 631-638.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aViruses cause significant mortality of marine microorganisms; however, their role in shaping the composition of microbial assemblages has not been fully elucidated. Because viruses may form lysogenic relationships with their hosts, temperate viruses may influence bacterial assemblage structures through direct lysis of hosts when induced by environmental stimuli or by homoimmunity (i.e., immunity to closely related viruses). We investigated the components of bacterioplankton assemblages that bore prophage using the lysogenic induction agent mitomycin C. Seawater was collected at two locations (the San Pedro Ocean Time Series Station and in the Santa Barbara Channel) in the Southern California Borderland and amended with mitomycin C. After 24-h incubation, the community structure of bacterioplankton was compared with unamended controls using automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis. The addition of mitomycin C to seawater had effects on the community structure of bacterioplankton, stimulating detectable overall diversity and richness of fingerprints and causing the assemblages within incubations to become different to control assemblages. Most negatively impacted operational taxonomic units (OTU) in mitomycin C-amended incubations individually comprised a large fraction of total amplified DNA in initial seawater (5.3-23.3% of amplified DNA fluorescence) fingerprints, and data suggest that these include organisms putatively classified as members of the γ-Proteobacteria, SAR11 cluster, and Synechococcus groups. The stimulation of assemblage richness by induction of lysogens, and the reduction in the contribution to total DNA of common OTU (and concomitant increase in rare OTU), suggests that temperate phage have the potential to strongly influence the diversity of bacterioplankton assemblages. Because lysogenic OTU may also be resistant to closely related lytic (i.e., free-living) viruses, the impact of lytic virioplankton on assemblages may only be pronounced transiently or when conditions causing lysogenic induction arise. 3aimmunity 3abacterioplankton 3aribosomal RNA 3acommunity structure 3afluorescence 3ahosts 3abacteriophages 3atime series analysis 3aseawater 3aintergenic DNA 3amitomycin 3amortality 3aSynechococcus 2aBacteriaxgrowth & developmentxvirology. 2aLysogenyxdrug effects 2aMitomycinxpharmacology 2aPlanktonxgrowth & developmentxvirology. 2aProphagesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSeawaterxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aWetlands 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0amicroorganisms1 aFuhrman, Jed A.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2007 May, v. 53, no. 4 p.631-638dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-006-9148-3 7aarticle01278naa a2200217 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010200126500019500228520042500423650002800848773010400876852000900980930003300989945001301022946001301035655001201048IND2059015020221119074949.0970816s1997    dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205901502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahidi, F.10aBeneficial health effects and drawbacks of antinutrients and phytochemicals in foods: an overview  aDeveloped from a symposium sponsored by the Division of Agricultural and Food Chemistry at the 210th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, August 20-25, 1995, Chicago, Illinois.  aAntinutrients in foods are responsible for deleterious effects related to the absorption of nutrients and micronutrients.

  1 aWolf, A.10aFifty year record of change in tree spatial patterns within a mixed deciduous forest  ap. 212-223.  aRipley's K-function was used to investigate the changes in spatial pattern among trees in a semi-natural mixed deciduous forest in Denmark over 50 years, from 1948 to 2001. Trees larger than 10 cm diameter in breast height (dbh) were mapped at 10-year intervals in 16 blocks within two former compartments. At the start of the observation, trees were found to be regularly distributed at distances less than 10 m. This pattern changed with time in different ways, depending on tree density at the beginning of the recording. Tree density has a greater influence on the number of recruits than on the number of dead trees. New recruits were significantly aggregated and positively correlated with dead trees, which suggests that regeneration occurred in canopy gaps. Compartments with many new recruits therefore showed a change in pattern towards more random distribution or even towards aggregation. In blocks with high basal area and few recruits, the pattern changed only slightly. Past management was found to be important in generating the patterns of tree distribution. 3aforest trees 3adeciduous forests 3aspatial distribution 3atree growth 3atree and stand measurements 3aforest stands 3astand density 3aplant competition 3atree mortality 3adead wood 3atemporal variation 3ahistory 3aDenmark 0aRipley's K-function0 tForest ecology and management.g2005 Aug. 25, v. 215, no. 1-3 p.212-223wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2005.05.0213electronic resource  a20060915b20061003c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/09/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03119naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072001700153072001700170072001700187072001700204100001200221245008300233300001600316520159300332650001501925650001601940650001801956650002101974650002001995650001702015650001002032650002102042650001502063650001702078650001602095653002502111653002402136653002502160653002902185700001202214700001102226700001102237700001402248700001402262700001402276700001102290773009302301852000902394856009302403930003302496945002502529946001102554655001202565IND4384353620221119075051.0061013e20060331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438435362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMai, K.10aDietary methionine requirement of large yellow croaker, Pseudosciaena crocea R  ap. 564-572.  aA feeding trial was conducted to determine the dietary methionine requirement of juvenile large yellow croaker (initial body weight 1.23 ± 0.02 g). The basal diet contained 43% crude protein from fish meal, soybean meal, yeast, wheat meal and crystalline amino acids with 0.65% methionine and 0.29% cystine on a dry diet basis. Six diets were formulated with six graded levels of methionine (0.66% to 1.89% in about 0.25% increment). Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 180 juvenile fish in seawater floating net cages (1.0 × 1.0 × 1.5 m). Fish were fed twice daily (05:00 and 17:30) to apparent satiation for 10 weeks. The water temperature fluctuated from 27 to 30 °C, salinity from 25‰ to 28‰ and dissolved oxygen was approximately 7 mg l− 1 during the experimental period. Specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) increased with increasing levels of methionine up to 1.41% diet (P < 0.05), and thereafter, declined. No significant differences in body composition were found among dietary treatments. On the basis of either SGR or FCE, the optimum dietary methionine requirements of juvenile large yellow croaker were estimated to be 1.44% of diet (3.34% of dietary protein) and 1.39% of diet (3.22% of dietary protein), respectively, using second-order polynomial regression analysis. Hence, the corresponding requirements of this fish for total sulfur amino acids (Met + Cys) were calculated to be 1.73% of diet (4.02% of dietary protein) and 1.68% of diet (3.91% of dietary protein), respectively. 3aSciaenidae 3amarine fish 3aanimal growth 3abody composition 3afeed conversion 3afish feeding 3afeeds 3afeed composition 3amethionine 3afish culture 3amariculture 0aPseudosciaena crocea 0aLarimichthys crocea 0aspecific growth rate 0aprotein efficiency ratio1 aWan, J.1 aAi, Q.1 aXu, W.1 aLiufu, Z.1 aZhang, L.1 aZhang, C.1 aLi, H.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Mar. 31, v. 253, no. 1-4 p.564-572wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.08.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20070802b20070902c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/08/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02163naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009700124500019500221520113200416650002301548650002001571650002601591650001701617650002101634700001801655700001601673773010401689852000901793930003301802945001301835946001301848655001201861IND2059016320221119075027.0970816s1997    dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205901632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaczk, M.10aalpha-Galactosides of sucrose in foods: composition, flatulence-causing effects, and removal  aDeveloped from a symposium sponsored by the Division of Agricultural and Food Chemistry at the 210th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, August 20-25, 1995, Chicago, Illinois.  aAlpha-galactosides of sucrose, namely raffinose, stachyose and verbascose, are widely distributed in higher plant, especially leguminous seeds. In addition the presence of galactopinitol, galactinol, mannitriose and melibiose in Brassica campestris, soybean and some legumes has been reported. Due to the absence of galactosidase activity in human and animal intestine mucosa, these oligosaccharides escape digestion and they are metabolized by bacteria to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane. Thus, they are considered to be the principal flatulence-causing factors present in food of plant origin. Furthermore, starch and hemicellulose may contribute to flatulence. A significant positive correlation, between the hydrogen production by rat and the content of alpha-galactosides of sucrose in legumes consumed, has been reported. Various methods for the removal of flatulence causing oligosaccharides including dehulling, soaking and/or cooking in water and in buffer solutions, irradiation, enzymatic treatment, germination and solvent extraction have been investigated. The pros and cons of these procedures are discussed. 3afood contamination 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases 3afood quality 3afood composition1 aAmarowicz, R.1 aShahidi, F.0 tAntinutrients and phytochemicals in food.dWashington, DC : American Chemical Society, c1997.7nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01691naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005500128500019500183520076000378650002001138650002601158650001701184650002101201700001901222773010401241852000901345930003301354945001301387946001301400655001201413IND2059017620221119074945.0970816s1997    dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205901762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRickard, S.E.10aInteractions and biological effects of phytic acid  aDeveloped from a symposium sponsored by the Division of Agricultural and Food Chemistry at the 210th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, August 20-25, 1995, Chicago, Illinois.  aPhytic acid is a compound found in cereal grains, legumes, nuts and oilseeds. It is considered to be an antinutrient due to its ability to bind minerals, proteins and starch at physiological pH. However, recent evidence indicates that phytic acid has healthful effects. Reductions in glycemic response to starchy foods as well as lower plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been observed with endogenous phytate consumed in foods or with the addition of purified sodium phytate. In addition, phytic acid has anticancer effects in the colon and mammary gland in rodent models and in various tumor cell lines in vitro. In view of these beneficial effects, the term "antinutrient" used to describe food constituents like PA needs to be reevaluated. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases 3afood quality 3afood composition1 aThompson, L.U.0 tAntinutrients and phytochemicals in food.dWashington, DC : American Chemical Society, c1997.7nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02582naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245011400181300001800295500002400313520095600337650002601293650002501319650003701344650002301381650001701404650001101421650001801432650001301450650001201463650005801475650002301533650002901556650002501585650001801610650003601628650002901664650002701693650002201720650002201742651001001764651001001774700002201784700001701806700001801823700001901841773009801860852000901958856008501967655001202052IND4441019420221119075024.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444101942DNAL7 a205266362pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0710-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Neha10aTomato leaf curl Bangalore virus (ToLCBV): infectivity and enhanced pathogenicity with diverse betasatellites  ap. 1343-1347.  aIncludes references  aGenomic components of a begomovirus isolated from tomato plants showing leaf curl and stunting symptoms in farmer's fields at Hessarghatta village near Bangalore, India, were cloned by rolling-circle amplification.

Accumulation of information on the genetic heterogeneity of porcine viruses is pivotal for readily characterising unusual human strains. Screening of 292 fecal samples, collected from 4-5- to 8-9-week-old asymptomatic pigs from four herds in Ireland between 2005 and 2007 resulted in 19 (6.5%) samples testing positive by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for GARV. The strains were molecularly characterized to collate data on the VP7 and partial VP4 outer capsid genes. By sequence analysis of the VP7 gene, the Irish strains were identified as G2, G4, G5, G9 and G11 viruses. The G11 strains were closely related to other human and porcine G11 strains, while the G2 strains resembled porcine G2 viruses detected recently in Europe and southern Asia. The G4 strains were distantly related to other G4 human and animal strains, constituting a separate G4 VP7 lineage. Analysis of the G5 strains revealed that they were similar to a selection of G5 human and porcine strains, while the G9 strains resembled other porcine G9 viruses. By sequence analysis of the VP8* fragment of the VP4, the Irish viruses were characterised as P[6], P[7], P[13], P[13]/[22], P[26] and P[32]. 3aRotavirus 3aenteritis 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic heterogeneity 3aherds 3ahumans 3apiglets 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxgenetics 2aCapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aFecesxvirology 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aRotavirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRotavirus Infectionsxphysiopathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSwinexvirology 2aSwine Diseasesxphysiopathologyxvirology. 3aIreland 3aSouthern European region 0aIreland1 aMartella, V.1 aSleator, R.

  1 aAnantasomboon, G.10aUnique lesions and viral-like particles found in growth retarded black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon from East Africa  ap. 197-203.  aThe problem of growth retardation in cultured black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon was observed at one commercial shrimp farm in East Africa in mid 2004. The mean body weight of the shrimp at the sixth month in affected ponds was only 19 ± 4 g, which was 30% less than the expected size of normal shrimp grown within the same period at this farm. A preliminary examination for pathogenic bacteria, parasites and viruses revealed mild bacterial infections in a few specimens but all were negative for 7 known pathogenic shrimp viruses, either by assays using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology or by histological examination. A subsequent examination of a second lot of samples prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of previously undescribed lesions in the lymphoid organ and gills. In semithin sections stained with toluidine blue, these were apparent as large cytoplasmic inclusions that were not visible in normal tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. By TEM, the cytoplasmic inclusions contained large numbers of non-enveloped, icosahedral virions of approximately 25 nm diameter. Given the unique nature of the lesions and the negative results with molecular tests for known shrimp viruses, it is possible that the particles seen constitute a new viral pathogen of shrimp. The retarded growth problem in East Africa resembles a similar problem called monodon slow growth syndrome (MSGS) that has been problematic with P. monodon in Thailand since 2001. Whether the slow growth in Africa and Thailand are due to the same or related pathogens or some other factor(s) remains to be explored. 3aPenaeus monodon 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3alesions (animal) 3aultrastructure 3ahistopathology 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aEastern Africa 0aviral-like particles 0ashrimp farming 0amonodon slow growth syndrome1 aSriurairatana, S.1 aFlegel, T.W.1 aWithyachumnarnkul, B.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Mar. 31, v. 253, no. 1-4 p.197-203wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.08.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02652naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012000181300001800301500002400319520103900343650002401382650001601406650001401422650001401436650003001450650001201480650004001492650005301532650002601585650003901611650005901650650002501709650003101734650005201765650003201817650001901849700001901868700001301887700001701900700002001917700001301937700001601950773009801966852000902064856008502073655001202158IND4441017720221119074704.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444101772DNAL7 a205329292pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0701-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanzarin, V.10aDevelopment and validation of a real-time TaqMan PCR assay for the detection of betanodavirus in clinical specimens  ap. 1193-1203.  aIncludes references  aBetanodaviruses are the causal agents of viral encephalo-retinopathy, an infectious disease affecting more than 40 marine fish species, characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Because of its severe impact, robust diagnostic tools are required. The aim of this work was to develop and validate a real-time TaqMan PCR assay to detect betanodaviruses in clinical specimens by amplifying a conserved region of the RNA2 strand. The method proved to be specific and sensitive, being capable of detecting as low as 10 TCID₅₀/ml. For clinical validation, samples from 100 marine fish were collected during a natural outbreak of disease and tested by three distinct laboratory methods, namely real-time TaqMan PCR, RT-seminested PCR and virus isolation. The results indicated optimal agreement between tests. The assay that was developed is capable of detecting members of all of the betanodavirus genetic groups currently described and can be considered a valid alternative to the time-consuming and contamination-prone nested PCR. 3ainfectious diseases 3amarine fish 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aFish Diseasesxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aNodaviridaexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPerciformesxvirology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA Virus Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinaryxvirology. 2aRNA, Viralxanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTaq Polymerase1 aPatarnello, P.1 aMori, A.1 aRampazzo, E.1 aCappellozza, E.1 aBovo, G.1 aCattoli, G.0 tArchives of virology.g2010 Aug., v. 155, no. 8 p.1193-1203dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-010-0701-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02775naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001200164245011300176300001800289500002400307500001500331520093700346650002101283650002401304650001101328650001501339650001001354650001301364650000801377650001001385650001601395650001201411650003201423650003201455650008701487650006601574650002801640650001501668650002701683650001001710650004401720650004901764651001301813651001001826651002501836653002201861700001301883700002401896700002401920700002201944700002701966773009801993852000902091856008502100655001202185IND4441017920221119074601.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444101792DNAL7 a205125142pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0706-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJinshan10aMolecular and serological survey of hepatitis E virus infection among domestic pigs in Inner Mongolia, China  ap. 1217-1226.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of swine hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in Inner Mongolia, China, serum samples obtained from 356 2- to 4-month-old pigs on 14 farms in Inner Mongolia were tested for the presence of anti-HEV antibodies and HEV RNA. Overall, 186 pigs (52%) tested positive for anti-HEV antibodies, while 30 pigs (8%) had detectable HEV RNA levels. The 30 HEV isolates recovered from the viremic pigs were phylogenetically classified into genotype 4 and differed from each other by up to 15.3% in a 412 nt sequence within ORF2. The Inner Mongolian swine HEV strains were most similar to human or swine HEV strains isolated in the other provinces of China but differed by 15.9-18.9% from those in Mongolia (formerly known as Outer Mongolia). These results indicate that farm pigs in Inner Mongolia are frequently infected with markedly divergent genotype 4 HEV strains that may be indigenous to China. 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aserological surveys 3ahumans 3aantibodies 3afarms 3agenotype 3aRNA 3aswine 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxvirology 2aHepatitis Antibodiesxblood 2aHepatitis E virusxclassificationxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aHepatitis, Viral, Animalxepidemiologyximmunologyxvirology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPrevalence 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aViremiaxepidemiologyximmunologyxvirology. 3aMongolia 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology. 0aHepatitis E virus1 aJirintai1 aManglai, Dugarjavin1 aTakahashi, Masaharu1 aNagashima, Shigeo1 aOkamoto, H.q(Hiroaki)0 tArchives of virology.g2010 Aug., v. 155, no. 8 p.1217-1226dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-010-0706-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02582naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010900183300001600292500002400308520127800332650002201610650001201632650001801644650001601662650001601678650001701694650001501711650000701726650002401733650005701757650001201814650002901826650001701855650003101872650002601903700001201929773012501941852000902066856008502075655001202160IND4441299120221119074626.0100813s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444129912DNAL7 a204370782pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-010-0726-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Bing-Feng10aProduction of tetramethylpyrazine by batch culture of Bacillus subtilis with optimal pH control strategy  ap. 815-821.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of initial culture pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.5 on biomass content, precursor 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (HB) accumulation, and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine (TTMP) formation by Bacillus subtilis CCTCC M 208157 were investigated in shake flask fermentation. Weak acidic conditions were found to favor cell growth and precursor HB accumulation, while TTMP could be synthesized more efficiently in conditions with initial pH towards neutrality. Batch bioprocess of TTMP fermentation by Bacillus subtilis CCTCC M 208157 at various controlled pH values ranging from 5.5 to 7.0 was then examined in 7.5-l fermentor. The results suggested that optimum pH for cell growth and precursor HB accumulation was 5.5 with maximum cell growth rate (Q x) and precursor HB accumulation rate (Q HB) of 0.833 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹ and 1.118 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹, respectively, while optimum pH for TTMP formation was 7.0 with maximum TTMP formation rate (Q TTMP) of 0.095 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹. A pH-shifted strategy was accordingly developed to improve TTMP production in bioreactor fermentation by shifting the culture pH from 5.5 to 7.0 after 48 h of cultivation. By applying the strategy, final TTMP concentration of 7.43 g l⁻¹ was obtained, being 22.2% greater than that of constant-pH fermentation. 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiomass 3abioprocessing 3abioreactors 3acell growth 3afermentation 3afermenters 3apH 2aAcetoinxmetabolism 2aBacillus subtilisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPyrazinesxmetabolism1 aXu, Yan0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 37, no. 8 p.815-821dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-010-0726-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02764naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245008500193300001600278500002400294520122200318650003301540650002401573650001601597650000901613650001601622650001401638650000901652650002001661650000901681650001401690650001501704650001401719650001701733650001201750650001601762650006601778650006001844650004101904650002101945650003801966650001502004650005102019700001602070773010802086852000902194856005502203655001202258IND4450560520221119074720.0110311e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445056052DNAL7 a212947492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2761.2010.01232.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStröm-Bestor, M.10aInhibitory activity of Pseudomonas sp. on Flavobacterium psychrophilum, in vitro  ap. 255-264.  aIncludes references  aA Pseudomonas sp. isolate MSB1 efficiently inhibited the growth of Flavobacterium psychrophilum of different serotypes on agar medium. A significant difference in the inhibition was observed between isolates of the less virulent FpT serotype compared to the Fd and Th serotypes. In broth coculture experiments, a low number of cells of MSB1 inhibited and outcompeted the F. psychrophilum cells. Also cell-free culture supernatant of MSB1 clearly repressed the growth of F. psychrophilum. A chromoazurol S assay suggested that MSB1 produced efficient siderophores, which most probably were responsible for the iron deficiency in the supernatant. The limited growth of F. psychrophilum in the supernatant was found to be partly because of the lack of available iron, but the results also indicated that some other mechanisms were probably involved in the observed inhibition. A potential use of MSB1 as a probiotic in rainbow trout aquaculture, especially in early life stages of the fish, is suggested, but future in vivo experiments needs to be carried out to verify this suggestion. This study also indicates a low iron acquisition efficiency of F. psychrophilum, compared to other examined bacterial fish pathogens. 3aFlavobacterium psychrophilum 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPseudomonas 3aagar 3aaquaculture 3acoculture 3afish 3ain vivo studies 3airon 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3aserotypes 3asiderophores 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aFish Diseasesxmicrobiologyxmortalityxprevention & control. 2aFlavobacteriaceae Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aFlavobacteriumxgrowth & development 2aIronxmetabolism 2aOncorhynchus mykissxmicrobiology 2aProbiotics 2aPseudomonasxgrowth & developmentxphysiology.1 aWiklund, T.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2011 Apr., v. 34, no. 4 p.255-264dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2010.01232.x 7aarticle02614naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001500186245010300201300001800304500002400322500001500346506007600361520068400437506003701121650001301158650002201171650002501193650001101218650002101229650002601250650001201276650003501288650001201323650006301335650005801398650002501456650002201481650002001503650003501523650001101558650002501569650000901594650002401603650005101627650002901678653001701707700001901724700001801743700002101761700001301782700002501795773009801820852000901918856008501927655001202012IND4441017620221207070415.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444101762DNAL7 a205210692pmid7 aPMC29245752pmcid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0709-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yan10aCharacterization of conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies against rabies virus nucleoprotein  ap. 1187-1192.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThree anti-rabies virus (RABV) nucleoprotein (N) monoclonal antibodies (Mab) were characterized by immunofluorescence assays, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.

These data, together with epitope mapping studies, suggest that two anti-N Mabs recognize conformational epitopes located within the N-terminal region of the RABV N protein. The availability of Mabs specific for both linear and epitope-specific antibodies should prove valuable for rabies diagnosis as well as for RABV N protein structure-function studies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepitopes 3aRabies lyssavirus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3arabies 3aWestern blotting 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aviruses 3afluorescent antibody technique 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxchemistryximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aAntibodies, Viralxchemistryximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aAntibody Specificity 2aBlotting, Western 2aEpitope Mapping 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aNucleocapsid Proteinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aRabies virusximmunology 0aRabies virus1 aLuo, Yonghuang1 aMichel, Frank1 aHogan, Robert J.1 aHe, Ying1 aFu, Z.

Hypotheses have emphasized the importance of both environmental and spatial factors. Much of the uncertainty about the relative role of these processes can be attributed to the limited number of comparative studies that evaluate multiple potential mechanisms. This study examines the relative importance of six variables: temperature, precipitation, productivity, habitat heterogeneity, area, and the mid-domain effect on patterns of species richness for non-volant small mammals along four neighboring mountain ranges in central Utah. Along each of these elevational gradients, a hump-shaped relationship of richness with elevation is evident. This study evaluates whether the processes shaping this common pattern are also common to all gradients. Model selection indicates that no one factor or set of factors best explains patterns of species richness across all gradients, and drivers of diversity may vary seasonally. These findings suggest that commonality in the pattern of species richness, even among elevational gradients with a similar biogeographic history and fauna, cannot be attributed to a simple universal explanation. 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3ahabitats 3amountains 3asmall mammals 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aUtah0 tEcography.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.411-422dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2008.05538.x 7aarticle03619naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245013100190300001800321500002400339500001500363520161100378650001601989650001302005650001402018650001802032650001502050650001402065650001802079650001902097650002002116650001402136650003902150650003002189650006602219650001602285650002002301650001902321650003902340650004202379650003502421650001102456650003002467650005302497650001702550650002602567650005202593650006402645653001602709700002802725700001902753700002002772700002102792773009802813852000902911856008502920655001203005IND4441017820221119074718.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444101782DNAL7 a205089562pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0704-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera-Toledo, Evelyn10aDecreased CD4 and wide-ranging expression of other immune receptors after HIV-envelope-mediated formation of syncytia in vitro  ap. 1205-1216.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn human HIV infection, multinucleated cells (syncytia) are formed by fusion of HIV-infected cells with CD4⁺ cells. In order to examine possible functional implications of syncytia formation for the immune response, the expression of important surface molecules by T-cell syncytia and surrounding cells that remain unfused (bystander cells) was analyzed in cocultures of HIV-Env- and CD4-expressing E6 Jurkat T cells. Fusion partners were differentially labeled with lipophilic probes, and syncytia and bystander cells were identified by flow cytometry. The cellular phenotype and response to activation stimulus after fusion were analyzed with antibodies coupled to third-party fluorochromes. Cocultured unfused E6 cells showed a marked decrease in CD4 expression, suggesting the selective recruitment of cells strongly expressing CD4 into syncytia. However, the incorporated CD4 was not detected in the syncytia, whereas the range of expression of CD28, ICAM-1, CXCR4 and CD3 was wider than that of unfused cells. Limited expression of CD4 in the bystander unfused population, as well as in the newly formed syncytia, would result in limitation of further viral entry and a failure to identify these cells, and it could partially contribute to functional impairment and a decrease in the number of CD4⁺ T cells in AIDS. Most of the syncytia were viable and expressed CD25 and IL-2 in response to activation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomicyn. Thus, syncytia populations harboring widely heterogeneous levels of receptors would constitute a potential source of anomalous immune function. 3agiant cells 3aacetates 3aphenotype 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3acoculture 3ainterleukin-2 3aflow cytometry 3aimmune response 3areceptors 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 2aCD4 Antigensxmetabolism. 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunologyxphysiologyxvirology. 2aCell Fusion 2aDown-Regulation 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGiant Cellsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aHIV Infectionsximmunologyxvirology. 2aHIV-1ximmunologyxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-2xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunitxmetabolism 2aJurkat Cells 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aReceptors, Immunologicximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aenv Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virusxmetabolism 0arecruitment1 aLópez-Balderas, Nayali1 aHuerta, Leonor1 aLamoyi, Edmundo1 aLarralde, Carlos0 tArchives of virology.g2010 Aug., v. 155, no. 8 p.1205-1216dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-010-0704-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02170naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245013700177300001600314500002400330520062300354650001000977650003500987650001401022650001101036650000901047650001801056650002601074650002901100650001601129650002001145650003001165650006901195650004101264651001001305651001001315653001201325653003001337653001401367653001801381700001901399700001701418700001801435773012901453852000901582856008501591655001201676IND4440988120221119074853.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444098812DNAL7 a206522202pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-010-0084-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Ke10aConcentrations and Profiles of Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans in Bank Soils Collected from Dongting Lake, China  ap. 174-178.  aIncludes references  aTwelve bank soil samples from the Dongting Lake area were determined to investigate the concentrations and distributions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs).

E827-E833.  aTo optimize artificial nutrition (AN) techniques for patients suffering from malnutrition or reduced intestinal absorption, utilization of energy fuels, especially glucose, requires better understanding. Because the liver plays a key role in glucose homeostasis, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of continuous intragastric and intravenous nutrition on insulin secretion and several markers of liver glucose metabolism, especially glucose transporter GLUT-2. Wistar male rats underwent catheterization of either stomach (intragastric) or vena cava (intravenous) and received 24 h/day the same all-in-one formula over 7 or 14 days. The metabolic parameters from intragastrically fed rats did not differ significantly from those from orally fed control rats. Intravenous nutrition induced insulin resistance (marked hyperinsulinemia and/or mild hyperglycemia) and reduced liver GLUT-2 protein and mRNA levels. The decrease in liver GLUT-2 gene expression might be mediated either by an inhibitory role of hyperinsulinemia or by the decrease in gut or portal factors. These results suggest that the route of nutrient delivery influences their utilization by the liver. 3atotal parenteral nutrition 3ainsulin 3agenes 3agene expression 3aproteins 3aliver 3arats 3aanimal models 0aglut-2 gene1 aLeturque, A.1 aGuihot, G.1 aLoizeau, M.1 aLavie, S.1 aColomer, S.1 aRicour, C.1 aGirard, J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1995 Nov., v. 269, no. 5:pt.1 p.E827-E833x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03802naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245013000176300001400306520209500320650002302415650001702438650001702455650001002472650001502482650002602497650001102523650001602534650001502550650001202565650001502577650001302592650001202605650001502617650001202632650001002644650000902654650001302663650001102676650001402687650001402701650001002715650001002725651001002735653001802745653002702763653001902790653003902809700002002848700002202868700002102890700002002911773011202931852000903043856009203052930003303144946001103177655001203188IND4438011220221119074604.0100604e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443801122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-697X.2010.00177.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamashita, Masayuki10aContrasting infection frequencies of Neotyphodium endophyte in naturalized Italian ryegrass populations in Japanese farmlands  ap. 71-76.  aNeotyphodium endophytes often confer benefits to their host grasses and may enhance invasiveness of some grasses. The knowledge of infection frequencies of endophytes among invading weed populations is necessary to understand the relationships between endophyte infection and invasiveness. Here we present data on infection frequencies of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), an important weed in some farmlands in Japan, persisting in contrasting farmlands: a terraced paddy field and a wheat-soybean double-cropped field in the western region of Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. The terraced paddy site is a mosaic of several landscape elements such as paddy fields, levees, fallow and abandoned fields, with a high percentage of non-crop area. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been cultivated for more than a decade with no application of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides. The wheat-soybean field is characterized by the aggregation of large-scaled fields that were originally reconstructed paddy fields, showing a low percentage of non-crop area. Wheat and soybean have been grown as winter and summer crops, respectively, using chemical fertilizers and herbicides. We examined the presence or absence of endophytes in a total of 1200 seeds sampled from the two Italian ryegrass populations. The terraced paddy population exhibited a markedly high infection frequency (91.0%), due possibly to selective feeding of non-infected seeds by insects. In contrast, the wheat-soybean farmland population showed almost no infection (1.1%), whereas the putative source of the invasion in the proximity exhibited a relatively high infection rate (64.4%). Such a micro-scale variation in infection frequencies may be attributable to a loss in endophyte viability within the wheat-soybean field. The findings suggest that endophyte infection frequency may markedly differ among the Italian ryegrass populations even within the same region, presumably depending on the abundance of the seed-eating insects, farmland management regimes and/or environmental conditions such as soil humidity. 3aLolium multiflorum 3aNeotyphodium 3aOryza sativa 3acrops 3aendophytes 3aenvironmental factors 3afallow 3afertilizers 3afungicides 3agrasses 3aherbicides 3ahumidity 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3apaddies 3aseeds 3asoil 3asoybeans 3asummer 3aterracing 3aviability 3aweeds 3awheat 3aJapan 0aFarmland weed 0aNeotyphodium endophyte 0aterraced paddy 0awheat-soybean double-cropped field1 aIwamoto, Miyuki1 aMaruyama, Keisuke1 aIchihara, Minoru1 aSawada, Hitoshi0 tGrassland science.g2010 June, v. 56, no. 2 p.71-76dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1744-69617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-697X.2010.00177.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02138naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245010100189300001600290520069700306650001101003650001201014650001101026650000901037650001901046650002501065650001401090650004501104650009501149653002801244653002301272653002901295653001101324653003401335700002001369700001601389700002701405773011501432852000901547856009201556930003301648946001101681655001201692IND4438011720221119074619.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443801172DNAL7 a203315392pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-1716.2010.02108.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Boer, T.P.14aThe mammalian KIR2.x inward rectifier ion channel family: expression pattern and pathophysiology  ap. 243-256.  aInward rectifier currents based on KIR2.x subunits are regarded as essential components for establishing a stable and negative resting membrane potential in many excitable cell types.

Nodulation (nod) genes used for this process are located in a cluster on the pSym-a megaplasmid of R. meliloti. These genes include nodP and nodQ (here termed nodPQ), which encode ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase, enzymes that catalyze the conversion of ATP and SO4(2-) into the activated sulfate form 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), an intermediate in cysteine synthesis. In Rhizobium, PAPS is also a precursor for sulfated and N-acylated oligosaccharide Nod-factor signals that cause symbiotic responses on specific host plants such as alfalfa. We previously found a highly conserved second copy of nodPQ in R. meliloti. We report here the mapping and cloning of this second copy, and its location on the second megaplasmid, pSym-b. The function of nodP(2)Q(2) is equivalent to that of nodP(1)Q(1) in complementation tests of R. meliloti and Escherichia coli mutants in ATP sulfurylase and adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase. Mutations in nodP(2)Q(2) do not have as severe an effect on symbiosis or plant host range as do those in nodP(1)Q(1), however, possibly reflecting differences in expression and/or channeling of metabolites to specific enzymes involved in sulfate transfer. Strains mutated or deleted for both copies of nodQ are severely defective in symbiotic phenotypes, but remain prototrophic. This suggests the existence in R. meliloti of a third locus for ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase activities. We have found a new locus saa (sulfur amino acid), which may also encode these activities. 3aloci 3astructural genes 3asulfates 3arestriction mapping 3aVicia sativa 3aMedicago sativa 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aplasmids 3anodulation 3anucleotidyltransferases 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aPlasmids 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSinorhizobium melilotixgenetics 2aSulfatesxmetabolism 2aSymbiosis 0akinases 0asulfate adenylyltransferase 0asulfates (organic salts) 0aactivated sulfate 0aadenylylsulfate kinases 0aatp sulfurylase 0achromosome mapping 0aaps kinase 0amelilotus alba 0aphosphotransferases (kinases) 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aLong, S.R.0 tGenetics.g1992 Dec., v. 132, no. 4 p.899-909x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03331naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072001700172072001700189072001700206100001800223245020200241300001800443500001500461520160300476650001702079650002002096650002302116650002002139650001302159650002102172650001502193650001102208650001202219650003502231650004102266650002202307650004402329650002402373651001202397653001802409653002802427653002602455700001902481700001602500700001902516773008702535852000902622856007702631930003302708945002502741946001102766655001202777IND4382548820221119074610.0060804e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438254882DNAL7 a164875672pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Grizzly bears in the GYE were listed as threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1975 and were proposed for delisting in 2005. However, questions remain about key bear foods. For example, ACMs are agricultural pests and concern exists about whether they contain pesticides that could be toxic to bears. Consequently, we investigated whether ACMs contain and transport pesticides to bear foraging sites and, if so, whether these levels could be toxic to bears. In 1999 we collected and analyzed ACMs from six bear foraging sites. ACMs were screened for 32 pesticides with gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC–ECD). Because gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) can be more sensitive than GC–ECD for certain pesticides, we revisited one site in 2001 and analyzed these ACMs with GC–MS/MS. ACMs contained trace or undetectable levels of pesticides in 1999 and 2001, respectively. Based on chemical levels in ACMs and numbers of ACMs a bear can consume, we calculated the potential of chemicals to reach physiological toxicity. These calculations indicate bears do not consume physiologically toxic levels of pesticides and allay concerns they are at risk from pesticides transported by ACMs. If chemical control of ACMs changes in the future, screening new ACM samples taken from bear foraging sites may be warranted. 3aUrsus arctos 3abioaccumulation 3apesticide residues 3arisk assessment 3aforaging 3aEuxoa auxiliaris 3afood chain 3aimagos 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effects 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMothsxmetabolism 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aUrsidaexphysiology 3aWyoming 0aadult insects 0aUrsus arctos horribilis 0atrophic relationships1 aSchwartz, C.C.1 aPetty, J.D.1 aBrussard, P.E.0 tChemosphere.g2006 Sept., v. 64, no. 10 p.1704-1712wJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.01.0063electronic resource  a20060901b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03250naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001900150245005900169300001800228520167000246650002801916650001501944650001601959650002701975650001202002650002102014650001202035650001202047650001502059650002602074650001002100650001202110650001202122650001202134650002702146650002302173650003802196650001102234650003402245650000902279650001202288650001202300650001302312650002802325650002002353650002702373650003402400650001702434653002002451653003202471700002102503773006902524852000902593939003302602946001302635655001202648IND9300787320221119075014.0930208e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078732DNAL7 a14594262pmid7 aPMC12052272pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyazaki, W.Y.10aSister-chromatid misbehavior in Drosophila ord mutants  ap. 1047-1061.  aIn Drosophila males and females mutant for the ord gene, sister chromatids prematurely disjoin in meiosis. We have isolated five new alleles of ord and analyzed them both as homozygotes and in trans to deficiencies for the locus, and we show that ord function is necessary early in meiosis of both sexes. Strong ord alleles result in chromosome nondisjunction in meiosis I that appears to be the consequence of precocious separation of the sister chromatids followed by their random segregation. Cytological analysis in males confirmed that precocious disjunction of the sister chromatids occurs in prometaphase I. This is in contrast to Drosophila mei-S332 mutants, in which precocious sister-chromatid separation also occurs, but not until late in anaphase I. All three of the new female fertile ord alleles reduce recombination, suggesting they affect homolog association as well as sister-chromatid cohesion. In addition to the effect of ord mutations on meiosis, we find that in ord(2) mutants chromosome segregation is aberrant in the mitotic divisions that produce the spermatocytes. The strongest ord alleles, ord(2) and ord(5), appear to cause defects in germline divisions in the female. These alleles are female sterile and produce egg chambers with altered nurse cell number, size, and nuclear morphology. In contrast to the effects of ord mutations on germline mitosis, all of the alleles are fully viable even when in trans to a deficiency, and thus exhibit no essential role in somatic mitosis. The ord gene product may prevent premature sister-chromatid separation by promoting cohesion of the sister chromatids in a structural or regulatory manner. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3achromatids 3amutagenesis 3achromosome aberrations 3amutants 3astructural genes 3ameiosis 3aalleles 3agerm cells 3agenetic recombination 3amales 3afemales 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aChromatidsxphysiology 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aFemale 2aInfertility, Femalexgenetics 2aMale 2aMeiosis 2aMitosis 2aMutation 2aNondisjunction, Genetic 2aOvaryxcytology 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSpermatocytesxultrastructure 2aTime Factors 0anon-disjunction 0asister chromatid separation1 aOrr-Weaver, T.L.0 tGenetics.g1992 Dec., v. 132, no. 4 p.1047-1061x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02266naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024004100131040001800172100001700190245015500207300001800362506007600380520038000456506003700836650002700873650001700900650001100917650001400928650001000942650001000952650001200962650001300974650001400987650001401001650003001015650001401045650002101059650001201080650003501092650001101127650003401138650002601172650003001198650004601228650001301274650004201287700001601329700001501345700001601360700001801376700001701394773008201411852000901493856009101502930003301593945001301626946001301639655001201652IND2209108520221207062543.0010116e200006  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220910852DNAL7 a108165452pmid7 aPMC976762pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.68.6.3768-3771.20002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, P.R.10aMutation of waaN reduces Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-induced enteritis and net secretion of type III secretion system 1-dependent proteins  ap. 3768-3771.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMutation of waaN, a gene involved in lipid A biosynthesis, reduced enteropathogenic responses induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in bovine ligated ileal loops.

This approach would offer great flexibility since capillary modification methods are well known, and thus, with this kind of chip, different microfluidic devices having various functionalizations could be prepared. Electrophoretic separations were first achieved by integrating an empty capillary into the chip to evaluate the analytical performances of this system. They were compared to those obtained with a classical chip. Finally, an electrochromatographic separation involving a capillary containing a hexyl acrylate-based monolith was performed. These preliminary results show this approach to be promising. 3asilica 3acapillarity 3aorganic compounds 3amodels 3agel chromatography 3aelectrophoresis 2aAcrylatesxchemistry 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aCapillary Electrochromatographyxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aDimethylpolysiloxanesxchemistry 2aMicrofluidic Analytical Techniquesxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aParticle Size 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSilicon Dioxidexchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aSiliconesxchemistry 2aSurface Properties 2aTime Factors 0asize exclusion chromatography1 aDelaunay, Nathalie1 aRocca, Jean-Louis0 tJournal of separation science.g2007 Nov., v. 30, no. 17 p.3043-3049dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007001323Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03660naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024004100131040001800172100002100190245010400211300001800315506007600333520140600409506003701815650002601852650002701878650001301905650001401918650002601932650001201958650001101970650001601981650001401997650001202011650001702023650003202040650001802072650001302090650002402103650001202127650002302139650003102162650002702193650002402220650002202244650002202266650002202288650002802310650002302338650001202361650003402373650002802407650004402435650003902479650002802518700002002546700001702566700001502583700001902598700001902617700002002636700001702656773008202673852000902755856009102764930003302855945001302888946001302901655001202914IND2209107620221207062433.0010116e200006  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220910762DNAL7 a108165212pmid7 aPMC976522pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.68.6.3630-3634.20002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlievert, P.M.10aPyrogenic toxin superantigen site specificity in toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning in animals  ap. 3630-3634.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStaphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes express pyrogenic toxin superantigens (PTSAgs) that are associated with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP). Most PTSAgs cause TSS in deep-tissue infections, whereas only TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1) is associated with menstrual, vaginal TSS. In contrast, SFP has been linked only with staphylococcal enteroxtoxins (SEs). Because of the differential abilities of PTSAgs to cause systemic or localized symptoms in a site-dependent manner, the present study was undertaken to assess the toxins' abilities to cross mucosal barriers. The activity of three PTSAgs when delivered orally, vaginally, or intravenously to rabbits and orally to monkeys was investigated. TSST-1 induced shock via all three routes in rabbits. Although active when administered intravenously, SEC1 and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) did not cause symptoms when administered orally or vaginally. Only SEC1 induced emesis in the monkey feeding assays. TSST-1, albeit less stable than SEC1 and SPEA to pepsin, induced diarrhea in monkeys. Our results may explain the unique association of TSST-1 with menstrual TSS and why SPEA is only rarely associated with TSS after pharyngitis, despite being highly associated with TSS after subcutaneous infections. Finally, our studies indicate that enterotoxicity in SFP is not the result of superantigenicity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3adiarrhea 3aexotoxins 3aintravenous injection 3amonkeys 3apepsin 3apharyngitis 3apoisoning 3arabbits 3aseptic shock 3astaphylococcal intoxication 3asuperantigens 3avomiting 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBacterial Toxinsxtoxicity 2aEnterotoxinsxtoxicity 2aExotoxinsxtoxicity 2aMacaca nemestrina 2aMembrane Proteins 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPyrogensxtoxicity 2aRabbits 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aShock, Septicxetiology 2aStaphylococcal Food Poisoningxetiology 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxetiology 2aSuperantigensxtoxicity1 aJablonski, L.M.1 aRoggiani, M.1 aSadler, I.1 aCallantine, S.1 aMitchell, D.T.1 aOhlendorf, D.H.1 aBohach, G.A.0 tInfection and immunity.g2000 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.3630-3634x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.68.6.3630-3634.20003Available from publisher's Web site  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03720naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024002000133024001900153040001800172100001600190245014800206300001800354506007600372520183800448506003702286650003902323650002702362650002102389650001702410650001302427650002802440650002702468650002202495650001202517650001902529650002402548650002602572650001402598650001802612650001502630650001402645650001602659650002402675650001902699700002102718700002002739700001602759700001702775700001702792700001802809700001502827700002302842773008202865852000902947856009102956930003303047945001303080946001303093655001203106IND2209104120221207062640.0010116e200006  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220910412DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.68.6.3210-3218.20002doi7 aPMC975642pmcid7 a108164652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco, J.10aBrucella abortus and its closet phylogenetic relative, Ochrobactrum spp., differ in outer membrane permeability and cationic peptide resistance  ap. 3210-3218.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe outer membrane (OM) of the intracellular parasite Brucella abortus is permeable to hydrophobic probes and resistant to destabilization by polycationic peptides and EDTA. The significance of these unusual properties was investigated in a comparative study with the opportunistic pathogens of the genus Ochrobactrum, the closest known Brucella relative. Ochrobactrum spp. OMs were impermeable to hydrophobic probes and sensitive to polymyxin B but resistant to EDTA. These properties were traced to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) because (i) insertion of B. abortus LPS, but not of Escherichia coli LPS, into Ochrobactrum OM increased its permeability; (ii) permeability and polymyxin B binding measured with LPS aggregates paralleled the results with live bacteria; and (iii) the predicted intermediate results were obtained with B. abortus-Ochrobactrum anthropi and E. coli-O. anthropi LPS hybrid aggregates. Although Ochrobactrum was sensitive to polymyxin, self-promoted uptake and bacterial lysis occurred without OM morphological changes, suggesting an unusual OM structural rigidity. Ochrobactrum and B. abortus LPSs showed no differences in phosphate, qualitative fatty acid composition, or acyl chain fluidity. However, Ochrobactrum LPS, but not B. abortus LPS, contained galacturonic acid. B.abortus and Ochrobactrum smooth LPS aggregates had similar size and zeta potential (-12 to -15 mV). Upon saturation with polymyxin, zeta potential became positive (1 mV) for Ochrobactrum smooth LPS while remaining negative (-5 mV) for B. abortus smooth LPS, suggesting hindered access to inner targets. These results show that although Ochrobactrum and Brucella share a basic OM pattern, subtle modifications in LPS core cause markedly different OM properties, possibly reflecting the adaptive evolution of B. abortus to pathogenicity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aEscherichia coli 3aOchrobactrum 3abacteria 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afatty acid composition 3agalacturonic acid 3ahybrids 3ahydrophobicity 3alipopolysaccharides 3amembrane permeability 3aparasites 3apathogenicity 3aphosphates 3aphylogeny 3apolymyxin B 3asecondary infection 3azeta potential1 aBengoechea, J.A.1 aBrandenburg, K.1 aLindner, B.1 aSeydel, Uwe.1 aGonzalez, D.1 aZahringer, U.1 aMoreno, E.1 aMoriyón, Ignacio.0 tInfection and immunity.g2000 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.3210-3218x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.68.6.3210-3218.20003Available from publisher's Web site  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle04454naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024004100131040001800172100001200190245019000202300001800392506007600410520200000486506003702486650001302523650001602536650001302552650002302565650001302588650001602601650003702617650002002654650001302674650001302687650001802700650001502718650002602733650001402759650001002773650001902783650002202802650005602824650001202880650002602892650002702918650002402945650004702969650002303016650002803039650002003067650003603087650003003123650002203153650004903175650003203224650002703256650003603283650005303319650001003372700001903382700001903401700001703420700001803437773008203455852000903537856009103546930003303637945001303670946001303683655001203696IND2209107020221207062617.0010116e200006  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220910702DNAL7 a108165052pmid7 aPMC976362pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.68.6.3509-3515.20002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, R.10aInhibition of adhesion of Escherichia coli K88ac fimbria to its receptor, intestinal mucin-type glycoproteins, by a monoclonal antibody directed against a variable domain of the fimbria  ap. 3509-3515.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStrains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli that express K88 fimbriae are among the most common causes of diarrhea in young pigs. Adhesion of bacteria to receptors on intestinal epithelial cells, mediated by K88 fimbriae, is the initial step in the establishment of infection. Three antigenic variants of K88 fimbriae exist in nature: K88ab, K88ac, and K88ad. K88ac is the most prevalent and may be the only variant of significance in swine disease. Each K88 fimbrial variant is composed of multiple antigenic determinants. Some of these determinants are shared among the three variants and may be referred to as conserved epitopes, whereas other are unique to a specific variant and may be referred to as variable epitopes. In this study, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to either variable or conserved epitopes of K88ac fimbriae were produced. The specificity of each MAb was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent and immunoblot assays. Fab fragments were prepared from these MAbs and were tested for their ability to block the binding of K88-positive bacteria and purified fimbriae to porcine enterocyte brush border vesicles and purified K88 receptors, respectively. The purified receptors were intestinal mucin-type sialoglycoproteins (IMTGP) isolated from porcine enterocytes (A.K. Erickson, D.R. Baker, B.T. Bosworth, T.A. Casey, D.A. Benfield, and D.H. Francis, Infect.Immun.62:5404-5410, 1994). Fab fragments prepared from MAbs specific for variable epitopes blocked the binding of bacteria to brush borders and of fimbriae to IMTGP. However, those from MAbs specific for a conserved epitope did not. These observations indicate that the receptor-binding domain of a K88ac fimbria is contained, at least in part, within the antigenically variable epitopes of that fimbria. Epitope mapping for one of the MAbs, which recognizes a linear epitope on K88ac fimbriae, indicated that this MAB binds to the region from amino acid no. 64 to no. 107 on the major subunit of K88ac fimbriae.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3adiarrhea 3aenterocytes 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aepitope mapping 3aepitopes 3afimbriae 3aglycoproteins 3amicrovilli 3amonoclonal antibodies 3areceptors 3aswine 3aswine diseases 3atoxigenic strains 2aAdhesins, Escherichia coliximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterial 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aAntigens, Bacterial 2aAntigens, Surfaceximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aEnterocytesxmetabolism 2aEpitope Mapping 2aEscherichia colixpathogenicity 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aFimbriae Proteins 2aFimbriae, Bacterialximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aIntestinal Mucosaxcytology 2aMicrovillixmetabolism 2aMucinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfaceximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aSwine1 aAnderson, T.J.1 aErickson, A.K.1 aNelson, E.A.1 aFrancis, D.H.0 tInfection and immunity.g2000 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.3509-3515x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.68.6.3509-3515.20003Available from publisher's Web site  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02968naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245010200166300001800268500001500286520100100301650002201302650002001324650002101344650003001365650001801395650002501413650003901438650002501477650003201502650001901534650002401553650001201577650001801589650002301607650002301630650003001653650001601683650003001699650001801729650003301747650001101780650002801791650003101819650001301850650003901863650000901902650003401911650003901945650003401984650001902018653001402037653002802051653001602079653001502095700001402110700001402124700001502138773007602153852000902229939003302238946001102271655001202282IND9300784720221119074910.0930208e19921212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078472DNAL7 a13611732pmid7 aPMC5569892pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaseem, N.H.10aIsolation and analysis of the fission yeast gene encoding polymerase delta accessory protein PCNA  ap. 5111-5120.  a2019-12-04  aFive monoclonal antibodies raised against rat PCNA cross-reacted with a similiar protein in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. One of these was used to screen an S.pombe cDNA expression library. An incomplete cDNA was isolated and used to screen a genomic library, identifying a single gene, designated pcn1+ (proliferating cell nuclear antigen). The gene encodes a protein of 260 amino acids, with a deduced sequence 52% identical to human and rat PCNAs, which are 98.5% identical to each other. The budding yeast PCNA homologue POL30 is only 35% identical to the human and rat proteins. Pcn1 has a region near the C-terminus of particularly high homology to higher eukaryotic PCNA proteins. pcn1+ is essential for viability and delta pcn1 cells undergo aberrant DNA replication before cell cycle arrest. Overproduction of the protein leads to cell cycle delay in G2. Disruption of pcn1+ is complemented by the human PCNA gene, demonstrating that these genes are functional homologues. 3aSaccharomycetales 3aDNA replication 3astructural genes 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3acell division 3aamino acid sequences 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3anucleotide sequences 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Replicationxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungal 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlasmids 2aProliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen 2aRats 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgenetics 2aSchizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpores, Fungal 0apcn1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0aembl/x54857 0acell cycle1 aLabib, K.1 aNurse, P.1 aLane, D.P.0 tEMBO journal.g1992 Dec. 12, v. 11, no. 13 p.5111-5120x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02094naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245008700171300001400258500001500272520085800287650004501145650001401190650002301204650001701227650001401244650001501258650002101273653002101294653001401315653002301329700001301352700001301365700001501378700001201393700001101405773008801416852000901504856007801513930003301591945001301624946001101637655001201648IND2041430520221119074911.0940812e199404  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204143052DNAL7 a241858832pmid7 a10.1007/BF002223952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, K.10aRFLP-based phylogenetic analysis of wide compatibility varieties in Oryza sativa L  ap. 65-69.  a2019-12-05  aTwenty-one wide compatibility varieties (WCVs) of rice together with three indica and three japonica testers were assayed with 160 DNA probes that were selected to represent the entire RFLP map at an average interval of 11 cM. On the basis of four enzyme digestion 125 probes detected polymorphisms among the WCVs and subspecies' testers. Among these polymorphic probes there were 68 that could distinguish the indica from the japonica testers. Two dendrograms were constructed on the basis of 398 polymorphic fragments of 125 probes and 139 polymorphic fragments of 68 subspecies' differentiating probes in combination with single enzymes, respectively. The reliability and representativeness of the testers and the levels of DNA variations among WCVs were estimated.

The mechanism of virulence of Brucella spp. is not fully understood yet. Furthermore, genes that allow Brucella to reach the intracellular niche and to interact with host cells need to be identified. Using the genomic survey sequence (GSS) approach, we identified the gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter of B. abortus strain S2308. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by this gene exhibited 69 and 67% identity with the sequences of the ABC transporters encoded by the exsA genes of Rhizobium meliloti and Mesorhizobium loti, respectively. Additionally, B. abortus ExsA, like R. meliloti and M. loci ExsA, possesses ATP-binding motifs and the ABC signature domain features of a typical ABC transporter. Furthermore, ortholog group analysis placed B. abortus ExsA in ortholog group 6 of ABC transporters more likely to be involved in bacterial pathogenesis. In R. meliloti, ExsA is an exopolysaccharide transporter essential for alfalfa root nodule invasion and establishment of infection. To test the role of ExsA in Brucella pathogenesis, an exsA deletion mutant was constructed. Replacement of the wild-type exsA by recombination was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of Brucella genomic DNA. Decreased survival in mice of the Brucella deltaexsA mutant compared to the survival of parental strain S2308 demonstrated that ExsA is critical for full bacterial virulence. Additionally, the B. abortus exsA deletion mutant was used as a live vaccine. Challenge experiments revealed that the exsA mutant strain induced superior protective immunity in BALB/c mice compared to the protective immunity induced by strain S19 or RB51.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aABC transporters 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aDNA 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aMesorhizobium loti 3aSouthern blotting 3aalfalfa 3aamino acid sequences 3abrucellosis 3adomestic animals 3aexopolysaccharides 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3alive vaccines 3amice 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aroot nodules 3asurveys 3avirulence 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aAlphaproteobacteriaxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Vaccinesxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aBase Sequence 2aBrucella abortusxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aBrucellosisximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Deletion 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSinorhizobium melilotixgenetics 2aVirulence 0amolecular sequence data1 aFreitas, D.A.1 aMiyoshi, A.1 aAzevedo, V.1 aCampos, E.1 aCravero, S.L.1 aRossetti, O.1 aSplitter, G.1 aOliveira, S.C.0 tInfection and immunity.g2002 Sept., v. 70, no. 9 p.5036-5044x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.70.9.5036-5044.20023Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02187naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001800159245006100177300001600238500002400254500001500278520102700293650001801320650003101338650001201369650001601381650001701397650001901414653002001433700001901453700001801472700001901490773011101509852000901620856009101629930003301720945002501753946001101778655001201789IND4383427620221119074827.0060907e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438342762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1001 aYanniotis, S.10aAroma recovery by combining distillation with absorption  ap. 882-887.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA new method for aroma recovery during evaporation is presented, in which, the vapour generated in an evaporator passes through an absorber where a hygroscopic solution partially absorbs water vapour. The remaining aroma rich stream is subsequently condensed. Experiments were carried out using 60% LiBr solution as hygroscopic solution and methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, methyl butyrate and ethyl butyrate as aroma compounds. When 20% of the feed was evaporated the aroma compounds were completely stripped from the feed, while when 10% of the feed was evaporated methanol and ethanol partially stripped from the feed. A significant amount of methanol and ethanol was absorbed by the LiBr solution (21-46%), while 3-17% of ethyl acetate, methyl butyrate and ethyl butyrate, compounds of higher relative volatility, were absorbed.

Diverse bacteria such as α-, γ-, δ-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were cultured, some of which were previously uncultivable bacteria, potential novel strains with less than 95% similarity to their closest relatives and sponge symbionts growing only in the medium with the addition of sponge extract. According to 16S rDNA BLAST analysis, most of the bacteria were cultured from sponge for the first time, although similar phyla of bacteria have been previously recognized. The selective pressure of sponge extract on the cultured bacterial species was suggested, although the effect of sponge extract on bacterial community in high nutrient medium is not significant. Although α- and γ-Proteobacteria appeared to form the majority of the dominant cultivable bacterial communities of the four sponges, the composition of the cultivable bacterial community in the mixed culture was different, depending on the medium and sponge species. Greater bacterial diversity was observed in media C and CS for Stelletta tenuis, in media F and FS for Halichondria rugosa and Craniella australiensis. S. tenuis was found to have the highest cultivable bacterial diversity including α-, γ-, δ-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, followed by sponge Dysidea avara without δ-Proteobacteria, sponge Halichondria rugosa with only α-, γ-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and sponge C. australiensis with only α-, γ-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Based on this study, by the strategy of mixed cultivation integrated with microbial community DNA-based DGGE fingerprinting and phylogenetic analysis, the cultivable bacterial community of sponge could be revealed effectively. 3aFirmicutes 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3amixed culture 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aCulture Media 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethods 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aEcosystem 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxmethods 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPoriferaxmicrobiology 2aProteobacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSeawater 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aSouth China Sea 0aChina1 aHe, Liming1 aMiao, Xiaoling0 tCurrent microbiology.g2007 Dec., v. 55, no. 6 p.465-472dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-007-9035-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01126naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245003300130300001600163520032000179650001100499650002400510650002600534650001600560651001100576653001300587653003400600653002200634773009500656852000900751939003300760945000800793946001100801655001200812991585430440742620221119074304.0930111e19920912xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930001192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoham, J.10aEmergency feeding programmes  ap. 596-597.  aThe "failure to supply an adequate balance of foods and of poorly designed feeding programs" in emergency intervention situations is the subject of this Editorial.

Mitochondrial (mt) DNA rearrangement involving the atp6 gene was used as a molecular marker. To detect the mtDNA rearrangement, polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were designed to amplify the upstream region of the atp6 gene. The oligonucleotides homologous to the following three regions were synthesized: (1) trnfM, (2) ORF105 and (3) atp6. PCRs were conducted with a pair of the first and the third primers to detect normal mtDNA, and with the second and the third primers for Ogura-type mtDNA. All 15 Japanese cultivars yielded an amplification product which was the same as that of normal mtDNA, whereas some wild radishes gave the product specific to Ogura mtDNA. Twenty-four populations of wild radish were classified into three groups according to the frequency of Ogura-type mtDNA: (1) in ten populations, all four plants analyzed per population had normal type mtDNA, (2) in five populations, only plants with Ogura-type mtDNA were found, and (3) nine populations included both normal and Ogura-type mtDNAs. There were no geographical restrictions and no cline in the distribution of the plants with Ogura-type mtDNA. These results suggested that the Ogura-type male-sterile cytoplasm originated in wild radishes. 3aRaphanus sativus 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3amitochondrial DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acultivars 3awild plants 3agenetic markers 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3apopulation 3aJapan 0aatp6 gene1 aTerachi, T.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Mar., v. 87, no. 8 p.996-1000x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002257943Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02167naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007300130300001800203520129600221650002001517650000901537650002401546650002001570650001201590650002301602650002501625650001901650653002801669700002001697773006901717852000901786939003301795946001301828655001201841IND9300788020221119074429.0930208e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackinnon, M.J.14aThe effects of selection of linkage analysis for quantitative traits  ap. 1177-1185.  aThe effects of within-sample selection on the outcome of analyses detecting linkage between genetic markers and quantitative traits were studied. It was found that selection by truncation for the trait of interest significantly reduces the differences between marker genotype means thus reducing the power to detect linked quantitative trait loci (QTL). The size of this reduction is a function of proportion selected, the magnitude of the QTL effect, recombination rate between the marker locus and the QTL, and the allele frequency of the QTL. Proportion selected was the most influential of these factors on bias, e.g., for an allele substitution effect of one standard deviation unit, selecting the top 80%, 50% or 20% of the population required 2, 6 or 24 times the number of progeny, respectively, to offset the loss of power caused by this selection. The effect on power was approximately linear with respect to the size of gene effect, almost invariant to recombination rate, and a complex function of QTL allele frequency. It was concluded that experimental samples from animal populations which have been subjected to even minor amounts of selection will be inefficient in yielding information on linkage between markers and loci influencing the quantitative trait under selection. 3aanimal breeding 3aloci 3aquantitative traits 3agenetic markers 3aalleles 3alinkage (genetics) 3aartificial selection 3agene frequency 0aselection by truncation1 aGeorges, M.A.J.0 tGenetics.g1992 Dec., v. 132, no. 4 p.1177-1185x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02927naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015400125300001600279500001500295520163900310650004501949650001701994650004302011650001302054650001902067650001602086650001602102650003202118650002002150650001502170650000702185650001702192650001802209653001202227653001202239700001602251700001102267700001902278700001602297773009002313852000902403930003302412945001302445946001102458655001202469IND2041077720221119074605.0940727e199403  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204107772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzanza, F.10aCharacterization of the effect of introgressed segments of chromosome 7 and 10 from Lycopersicon chmielewskii on tomato soluble solids, pH, and yield  ap. 965-972.  a2019-12-05  aThree chromosomal segments from the wild tomato L. chmielewskii have been introgressed into the L. esculentum genome. Using molecular markers they have been mapped to the middle and terminal regions of chromosome 7 (7M, 7T respectively), and to the terminal region of chromosome 10 (10T). This study was conducted to further clarify the physiological influence of the introgressed segments of chromosome 7 and 10 on tomato soluble solids (SS), and other fruit and yield parameters. The effect of the 10T segment was evaluated using five lines that differ for the presence of this segment. As previously reported this segment increased fruit pH with no significant effect on SS. Sixty-four BC2F5 backcross inbred lines (BILs) were developed from a cross using LA1501 (an L. esculentum line that contains the 7M and 7T fragments from L. chmielewskii) as the donor parent, and VF145B-7879 (a processing cultivar) as the recurrent parent. BILs were classified in four groups (++, inbreds without either of the L. chmielewskii segments; 7M+, lines with only the 7M segment; +7T, inbreds with only the 7T segment, and 7M7T, inbreds with both segments) based on RFLP information, and then compared to each other for all the parameters under study. Inbreds homozygous for the 7M fragment displayed greater SS (26%) and higher pH (0.10) than the control group (++). The 7L fragment did not influence either SS or pH, but was observed to significantly increase fruit yield by 12% when compared to the recurrent parent. A gene or genes that increase yield without affecting SS or pH may have potential in the development of commercial cultivars. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3abackcrossing 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3aplant breeding 3awild plants 3achromosomes 3ainterspecific hybridization 3afood processing 3acrop yield 3apH 3ainbred lines 3aintrogression 0aquality 0aSolanum1 aYoung, T.E.1 aKim D.1 aTanksley, S.D.1 aJuvik, J.A.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Mar., v. 87, no. 8 p.965-972x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02219naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001800150245007000168300001800238500001500256520096400271650002001235650002301255650002601278650002501304650001501329650001201344650001301356650002201369650002501391650001301416650002301429650001401452650001601466650002301482653001901505653002501524653002101549653003501570653002001605773006901625852000901694939003301703946001301736655001201749IND9300788120221119074541.0930208e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078812DNAL7 a14594352pmid7 aPMC12052382pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoulley, J.L.10aPrediction of selection response for threshold dichotomous traits  ap. 1187-1194.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper presents a formula to predict expected response to one generation of truncation selection for a dichotomous trait under polygenic additive inheritance. The derivation relies on the threshold liability concept and on the normality assumption of the joint distribution of additive genetic values and their predictors used as selection criteria. This formula accounts for asymmetry of response when both the prevalence of the trait and the selection rate differ from 1/2 via a bivariate normal integral term. The relationship with the classical formula R = i rho sigma(G) is explained with a Taylor expansion about a zero value of the correlation factor. Properties are illustrated with an example of sire selection based on progeny test performance which shows a departure from usual predictions up to 15-20% at low (0.05) or high (0.95) selection rates. Univariate approximations and extensions to several paths of genetic change are also discussed. 3asire evaluation 3aselection response 3apolygenic inheritance 3aartificial selection 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aModels, Biological 2aPhenotype 2aProbability 2aSelection, Genetic 0asire selection 0atruncation selection 0agenetic algebras 0apolygenic additive inheritance 0aanimal breeding0 tGenetics.g1992 Dec., v. 132, no. 4 p.1187-1194x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03067naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245022200164300001600386520170300402650002702105650002602132650002502158650001902183650001102202650001502213650001702228650001502245650001702260650002902277651001902306700001802325700001902343700002002362700001402382773012002396852000902516856008802525939003302613946001102646655001202657IND4478797220221119074504.0140325e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447879722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2004.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowling, A.10aPathophysiological and immune cell responses in calves prior to and following lung challenge with formalin-killed Pasteurella multocida biotype A:3 and protection studies involving subsequent homologous live challenge  ap. 197-207.  aPneumonic pasteurellosis is a common respiratory infection in cattle that has major economic and welfare implications world-wide and the incidence in the UK due to Pasteurella multocida, currently the same as that associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, is increasing. Whereas much is known regarding the pathogenesis of M. haemolytica infections little information is available on the pathogenic process of pasteurellosis initiated by P. multocida. In the present work calf systemic and innate immune responses to intratracheal challenge with formalin-killed P. multocida biotype A:3 and to subsequent experimental lung infection with live P. multocida were investigated. Eight-week-old calves were challenged intratracheally on day 0 with either 10(9) colony forming units (cfu) of formalin-killed P. multocida biotype A:3 in 300 ml saline (n=10) or 300 ml saline alone (n=10), followed, at day 21, by challenge with 10(9) cfu live P. multocida. Pathophysiological and lung phagocyte responses were assessed by clinical monitoring, sequential lung lavage and blood sampling. Results for samples obtained before, during and after challenge showed clinical and acute phase protein responses to both bacterial culture and saline control treatments, although higher responses were associated with bacterial challenge. Phagocytosis of P. multocida during 1 h incubation periods with lavaged cells in vitro was unaffected by exposure in vivo to killed P. multocida and there was evidence that P. multocida was able to survive intracellularly during this assay. There was no indication that lung exposure to formalin-killed P. multocida conferred protection against subsequent homologous live challenge. 3aMannheimia haemolytica 3aPasteurella multocida 3aacute phase proteins 3ablood sampling 3acalves 3amonitoring 3apathogenesis 3aphagocytes 3aphagocytosis 3apneumonic pasteurellosis 3aUnited Kingdom1 aHodgson, J.C.1 aDagleish, M.P.1 aEckersall, P.D.1 aSales, J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2004 Aug., v. 100, no. 3-4 p.197-207wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2004.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140325  aNon-US 7aarticle02753naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245012900189300001600318500002400334520117800358650002201536650003201558650000801590650001301598650001601611650003901627650001101666650001101677650002901688650001201717650001201729650002301741650002301764650002301787650001101810650002101821650004001842650001201882650003801894650003701932650002201969700002001991700002202011700002202033773008602055852000902141856008502150655001202235IND4397926520221119074530.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439792652DNAL7 a176198942pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-007-0117-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeryusheva, Svetlana10aTandem 41-bp repeats in chicken and Japanese quail genomes: FISH mapping and transcription analysis on lampbrush chromosomes  ap. 519-530.  aIncludes references  aThe chromosomal distribution of 41-bp repeats, known as CNM and PO41 repeats in the chicken genome and BglII repeats in the Japanese quail, was analyzed precisely using giant lampbrush chromosomes (LBC) from chicken, Japanese quail, and turkey growing oocytes. The PO41 repeat is conserved in all galliform species, whereas the other repeats are species specific. In chicken and quail, the centromere and subtelomere regions share homologous satellite sequences. RNA polymerase II transcribes the 41-bp repeats in both centromere and subtelomere regions. Ongoing transcription of these repeats was demonstrated by incorporation of BrUTP injected into oocytes at the lampbrush stage. RNA complementary to both strands of CNM and PO41 repeats is present on chicken LBC loops, whereas strand-specific G-rich transcripts are characteristic of BglII repeats in the Japanese quail. The RNA from 41-bp repeats does not undergo cotranscriptional U snRNP-dependent splicing. At the same time, the ribonucleoprotein matrix of transcription units with C-rich RNA of CNM and PO41 repeats was enriched with hnRNP protein K. Potential promoters for satellite transcription are discussed. 3aCoturnix japonica 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3achickens 3achromosomes 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenome 3aquails 3atranscription (genetics) 3aturkeys 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCoturnixxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenomexgenetics 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aOocytes 2aTandem Repeat Sequencesxgenetics 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics 2aTurkeysxgenetics1 aKrasikova, Alla1 aKulikova, Tatiana1 aGaginskaya, Elena0 tChromosoma.g2007 Dec., v. 116, no. 6 p.519-530dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-007-0117-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01405naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008500127300001600212500001500228520046000243650001900703650001600722650002400738650001100762650002000773650002400793650001400817653002400831653001000855653001300865700001700878700001500895773008000910852000900990939003300999946001101032655001201043IND9300788520221119074538.0930204e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez, G.10aThermostabilization of Cucurbita ficifolia protease in the presence of additives  ap. 919-924.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of additives such as polyhydric alcohols, polyethylene glycol and casein on the thermostability of Cucurbita ficifolia protease was determined.

R1475-R1480.  aEnergy expenditure was measured in one-way crossed-intestine rats by use of indirect calorimetry to examine the role of energy metabolism in body weight control. The intestinal surgery was done according to Koopmans (Brain Pes. Bull. 14: 595-603, 1985). The food-losing rats increased daily food intake from 70.8 to 126.3 g/day, whereas their partners decreased intake from 67.1 to 38.7 g/day (P < 0.001). Compared with levels before surgery, the food-losing rats showed slightly increased O2 consumption (1.31 vs. 1.28 l.h-1.kg-1) and metabolic rate (6.62 vs. 6.39 kcal.h-1.kg-1) and largely increased CO2 production (1.31 vs. 1.22 l.h-1.kg-1, P < 0.01), whereas in their food-gaining partners O2 consumption (1.12 vs. 1.25 l.h-1.kg-1, P < 0.01)and metabolic rate(5.76 vs. 6.26 kcal.h-1.kg-1) were significantly decreased. Respiratory quotients were higher in the food-gaining rats than in their partners (1.076 vs. 0.999, P < 0.01), indicating more fatty acid synthesis. These results suggest that daily food intake and energy expenditure increase and decrease together, despite the fact that about the same amount of food has been absorbed from the intestines of each rat. 3aoverfeeding 3afood intake 3aabsorption 3aweight control 3aenergy metabolism 3aenergy expenditure 3arats1 aKoopmans, H.S.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1995 Dec., v. 269, no. 6:pt.2 p.R1475-R1480x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03378naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001900150245007300169300001800242520163800260650004301898650002201941650001901963650002001982650002302002650001802025650001602043650004502059650001502104650003102119650003102150650002502181650002302206650001702229650002002246650002002266650004602286650002702332650003202359650002902391650002502420653001802445653001402463700001602477700001702493700002202510700002102532700001402553700001702567700002102584700001802605700001702623773006902640852000902709939003302718946001302751655001202764IND9300787820221119073209.0930208e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078782DNAL7 a13609342pmid7 aPMC12052352pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanksley, S.D.10aHigh density molecular linkage maps of the tomato and potato genomes  ap. 1141-1160.  aHigh density molecular linkage maps, comprised of more than 1000 markers with an average spacing between markers of approximately 1.2 cM (ca. 900 kb), have been constructed for the tomato and potato genomes. As the two maps are based on a common set of probes, it was possible to determine, with a high degree of precision, the breakpoints corresponding to 5 chromosomal inversions that differentiate the tomato and potato genomes. All of the inversions appear to have resulted from single breakpoints at or near the centromeres of the affected chromosomes, the result being the inversion of entire chromosome arms. While the crossing over rate among chromosomes appears to be uniformly distributed with respect to chromosome size, there is tremendous heterogeneity of crossing over within chromosomes. Regions of the map corresponding to centromeres and centromeric heterochromatin, and in some instances telomeres, experience up to 10-fold less recombination than other areas of the genome. Overall, 28% of the mapped loci reside in areas of putatively suppressed recombination. This includes loci corresponding to both random, single copy genomic clones and transcribed genes (detected with cDNA probes). The extreme heterogeneity of crossing over within chromosomes has both practical and evolutionary implications. Currently tomato and potato are among the most thoroughly mapped eukaryotic species and the availability of high density molecular linkage maps should facilitate chromosome walking, quantitative trait mapping, marker-assisted breeding and evolutionary studies in these two important and well studied crop species. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3alinkage groups 3agenetic markers 3achromosome mapping 3acrossing over 3acentromeres 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aDNA probes 3anucleic acid hybridization 2aCentromerexultrastructure 2aChromosome Inversion 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSolanum tuberosumxgenetics 2aTelomerexultrastructure 2aVegetablesxgenetics 0aheterogeneity 0ainversion1 aGanal, M.W.1 aPrince, J.P.1 aVicente, M.C. de.1 aBonierbale, M.W.1 aBroun, P.1 aFulton, T.M.1 aGiovannoni, J.J.1 aGrandillo, S.1 aMartin, G.B.0 tGenetics.g1992 Dec., v. 132, no. 4 p.1141-1160x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04098naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024004100131040001800172100001500190245010900205300001800314506007600332520147000408506003701878650003001915650002101945650001701966650001401983650002001997650002102017650003402038650002402072650001002096650000902106650001202115650001102127650002102138650001402159650002302173650002502196650001102221650001402232650002402246650001202270650004002282650006802322650003102390650001102421650002102432650003302453650004402486650003802530650002302568650004102591650000902632650002402641650002802665650002902693650001102722650002702733650001302760650001402773650004602787650003402833653002802867653002102895700001702916700001702933700001902950700001702969700001702986773008203003852000903085856009103094930003303185945001303218946001303231655001203244IND2208044220221207050243.0001129e200008  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220804422DNAL7 a108998722pmid7 aPMC984082pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.68.8.4673-4680.20002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWest, N.P.10aRole of phosphoglucomutase of Bordetella bronchiseptica in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and virulence  ap. 4673-4680.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe phosphoglucomutase (PGM)-encoding gene of Bordetella bronchiseptica is required for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. An insertion mutant of the wild-type B. bronchiseptica strain BB7865 which disrupted LPS biosynthesis was created and characterized (BB7865pgm). Genetic analysis of the mutated gene showed it shares high identity with PGM genes of various bacterial species and forms part of an operon which also encompasses the gene encoding phosphoglucose isomerase. Functional assays for PGM revealed that enzyme activity is expressed in both bvg-positive and bvg-negative strains of B. bronchiseptica and is substantially reduced in BB7865pgm. Complementation of the mutated PGM gene with that from BB7865 restored the wild-type condition for all phenotypes tested. The ability of the mutant BB7865pgm to survive within J774.A1 cells was significantly reduced at 2 h (40% reduction) and 24 h (56% reduction) postinfection. BB7865pgm was also significantly attenuated in its ability to survive in vivo following intranasal infection of mice, being effectively cleared from the lungs within 4 days, whereas the wild-type strain persisted at least 35 days. The activities of superoxide dismutase, urease, and acid phosphatase were unaffected in the PGM-deficient strain. In contrast, the inability to produce wild-type LPS resulted in a reduced bacterial resistance to oxidative stress and a higher susceptibility to the antimicrobial peptide cecropin P.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBordetella bronchiseptica 3aacid phosphatase 3abiosynthesis 3acecropins 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic analysis 3aglucose-6-phosphate isomerase 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amice 3amutants 3aoperon 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3aphosphoglucomutase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aurease 3avirulence 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBordetella bronchisepticaxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aFemale 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGlucose-6-Phosphate Isomerasexgenetics 2aLipopolysaccharidesxbiosynthesis 2aLungxmicrobiology 2aMacrophagesxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aOperon 2aParaquatxpharmacology 2aPeptides 2aPhenotype 2aPhosphoglucomutasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af1716321 aJungnitz, H.1 aFitter, J.T.1 aMcArthur, J.D.1 aGuzman, C.A.1 aWalker, M.J.0 tInfection and immunity.g2000 Aug., v. 68, no. 8 p.4673-4680x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.68.8.4673-4680.20003Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle01782naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012000127300001600247520062500263650001700888650002300905650001200928650001800940650002500958650002200983650001601005650002001021650000901041650001301050650002001063650001101083650002001094650001901114653001101133653001201144653001501156700001901171700002501190773008001215852000901295939003301304946001101337655001201348IND9300789320221119072927.0930204e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, S.P.10aAgrochemical resistant mutants of nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Tolypothrix tenuis as nitrogen fertilizer for rice  ap. 969-974.  aAgrochemical resistant mutants of nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Tolypothrix tenuis were isolated after MNNG mutagenesis.

The effects of SDME parameters such as extraction solvent, microdrop volume, extraction time, stirring speed, salt concentration, and sample pH on the extraction performance are investigated. Under optimal extraction conditions (extraction solvent, toluene; solvent drop volume, 3.0 μL; extraction time, 15 min; stirring speed, 600 rpm; no addition of salt and change of sample pH), the calibration curve was drawn by plotting peak area against a series of BDE-209 concentrations (0.001-1 μg/mL) in aqueous solution; the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.9998. The limit of detection was 0.7 ng/mL. The enrichment factor was 10.6. The precision of this method was obtained by six successive analyses of a 100 ng/mL standard solution of BDE-209, and RSD was 4.8%. This method was successfully applied to the extraction of BDE-209 from tap and East Lake water samples with relative recoveries ranging from 92.5 to 102.8% and from 91.5 to 96.2%, respectively, and the relative standard deviations (n = 3) were 4.4 and 2.2%. The proposed method is acceptable for the analysis of BDE-209 in water samples. 3amicroextraction 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3alakes 3amixing 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3apH 3asalt concentration 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atoluene 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethers 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPhenyl Ethersxanalysis 2aPolybrominated Biphenylsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aWei, Guohui1 aWang, Xuedong0 tJournal of separation science.g2007 Nov., v. 30, no. 16 p.2698-2702dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007001883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02470naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072001700150072001700167100001500184245012100199300001600320520120100336650001701537650000901554650001401563650002001577650002001597650001901617650001701636650002401653650002101677650001601698650002101714653003101735700001501766700001301781773009001794852000901884856007401893930003301967945002502000946001102025655001202036IND4381314820221119073228.0060621e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438131482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2006.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSawada, H.10aInduction of benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase and salicylic acid biosynthesis--Modulation by salt stress in rice seedlings  ap. 263-270.  aSalicylic acid (SA) is an important signal molecule of the plant defense response and is involved in regulation of the anti-oxidative system. Endogenous SA content is increased by various environmental stresses, including salinity. SA biosynthesis is catalyzed by benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase (BA2H). Therefore, induction and control of BA2H under stress conditions are important for the anti-oxidative system. We studied the induction and inhibition of BA2H in rice seedlings under salt stress. BA2H activity was induced by salinity, suggesting that the increased SA content was caused by activation of BA2H. Moreover, induction of BA2H activity was also caused by other oxidative stresses. As BA2H is a member of the cytochrome P-450 (P450) family, we further investigated the inhibitory effect on BA2H in vitro using various inhibitors of P450. Uniconazole proved to be the most effective inhibitor of BA2H. When rice seedlings were exposed to salt stress and treated with uniconazole in vivo, accumulation of SA was suppressed. These results suggest that inhibition of BA2H can control the endogenous response to salt stress and prevent SA accumulation in rice seedlings under oxidative stress. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aseedlings 3aoxidoreductases 3aenzyme activity 3asalicylic acid 3abiosynthesis 3asignal transduction 3acytochrome P-450 3asalt stress 3aoxidative stress 0abenzoic acid 2-hydroxylase1 aShim, I.S.1 aUsui, K.0 tPlant science.g2006 Aug., v. 171, no. 2 p.263-270wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2006.03.0203electronic resource  a20061221b20070102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/12/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03021naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002000180245011700200300001600317500002400333500001500357520116000372650001401532650002301546650002101569650001201590650000901602650002301611650002301634650001201657650002301669650001901692650001101711650001401722650001901736650005001755650003201805650002401837650001301861650005901874650004501933651001801978651001801996653001502014653002002029653001202049653002402061700001702085700001802102773011702120852000902237856009202246930003302338945002502371946001102396655001202407IND4425977720221119073124.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442597772DNAL7 a197696692pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00787.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8001 aDemetriou, J.L.10aSurvey of pet owners' expectations of surgical practice within first opinion veterinary clinics in Great Britain  ap. 478-487.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe expectations of small animal pet owners in Great Britain were evaluated on a number of issues regarding aseptic practice and clinical management and compared with final year veterinary students' assessment of actual veterinary practice. A survey was completed by 328 small animal pet owners and 56 veterinary practices in Great Britain. Questions from the pet owner survey related to expectations and opinions on a number of surgical issues and questions from the veterinary surgeon survey examined veterinary practice in relation to the same issues. Comparisons were made to determine whether there were any differences between pet owner expectations and veterinary student assessment of actual practice of small animal first opinion clinics. In the majority of issues examined there was a significant mismatch between client expectation and provisions made. Of particular importance was the discrepancy regarding the use of surgical gloves and administration of analgesia. These results suggest that attempts should be made to understand and improve the disparity that exists between small animal pet owners and veterinary surgeons in Great Britain. 3aanalgesia 3aaseptic conditions 3aconsumer surveys 3asurgery 3apets 3aconsumer attitudes 3aveterinary clinics 2aAnimals 2aAttitude to Health 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aOwnership 2aPilot Projects 2aProtective Clothingxutilizationxveterinary. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSchools, Veterinary 2aStudents 2aSurgical Procedures, Operativexstandardsxveterinary. 2aVeterinary Medicinexmethodsxstandards. 3aGreat Britain 0aGreat Britain 0apet owners 0asurgical gloves 0asurveys 0aveterinary students1 aGeddes, R.F.1 aJeffery, N.D.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2009 Sept., v. 50, no. 9 p.478-487dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-45107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00787.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/10/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02344naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007900172300001600251500002400267520130000291650002201591650002601613653004001639653001501679653001801694700001701712700001901729773012501748852000901873856009201882930003301974946001102007655001202018IND4425979520221119073122.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442597952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01265.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDORMAN, MICHAEL10aLocal adaptation in four Iris species tested in a common-garden experiment  ap. 267-277.  aIncludes references  aLocal adaptation is a commonly observed result of natural selection acting in heterogeneous environment. Common-garden experiments are a method of detecting local adaptation, as well as studying phenotypic plasticity and gradients of traits. The present study aimed to analyse reaction norms of four closely-related Iris species of section Oncocyclus and to identify a role of environmentally-specific natural selection in their plastic responses. The plant vegetative and phenological, as well as performance traits were measured in a full factorial common-garden experiment with three levels of water amount and three soil types. We found a significant effect of species identity on all traits measured. Water amount and soil type affected many of the traits, but soil type did not affect the performance. There was no significant difference in the effect of water amount and soil type on performance as reflected by rhizome growth; in other words, there was no significant genotype x environment interaction for performance. Plasticity levels and directions of response were also similar among the species. We conclude that phenotypic differences among species are of genetic origin, although no adaptive value was demonstrated for them at the time and life-stages 'frame' of this experiment. 3anatural selection 3aphenotypic plasticity 0agenotype by environment interaction 0aOncocyclus 0areaction norm1 aSAPIR, YUVAL1 aVolis, Sergei.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2009 Oct., v. 98, no. 2 p.267-277dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01265.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03155naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001300172245009800185300001800283500002400301500001500325520150900340650001101849650002401860650002201884650001401906650001001920650001101930650001101941650000901952650001001961650002001971650002201991650001702013650001302030650002602043650002202069650001002091650002002101650001602121650001102137653002402148700001402172700001302186700001902199773008902218852000902307856008502316856009302401930003302494945002502527946001302552655001202565IND4383435820221119073126.0060907s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438343582DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606008301342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aQ1041 aGarg, M.10aGenetic control of high protein content and its associaton with bread-making quality in wheat  ap. 1357-1369.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross of Triticum aestivum cvs. WL711 and PH132 using the single-seed descent method was used to investigate the genetics of high protein content and its contribution to bread-making quality. Four-year data on protein content of parents and 124 RILs suggested that the difference in protein content between the two parents was controlled by two major genes with an additive effect. The individual gene gave intermediate protein content. Seven RILs with high protein content and without any yield penalty were selected, multiplied, and investigated for various milling, dough, and bread-making characteristics. PH132 and all seven selected RILs had higher protein content, higher sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation value, longer dough development time, a lower mixing tolerance index, higher stability, and better loaf volume and loaf quality than the bread wheat cultivars WL711 and PBW343. High molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunit composition of various high-protein RILs indicated a recombination of parental protein subunits. "2*" coded by Glu-A1 locus, 17 + 18 subunits coded by Glu-B1 locus, and "5 + 10" coded by Glu-D1 locus were predominant. One of the selected RILs, T-74, possessing 2 + 12 at Glu-D1 locus, also had superior bread-making quality, indicating that grain-protein content above a certain minimum value is a relatively more important determinant of bread-making quality than HMW glutenin subunits 5 + 10. 3aloaves 3abreadmaking quality 3adough development 3aglutenins 3adough 3avolume 3amixing 3aloci 3awheat 3amilling quality 3aTriticum aestivum 3ainbred lines 3agenotype 3aadditive gene effects 3agenetic variation 3agenes 3aprotein content 3agrain yield 3abreads 0aprotein composition1 aSingh, H.1 aKaur, H.1 aDhaliwal, H.S.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 8 p.1357-1369dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606008301343Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle02493naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001900161245012800180300001800308500002400326520108100350650002601431650001001457650002201467650002601489650000901515650001201524650001601536650003601552650002101588650001901609650003501628650000901663650002401672650005701696650003801753700001501791700002101806700002101827773010801848852000901956856008201965655001202047IND4398061320221119073059.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439806132DNAL7 a177635102pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2007002312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Eun Jeong10aQuantitative analysis of phosphatidylcholine in rat liver tissue by nanoflow liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 2598-2604.  aIncludes references  aA quantitative method was developed for the determination of phosphatidylcholine (PC) species concentration using nanoflow LC-ESI-MS/MS. In this study, a calibration method is developed to determine the effect of PC carbon chain length on MS peak intensity. Using the multiple standard addition method, a relationship between the peak intensities of different PC species from nanoflow LC-MS and carbon chain length is established first using different injection amounts of PC standards. From this relationship, a calibration curve for each carbon chain length can be obtained for the concentration calculation. It was found that the MS peak area of PC species analyzed by nanoflow LC-MS linearly decreased with increased acyl carbon numbers, and that the effect of the degree of acyl chain unsaturation on MS peak intensity was minimized when the injection amount was maintained at less than 1 pmol. The method was applied for the quantitative calculation of 34 PC species from rat liver, which were identified from data-dependent MS/MS analysis during nanoflow LC separation. 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 2aAnimals 2aCalibration 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aLiverxchemistry 2aNanotechnology 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxanalysis 2aRats 2aReference Standards 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods1 aKim, Hanna1 aChung, Bong Chul1 aMoon, Myeong Hee0 tJournal of separation science.g2007 Nov., v. 30, no. 16 p.2598-2604dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007002313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01907naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001400163245007800177300001800255500002400273520056900297650001700866650000900883650002100892650001100913650002000924650002000944650002800964650001100992650001801003650002001021650001401041650001501055650001801070700001401088773008901102852000901191856008501200856009301285930003301378945002501411946001301436655001201449IND4383436120221119073203.0060907s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438343612DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606008302252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF6001 aLin, Y.C.10aEffect of excess nickel on starch mobilization in germinating rice grains  ap. 1405-1412.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of excess nickel (as NiSO4) on starch mobilization of rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains or dehulled rice grains during germination was investigated.

Although natural selection often favours cryptic coloration, sexual selection can underlie patterns of coloration that function in inter- or intrasexual communication. We compared social signal coloration of three lizard species across a substrate colour ecotone in New Mexico. These species exhibit cryptic blanched dorsal coloration on the gypsum dunes of White Sands and dark coloration on the surrounding desert soils. We detected corresponding population divergence in colour used for intra- (Aspidoscelis inornata, Sceloporus undulatus) or inter- (Holbrookia maculata) sexual signalling. Although the magnitude and direction of change in coloration varied among taxa, differences in hue and chroma accounted for more variation in social coloration than for dorsal coloration. The relative conspicuousness of social signals also varied across the ecotone. We discuss the possibilities that divergent signalling colours in this system are the result of: (1) stochastic processes, (2) direct selection, and/or (3) a correlated response to natural selection on dorsal coloration. 3aSceloporus 3asexual selection 0aAspidoscelis 0aecological speciation 0aHolbrookia 0asensory drive1 aRosenblum, Erica Bree.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2009 Oct., v. 98, no. 2 p.243-255dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01291.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02282naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165100001500182245009100197300001600288520086000304650001101164650001401175650002301189650001701212650001201229650002301241650001701264650002301281650001501304650002301319650002001342650003201362650002001394651001301414653001801427700001401445700001601459700001401475700001801489700001501507773010401522852000901626856007201635930003301707945002501740946001101765655001201776IND4384590220221119073106.0061020e20061105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438459022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A total of 18,000 cattle and 9000 buffaloes were examined in the field and slaughter house. Only one species of Hypoderma, i.e. Hypoderma lineatum was recorded from this area. The prevalence of WFI was higher in slaughter house versus field, cattle versus buffaloes, males versus females, and young versus old animals in both the districts. The highest month-wise prevalence was recorded in December and the lowest in July. Organ-wise prevalence of WFI was highest in oesophagus followed in order by rumen and spleen. The economic losses based on the value of warbled and warble-free hides were estimated as Rs. 22.8 million per annum (currency exchange rate is Rs. 57.5 = US$ 1). 3acattle 3abuffaloes 3aHypoderma lineatum 3awarble flies 3amyiasis 3adisease prevalence 3arisk factors 3agender differences 3aanimal age 3aseasonal variation 3ahides and skins 3alivestock and meat industry 3aeconomic impact 3aPakistan 0aeconomic loss1 aIqbal, Z.1 aSajid, M.S.1 aAnwar, M.1 aNeedham, G.R.1 aHassan, M.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2006 Nov. 5, v. 141, no. 3-4 p.386-390wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.05.0143electronic resource  a20061114b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03050naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010800172300001600280500002400296500001500320520179000335650002002125650001302145650001502158650001002173650001802183650002602201650001302227650001202240650002502252650002102277650001102298650001602309653001602325653001602341653001002357700001702367700002302384773010802407852000902515856009202524655001202616IND4397972720221119073236.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439797272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04081.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParejo, Deseada10aWithin-brood size differences affect innate and acquired immunity in roller Coracias garrulus nestlings  ap. 717-725.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe immune system has a crucial importance determining animal health and survival. Its maintenance and activation are costly and usually trade with other physiologically costly functions. In birds, number and size of siblings in a nest are likely to determine the development of immunity. Indeed lower immunocompetence is expected in large than in small broods. Moreover, in asynchronous breeders, siblings are expected to differ in immunocompetence because asynchrony produces marked size hierarchy within-broods. Here we studied the effect of environmental conditions at the nest, chick sex and size, and natural mass differences among siblings due to hatching asynchrony on the development of the innate and acquired immune systems in the threatened non-size dimorphic asynchronous breeder European roller Coracias garrulus. Constitutive innate immune function was estimated by using a new technique proposed by Matson et al. (2005) . Natural Antibody (NAb) and Complement levels, innate immunity, varied with the mass difference between each chick and its heaviest sibling. NAb levels were higher in late-hatched siblings compared to early-hatched ones, indicating that the smallest offspring in each brood has the most developed innate immune system. This relationship was independent of the nest environment. The heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, which may indicate the level of stress, was higher in the heaviest siblings of each brood. In addition, the H/L ratio and white blood cell count (WBC) of nestlings, measures belonging to both the innate and acquired arms of the immune system, were related to conditions suffered in the nest. Our results may be explained by differential allocation of resources by female rollers as a way to improve the survival of the whole brood. 3aleukocyte count 3asiblings 3acomplement 3anests 3aanimal health 3aenvironmental factors 3ahatching 3aprogeny 3aenvironmental impact 3aimmunocompetence 3achicks 3aheterophils 0amethodology 0anew methods 0abirds1 aSilva, Nadia1 aAvilés, Jesús M.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2007 Nov., v. 38, no. 6 p.717-725dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04081.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02983naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001200161245016600173300001800339500002400357520124000381650001301621650001301634650001001647650004301657650001301700650001201713650002001725650001001745650001101755650001201766650001601778650005001794650003401844650002201878650002701900650002401927650002001951650003101971650003202002651001002034700001902044700001602063700001602079700001902095700002202114700001402136700002002150700001602170700002002186773010802206852000902314856008202323655001202405IND4398061120221119073152.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439806112DNAL7 a177221892pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2007001182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jun10aSimultaneous determination of phenols in Radix Polygalae by high performance liquid chromatography: Quality assurance of herbs from different regions and seasons  ap. 2583-2589.  aIncludes references  aRadix Polygalae, roots of Polygala tenuifolia or of Polygala sibirica, is a Chinese herbal medicine commonly used to prevent dementia. Reliable chemical markers for quality assurance of this herb are missing. Here, a high performance liquid chromatography method coupled with diode array detection was developed to simultaneously determine nine different phenols in Radix Polygalae, including sibiricose A₅, sibiricose A₆, glomeratose A, tenuifoliside A, glomeratose D, 3',6-di-O-sinapoyl sucrose ester, mangiferin, polygalaxanthone III, and polygalaxanthone XI. By using two different detection wavelengths in the HPLC analysis, the developed method was able to determine the phenols with excellent resolution, precision, and recovery. This established method was therefore applied to determine the amounts of phenols in thirty-two samples from different cultivation regions and harvest seasons in China, and significant variations were revealed. The amounts of phenols in the roots of P. tenuifolia collected in Shanxi and Shannxi Provinces were markedly higher than in roots collected from other Provinces. Moreover, the samples harvested in the spring contained higher contents of phenols than those collected in other seasons. 3aPolygala 3adementia 3aherbs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amedicine 3aphenols 3aquality control 3aroots 3aspring 3asucrose 3awavelengths 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aMedicine, Chinese Traditional 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aPolygalaxchemistry 2aQuality Control 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 3aChina1 aDong, Xiaobing1 aJiang, Yong1 aGao, Qiutao1 aJiang, Zhiyong1 aCheung, Anna W.H.1 aDuan, Ran1 aDong, Tina T.X.1 aTu, Pengfei1 aTsim, Karl W.K.0 tJournal of separation science.g2007 Nov., v. 30, no. 16 p.2583-2589dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007001183Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02560naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072001700150100001700167245011200184300001600296500001500312520131300327650001801640650002201658650001701680650001701697650002001714650001801734650002301752650001101775653002001786653002201806653001601828700001701844700001401861773011101875852000901986856007401995930003302069945002502102946001102127655001202138IND4383583420221119073044.0060915e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438358342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2005.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Twelve calves were subjected to two different experimental tests: (1) a social preference test were the calves could choose between a familiar and an unfamiliar calf in a Y-maze, and (2) a separation test were the test calf were taken out from their home pen and placed in a unfamiliar pen, once together with a familiar calf, once together with an unfamiliar calf and once alone. In the social preference test, the calves spent significantly more time in the area where the familiar calf was placed (P < 0.05). In the separation test, the calves vocalized more (P < 0.05), showed less locomotor activity (P < 0.001), were more immobile (P < 0.001) and explored the pen less (P < 0.001) when separated alone compared to separation with a companion calf. The calves vocalized more when separated with an unfamiliar calf (P < 0.05) compared to when separated with a familiar calf. The calves that spent most time with the familiar calf in the social preference test were more immobile when separated with an unfamiliar calf (rs = 0.60, P < 0.05). In conclusion, calves seem to prefer a familiar calf to an unfamiliar calf, and the presence and familiarity of a companion calf affects the calves’ reaction to separation. 3aanimal stress 3asocial enrichment 3acalf housing 3adairy cattle 3asocial behavior 3agroup housing 3aanimal preferences 3acalves 0aanimal behavior 0aseparation stress 0afamiliarity1 aJensen, M.B.1 aBoe, K.E.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2006 Sept., v. 99, no. 3-4 p.205-221wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2005.10.0123electronic resource  a20070123b20070202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03176naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002000180245009500200300001400295500011000309500002400419500001500443520136400458650001801822650001701840650000901857650001701866650001201883650005201895650000901947650001101956650004101967650000902008650009302017650001402110653003602124653002202160653001902182653002302201653002902224653002202253653002502275700001702300700001902317773011602336852000902452856009202461930003302553945002502586946001102611655001202622IND4425978820221119073121.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442597882DNAL7 a197652172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00800.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aHäggström, J.13aAn update on treatment and prognostic indicators in canine myxomatous mitral valve disease  ap. 25-33.  aIn the special issue: Chronic degenerative valvular disease - Where are we now? / edited by Rachel James.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMitral regurgitation caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease is the most common cause for congestive heart failure and cardiac-related mortality in dogs. Typically, it takes several years for the disease to progress from mild, clinically silent myxomatous mitral valve disease to severe disease with signs of congestive heart failure. A proportion of dogs will never progress into congestive heart failure before they die from other causes or old age. Some variables have been shown to be predictive of onset of congestive heart failure and they might be useful to identify dogs that need more frequent monitoring and eventually treatment. Results from several controlled clinical trials are available concerning medical treatment of dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease with or without congestive heart failure. These trials provide estimates of treatment effects and also allow identification of other variables with prognostic value for the outcome after the onset of congestive heart failure. Use of prognostic variables together with qualitative and quantitative results from clinical drug trials may aid the clinician and owner to plan and decide on optimal management of the myxomatous mitral valve disease dog. The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge of prognostic variables and therapy for this common condition in dogs. 3aheart failure 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aheart valves 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxtherapy. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHeart Failurexetiologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMitral Valve Insufficiencyxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxtherapyxveterinary. 2aPrognosis 0amyxomatous mitral valve disease 0adisease treatment 0aheart diseases 0aliterature reviews 0acongestive heart failure 0adisease prognosis 0amitral regurgitation1 aHöglund, K.1 aBorgarelli, M.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2009 Sept., v. 50, no. s1 p.25-33dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-45107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00800.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/10/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03511naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001500177245008000192300001600272500002400288520201600312650001802328650002002346650001502366650001502381650002002396650001802416650001302434650002202447650001802469650001402487650001902501650002502520650003002545650001602575650001802591650001802609650002802627700001502655700001702670700001402687773011102701852000902812856009102821930003302912945002502945946001102970655001202981IND4383429120140723000000.0060907e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438342912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ505 0aX1001 aAversa, M.13aAn analysis of the transport phenomena occurring during food drying process  ap. 922-932.  aIncludes references  aThis research presented a theoretical model describing the transport phenomena involved in food drying. Aim of the study was to determine the influence of some of the most important operating variables, especially velocity, humidity and temperature of drying air on the performance of drying process of vegetables. The main connotation of this study regarded the possibility of increasing the accuracy of drying process modelling by the use of finite elements method (FEM). With respect to most of the works published in literature, the main innovation introduced in this study was represented with the model formulation. This, in fact, simulated the simultaneous bidimensional heat and moisture transfer accounting for the variation of both air and food physical properties as functions of local values of temperature and moisture content. The resulting system of unsteady-state partial differential equations has been solved by a commercial FEM package, called FEMLAB. The proposed model was general since it was capable of describing both the transport of free and bounded water within the food and the evaporation/condensation phenomena that, depending of the actual driving forces, may occur at the air/food interface. Simulations, carried out in different drying conditions, showed that air velocity and its relative humidity are more effective than air temperature to determine the drying rate. A comparison between the theoretical predictions and a set of experimental results reported in the literature has shown a remarkable agreement especially during the first 2 h when experimental data and theoretical predictions overlapped and relative errors never exceeded 5%. Later on, a slight deviation can be observed, particularly for the drying test performed with higher air temperature and smaller food thickness, i.e. when a significant volume reduction (shrinkage) was possibly achieved. The observed deviation can be, therefore, ascribed to the lack of accounting for shrinkage effects in the model. 3awater content 3afood processing 3avegetables 3aair drying 3aair temperature 3aheat transfer 3avelocity 3arelative humidity 3amass transfer 3amass flow 3adrying quality 3athermal conductivity 3aheat transfer coefficient 3adiffusivity 3afood surfaces 3aspecific heat 3afinite element analysis1 aCurcio, S.1 aCalabrò, V.1 aIorio, G.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Feb., v. 78, no. 3 p.922-932dElsevier Science Pub.

This group-size effect does not, however, consider if larger groups differ systematically from smaller ones: Large groups could form in different habitats than small groups or be composed of a different mix of ages or classes than small groups. We examined how habitat differences and flock size and composition explain feeding and vigilance rates in common cranes Grus grus, wintering in holm oak Quercus ilex dehesas of Spain. Flock size and composition were related to habitat type in cranes: flocks formed in areas sown with cereal crops were larger than flocks formed in set aside areas. Vigilance rate depended on habitat but decreased with increasing flock size in a similar way across all habitats. Juveniles were less vigilant than adults and showed little change in vigilance with flock size. Vigilance increased and feeding time decreased over months from November through February. Our results show that vigilance is affected by habitat but that the group size effect on vigilance is not the product of differences between habitats in group size or composition. 3aGrus 3aQuercus ilex 3aadults 3aanimals 3aflocks 3aforaging 3agrain crops 3agroup size 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles1 aBednekoff, Peter A.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2007 Nov., v. 38, no. 6 p.690-697dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04002.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02257naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245014000166300001600306500001900322500002400341520124700365650001501612650001201627650001001639650002201649650001201671651001101683700002301694700001801717700001701735773011001752852000901862856004801871655001201919IND4422836520221119073002.0090703e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442283652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-008-9187-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansson, Nicklas13aAn indicator system for identification of sites of high conservation value for saproxylic oak (Quercus spp.) beetles in southern Sweden  ap. 399-412.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aThe saproxylic beetle fauna on old oaks was sampled in four regions of southern Sweden using two methods: window and pitfall trapping. The aim was to test a way of finding indicator species which can be used to identify sites with high species number or that scored high on a conservation priority species index, based on occurrence of red-listed species. From 92 sites surveyed, in total 164 species of saproxylic beetles were identified. Different sets of indicator species were selected based upon 22 sites from a centrally located region. Predictions of species number and the index for 30 other sites from the same province were made. The correlation between observed and predicted species number and the index increased with increasing number of indicators. When comparing different treatment of species indata, the explanatory power of predictions was strongest for presence/absence data. Indicator sets of species effectively caught with pitfall traps gave overall the best predictions of both species number and the index. Predictions of species number and the index worked well within the same regions but gave varied result for the three other regions which shows that transferability of indicators between regions may be doubtful. 3aColeoptera 3aQuercus 3afauna 3aindicator species 3ainsects 3aSweden1 aBergman, Karl-Olof1 aJonsell, Mats1 aMilberg, Per0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2009 Aug., v. 13, no. 4 p.399-412dSpringer Netherlandsx1366-638X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-008-9187-9 7aarticle03740naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100001400170245008600184300001800270500002400288500001500312520205600327650001602383650002302399650001002422650002502432650001402457650002002471650001002491650002102501650001102522650001102533650002502544650002602569650002202595650002602617650004202643650001402685650002102699650001702720650003202737650002802769653001602797700001602813773011702829852000902946856008202955856006803037930003303105945002503138946001103163655001203174IND4383444020221119073042.0060908e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438344402DNAL7 a165058362pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08032582doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aLinne, Y.10aIdentification of women at risk of adverse weight development following pregnancy  ap. 1234-1239.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBackground: It has been known for long time that pregnancy associated with weight problems women but few important factors have been identified, except for weight gain during pregnancy itself. Objective: To identify cutoffs for weight gain during pregnancy for identification of women at risk of high weight retention after pregnancy. Methods: A longitudinal analysis of 563 women who gave birth in 1984-1985 was used. Weight development during pregnancy was used as diagnostic test for high weight retention at 1 and 15 years follow-up. True positives for high weight retention were defined as >90th percentile at 1 and 15 years. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to derive cutoffs minimizing the absolute and relative number of misclassifications. Results: The average weight retention at 1 year (WR1y) and 15 years (WR15y) was 1.1 +/- 3.6 and 7.6 +/- 7.4, respectively. There was a moderately strong correlation between weight gain during pregnancy and weight retention at 1 and 15 years follow-up (r2 = 0.13 and r2=0.05, respectively; both P<0.001) and weight gain during pregnancy as diagnostic test to find high weight retainers performed better than chance both for WR1y (AUC=0.76 +/- 0.04, P<0.01) and WR15y (0.63 +/- 0.04, P<0.05). To minimize the absolute number of misclassifications of high weight retention, a highly specific and insensitive cut-off of around 24 kg weight gain during pregnancy was needed. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specifity, minimizing the relative number of misclassifications, was at a cutoff of around 16 kg, but this resulted in three times as many absolute misclassifications. Conclusion: Weight gain during pregnancy was found to be a moderately strong diagnostic test for weight retention after pregnancy. In order to implement weight gain recommendations for clinical practice larger studies need to be conducted and the demands on the reference values specified, since decisions about the trade-offs between types and extent of misclassifications need to be made. 3aweight gain 3aat-risk population 3awomen 3alongitudinal studies 3apregnancy 3abody mass index 2aAdult 2aArea Under Curve 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aPostpartum Period 2aPregnancyxphysiology 2aPregnancy Complicationsxepidemiology 2aROC Curve 2aReference Values 2aRisk Factors 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 0arisk groups1 aNeovius, M.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2006 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.1234-1239dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08032583Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/03  aNon-US 7aarticle01873naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245011400190300001600304500002400320520064900344650002100993650001001014650001901024650001901043650001401062650003001076650004401106650001701150650002401167650002401191650003601215700002801251773012601279852000901405856008501414655001201499IND4397949120221119073004.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439794912DNAL7 a179260732pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-007-0257-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLütke-Eversloh, Tina12aA semi-quantitative high-throughput screening method for microbial l-tyrosine production in microtiter plates  ap. 807-811.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, we developed a fluorescence-based assay for quantifying the aromatic amino acid l-tyrosine in small sample volumes employing 96-well microtiter plates.

The experiments were carried out using the dynamic method at different temperature (20, 30 and 40 °C) and pressure (12, 15 and 20 MPa) levels, indicating a solvent density ranging from 719.1 to 937.5 kg/m3. By using low solvent flow rates, it was assumed that the solvent was saturated with the solute downstream the extractor. The results of the solubility experimental data, obtained for the operating conditions evaluated in this work, varied from 2.33 x 10-4 to 5.23 x 10-4 g/g CO2. The experimental results were correlated using three different empirical equations proposed correspondingly by Chrastil, del Valle and Aguilera and Gordillo et al. The lowest deviation between experimental data and correlated values was obtained from the results taken at 40 °C and using the correlation proposed by Gordillo et al.

Fresh pickling cucumbers (cv. Octobus) were stored for 30 days at 7 °C and 90-95% relative humidity (RH) under different controlled atmosphere (CA) combinations. Samples taken at the beginning and on the 0 (i.e., without storage), 10, 20 and 30 days of storage were processed to sweet pickle. At each sampling, physical and chemical analyses were carried out in the fresh pickling cucumbers to determine the changes in the quality with storage time. Besides, physical, chemical and sensory analyses were carried out in the pickles elaborated from the fresh samples taken at the same periods, after keeping at room temperature for 6 months, with the aim of determining CA and storage time effect on the final pickle quality. It was found that storage of cucumbers to be processed to pickle could be possible for less than 10 days at 7 °C temperature and 90-95 RH under normal atmosphere (NA). However, physical and chemical analyses showed that storage period of fresh pickling cucumbers could be prolonged up to 30 days under the same storage conditions, if suitable atmosphere combinations are created. Nevertheless, it was concluded that restricting the storage period of fresh pickling cucumbers to 20 days could give better results after processing to pickle. 3acucumbers 3apickling 3apickled vegetables 3afood storage 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3acarbon dioxide 3aoxygen 3astorage time 3acold storage 3arelative humidity 3ashelf life 3afood processing quality 3ashrinkage 3afirmness 3acell respiration 3atotal solids 3atitratable acidity 3apH 3achlorophyll 3aion transport 3aappearance (quality) 3acolor 3acultivars 0atotal soluble solids1 aOzer, M.H.1 aUylaser, V.1 aKaraman, B.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Feb., v. 78, no. 3 p.1034-1046dElsevier Science Pub.

E1118-E1124.  aThe classical concept holds that liver and kidneys are the main sinks of glycerol released by adipose tissue. However, rates of glycerol appearance (Ra) exceed the rate of glycerol delivery to liver and kidneys. We measured the hepatic and renal contributions to glycerol production and utilization in anesthetized dogs that were fasted either overnight or for 24 h after 3 days on a carbohydrate-free diet. Dogs were infused with [2H5]glycerol, and the concentration and 2H enrichment of glycerol were measured across liver and kidney. After a baseline period, either norepinephrine or glucose plus insulin was infused to alter the rate of glycerol production. Our study shows that the production of glycerol by liver and kidneys amounted to 4-9% and 4-7% of the Ra of glycerol, respectively. Uptake of glycerol by liver and kidneys amounted to 26-30 and 10-19% of the Ra of glycerol, respectively. Thus, contrary to the classical concept, the bulk of glycerol utilization occurs in nonhepatic, nonrenal tissues that have very low glycerol kinase activity per gram. 3amathematics and statistics 3anutrition physiology 3ahuman nutrition1 aMartin, S.K.1 aHazey, J.W.1 aSoloviev, M.V.1 aKeating, A.P.1 aLucas, D.1 aDavid, F.1 aKoshy, J.1 aKirschenbaum, D.W.1 aTserng, K.Y.1 aBrunengraber, H.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1996 Dec., v. 271, no. 6 p.E1118-E1124x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03441naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100002000197245011500217300001800332500002400350500001500374520069200389650002601081650001901107650002001126650003001146650002401176650001901200650001101219650001701230650001801247650001701265650002201282650001501304650002301319650002001342650003001362650003001392650001201422650004401434650005101478650001401529650002101543650003201564650001101596650002901607650003601636650002401672650002001696650004501716650002801761650004001789650004201829650005001871650003601921651001101957653002701968653001801995653002502013653001302038653002802051653002002079653001702099700001802116700002302134700001902157700002202176700001902198700002202217700002202239700001802261773009102279852000902370856009102379930003302470945002502503946001102528655001202539IND4425964520221119073154.0090918e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442596452DNAL7 a196793232pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aL823 0aX3801 aLacroix, Damien10aHydroperoxy-cycloartane triterpenoids from the leaves of Markhamia lutea, a plant ingested by wild chimpanzees  ap. 1239-1245.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the framework of the phytochemical investigation of plant species eaten by wild chimpanzees in their natural environment in Uganda, leaf samples of Markhamia lutea were selected and collected. The crude ethyl acetate extract of M. lutea leaves exhibited significant in vitro anti-parasitic activity and low cytotoxicity against MRC5 and KB cells. Fractionation of this extract led to six cycloartane triterpenoids, musambins A-C and their 3-O-xyloside derivatives musambiosides A-C. The structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral studies including mass spectroscopy and extensive 2D NMR. Most of the compounds exhibited mild anti-leishmanial and anti-trypanosomal activities. 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3ahuman diseases 3aPan troglodytes 3aTrypanosoma brucei brucei 3aLeishmania donovani 3aphytochemicals 3axylose 3acytotoxicity 3atriterpenoids 3awild animals 3aspectral analysis 3aglycosides 3achemical structure 3astereochemistry 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistry. 2aAnimals 2aAntimalarialsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCell Line 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLeishmaniaxdrug effects 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMolecular Structure 2aPan troglodytes 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlasmodium falciparumxdrug effects 2aTriterpenesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aTrypanocidal Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aTrypanosoma cruzixdrug effects 3aUganda 0aantiprotozoal activity 0aphaeophorbide 0amedicinal properties 0amusambin 0acycloartane triterpenes 0aMarkhamia lutea 0amusambioside1 aPrado, Soizic1 aDeville, Alexandre1 aKrief, Sabrina1 aDumontet, Vincent1 aKasenene, John1 aMouray, Elisabeth1 aBories, Christian1 aBodo, Bernard0 tPhytochemistry.g2009 July, v. 70, no. 10 p.1239-1245dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.06.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20091006b20091106c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/10/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02071naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002200157245009500179300001600274500001500290520087400305650000901179650002301188650001901211650002301230650002901253650001301282650002001295653001701315653001701332700002101349700001301370700001601383700001701399773008901416852000901505856007801514930003301592945001301625946001101638655001201649IND2041883220221119072938.0940908e199405  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204188322DNAL7 a241859282pmid7 a10.1007/BF002258992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso-Blanco, C.10aGenetic mapping of cytological and isozyme markers on chromosomes 1R, 3R, 4R and 6R of rye  ap. 208-214.  a2019-12-05  aCytogenetic maps involving chromosomes 1R, 3R, 4R and 6R have been developed from the analysis of offspring of crosses between multiple heterozygous rye plants. The maps include isozyme loci Gpi-R1, Mdh-R1 and Pgd2 (located in chromosome 1R), Mdh-R2 (located in chromosome 3R), Pgm-R1 (located in chromosome 4R) and Aco-R1 (located in chromosome 6R). Various telomeric and interstitial C-bands of these four chromosomes, the centromere split of chromosome 3R, and translocation TR01 were used as cytological markers. By means of electron microscope analysis of spread pachytene synaptonemal complexes, the breakpoint of TR01 was physically mapped in chromosome arms 4RS and 6RL. From the linkage data, conclusions were derived concerning the cytological locations of the isozyme loci and the physical extent of the evolutive translocations involving chromosome arm 6RL. 3aloci 3achromosome banding 3aSecale cereale 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome translocation 3aisozymes 3agenetic markers 0acell biology 0acytogenetics1 aGoicoechea, P.G.1 aRoca, A.1 aAlvarez, E.1 aGiraldez, R.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.208-214x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002258993Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02075naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245011500174300001600289520090300305650002201208650000901230650001201239650001401251650002101265650003001286650004501316653001801361653001601379653001401395700001701409700001801426773008901444852000901533856007801542930003301620945001301653946001101666655001201677IND2041882020221119073025.0940908e199405  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204188202DNAL7 a241859232pmid7 a10.1007/BF002258942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Ovidio, R.10aPCR analysis of genes encoding allelic variants of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits at the Glu-D1 locus  ap. 175-180.  aGenes encoding high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits, present in bread-wheat lines and cultivars, were studied by RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analyses. In particular, allelic subunits of the x- or y-type, encoded at the Glu-D1 locus present on the long arm of chromosome 1D, were investigated. The variation in size, observed in different allelic subunits, is mainly due to variation in the length of the central repetitive domain, typical of these proteins. Deletions or duplications, probably caused by unequal crossing-over, have given rise to the size heterogeneity currently observed. The possibility of using the PCR technique for a detailed analysis of HMW glutenin genes in order to obtain a more accurate estimation of the molecular weight of their encoded subunits, and the detection of unexpressed genes, is also described. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aloci 3aalleles 3aglutenins 3amolecular weight 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 0aheterogeneity 0aduplication 0adeletions1 aPorceddu, E.1 aLafiandra, D.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.175-180x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002258943Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02439naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245013400132300001600266520124600282650002101528650001901549650002301568650002401591650002301615650001401638650002201652650002801674650002301702650001301725650002501738653001401763653001101777653001901788653001801807653002301825700001401848773008901862852000901951930003301960945001301993946001102006655001202017IND2041880820221119073011.0940908e199405  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204188082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnnicchiarico, P.10aIntererence effects in white clover genotypes grown as pure stands and binary mixtures with different grass species and varieties  ap. 153-158.  aSix white clover genotypes and eight grass varieties belonging to four different species were grown both in monoculture and as grass-legume binary mixtures in dense swards for two years under a mowing regime and a management including N fertilization. Dry matter yield and yield-related traits were recorded to investigate some aspects of inter-specific interference in white clover-based mixtures and to define a methodology for selecting genotypes of this clover suited to conditions of association. Clover was at a competitive disadvantage in most mixtures. Differences among grasses for aggressiveness were related more to variety vigour than to species. Clover compatibility proved specific only in relation to grass vigour. Variation among clovers for tolerance to competitive stress involved significant cross-over interactions passing from monoculture to severe stress conditions for clover yield and other traits, and was related positively to stolon density and negatively to yield and leaf gigantism traits recorded in monoculture. Clover selection for high levels of competitive stress seems possible either by genotype assessment in stress conditions or by a combination of high yield and stolon density assessed in monoculture. 3aTrifolium repens 3aLolium perenne 3aDactylis glomerata 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aLolium multiflorum 3avarieties 3aplant competition 3adry matter accumulation 3aselection criteria 3agenotype 3aartificial selection 0atolerance 0astress 0amixed pastures 0acrop mixtures 0acompetitive stress1 aPiano, E.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.153-158x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02313naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245011600171300001600287500001500303520097500318650002301293650004501316650001601361650001401377650001101391650001301402650002201415650001301437651001101450653002201461653002501483653002001508700001501528700001501543700002101558700001601579700001501595773008901610852000901699856007801708930003301786945001301819946001101832655001201843IND2041883020221119072808.0940908e199405  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204188302DNAL7 a241859272pmid7 a10.1007/BF002258982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBesse, P.10aGenetic diversity among wild and cultivated populations of Hevea brasiliensis assessed by nuclear RFLP analysis  ap. 199-207.  a2019-12-05  aRestriction fragment length polymorphism was assessed in wild and cultivated populations of Hevea brasiliensis using random probes from an Hevea nuclear library. One-hundred-and-sixty-four individuals were surveyed, and the results discussed in the light of previous work performed on isozyme variation. Both studies show that germplasm collections have led to an effective enrichment of the genetic resources available for Hevea breeding, and that cultivated clones have conserved a relatively high level of polymorphism, despite their narrow genetic base and their high level of inbreeding. An equivalent level of polymorphism is revealed by random nuclear probes and isozymes. However, the genetic structuring of the diversity appears more striking using RFLP markers. Wild accessions can be divided into three genetic groups according to their geographical origin. The present results are an essential guide to the incorporation of wild material in breeding schemes. 3aHevea brasiliensis 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3awild plants 3avarieties 3aclones 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aisozymes 3aBrazil 0acultivated clones 0agenetic polymorphism 0awild accessions1 aSeguin, M.1 aLebrun, P.1 aChevallier, M.H.1 aNicolas, D.1 aLanaud, C.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.199-207x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002258983Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03598naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072000900142072000900151072000900160100001100169245019600180300001800376500002400394520183200418650001202250650002302262650002502285650002102310650002502331650001102356650001302367650001902380650000802399650001002407650001602417650002502433650002002458650001302478650001102491650001102502650001902513650002002532651001402552653002502566700001302591700002102604700001902625700001902644773011702663852000902780856008202789856006802871930003302939945002502972946001102997655001203008IND4383442620221119073313.0060908e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438344262DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08032812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX380 0aX3001 aLi, S.10aInfluence of lipoprotein lipase gene Ser447Stop and β1-adrenergic receptor gene Arg389Gly polymorphisms and their interaction on obesity from childhood to adulthood: the Bogalusa Heart Study  ap. 1183-1188.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To investigate the influence of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) Ser447Stop and beta1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) Arg389Gly gene polymorphisms, individually and in combination, on obesity from childhood to adulthood. Design and subjects: A community-based cohort of 1331 subjects (30% black and 70% white subjects) was followed over an average period of 23 years from childhood (age range: 4-17 years) to adulthood (age range:18-44 years). Measurement: Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and LPL Ser447Stop and the ADRB1 Arg389Gly genotypes. Results: The frequency of the ADRB1 Gly389 allele was 0.25 in white subjects vs 0.39 in black subjects (P<0.001); 0.08 vs 0.05 (P=0.280) for the LPL Stop447 allele. There was no association between the LPL Stop447 allele and BMI among white and black subjects either in childhood and adulthood levels or annual change from childhood to adulthood. The ADRB1 Gly389 allele was associated with lower BMI only in black adults (P = 0.017). Further, the interaction effect of the LPL Stop447 allele and ADRB1 Gly389 allele on adult BMI or its annual change was significant in white subjects and in the total sample (P = 0.03-0.006). Childhood values tended to show a similar trend. Having both ADRB1 Gly389 allele and LPL Stop447 allele was associated with 71% (95% confidence interval: 26-89%) less odds for developing obesity from childhood to adulthood after adjusting for age, race, sex, and childhood BMI. Conclusion: While Gly389 allele of the ADRB1 gene lowers obesity in black subjects, this allele in conjunction with Stop447 allele of the LPL gene lowers obesity in adults and attenuates the development of obesity from childhood to adulthood. These findings underscore the importance of gene-gene interaction in the assessment of genetic influences on complex traits such as obesity. 3aobesity 3alipoprotein lipase 3aadrenergic receptors 3agene interaction 3agenetic polymorphism 3aadults 3achildren 3acohort studies 3amen 3awomen 3aadolescents 3alongitudinal studies 3abody mass index 3agenotype 3aWhites 3aBlacks 3aheart diseases 3arisk assessment 3aLouisiana 0aBogalusa Heart Study1 aChen, W.1 aSrinivasan, S.R.1 aBoerwinkle, E.1 aBerenson, G.S.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2006 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.1183-1188dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08032813Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02397naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100001600186245010900202300001800311500002400329500001500353520100600368650002401374650001401398650001701412650001901429650001901448650002601467650002201493650002001515650001801535651002101553653002501574653001801599700002801617773011301645852000901758856009101767930003301858945002501891946001101916655001201927IND4383442920221119073201.0060908e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438344292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aQ505 0aF200 0aS2001 aOzcan, M.M.14aThe Strawberry (Arbutus unedo L.) fruits: Chemical composition, physical properties and mineral contents  ap. 1022-1028.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNutrition and physical properties were established in developing Arbutus unedo L.

Using a total of 50 RFLP and 92 RAPD markers, the relatedness between the lines was determined. In total, the RFLP and the RAPD analysis revealed more than 500 and 400 bands, respectively. The relative frequencies of loci with allele differences were estimated from the band data. Th RFLP and RAPD marker sets detected very similar relationships among the three lines, consistent with known pedigree data, Bootstrap analyses showed that the use of approximately 30 probes or primers would have been sufficient to achieve these relationships. This indicates that RAPD markers have the same resolving power as RFLP markers when used on exactly the same set of B. napus genotypes. Since RAPD markers are easier and quicker to use, these markers may be preferred in applications where the relationships between closely-related breeding lines are of interest. The use of RAPD markers in fingerprinting applications may, however, not be warranted, and this is discussed in relation to the reliability of RAPD markers. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aDNA 3agenetic distance 3aBrassica napus 3agenetic markers 0alines1 aNilsson, N.O.1 aRading, I.N.1 aSall, T.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Apr., v. 88, no. 1 p.123-128x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002224043Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02115naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165100001400182245013000196300001600326500001500342520066600357650002501023650002601048650001801074650001901092650002301111650003801134650002501172650002001197650003501217650001101252653001501263653002201278700001301300700001701313700001701330700001401347700001701361773010501378852000901483856007201492930003301564945002501597946001101622655001201633IND4383006220221119073038.0060822e20060831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438300622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The high concordances of 92.4% (351/380) and 98.2% (373/380) between ELISA and IFAT for B. caballi and B. equi, respectively suggest that ELISA, especially for B. equi infection, could be alternative to the corresponding IFAT for serodiagnoses of equine piroplasmosis, although some improvements are required in ELISA for B. caballi. 3arecombinant antigens 3adiagnostic techniques 3aserodiagnosis 3aTheileria equi 3aantibody detection 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequine piroplasmosis 3aBabesia caballi 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahorses 0ababesiosis 0adisease diagnosis1 aXuan, X.1 aYokoyama, N.1 aKatayama, Y.1 aAnzai, T.1 aIgarashi, I.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2006 Aug. 31, v. 140, no. 1-2 p.158-161wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.03.0133electronic resource  a20060906b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03234naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245008900173300001600262520205800278650002002336650002202356650002302378650001702401650002402418650002102442650002302463653002502486653003602511653001902547700001802566700001802584773009002602852000902692856007802701930003302779945001302812946001102825655001202836IND2039097520221119073104.0940426e199312  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203909752DNAL7 a241903172pmid7 a10.1007/BF002150902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerrier, E.10aLong-term effects of selection based on the animal model BLUP in a finite population  ap. 446-454.  aMonte Carlo simulation was used to assess the long-term effects of truncation selection within small populations using indices (I = omega f + m) combining mid-parent [f = (a(s) + a(d))/2] and Mendelian-sampling (m = a - f) evaluations provided by an animal model BLUP (a = f + m). Phenotypic values of panmictic populations were generated for 30 discrete generations. Assuming a purely additive polygenic model, heritability (h2) values were 0.10, 0.25 or 0.50. Two population sizes were considered: five males and 25 females selected out of 50 candidates of each sex (small populations, S) and 50 males and 250 females selected out of 500 candidates in each sex (large populations, L). Selection was carried out on the index defined above with omega = 1 (animal model BLUP), omega = 1/2, or omega = 0 (selection on within-family deviations). Mass selection was also considered. Selection based on the animal model BLUP (omega = 1) maximized the cumulative genetic gain in L populations. In S populations, selection using omega = 1/2 and mass selection were more efficient than selection under an animal model (+3 to +7% and +1 to +4% respectively, depending on h2). Selection on within-family deviations always led to the lowest gains. In most cases, the variance of response to selection between replicates did not depend on the selection method. The within-replicate genetic variance and the average coefficient of inbreeding (F) were highly affected by selection with omega = 1 or 1/2, especially in populations of size S. As expected, selection based on within-family deviations was less detrimental in that respect. The number of copies of founder neutral genes at a separate locus, and the probability vector of origin of the genes in reference to the founder animals, were also observed in addition to F values. The conclusion was that selection procedures placing less emphasis on family information might be interesting alternatives to selection based on animal model BLUP, especially for small populations with long-term selection objectives. 3aanimal breeding 3aselection methods 3aMonte Carlo method 3aheritability 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variance 3aselection response 0atruncation selection 0abest linear unbiased prediction 0agenetic models1 aColleau, J.J.1 aFoulley, J.L.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Dec., v. 87, no. 4 p.446-454x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002150903Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04083naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002000176245011800196300001600314500024300330500002400573500001500597520207400612650002502686650002202711650001102733650002302744650002002767650001002787650002102797650001502818650001302833650001902846650001902865650001502884651001002899653002402909653002602933653004702959653001803006700001503024700001703039700001503056700001403071700001603085700001603101700001603117700001903133700001703152700001503169773009403184852000903278856008903287930003303376945002503409946001103434655001203445IND4426035320140725000000.0090918e20090830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aX100 0aX6201 aSaux-Picart, S.10aWater and energy budgets simulation over the AMMA-Niger super-site spatially constrained with remote sensing data  ap. 287-295.  aIn the special issue: Surface processes and water cycle in West Africa, studied from the AMMA-CATCH observing system / edited by Thierry Lebel, Bernard Cappelaere, Baxter Vieus, Sylvie Galle, Niall Hanan, Laurent Kergoat and Sameul Levis.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe SEtHyS_Savannah model [Saux-Picart et al., submitted for publication. SEtHyS_Savannah: a multiple source land surface model applied to sahelian landscapes. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology] was developed as an extension of the SEtHyS land surface model to simulate the water and energy fluxes over dry savannah landscapes. The vegetation cover is represented by a two layer model and a mulch approach is used for the soil description. The SEtHyS_Savannah model was regionalized over the AMMA-Niger super-site (about 50km by40km), with the help of remote sensing data. The model uses a regular 1km grid and each cell is divided in sub-grid patches in order to represent land cover and soil heterogeneities (tile approach). The vegetation cover parameters were prescribed according to the land cover map and the seasonal evolution of the Leaf Area Index (LAI), both derived from SPOT-HRV (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre - High Resolution Visible) data imagery. The atmospheric forcing was assumed homogeneous over the area and provided by a meteorological station installed at the Fakara experimental site. The surface water and energy budgets were simulated over a one-year period (2005) at a 5-min time step and validated against MSG-SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation - Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-red Imager) land surface temperature and ENVISAT-ASAR (ENVIronnement SATellite - Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) soil humidity products. The results show realistic surface fluxes and good agreement with the MSG-SEVIRI temperature observations. The soil moisture comparison presents significant correlation but large root mean square errors. These discrepancies are the consequence of both the use of a non-spatialized atmospheric forcing and to residual vegetation effects on the radar signal. Despite these uncertainties, the results increase confidence in the model representation of Sahelian soil-vegetation processes and open new perspectives to quantify the effects of vegetation changes on evapotranspiration and runoff over the region. 3aenvironmental models 3asimulation models 3acanopy 3asoil water content 3aleaf area index 3aSahel 3avegetation cover 3asoil water 3asavannas 3aremote sensing 3aenergy balance 3aunderstory 3aNiger 0amathematical models 0aSetHyS_Savannah model 0aAfrican Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis 0awater balance1 aOttlé, C.1 aDecharme, B.1 aAndré, C.1 aZribi, M.1 aPerrier, A.1 aCoudert, B.1 aBoulain, N.1 aCappelaere, B.1 aDescroix, L.1 aRamier, D.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Aug. 30, v. 375, no. 1-2 p.287-295dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.12.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090928b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02310naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001400146245009400160300001800254500002400272520105400296650001701350650002001367650002401387650002301411650003801434650002201472653005901494700001401553700001201567700001701579700001301596773016201609852000901771856006101780930003301841945002501874946001301899655001201912IND4383460020221119073021.0060908e20060809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438346002DNAL7 a10.1021/jf060275j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2031 aZhang, S.10aDevelopment of a Chemiluminescent ELISA for Determining Chloramphenicol in Chicken Muscle  ap. 5718-5722.  aIncludes references  aAn indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with chemiluminescent (CL) detection for chloramphenicol (CAP) in chicken muscle was developed. CAP-specific polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbit with a CAP-succinate derivative conjugated with bovine serum albumin. Luminol solution was used as the substrate of horseradish peroxidase. The detection limit was 6 ng/L. The CL-ELISA was 10 times more sensitive compared to the colorimetric-ELISA. When CAP was spiked in chicken muscle at levels of 0.05-5 microgram/kg, recoveries ranged from 97 to 118% with coefficients of variation of 6-22%. In an actual residue study, the results obtained by CL-ELISA correlated well with those obtained by gas chromatography with microcell electron capture detector. The residue levels of CAP in treated chicken decreased with time and dropped rapidly after the first 6 h from around 50 to 10 g/kg. After 3 days, CAP was not detected in chicken muscle. The developed method is therefore suitable for screening of CAP in chicken muscle samples. 3achicken meat 3achloramphenicol 3aantibiotic residues 3afood contamination 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3achemiluminescence 0aindirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay1 aZhang, Z.1 aShi, W.1 aEremin, S.A.1 aShen, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Aug. 9, v. 54, no. 16 p.5718-5722dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf060275j3electronic resource  a20070322b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/22  aOther US 7aarticle04192naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001900167245007400186300001300260500024300273500002400516500001500540520241100555650001902966650001002985650000902995650002403004650001303028650002103041651001003062651000903072651001003081651001803091653004703109700002403156700001803180700001703198700002103215700001803236700001803254700001803272700002103290700001703311700002403328700001603352773009103368852000903459856008903468930003303557945002503590946001103615655001203626IND4426035420140725000000.0090918e20090830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aB2001 aLebel, Thierry10aAMMA-CATCH studies in the Sahelian region of West-Africa: An overview  ap. 3-13.  aIn the special issue: Surface processes and water cycle in West Africa, studied from the AMMA-CATCH observing system / edited by Thierry Lebel, Bernard Cappelaere, Baxter Vieus, Sylvie Galle, Niall Hanan, Laurent Kergoat and Sameul Levis.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) is an international and interdisciplinary experiment designed to investigate the interactions between atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial systems and their joint controls on tropical monsoon dynamics in West Africa. This special issue reports results from a group of AMMA studies regrouped in the component “Couplage de l'Atmosphère Tropicale et du Cycle Hydrologique” (CATCH). AMMA-CATCH studies focus on measuring and understanding land surface properties and processes in West Africa, the role of terrestrial systems in altering boundary layer dynamics, and thus the potential that surface hydrology and biology, and human land use practices, may directly or indirectly affect monsoon dynamics and rainfall in the region. AMMA-CATCH studies focus on three intensively instrumented mesoscale sites in Mali, Niger and Benin that sample across the 100-1300mm/annum rainfall gradient of the Sahel, Sudan and North-Guinean bioclimatic zones. Studies report on: (i) surface-boundary layer interactions that may influence atmospheric convergence and convective processes and thus rainfall type, timing and amount; (ii) vegetation dynamics at seasonal to decadal time-scales that may respond to, and alter, atmospheric processes; (iii) surface-atmosphere fluxes of heat, water and carbon dioxide that directly influence the atmosphere; (iv) soil moisture variability in space and time that provide the proximate control on vegetation activity, evapotranspiration and energy balance; and (v) local and mesoscale modeling of hydrology and land surface-atmosphere exchanges to assess their role in the hydrological, atmospheric and rainfall dynamics of West Africa. The AMMA-CATCH research reported in this issue will be extended in future years as measurements and analysis continue and are concluded within the context of both CATCH and the wider AMMA study. This body of research will contribute to an improved understanding of the functioning of the coupled West African system, and enhance our ability to model and predict rainfall, vegetation and biogeochemical dynamics across time-scales (day, year, decade, and century), and in response to changing climate and land use. Such information is vital for policy makers and managers in planning for future economic development, sustainability and livelihoods of the growing populations of the region. 3amonsoon season 3aSahel 3arain 3awatershed hydrology 3aland use 3aclimatic factors 3aBenin 3aMali 3aNiger 0aAfrica, West. 0aAfrican Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis1 aCappelaere, Bernard1 aGalle, Sylvie1 aHanan, Niall1 aKergoat, Laurent1 aLevis, Samuel1 aVieux, Baxter1 aDescroix, Luc1 aGosset, Marielle1 aMougin, Eric1 aPeugeot, Christophe1 aSeguis, Luc0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Aug. 30, v. 375, no. 1-2 p.3-13dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.03.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03562naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011800168300001600286520243000302650001302732650002002745650001302765651001002778653002002788653002802808653001302836653002502849653001902874700003102893700002202924773011602946852000903062856008503071930003303156946001103189655001203200IND4407803320221119072846.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440780332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-1006-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebernardi, Laura 10aCorrelation between nitrate concentration in groundwater and parameters affecting aquifer intrinsic vulnerability  ap. 539-558.  aThis paper is the result of a study which was carried out in order to verify if the traditional methods to evaluate the intrinsic vulnerability or vulnerability related parameters, are able to clarify the problem of nitrate pollution in groundwater. In particular, the aim was to evaluate limitations and problems connected to aquifer vulnerability methods applied to nitrate contamination prevision in groundwater. The investigation was carried out by comparing NO₃ ⁻ concentrations, measured in March and November 2004 in the shallow aquifer, and the vulnerability classes, obtained by using GOD and TOT methods. Moreover, it deals with a comparison between NO₃ ⁻ concentrations and single parameters (depth to water table, land use and nitrogen input). The study area is the plain sector of Piemonte (Northern Italy), where an unconfined aquifer nitrate contamination exists. In this area the anthropogenic presence is remarkable and the input of N-fertilizers and zootechnical effluents to the soil cause a growing amount of nitrates in groundwater. This approach, used in a large area (about 10,000 km²) and in several monitoring wells (about 500), allowed to compare the efficiency of different vulnerability methods and to verify the importance of every parameter on the nitrate concentrations in the aquifer. Furthermore it allowed to obtain interesting correlations in different hydrogeological situations. Correlations between depth to water table, land use and nitrogen input to the soil with nitrate concentrations in groundwater show unclear situations: in fact these comparisons describe the phenomenon trend and highlight the maximum nitrate concentrations for each circumstance but often show wide ranges of possible nitrate concentrations. The same situation could be observed by comparing vulnerability indexes and nitrate concentrations in groundwater. These results suggest that neither single parameters nor vulnerability methods (GOD and TOT) are able to describe individually the complex phenomena affecting nitrate concentrations in soil, subsoil and groundwater. In particular, the traditional methods for vulnerability analysis do not analyze physical processes in aquifers, such as denitrification and nitrate dilution. According to a recent study in the shallow unconfined aquifer of the Piemonte plain, dilution can be considered as the main cause for nitrate attenuation in groundwater. 3anitrates 3adenitrification 3aland use 3aItaly 0aShallow aquifer 0aIntrinsic vulnerability 0aDilution 0aDepth to water table 0aNitrogen input1 aDe Luca, Domenico Antonio 1 aLasagna, Manuela 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 Aug., v. 55, no. 3 p.539-558dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1006-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02868naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245009300176300001800269520157700287650002301864650001801887650001801905650001201923650001901935650002001954650001301974650001101987650001101998650000902009653001402018653001802032653001302050653001902063653001402082653001402096700002302110700002402133773012002157852000902277856009202286930003302378946001102411655001202422IND4405731720221119072949.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440573172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01588.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltermatt, Florian.10aClimate change affects colonization dynamics in a metacommunity of three Daphnia species  ap. 1209-1220.  aClimate change is expected to alter the range and abundance of many species by influencing habitat qualities. For species living in fragmented populations, not only the quality of the present patches but also access to new habitat patches may be affected. Here, we show that colonization in a metacommunity can be directly influenced by weather changes, and that these observed weather changes are consistent with global climate change models. Using a long-term dataset from a rock pool metacommunity of the three species Daphnia magna, Daphnia longispina and Daphnia pulex with 507 monitored habitat patches, we correlated a four-fold increase in colonization rate with warmer, drier weather for the period from 1982 to 2006. The higher colonization rate after warm and dry summers led to an increase in metacommunity dynamics over time. A mechanistic explanation for the increased colonization rate is that the resting stages have a higher exposure to animal and wind dispersal in desiccated rock pools. Although colonization rates reacted in the same direction in all three species, there were significant species-specific effects that resulted in an overall change in the metacommunity composition. Increased local instability and colonization dynamics may even lead to higher global stability of the metacommunity. Thus, whereas climate change has been reported to cause a unidirectional change in species range for many other species, it changes the dynamics and composition of an entire community in this metacommunity, with winners and losers difficult to predict. 3aDaphnia longispina 3aDaphnia magna 3aDaphnia pulex 3aanimals 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3amodels 3asummer 3awind 0adispersal 0aD. longispina 0aD. pulex 0ametapopulation 0amigration 0arock pool1 aPAJUNEN, V.

ASM in vitro exhibited an antifungal dose-dependant activity in the form of reduced mycelial growth. This inhibition reached 40% in comparison with the control at a concentration of 0.5 g/l ASM in the growth media. Seed imbibition with ASM at a concentration of 0.08 g/l and 0.5 g/l significantly induced a reduction of the intensity of hypocotyl rot symptoms caused by R. solani AG-4 that was correlated with a stimulation of chitinase activity. The protective effect of ASM against R. solani AG-4 is probably due to the combination of induced resistance and its effect on pathogen growth. Seed treatment with ASM affected also the growth of 2-day-old seedlings. A dose-dependant inhibition of the seminal root growth was observed which reached 53% at a concentration of 0.5 g/l ASM. This growth reduction of soybean was transitional and was rapidly recovered in optimal growth conditions except at 0.5 g/l of ASM. 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aacibenzolar-S-methyl 3achitinase 3aculture media 3agrowth retardation 3ahypocotyls 3aimbibition 3ainduced resistance 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aprotective effect 3aroot growth 3aseed treatment 3aseedlings 3asoybeans 0abenzothiadiazole 0afitness cost1 aNassr, N.1 aLebeau, T.1 aWalter, B.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2008 Apr., v. 156, no. 4 p.236-242dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2007.01367.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03780naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100001700170245012400187300001800311500002400329500001500353520169200368650003102060650002302091650001202114650001902126650002302145650002502168650001302193650001202206650002002218650001602238650001902254650001002273650002102283650002002304650001002324650001802334650002702352650001102379650002202390650001102412650000902423650001602432650002702448650003402475650003002509650001602539650001702555650002202572650001602594653001102610653001902621700001902640700001702659700001902676700001802695773011702713852000902830856008202839856006802921930003302989945002503022946001103047655001203058IND4383444720221119073013.0060908e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438344472DNAL7 a164911112pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08032562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aTemple, J.L.10aRelationship between sex of parent and child on weight loss and maintenance in a family-based obesity treatment program  ap. 1260-1264.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To determine if the sex of the participating parent/child pair is a contributing factor in initial weight loss and maintenance within a family-based obesity treatment program. Design: A 2-year family-based obesity treatment program targeting one overweight parent and one overweight child. Subjects: One overweight parent (body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 25) and child (greater than or equal to 85th BMI percentile) from 164 families. Measurements: Parameters of body weight, including height, weight, BMI, z-BMI, percent overweight (BOV) at baseline and at 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up time points. Results: Children within the opposite-sex dyads had greater weight loss (P<0.01) at 6- and 12-month time points compared with children in the same-sex dyads. Parents within opposite-sex dyads had significantly greater weight loss at 24 months (P<0.05) compared with those in the same-sex dyads. When individual dyads were examined, the change in child z-BMI after 6 months was greater for the mother-son dyad as compared to the mother-daughter and father-son (P<0.05). For parent z-BMI, the mother-daughter dyad consistently exhibited the poorest results. At 6- and 12-month time points, parents in the mother-daughter dyad lost significantly less weight than parents in all other dyads (P<0.05), and at 24 months, parents in the mother-daughter dyad lost less weight than parents in the opposite-sex dyads (P<0.05). Conclusion: These data reveal that child-parent sex interactions can strongly influence the outcome of obesity treatment when both parent and child are the target for weight loss. The reasons that underlie this effect remain to be determined. 3aparent-child relationships 3apatient compliance 3aparents 3acohort studies 3agender differences 3apsychosocial factors 3achildren 3aobesity 3abody mass index 3aweight loss 3aweight control 2aAdult 2aBehavior Therapy 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aFamily Health 2aFather-Child Relations 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMother-Child Relations 2aObesityxpsychologyxtherapy. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aSex Factors 2aTime Factors 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWeight Loss 0agender 0afamily studies1 aWrotniak, B.H.1 aPaluch, R.A.1 aRoemmich, J.N.1 aEpstein, L.H.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2006 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.1260-1264dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08032563Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02089naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245004700146300001400193520068400207650002200891650002800913650001700941650002100958650001300979650001300992650001301005650001601018650002501034650000901059650002101068650003701089650002701126650003701153650001301190650001301203650002501216650004101241650002701282650001901309650002301328650002801351700001301379700001701392773009401409852000901503930003301512945001301545946001301558655001201571IND2058655420221119072952.0970726e199607  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205865542DNAL7 a87566132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubramani, S.10aStability of invertase in reverse micelles  ap. 33-39.  aThe stability of invertase was studied under various conditions, including at 75 degrees C, in presence of stabilizers (sorbitol and glycerol) at 75 degrees C, and in the presence of denaturants (urea and trichloroacetic acid) at 37 degrees C in reverse micelles.

Four wildtype strains of Azospirillum and their IAA-deficient mutants were co-immobilized with C. vulgaris in alginate beads. Cultures were grown in synthetic growth medium supplemented with tryptophan. Growth promotion of microalgae and production of exogenous IAA by Azospirillum spp. were monitored. All wildtype Azospirillum spp. produced significant but varying amounts of IAA, while their mutant forms produced significantly less. The results demonstrated a significant growth promotion in Chlorella cultures when immobilized with the four wildtype strains of Azospirillum, while very low or no enhanced growth was induced by the four IAA-deficient mutants, compared to when C. vulgaris is immobilized alone. A complementation experiment, where an IAA-attenuated mutant (A. brasilense SpM7918) was supplemented with IAA produced by its parental wildtype strain (A. brasilense Sp6), restored growth promotion in the microalgae-mutant culture. 3aAzospirillum 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aalgae culture 3abacteria 3aculture media 3agrowth promotion 3aindole acetic acid 3amicroalgae 3amutants 3atryptophan 0aplant-growth-promoting bacteria1 aAntoun, Hani1 aBashan, Yoav0 tJournal of phycology.g2008 Aug., v. 44, no. 4 p.938-947dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00533.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04146naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011500182300001600297500002400313520188400337650002402221650002602245650002602271650002302297650001202320650002502332650002902357650001902386650002102405650002402426650002302450650000902473650000902482650001802491650001002509650001702519650002802536650001102564650001102575650001202586650000902598650001002607650001602617650001202633650005502645650006002700650000902760650007202769650002402841650001102865650007602876650005602952650003403008650001703042650003303059650004203092651001103134651002603145700002203171700002003193700002003213773009703233852000903330856008503339655001203424IND4441032320221119072814.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444103232DNAL7 a205325632pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-010-1926-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlimpel, Sven10aGastrointestinal and ectoparasites from urban stray dogs in Fortaleza (Brazil): high infection risk for humans  ap. 713-719.  aIncludes references  aDogs are important definite or reservoir hosts for zoonotic parasites. However, only few studies on the prevalence of intestinal parasites in urban areas in Brazil are available. We performed a comprehensive study on parasites of stray dogs in a Brazilian metropolitan area. We included 46 stray dogs caught in the urban areas of Fortaleza (northeast Brazil). After euthanization, dogs were autopsied. Ectoparasites were collected, and the intestinal content of dogs were examined for the presence of parasites. Faecal samples were collected and analysed using merthiolate iodine formaldehyde concentration method. A total of nine different parasite species were found, including five endoparasite (one protozoan, one cestode and three nematode species) and four ectoparasite species (two flea, one louse and one tick species). In the intestinal content, 3,162 specimens of four helminth species were found: Ancylostoma caninum (prevalence, 95.7%), Dipylidium caninum (45.7%), Toxocara canis (8.7%) and Trichuris vulpis (4.3%). A total of 394 ectoparasite specimens were identified, including Rhipicephalus sanguineus (prevalence, 100.0%), Heterodoxus spiniger (67.4%), Ctenocephalides canis (39.1%) and Ctenocephalides felis (17.4%). In the faeces, intestinal parasites were detected in 38 stray dogs (82.6%), including oocysts of Giardia sp. (2.2%) and eggs of the nematode A. caninum (82.6%). Neither eggs nor larval stages of D. caninum, T. canis or T. vulpis were detected in dog faeces. Sensitivity of faecal examination for A. caninum was 86.4% (95% confidence interval, 72.0-94.3) but zero percentage for the other intestinal helminth species. Our data show that stray dogs in northeast Brazil carry a multitude of zoonotic ecto- and endoparasites, posing a considerable risk for humans. With the exception of A. caninum, sensitivity of faecal examination was negligible. 3aAncylostoma caninum 3aCtenocephalides canis 3aCtenocephalides felis 3aDipylidium caninum 3aGiardia 3aHeterodoxus spiniger 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aToxocara canis 3aTrichuris vulpis 3aconfidence interval 3adisease reservoirs 3adogs 3aeggs 3aendoparasites 3afeces 3aformaldehyde 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3aiodine 3aoocysts 3arisk 3aticks 3aurban areas 2aAnimals 2aCestodaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aDogs 2aEctoparasitic Infestationsxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aFecesxparasitology 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Diseases, Parasiticxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aNematodaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aRhipicephalusxclassification 2aRural Health 2aSiphonapteraxclassification 2aZoonosesxparasitologyxtransmission. 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aHeukelbach, Jörg1 aPothmann, David1 aRückert, Sonja0 tParasitology research.g2010 Aug., v. 107, no. 3 p.713-719dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-010-1926-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04525naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001500158245010600173300001600279500024300295500002400538500001500562520253700577650001603114650001603130650002303146650001903169650001103188650002003199650002303219650001003242650002003252650001403272650001903286650001103305650001503316650001203331651000903343653001903352653002303371653002003394653001603414653004703430700001603477700001503493700001603508700001603524700001803540700001803558700001703576700001603593700001703609773009403626852000903720856008903729930003303818945002503851946001103876655001203887IND4426034420221119073013.0090918e20090830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aTimouk, F.10aResponse of surface energy balance to water regime and vegetation development in a Sahelian landscape  ap. 178-189.  aIn the special issue: Surface processes and water cycle in West Africa, studied from the AMMA-CATCH observing system / edited by Thierry Lebel, Bernard Cappelaere, Baxter Vieus, Sylvie Galle, Niall Hanan, Laurent Kergoat and Sameul Levis.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe West African monsoon interacts strongly with the land surface, yet knowledge of these interactions is severely limited by the lack of observations of surface energy fluxes. Within the framework of the AMMA project, three eddy covariance flux stations were installed to sample the three main surface types near Hombori (Mali) in the central Sahel at 15.3°N, and a fourth station was installed near Bamba in the northern Sahel at 17.1°N to sample semi-desert conditions. Observed land types near Hombori comprised a grassland growing on sandy soil (near the village of Agoufou), a flooded forest in a clay-soil depression (Kelma), and a bare rocky soil (Eguerit). The energy balance closure at the grassland site was satisfactory, but less so at the flooded forest site. Surface water heat storage during the flood and advection probably were responsible for most of the imbalance. The daily sensible heat flux (H) was fairly constant throughout the year at Bamba and Eguerit, with only a slight increase during the monsoon season corresponding to increased net radiation. By contrast, the seasonal cycle of the grassland site was marked, with H decreasing during the monsoon season from 70Wm⁻² in May to 20Wm⁻² in August. The flooded woodland exhibited the strongest contrast between the dry and wet seasons, with daily sensible heat flux close to zero during the flood. During the peak monsoon season, the two vegetated sites had the highest net radiation and the lowest sensible heat flux, as a consequence of the strong evapotranspiration rates caused by both high soil moisture availability and high leaf area index. Lateral fluxes of water were found to be strong drivers of inter-site sensible and latent heat fluxes variability, with water leaving bare rocky soils as surface runoff and ending in the clay depressions (e.g., Kelma), whereas the sandy soils were locally endorheic, with most of the rainfall being rapidly returned to the atmosphere. An attempt was made to scale the sensible heat flux up to the scale of the AMMA northern super-site (60kmx60km), following a simple scaling scheme, which accounted for the contrasting surface types and water regimes. The super-site average sensible heat flux proved to be close to the grassland sensible heat flux, in part because grassland occupies 55% of the area. A strong spatial variability was caused by the difference in water regime and vegetation type, at a scale large enough to potentially influence the atmospheric properties such as the boundary layer. 3astony soils 3asandy soils 3aevapotranspiration 3amonsoon season 3afloods 3aleaf area index 3aflooded conditions 3aSahel 3agrassland soils 3awoodlands 3aenergy balance 3arunoff 3agrasslands 3aforests 3aMali 0asurface layers 0asoil water regimes 0aflooded forests 0arocky soils 0aAfrican Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis1 aKergoat, L.1 aMougin, E.1 aLloyd, C.R.1 aCeschia, E.1 aCohard, J.-M.1 aRosnay, P. de1 aHiernaux, P.1 aDemarez, V.1 aTaylor, C.M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Aug. 30, v. 375, no. 1-2 p.178-189dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.04.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20090929b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03278naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012300173300001600296520201600312650002802328650001402356650000902370650001002379650002302389650001402412650001402426650001402440650000902454650001602463650001602479651001202495653002702507653002102534653002302555700001902578773011402597852000902711856009202720930003302812946001102845655001202856IND4404228720221119072911.0080412e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440422872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01954.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYOUNG, JOELLE D.10aModification of the diel vertical migration of Bythotrephes longimanus by the cold-water planktivore, Coregonus artedi  ap. 981-995.  a1. The weak diel vertical migration observed in the large cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus seems contradictory to the predator-avoidance hypothesis that predicts large zooplankton should have long migration amplitudes. However, cold-water planktivores, especially Coregonus spp., are a main source of mortality for Bythotrephes and hence a deeper migration would result in a greater overlap with these hypolimnetic planktivores. We hypothesized that Coregonus artedi (cisco) modifies the normal vertical migration pattern of Bythotrephes, such that the latter stays higher in the water column during the day and thus migrates less extremely at night. 2. The vertical distribution of Bythotrephes during the day was determined from single visits to six lakes in Ontario, Canada, all of which contain warm-water, epilimnetic planktivores but differing in whether they contain cisco. One lake of each fish type was sampled day and night every 2-3 weeks over the ice-free season to examine daytime depths and migration amplitude. 3. The vertical migration of Bythotrephes differed in the presence and absence of cisco. In the lakes with cisco, there were significantly fewer Bythotrephes in the hypolimnion and they were higher in the water column during the day. Migration amplitude was smaller in the cisco than in the non-cisco lake. These observations were not attributable to differences in physical factors, and, although not conclusively attributable to cisco, are consistent with an effect of cisco. 4. We suggest that diurnal depth selection by Bythotrephes in lakes containing cisco is a trade-off between the risk of predation by warm- versus cold-water predators, balanced by the benefits of increased temperature and feeding rates near the surface. Even in lakes without cisco, however, the vertical migration of Bythotrephes was less than expected, suggesting that diurnal depth selection is a balance between the risk from warm-water planktivores and access to sufficient light to feed effectively. 3aBythotrephes longimanus 3aCoregonus 3afish 3alakes 3amigratory behavior 3amortality 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3atemperature 3azooplankton 3aOntario 0acold-water planktivore 0aCoregonus artedi 0avertical migration1 aYAN, NORMAN D.0 tFreshwater biology.g2008 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.981-995dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01954.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080412b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02955naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002400168245009700192300001600289500002400305500001500329520148100344650002601825650002101851650001501872650001201887650001301899650002201912650001601934650002301950650002501973650002001998651001202018653003902030653001802069653001802087653002202105653001702127653001802144653001902162773010002181852000902281856009002290930003302380945002502413946001102438655001202449IND4442424620221119073335.0100916e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444242462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2010.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE500 0aX8001 aDuenckmann, Florian14aThe village in the mind: Applying Q-methodology to re-constructing constructions of rurality  ap. 284-295.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn recent years rural studies have focused on the analysis of different notions of ‘the rural’ and how they are constructed in expert discourses as well as in everyday life. Dealing empirically with such patterns of meaning, poses special challenges to social science. In this article I want to explore Q-methodology that approaches subjectivity in a particular way. Instead of beginning with the individual – as it is done in case study approaches – or with socio-demographic categories – as surveys usually do – Q-methodology attempts to put the focus of inquiry on the content of subjectivity itself, i.e. the integral views and their internal frame of reference. Q-methodology can be conceived as a hybrid of qualitative and quantitative methodology since it combines mathematical procedures like factor analysis with a genuine constructivist and interpretative approach to ‘reality’. An example of a study in which Q-methodology was applied is presented. The aim of this analysis was to explore the different views of village development and community life that existed in a municipality of the exurban hinterland of Hamburg. As a result of this study three distinct perceptions of rurality are identified: an idyllic, a reform-oriented and an anti-conservationist view. Based on a structured comparison of these three views it is shown how Q-methodology can contribute new perspectives and insights to the debate about social representations of rurality. 3aquantitative analysis 3arural population 3ainterviews 3asurveys 3avillages 3arural development 3arural areas 3asocial environment 3aqualitative analysis 3arural sociology 3aGermany 0asocial representations of rurality 0aQ-methodology 0arural society 0adiscourse studies 0asubjectivity 0arural studies 0acommunity life0 tJournal of rural studies.g2010 July, v. 26, no. 3 p.284-295dElsevier Sciencex0743-01677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2010.01.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20101207b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle04633naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245012000185300001600305500024300321500002400564500001500588520264300603650002303246650002303269650001203292650001903304650001103323650001803334650002303352650001003375650002303385650001903408650001303427650000903440650001903449651001003468653001903478653004703497653001803544700002103562700002403583700001903607700001903626700002003645700002603665700002503691700001803716700002403734773009403758852000903852856008903861930003303950945002503983946001104008655001204019IND4426034620140725000000.0090918e20090830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aF6001 aRamier, David10aTowards an understanding of coupled physical and biological processes in the cultivated Sahel - 1.

The two stations, sited in a millet field and in a semi-natural fallow savanna plot, sample the two dominant land cover types in this area typical of the cultivated Sahel. The 2-year study period enables an analysis of seasonal variations over two full wet-dry seasons cycles, characterized by two contrasted rain seasons that allow capturing a part of the interannual variability. All components of the surface energy budget (four-component radiation budget, soil heat flux and temperature, eddy fluxes) are measured independently, allowing for a quality check through analysis of the energy balance closure. Water cycle monitoring includes rainfall, evapotranspiration (from vapour eddy flux), and soil moisture at six depths. The main modes of observed variability are described, for the various energy and hydrological variables investigated. Results point to the dominant role of water in the energy cycle variability, be it seasonal, interannual, or between land cover types. Rainfall is responsible for nearly as much seasonal variations of most energy-related variables as solar forcing. Depending on water availability and plant requirements, evapotranspiration pre-empts the energy available from surface forcing radiation, over the other dependent processes (sensible and ground heat, outgoing long wave radiation). In the water budget, pre-emption by evapotranspiration leads to very large variability in soil moisture and in deep percolation, seasonally, interannually, and between vegetation types. The wetter 2006 season produced more evapotranspiration than 2005 from the fallow but not from the millet site, reflecting differences in plant development. Rain-season evapotranspiration is nearly always lower at the millet site. Higher soil moisture at this site suggests that this difference arises from lower vegetation requirements rather than from lower infiltration/higher runoff. This difference is partly compensated for during the next dry season. Effects of water and vegetation on the energy budget appear to occur more through latent heat than through albedo. A large part of albedo variability comes from soil wetting and drying. Prior to the onset of monsoon rain, the change in air mass temperature and wind produces, through modulation of sensible heat, a marked chilling effect on the components of the surface energy budget. 3aagricultural soils 3aevapotranspiration 3amillets 3amonsoon season 3afallow 3asavanna soils 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aSahel 3aseasonal variation 3asemiarid soils 3asavannas 3arain 3aenergy balance 3aNiger 0asemiarid zones 0aAfrican Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis 0awater balance1 aBoulain, Nicolas1 aCappelaere, Bernard1 aTimouk, Franck1 aRabanit, Manon1 aLloyd, Colin R.1 aBoubkraoui, Stéphane1 aMétayer, Frédéric1 aDescroix, Luc1 aWawrzyniak, Vincent0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Aug. 30, v. 375, no. 1-2 p.204-216dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.12.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090928b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03394naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001600158245013800174300001600312500024300328500002400571500001500595520152300610650002102133650001002154650001502164650001202179650001902191650001802210651001002228653001902238653001902257653002602276653001702302653001402319653003502333653004702368700001802415700001602433700001502449700001602464700001902480700001902499700001702518700001702535700001502552773009402567852000902661856008902670930003302759945002502792946001102817655001202828IND4426034720221119073339.0090918e20090830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aEzzahar, J.10aCombining scintillometer measurements and an aggregation scheme to estimate area-averaged latent heat flux during the AMMA experiment  ap. 217-226.  aIn the special issue: Surface processes and water cycle in West Africa, studied from the AMMA-CATCH observing system / edited by Thierry Lebel, Bernard Cappelaere, Baxter Vieus, Sylvie Galle, Niall Hanan, Laurent Kergoat and Sameul Levis.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper deals with the issue of using scintillometry in conjunction with a simple aggregation scheme to derive area-averaged sensible and latent heat fluxes over a small watershed in Niamey, Niger (Wankama catchment). Data collected in the context of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) program has been used to test the proposed approach. For this purpose, a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) was set up over heterogeneous surface transect of about 3.2km spanning three vegetation types. The comparison between scintillometer-based estimates of area-averaged sensible heat fluxes and those measured by a network of the classical eddy covariance (EC) devices showed good agreement, with a relative error of about 20% (R ² =0.85, RMSD=22Wm⁻², and SEE=21.39Wm⁻²). This is a good result considering the contrast in terms of the footprint scales associated with the two devices, which is amplified by the heterogeneity of the catchment. The results also showed that using the LAS-derived values of area-average sensible heat flux in conjunction with a simple aggregation rule to estimate area-average available energy led to a reasonable prediction of area-averaged latent heat flux (R ² =0.75, RMSD=64Wm⁻² and SEE=50Wm⁻²), when compared to those measured using the EC network. This is of interest since the LAS can potentially be used to validate estimates of surface fluxes, based on the meso-scale model, as well as those estimated using coarse-scale remote sensing-based algorithm. 3avegetation types 3aSahel 3awatersheds 3atopsoil 3aenergy balance 3aheat transfer 3aNiger 0asurface layers 0ascintillometry 0aregional surface flux 0aheat balance 0aheat flux 0alarge aperture scintillometers 0aAfrican Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis1 aChehbouni, A.1 aHoedjes, J.1 aRamier, D.1 aBoulain, N.1 aBoubkraoui, S.1 aCappelaere, B.1 aDescroix, L.1 aMougenot, B.1 aTimouk, F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Aug. 30, v. 375, no. 1-2 p.217-226dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.01.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090929b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01772naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009300164300001600257500001900273500002400292520069900316650001501015650001601030650000901046650001301055650001301068650001301081650001001094651001401104700002501118700002101143700001701164700002201181700002301203773010301226852000901329856004801338655001201386IND4449524520221119073302.0110225e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444952452DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078110101062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudneva, I.

Drawing upon experiences from Akwatia, Ghana's epicentre of diamond production since the mid-1920s, the analysis challenges the commonly-held view that the region's people are drawn to artisanal mining solely because of a desire ‘to get rich quick’. A combination of events, including the recent closure of Ghana Consolidated Diamonds Ltd's industrial-scale operation and decreased foreign investment in the country's diamond industry over concerns of it potentially harbouring ‘conflict’ stones from neighbouring Côte D'Ivoire, has had a debilitating economic impact on Akwatia. In an attempt to alleviate their hardships, many of the town's so-called ‘lifetime’ diamond miners have managed to secure employment in neighbouring artisanal gold mining camps. But their decision has been condemned by many of the country's policymakers and traditional leaders, who see it solely as a move to secure ‘fast money’. It is argued here, however, that these people pursue work in surrounding artisanal gold mining communities mainly because of poverty, and that their decision has more to do with a desire to immerse in activities with which they are familiar, that offer stable employment and consistent salaries, and provide immediate debt relief. Misdiagnosis of cases such as Akwatia underscores how unfamiliar policymakers and donors are with the dynamics of ASM in sub-Saharan Africa. 3aemployment opportunities 3atraditional technology 3apoverty 3aeconomic analysis 3arural policy 3aglobalization 3aemployment 3aattitudes and opinions 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3amining 3aminerals 3apeople 3aeconomic impact 3aGhana 0ainvestment 0aminers 0alivelihood diversification 0aartisanal mining 0aissues and policy0 tJournal of rural studies.g2010 July, v. 26, no. 3 p.296-307dElsevier Sciencex0743-01677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2010.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20101207b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02048naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245009100151300001800242520105200260650001101312650000901323650002101332650002501353650001701378650002101395650001201416653003901428700001901467700002101486700001501507773009601522852000901618930003301627945001301660946001301673655001201686IND2044527820221119073120.0950209e199411  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204452782DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardes, J.10aInfluence of sodium diet on L-NAME effects on renin release and renal vasoconstriction  ap. F798-F804.  aThe intervention of the L-arginine-NO pathway in renal vasodilation and renin secretion was studied in an isolated perfused rat kidney model. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME 1-26 micromolar), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, caused a dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure (PP) and a dose-dependent decrease in renal perfusate flow. Renin was inhibited independently of the rise in PP, since the effect of L-NAME on renin release was the same when PP was maintained constant. Exposure of rats to low [salt depleted (SD)] or high [salt repleted (SR)] salt intake for 1 mo influenced the renal vascular response to L-NAME (3 micromolar). Isolated SR rat kidney vasculature vasoconstricted to a greater extent after inhibition of NO synthase than did that of SD kidneys. A similar fall in renin release was observed after L-NAME in both groups, despite a higher renin secretion rate in SD than in SR rats. These results suggest that NO-dependent vasodilation counteracts the renal vasoconstrictor effect of sodium loading. 3asodium 3adiet 3anutrient balance 3ametabolic inhibitors 3anitric oxide 3avasoconstriction 3akidneys 0an(g)-nifro-l-arginine methyl ester1 aGonzalez, M.F.1 aAlhenc-Gelas, F.1 aMenard, J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1994 Nov., v. 267, no. 5:pt.2 p.F798-F804x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02696naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001100138245005500149300001600204500002400220520140500244650001601649650001901665650001301684650001301697650002601710650002101736650001901757650001101776650001801787650002101805653002901826653001701855773009801872852000901970856011001979856008902089930003302178945002502211946001302236961001302249655001202262IND4387148820221120043522.0070124s2006    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND438714882DNAL7 a10113/5442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aLe, S.10aCleaning Performance of Modified Cylinder Cleaners  ap. 273-283.  aIncludes references  aSaw-type lint cleaners are considered the most efficient and aggressive cleaners in the ginning industry. To look for a gentler cleaning alternative, a study was conducted over two seasons to evaluate the lint cleaning performance of modified cylinder cleaners. In crop year 2003, six cylinder configurations were made by varying the grid bar shapes, the spacing between grid bars, and a combination of these factors for each cylinder. Results indicated that all cylinder cleaner configurations yielded higher turnouts than the benchmark saw-type lint cleaner and its hybrid (a six cylinder cleaner with a special saw-type lint cleaner connected in series). The best overall cylinder cleaner was composed of 3 cradles of flat, square grid bars with a wide spacing (9.5 mm) between bars followed by another three cradles of flat, square grid bars with a narrow gap (6.4 mm) between bars. The second year of the study concluded that configuration 2004-1 composed of flat, square grid bars with a narrow spacing followed by wide spacing between grid bars (three cradles each) performed the best. This configuration provided the highest expected bale value ($321.5) and turnout (39.3%) with good reflectance (79.72), a low cleaning efficiency (18.0%), and the second lowest level of waste and neps (1.11 kg/bale and 208.1 neps/g for SG105, respectively). The best performer in 2003 ranked second in 2004. 3alint cotton 3acotton ginning 3acleaning 3acleaners 3aequipment performance 3aequipment design 3atextile fibers 3ayields 3afiber quality 3acotton gin trash 0alint cleaning efficiency 0alint turnout0 tJournal of cotton science.g2006, v.  10, no.  4 p.273-283wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.cotton.org/journal/2006-10/4/273.cfm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070813b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/02/05  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01867naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100002300184245014300207300001600350500002400366520047500390650001800865650002100883650001900904650001100923650000900934650001300943650001900956650001700975651001500992700002401007773011501031852000901146856008501155856011201240930003301352945002501385946001101410961001201421655001201433IND4398511020221123035410.0071209e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439851102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-007-9493-y2doi7 a10113/125402hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aB2001 aPadgett, Pamela E.10aWet Deposition of Nitrogenous Pollutants and the Effect of Storm Duration and Wind Direction: A Case Study from Inland Southern California  ap. 337-341.  aIncludes references  aMeteorological factors affecting concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in rain were examined.

Its stalking behavior with whiteflies as prey was similar to that observed with aphids. A previously unobserved behavior was noted that involves the predators using salivary secretions to fasten the wings of prey to various surfaces, allowing labial probing and feeding. Prey consumption as a function of prey number appeared to follow the pattern of the Holling type II functional response. Handling time per prey item ranged from about 180 to 240 seconds. No changes were observed in handling time devoted to earlier versus later catches. Nutritional quality of whiteflies was measured using crude protein, lipids and carbohydrates as criteria. Performance, in terms of predator behavior, total daily handling time, functional response, energy budget and nutritional quality all support the hypothesis that G. punctipes is a promising candidate for biological control of sweet potato whiteflies. 3aBemisia tabaci 3abiological control 3aGeocoris punctipes 3alaboratory techniques 3agreenhouse production 3ahorticultural crops 3apredators 0apredators of insect pests 0agreenhouse crops1 aByrne, D.N.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1992 Aug., v.  64, no.  2 p.195-202x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231643Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001629923Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03079naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001700148245014800165300001600313500002400329500001500353520142300368650001901791650002601810650001401836650002301850650001601873650001701889650001701906650002201923650002301945650003401968650001802002650001302020650001802033653002502051653004502076653001802121653001902139773009702158852000902255856011102264856010202375930003302477945002502510946001302535961001302548655001202561IND4369004820221123005103.0050415s2005    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436900482DNAL7 a10113/17192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aF2001 aGamble, G.R.10aCotton fiber chemical differences and their effect on friction behavior: a comparison of two crop years in the ATMI/ARS leading cultivars study  ap. 335-349.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aA comparison of two crop years from the USDA-ATMI Leading Cultivars Study indicated a substantial increase in processing difficulties in CY 2002 compared with CY 2001, but HVI properties were unable to adequately predict these differences. With the goal of complementing HVI with alternative measurements in order to better predict processing performance, this research attempted to determine whether the observed differences in processing between years are attributable to fiber chemical factors. Chemical and physical measurements were performed on 46 cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) samples with a range in genetic diversities and from different growing locations from two consecutive crop years. Samples from the two crop years exhibited marked differences in moisture and electrolyte content as a result of different environmental conditions subsequent to boll opening and prior to harvest. Infrared spectroscopy was unable to distinguish differences in crystallinity indices within or between the two crop years. Differences in moisture content appear to be related to differences in hygroscopic surface salts and sugars. Micronaire-normalized frictional measurements indicate that fiber friction increases moisture and electrolyte content decreases, indicating that moisture in conjunction with surface salt content affects the surface characteristics of the fiber, possibly through an anti-electrostatic effect. 3avariety trials 3aprocessing technology 3acultivars 3atemporal variation 3alint cotton 3aelectrolytes 3asalt content 3acrystal structure 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aAgricultural Research Service 3awater content 3afriction 3afiber quality 0achemical composition 0aAmerican Textile Manufacturers Institute 0acrystallinity 0afiber friction0 tJournal of cotton science.g2005, v.  9, no.  1 p.335-349wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/17193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.cotton.org/journal/2005-09/1/upload/jcs09-056.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070801b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/04/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03172naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001800140245012600158300001600284500002400300500001500324520147600339650001401815650001201829650004301841650002601884650003201910650001401942650002501956650002701981650002602008650002202034650001902056650002302075650002002098653002702118653001502145653003002160653001402190700001602204700001202220700001202232700001302244773006502257852000902322856011202331856009302443930003302536945002502569946001102594961001302605655001202618IND4361348220221118000602.0040224s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436134822DNAL7 a10113/143862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aSteiger, D.L.10aGenetic relationships of macadamia cultivars and species revealed by AFLP markers.

Johnson, and their hybrids. One hundred and five AFLP markers were used to analyze 26 macadamia accessions representing four species: M. integrifolia, M. tetraphylla, M. ternifolia, and M. hildebrandii as well as a wild relative, Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia (rose nut). Each macadamia accession showed distinct AFLP fingerprints indicating a significant level of genetic variation in this macadamia germplasm collection. The four Macadamia species included in this study were clearly separated using cluster analysis with AFLP marker data. Based on a single accession, the separation of M. ternifolia from M. integrifolia suggested the relatively distant genetic relationship between these two species and casts doubts on the notion that the M. ternifolia may be a variant of M. integrifolia. Within the major cluster of M. integrifolia, nine established smooth shell cultivars were separated into two sub-clusters, suggesting the heterozygous nature of the original gene pool that had contributed to macadamia variety improvement programs. M. hildebrandii and H. pinnatifolia formed a distinct cluster and shared dramatically less genetic similarity with the other Macadamia species. Additional data would be needed to clarify the phylogenetic nature and status of M. hildebrandii in the genus Macadamia. 3acultivars 3ahybrids 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aMacadamia tetraphylla 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aphylogeny 3aMacadamia ternifolia 3aMacadamia integrifolia 3amolecular systematics 3agenetic variation 3amacadamia nuts 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic markers 0aMacadamia hildebrandii 0aProteaceae 0aHicksbeachia pinnatifolia 0aMacadamia1 aMoore, P.H.1 aZee, F.1 aLiu, Z.1 aMing, R.0 tEuphytica.g2003, v.  132, no.  3 p.269-277x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0014-2336/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/02/26  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02779naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100001700175245013800192300001800330500002400348520145900372650000901831650000901840650001101849650002301860650002201883650001201905653003401917700001701951700001401968773009701982852000902079856011202088856008502200930003302285945002502318946001302343961001302356655001202369IND4405831120221116141947.0080519e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440583112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-003-0821-y2doi7 a10113/150672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aMoreau, R.A.10aPressurized Liquid Extraction of Polar and Nonpolar Lipids in Corn and Oats with Hexane, Methylene Chloride, Isopropanol, and Ethanol  ap. 1063-1067.  aIncludes references  aSamples of freshly ground corn kernels and freshly ground rolled oats were extracted via pressurized liquid extraction (accelerated solvent extraction) using four different organic solvents [hexane, methylene chloride (also known as dichloromethane), isopropanol, and ethanol] at two temperatures (40 and 100°C). Lipid yields varied from 2.9 to 5.9 wt% for ground corn and from 5.5 to 6.7 wt% for ground oats. With ground corn, more lipid was extracted as solvent polarity was increased, and for each individual solvent, more lipid was extracted at 100°C than at 40°C. With ground oats, the same temperature effects was observed, but the solvent polarity effect was more complex. For both corn and oats, methylene chloride extracted the highest levels of each of the nonpolar lipid classes. In general, for both corn and oats, icnreasing solvent polarity resulted in increasing yields of polar lipids, and for each solvent, more of each lipid class was extracted at 100°C, than at 40°C. Among the lipids in corn extracts, the phytosterols may be the most valuable, and total phytosterols ranged from about 0.6 wt% in the hot ethanol extracts to about 2.1 wt% in the hot hexane and methylene chloride extracts. Total phytosterols in all oat extracts were about 0.1 wt%. Digalactosyldiacylglycerol was the most abundant polar lipid in the oat extracts; its levels ranged from 1.6 wt% in the cold hexane extracts to 4.3 wt% in the hot ethanol extracts. 3acorn 3aoats 3ahexane 3amethylene chloride 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aethanol 0apressurized liquid extraction1 aPowell, M.J.1 aSingh, V.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2003 Nov., v.  80, no.  11 p.1063-10677nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-003-0821-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/05/23  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02931naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001500157245008100172500010600253500002400359520139300383650002101776650001301797650001801810650002501828650003501853650002101888650002201909650003001931651001401961653002101975653002301996653001602019653005602035700001602091700001602107700001602123773009402139852000902233856011102242930003302353945002502386946001302411961001302424655001202437IND4394500820221116204608.0070828s2005    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND439450082DNAL7 a10113/26862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP210 0aX1001 aNangia, V.10aModeling Nitrate-Nitrogen Losses in Response to Tile Drain Depth and Spacing  aPaper presented at the 2005 ASAE Annual International Meeting, held July 17-20, 2005, Tampa, Florida.  aIncludes references  aThe Agricultural Drainage and Pesticide Transport (ADAPT) model was used to evaluate the effects of tile drain spacing and depth on NO3-N losses in southeastern Minnesota. The model was calibrated and validated using 4 years of monthly flow and nitrate loss data from two tile drained fields (11 and 9.3 ha) in Nicollet County. Half the monitoring data from the 11 ha field were used for calibration and half for validation of the model. The model was also validated using independent monitoring data from the 9.3 ha field. For the calibration period on the 11 ha field, the model predicted mean monthly tile drainage and NO3-N losses of 141.5 m3/day and 5.2 kg/ha, respectively, against measured tile drainage (126.2 m3/day) and NO3-N losses (4.5 kg/ha). For validation, the predicted mean monthly tile drainage and NO3-N losses were 131.7 m3/day and 4.4 kg/ha, respectively, against measured tile drainage and NO3-N losses of 80.4 m3/day and 3.0 kg/ha, respectively. Similar validation results were found with 9.3 ha field. Long-term simulations were made for a wide range of climatic conditions (1954-2003) to evaluate the effects of drain spacing and drain depth on tile drainage and NO3-N losses. Simulations results indicate that increasing spacing and decreasing depth of tile drains reduces the tile drainage and NO3-N losses, and can serve as a remedy to the excess NO3-N losses. 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3atile drainage 3aspatial distribution 3aagricultural management models 3amodel validation 3asimulation models 3anonpoint source pollution 3aMinnesota 0atile drain depth 0atile drain spacing 0aADAPT model 0aAgricultural drainage and Pesticide Transport model1 aGowda, P.H.1 aMulla, D.J.1 aSands, G.R.0 tPaper.g2005, , no.  052022aAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineers.x0149-98907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/26863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/31  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02976naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100001500184245011700199300001800316500002400334500001500358520155800373650001801931650002101949650002801970650002401998650001102022650001402033653002902047653002802076653002402104700001502128773009702143852000902240856011202249856008502361930003302446945002502479946001302504961001302517655001202530IND4405831320221116141912.0080519e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440583132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-003-0814-x2doi7 a10113/150682hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aP1201 aKnothe, G.10aDependence of Oil Stability Index of Fatty Compounds on Their Structure and Concentration and Presence of Metals  ap. 1021-1026.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aDuring storage and use, vegetable oil-derived industrial products such as biodiesel and biodegradable lubricants can be subjected to conditions that promote oxidation of their unsaturated components. The materials arising during oxidation and subsequent degradation can seriously impair the quality and performance of such products. Therefore, oxidative stability is a significant issue facing these vegetable oil-derived products, and enhanced understanding of the influence of various components of vegetable oils and storage parameters is necessary. In this work, the oil stability index (OSI) was used for assessing oxidation of monoalkyl esters of FA by varying several parameters. Neat fatty compounds and prepared mixtures thereof were studied for assessing the influence of compound structure and concentration. Small amounts of more highly unsaturated compounds had a disproportionately strong effect on oxidative stability. The recently developed concept of bis-allylic equivalents correlated more closely than the iodine value with the OSI times of mixtures of fatty esters. The OSI times of free acids were shorter than those of the corresponding alkyl esters. The presence of copper, iron, and nickel also reduced oxidative stability, but their effect was less than the presence of more highly unsaturated fatty compounds. Of these metals, copper had the strongest catalytic effect on OSI time. OSI may be an alternative to long-term storage tests for determining the influence of extraneous materials such as metals on oxidative stability. 3avegetable oil 3afree fatty acids 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3aoxidative stability 3aesters 3abiodiesel 0arenewable energy sources 0afatty acid methyl ester 0aoil stability index1 aDunn, R.O.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2003 Oct., v.  80, no.  10 p.1021-10267nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-003-0814-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/05/23  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04359naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024001900119024002200138024002100160040001800181072000900199072000900208072000900217100001500226245003900241300001800280500002400298500001500322506007600337520174600413506003702159650001202196650000902208650001502217650001102232650001402243650002002257650001702277650000902294650001002303650002802313650002302341650002202364650001702386650002002403650003602423650001402459650001902473650002102492650003502513650002302548650002802571650001802599650002202617650002202639650001302661650002102674650001402695650004102709650002902750650003902779650002302818653001102841653001002852653001802862653001202880700001602892700001102908700001402919700001202933700001602945700001802961700001802979700001302997700002003010700001903030773011403049852000903163856011203172856007703284930003303361945001303394946001303407961001303420655001203433IND2332984420221207144933.0030610e200212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233298442DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.0152482doi7 a124810442pmid7 aPMC15402662pmcid7 a10113/268602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX200 0aF600 0aF2001 aWare, D.H.10aGramene, a tool for grass genomics  ap. 1606-1613.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGramene (http://www.gramene.org) is a comparative genome mapping database for grasses and a community resource for rice (Oryza sativa). It combines a semi-automatically generated database of cereal genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences, genetic maps, map relations, and publications, with a curated database of rice mutants (genes and alleles), molecular markers, and proteins. Gramene curators read and extract detailed information from published sources, summarize that information in a structured format, and establish links to related objects both inside and outside the database, providing seamless connections between independent sources of information. Genetic, physical, and sequence-based maps of rice serve as the fundamental organizing units and provide a common denominator for moving across species and genera within the grass family. Comparative maps of rice, maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and oat (Avena sativa) are anchored by a set of curated correspondences. In addition to sequence-based mappings found in comparative maps and rice genome displays, Gramene makes extensive use of controlled vocabularies to describe specific biological attributes in ways that permit users to query those domains and make comparisons across taxonomic groups. Proteins are annotated for functional significance using gene ontology terms that have been adopted by numerous model species databases. Genetic variants including phenotypes are annotated using plant ontology terms common to all plants and trait ontology terms that are specific to rice. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the search tools available to the plant research community in Gramene.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agrasses 3arice 3afood crops 3abarley 3aphenotype 3aHordeum vulgare 3aOryza sativa 3aoats 3awheat 3aexpressed sequence tags 3achromosome mapping 3aTriticum aestivum 3aAvena sativa 3aSorghum bicolor 3achemical constituents of plants 3adatabases 3aplant proteins 2aAvenaxgenetics. 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenomicsxmethods 2aHordeumxgenetics 2aInternet 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPhenotype 2aPhysical Chromosome Mappingxmethods 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPoaceaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aTriticumxgenetics 0agenome 0agenes 0afodder plants 0aPoaceae1 aJaiswal, P.1 aNi, J.1 aYap, I.V.1 aPan, X.1 aClark, K.Y.1 aTeytelman, L.1 aSchmidt, S.C.1 aZhao, W.1 aChang, Claudia.1 aCartinhour, S.0 tPlant physiology.g2002 Dec., v.  130, no.  4 p.1606-1613aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/268603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0152483Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSC  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03356naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001800140245011900158300001600277500002400293500001500317520174100332650001502073650001602088650001602104650001802120650002202138650001802160650003002178650002002208650002302228650002302251650001902274650002702293650001402320651001702334651001402351651001702365653001302382653001402395653002302409653001502432653003002447653002302477653001902500773007802519852000902597856011202606930003302718945001302751946001302764961001302777655001202790IND2327282920221120191752.0020529e200102  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232728292DNAL7 a10113/246162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aCharlet, L.D.10aBiology and seasonal abundance of parasitoids of the banded sunflower moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in sunflower  ap. 113-121.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aMortality, parasitization, and overwintering development through pupation of the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes Walsingham, larvae and two of its endoparasitoids, Glypta prognatha Dasch and Chelonus phaloniae Mason, were followed over a 2-year period (1987 to 1989). Development of parasitoids in the field was determined for each species by examination of moth eggs and larvae during the 1989 season. Parasitoids of C. hospes, recovered from cultivated sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., from North and South Dakota and Minnesota in 1994 and 1995, parasitized 24 and 17% of larvae, respectively. Species of Hymenoptera collected included G. prognatha and Trathala sp. (Ichneumonidae), C. phaloniae and Macrocentrus ancylivorus Rohwer (Braconidae), and Perilampus robertsoni Crawford (Pteromalidae). The most abundant parasitoid was G. prognatha. In 1994 and 1995, C. phaloniae, an egg-larval parasitoid, emerged earlier but was less abundant than the later occurring larval parasitoid G. prognatha. Species of parasitoids collected from cultivated sunflower and five species of native sunflowers were similar. An additional parasitoid, Mastrus sp. (Ichneumonidae), was recovered only from the native sunflowers H. annuus and H. tuberosus L. Results from 1994 and 1995 showed that parasitization rates for the total season by the two most abundant parasitoids were similar in fields using three planting dates. These results suggest that altering planting date could be successfully used as a pest management strategy without disrupting the biological control of the banded sunflower moth. Conservation of these parasitoids in the sunflower agroecosystem is needed since they play an important role in the management of C. hospes. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aHymenoptera 3aoverwintering 3aHelianthus annuus 3aplanting date 3abiological control agents 3aCochylis hospes 3aseasonal variation 3apopulation density 3awild relatives 3abiological development 3amortality 3aNorth Dakota 3aMinnesota 3aSouth Dakota 0aCochylis 0aparasites 0aseasonal abundance 0aHelianthus 0aparasites of insect pests 0achelonus phaloniae 0aypta prognatha0 tBiological control.g2001 Feb., v.  20, no.  2 p.113-121x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090223b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03207naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152100001600170245009400186300001600280500002400296500001500320520185300335650001802188650001902206650002302225650001502248650001902263650001902282650002002301653002302321653002602344700001402370700001702384773009002401852000902491856011202500856008902612930003302701945001302734946001302747961001302760655001202773IND2058987520221120143531.0970815e199709  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205898752DNAL7 a10.1016/S0034-4257(97)00045-X2doi7 a10113/110292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran, M.S.10aOpportunities and limitations for image-based remote sensing in precision crop management  ap. 319-346.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThis review addresses the potential of image-based remote sensing to provide spatially and temporally distributed information for precision crop management (PCM). PCM is an agricultural management system designed to target crop and soil inputs according to within, field requirements to optimize profitability and protect the environment. Progress in. PCM has been hampered by a lack of timely, distributed information on crop and soil conditions. Based on a review of the information requirements of PCM, eight areas were identified in which image-based remote sensing technology could provide information that is currently lacking or inadequate. Recommendations were made for applications with potential for near-term implementation with available remote sensing technology and instrumentation. We found that both aircraft- and satellite-based remote sensing could provide valuable information for PCM applications. Images from aircraft-based sensors have a unique role for monitoring seasonally variable crop/soil conditions and for time specific and time-critical crop management; current satellitebased sensors have limited, but important, applications; and upcoming commercial Earth observation satellites may provide the resolution, timeliness, and high quality required for many PCM operations. The current limitations for image-based remote sensing applications are mainly due to sensor attributes, such as restricted spectral range, coarse spatial resolution, slow turnaround time, and inadequate repeat coverage. According to experts in PCM, the potential market for remote sensing products in PCM is good. Future work should be focused on assimilating remotely sensed information into existing decision support systems (DSS), and conducting economic and technical analysis of remote sensing applications with season-long pilot projects. 3ayield mapping 3aimage analysis 3asoil heterogeneity 3acrop yield 3asoil fertility 3aremote sensing 3acrop management 0aliterature reviews 0aprecision agriculture1 aInoue, Y.1 aBarnes, E.M.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g1997 Sept., v.  61, no.  3 p.319-346x0034-42577nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0034-4257(97)00045-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdTW1  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03164naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002000117040001800137072001700155072001700172100001900189245008000208300001600288500002400304500002300328500001500351520142200366650002601788650002401814650001201838650002101850650002601871650001801897650002201915650002201937650001001959651001101969653002201980653001802002653001402020653001502034653002202049653001502071653002402086653001802110653002302128653001902151700001602170773011202186852000902298856007502307856011102382930003302493945002502526946001102551961001202562655001202574IND4369710220221119080154.0050509e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436971022DNAL7 a10.1139/x04-1652doi7 a10113/12322hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We used indirect gradient analysis to characterize gradients in plant species composition and cluster analysis to characterize groups of plant species associated with specific geomorphic areas. We sampled vegetation within 63 randomly selected zero-order basins in the southern Coast Range of Oregon and collected data on herb, shrub, and overstory tree cover, as well as environmental conditions. Zero-order basin overstories were similar in tree composition to both first-order riparian and upland plant assemblages, but were intermediate in tree density. Shrubs in zero-order basins included both species associated with dry upland conditions and species associated with riparian conditions. Results suggest that understory plant species composition in zero-order basins follows gradients in geomorphic and overstory conditions. Furthermore, it appears that zero-order basins have distinctive geomorphology and fluvial regimes. These distinctive features appear to support both plant species associated with riparian conditions and species associated with upland conditions. Zero-order basins represent the farthest upstream extension of riparian plant species into upland areas, increasing plant species diversity in steep, forested landscapes. 3abotanical composition 3aforested watersheds 3avalleys 3avegetation cover 3aenvironmental factors 3astand density 3aforest ecosystems 3astand composition 3ahills 3aOregon 0aplant communities 0ageomorphology 0alandforms 0awatersheds 0aspecies diversity 0ahillslopes 0aheadwater drainages 0aplant ecology 0aOregon Coast Range 0aforest ecology1 aSpies, T.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2005 Feb., v.  35, no.  2 p.340-355wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x04-1653Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/12323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03470naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092024002100132040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100002400198245008600222300001600308500002400324500001500348520137300363650002001736650002401756650001601780650001401796650002101810650001901831650001801850650001701868650002601885650001601911650002001927650002701947650001601974650001801990650001602008650001702024650002002041650001402061650001102075650001702086650001802103650002002121650001102141650001502152650001002167650001702177650001002194650002102204650001202225653001802237653002002255653002702275700001702302700001702319773009502336852000902431856011202440856009002552930003302642945002502675946001102700961001302711655001202724IND4426071020221120035153.0090918e20100201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442607102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.05.0442doi7 a10113/357862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ504 0aQ1141 aMohamed, Abdellatif10aYeast leavened banana-bread: Formulation, processing, colour and texture analysis  ap. 620-626.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aBanana powder (BP) was added to hard-red spring wheat (HRSW) flour intended for yeast-leavened bread formulation. Five different formulations containing 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% BP were prepared with varying amounts of base flour, while vital gluten was maintained at 25% in all blends. Based on the added BP amounts only, the prepared bread could deliver 42.87-128.6mg potassium/30g of bread (one regular slice) and 0.33-1.00g of fibre. Although the dough water absorption was increased, due to BP addition, the dough mixing tolerance (MTI) decreased. The bread loaf volume was significantly higher than the control except for the 30% blend, where the loaf volume was similar to the control. Bread staling increased with BP levels due to the high sugar content but, this effect was limited to the first two days of storage. Blends exhibited darker colour due to the high sugar and protein, while the 25% and 30% blends had the lowest percent of freezable water. The amounts of acetic acid extractable proteins from the dry blends and the dough decreased with increase in BP. The linear rheological properties of the control, 10%, and 30% blends exhibited similar viscoelastic solid behaviour, where both G' and G'' had plateaus (G'> G'') and they were parallel to each other over three decades of the frequency. Blends showed higher moduli values than the control. 3aviscoelasticity 3abreadmaking quality 3awheat flour 3afreshness 3afood composition 3apowdered foods 3afiber content 3afood storage 3ahard red spring wheat 3aingredients 3amineral content 3achemical concentration 3abread dough 3adietary fiber 3abreadmaking 3astorage time 3astorage quality 3apotassium 3aflavor 3awheat gluten 3asugar content 3aprotein content 3avolume 3aabsorption 3awater 3ayeast breads 3acolor 3adietary minerals 3abananas 0abanana powder 0afreezable water 0arheological properties1 aXu, Jingyuan1 aSingh, Mukti0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Feb. 1, v.  118, no.  3 p.620-626dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/357863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.05.0443Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/11/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03565naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002000127040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100001600192245006100208300001600269500002400285500001500309520204700324650001402371650001902385650001902404650001102423650001002434650002202444650001902466650001702485650001902502650001702521650001502538651001402553653001702567653001802584700001602602700001602618700001902634773008102653852000902734856011102743856008502854930003302939945002502972946001302997961001303010655001203023IND4397810320221120213730.0071113e20050430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439781032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2005.01.0122doi7 a10113/67802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aX200 0aW0001 aThoma, D.P.10aAirborne laser scanning for riverbank erosion assessment  ap. 493-501.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWorldwide, rivers and streams are negatively impacted by sedimentation. However, there are few broad scale techniques for quantifying the sources of sediment, i.e. upland vs. river bank erosion. This research was designed to evaluate the use of airborne LIDAR for characterizing sediment and phosphorus contributions from river bank erosion. The evaluation was done on the main stem of the Blue Earth River in southern Minnesota. Detailed topographic data were collected on an annual basis in April 2001 and 2002 over a 56 km length of the river with a helicopter mounted Topeye laser system. The raw database included X, Y, Z coordinates of laser returns sampled from the river valley with a density of 1-3.3 elevations per m2. Uniform 1 m bare earth digital elevation models were constructed by stripping vegetation laser returns and interpolation. The two models were differenced to determine volume change over time, which was then converted to mass wasting by multiplying volume change with bulk density. Mass wasting rates were further converted to sediment load based on percentage of transportable material in the bank strata. The average difference between LIDAR measured elevations and RTK GPS surveyed elevations on 5 highway bridge surfaces was 2.5 and 8.8 cm for the 2001 and 2002 scans, respectively. The elevation errors were quasi-normally distributed with standard deviation of 6.7 and 6.1 cm for 2001 and 2002, respectively. No elevation or planimetric corrections were made to the laser data before calculating mass wasting rates because it was not possible to determine the source of error or if it was uniform within and between scans. The mass wasting estimate from the LIDAR surveys varied from 23% to 56% of the sediment mass transported past the downstream gauging station depending on the range of textural material that was entrained once in the river. These estimates are in the range of values reported in the literature. Total P contribution due to bank erosion from the river reach was estimated to be 201 t/yr. 3asediments 3asediment yield 3aimage analysis 3arivers 3alidar 3acomputer analysis 3apollution load 3aspatial data 3aremote sensing 3abank erosion 3aphosphorus 3aMinnesota 0asoil erosion 0awater erosion1 aGupta, S.C.1 aBauer, M.E.1 aKirchoff, C.D.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2005 Apr. 30, v.  95, no.  4 p.493-5017nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2005.01.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20071116b20071210c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/16  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03750naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182100002200191245018000213300001600393500002400409500001500433520167800448650002402126650002602150650001202176650002102188650002302209650002802232650001402260650001602274650001502290650001202305650001302317650001402330650002202344650001602366650003002382650002602412650002302438653003202461653003002493653001202523653001602535700001802551700001902569700001902588700001902607700001902626700001802645700001902663700001902682773007802701852000902779856011202788856009202900930003302992945002503025946001303050961001303063655001203076IND4425963620221120144152.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442596362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2009.06.0042doi7 a10113/357872hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aF9001 aArmstrong, Donald10aGermination-Arrest Factor (GAF): 3. Determination that the herbicidal activity of GAF is associated with a ninhydrin-reactive compound and counteracted by selected amino acids  ap. 181-190.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA novel, naturally-occurring herbicide (Germination-Arrest Factor, GAF), produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6 and several related isolates of rhizosphere bacteria, irreversibly arrests germination of the seeds of a wide range of graminaceous species, including a number of important grassy weed species. GAF activity has been shown previously to be associated with a hydrophilic, low molecular weight compound that contains an acid group. In the present study, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of extracts of WH6 culture filtrate demonstrated that GAF activity migrates on TLC plates with a particular ninhydrin-reactive compound. This compound was found to be present in GAF-producing P. fluorescens isolates and absent in P. fluorescens strains that lack the ability to produce GAF. Treatments, including mutagenesis, which resulted in the loss of GAF activity in culture filtrates from P. fluorescens WH6 were shown to result in the disappearance of this ninhydrin-reactive compound from extracts of WH6 culture filtrates or in alteration of its appearance on TLC chromatograms. The ninhydrin-reactivity of GAF indicates that it probably contains an amino group, as well as the acid group previously demonstrated, and suggests that GAF may be a small peptide or amino acid analog. Biological investigations motivated by this conclusion demonstrated that the effects of GAF in inhibiting the germination of seeds of annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) could be counteracted by treatment with alanine or glutamine and, to lesser extent, by several other amino acids, suggesting that this compound may act by interfering with some aspect of amino acid metabolism or function. 3amechanism of action 3aherbicidal properties 3agrasses 3aseed germination 3achemical compounds 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aglutamine 3amutagenesis 3aherbicides 3aalanine 3apeptides 3aPoa annua 3aculture filtrates 3agrass weeds 3athin layer chromatography 3aamino acid metabolism 3achemical structure 0aninhydrin-reactive compound 0agermination arrest factor 0aPoaceae 0aamino acids1 aAzevedo, Mark1 aMills, Dallice1 aBailey, Bonnie1 aRussell, Brian1 aGroenig, Aleta1 aHalgren, Anne1 aBanowetz, Gary1 aMcPhail, Kerry0 tBiological control.g2009 Oct., v.  51, no.  1 p.181-190x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/357873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2009.06.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04077naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001300148245012600161300001800287500002400305500001500329520241100344650002102755650002102776650001702797650002102814650001402835650002102849650002002870650001502890650002002905650001002925650001302935650001802948650002402966650002302990650001803013650001203031653001503043653001003058700001603068700001703084700001603101700001603117700001803133700001703151700001603168773008703184852000903271856011103280930003303391945002503424946001303449961001303462655001203475IND4372482520221120052027.0050720e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437248252DNAL7 a10113/78952hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL831 0aL8101 aPiva, A.10aActivated carbon does not prevent the toxicity of culture material containing fumonisin B₁ when fed to weanling piglets  ap. 1939-1947.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFumonisins are mycotoxins found primarily in corn and corn products that are produced by Fusarium verticillioides, F. proliferatum, and several other Fusarium species. The toxicity of fumonisin B₁ (FB) from culture material with and without activated carbon was evaluated using weanling piglets. Fifty-six weanling pigs were assigned to one of four treatments diets based on BW. The treatment diets were 1) control = corn-soybean basal diet with <2 ppm FB; 2) AC = control + activated carbon at 1% of the diet, as fed; 3) FB = control + culture material (formulated to contain 30 ppm FB, as-fed basis); and 4) AC + FB = control + activated carbon at 1% of the diet as fed + culture material (formulated to contain 30 ppm FB). A total of four replicates of four pigs per pen for the control and AC treatments and three piglets per pen for the FB and AC + FB treatments were used. Feed and water were offered ad libitum for the duration of the 42-d experiment. Compared with pigs fed the control or AC diets, pigs receiving the two FB-contaminated diets (FB or AC + FB) had lower G:F (P < 0.01), higher serum enzyme activities of [gamma]-glutamyltransferase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (P < 0.05), and higher concentrations of cholesterol, free sphinganine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and sphinganine 1-phosphate (P < 0.05). Although animals consuming FB diets showed no signs of respiratory distress, all pigs consuming either the FB or the AC + FB diets had marked pulmonary edema. Lesions were observed in the lungs, heart, and liver of pigs fed the FB or AC + FB diets, and treatment-associated changes also were seen in the pancreas, intestines, spleen, and lymph nodes. No lesions were observed in the brain. In liver, lung, heart, pancreas, spleen, intestines, and lymph nodes, the histopathological effects observed were more severe in the AC + FB group, suggesting that the AC treatment worsened the toxic effects of FB. Additionally, immunological measurements of macrophage function (CD14) were affected (P < 0.05) by the consumption of the FB diets. The consumption of FB diets containing 30 ppm fumonisin B₁ from cultured material significantly affected performance, biochemical measurements, and organ pathology in weanling pigs. The addition of activated carbon at the rate of 1% to the diet was not effective in protecting against the detrimental effects of fumonisin consumption. 3aanimal pathology 3aactivated carbon 3afumonisin B1 3alesions (animal) 3aweanlings 3aimmunocompetence 3ablood chemistry 3aabsorption 3adisease control 3aedema 3atoxicity 3atissue weight 3adietary supplements 3aanimal performance 3aculture media 3apiglets 0amycotoxins 0aswine1 aCasadei, G.1 aPagliuca, G.1 aCabassi, E.1 aGalvano, F.1 aSolfrizzo, M.1 aRiley, R.

Application of biopesticides and fertilizer concentration significantly influenced the severity of infection, but there was no significant effect from the interaction of these two factors. Overall, disease severity showed a tendency to increase with the concentration of applied fertilizer. Compared with the control plants, disease was significantly less severe in plants that were treated with the biopesticides, except for plants treated with metabolites of Myrothecium verrucaria (DiTera). However, only the products containing potassium phosphonates and potassium phosphates (FNX-100 and FNX-2500) provided a satisfactory level of control when compared with either the control plants or those that received any of the other products tested. Additional experiments were carried out in growth chambers to test the effects of increasing fertilizer concentrations in plants that were inoculated with different P. nicotianae inoculum levels. In these trials, there was no consistent indication that disease is most severe in plants that received the highest fertilizer concentration even at the highest inoculum level. 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aornamental plants 3anursery crops 3aPhytophthora nicotianae 3afungal diseases of plants 3afertilizer rates 3abiopesticides 3adisease control 3anutrient availability 3adisease severity 3ainoculum density 3aantifungal properties 0abiofungicides1 aRosskopf, E.N.1 aShah, D.A.1 aAlbano, J.P.0 tPlant disease.g2007 Nov., v.  91, no.  11 p.1477-1483x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-91-11-14773Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02855naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112100001500130245009200145300001600237500002400253520137700277650001701654650001101671650001901682650002501701650002301726650001501749650000901764650001901773650002101792651001001813653002301823653001501846653001101861653002401872653003301896700001501929700002001944700001601964773011101980852000902091856011102100856007802211930003302289945001302322946001302335961001302348655001202361IND2204165220221118221658.0000428e199904  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220416522DNAL7 a10113/61522hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBent, G.C.10aRunoff and erosion response of simulated waste burial covers in a semi-arid environment  ap. 441-455.  aIncludes references  aControl of runoff (reducing infiltration) and erosion at shallow land burials is necessary in order to assure environmentally safe disposal of low-level radioactive-waste and other waste products.

Total runoff and soil loss from natural rainfall and snowmelt events during 1987 were 25 and 105 percent greater, respectively, on streambank wheatgrass plots than on crested wheatgrass plots. Thus, crested wheatgrassappears to be better suited in revegetation of waste burial covers at INEEL than streambank wheatgrass due to its much lower erosion rate and only slightly higher infiltration rate (lower runoff rate). 3asoil erosion 3arunoff 3awaste disposal 3aAgropyron desertorum 3aElymus lanceolatus 3asoil water 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3aland restoration 3aIdaho 0aradioactive wastes 0asimulation 0acovers 0ashallow land burial 0alow level radioactive wastes1 aGoff, B.F.1 aRightmire, K.G.1 aSidle, R.C.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g1999 Apr., v.  35, no.  2 p.441-455x1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/61523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071102b20071210c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04102naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100001600193245017900209300001600388500002400404500001500428520217200443650002502615650002302640650002902663650001202692650001402704650001302718650002502731650002602756650002302782650001702805650002502822650002202847650001202869650001202881650001102893651001102904653002802915653001802943653002602961653002102987700003403008700001803042700001703060700001903077700001703096773006403113852000903177856008503186856011203271930003303383945002503416946001103441961001203452655001203464IND4378045620221122091323.0060223e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437804562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-004-0391-22doi7 a10113/375162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF300 0aK0011 aBucci, S.J.10aMechanisms contributing to seasonal homeostasis of minimum leaf water potential and predawn disequilibrium between soil and plant water potential in Neotropical savanna trees  ap. 296-304.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSeasonal regulation of leaf water potential (psi L) was studied in eight dominant woody savanna species growing in Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) sites that experience a 5-month dry season. Despite marked seasonal variation in precipitation and air saturation deficit (D), seasonal differences in midday minimum psi L were small in all of the study species. Water use and water status were regulated by a combination of plant physiological and architectural traits. Despite a nearly 3-fold increase in mean D between the wet and dry season, a sharp decline in stomatal conductance with increasing D constrained seasonal variation in minimum psi L by limiting transpiration per unit leaf area (E). The leaf surface area per unit of sapwood area (LA/SA), a plant architectural index of potential constraints on water supply in relation to transpirational demand, was about 1.5-8 times greater in the wet season compared to the dry season for most of the species. The changes in LA/SA from the wet to the dry season resulted from a reduction in total leaf surface area per plant, which maintained or increased total leaf-specific hydraulic conductance (Gt) during the dry season. The isohydric behavior of Cerrado tree species with respect to minimum psi L throughout the year thus was the result of strong stomatal control of evaporative losses, a decrease in total leaf surface area per tree during the dry season, an increase in total leaf-specific hydraulic conductance, and a tight coordination between gas and liquid phase conductance. In contrast with the seasonal isohydric behavior of minimum psi L, predawn psi L in all species was substantially lower during the dry season compared to the wet season. During the dry season, predawn psi L was more negative than bulk soil psi estimated by extrapolating plots of E versus psi L to E=0. Predawn disequilibrium between plant and soil psi was attributable largely to nocturnal transpiration, which ranged from 15 to 22% of the daily total. High nocturnal water loss may also have prevented internal water storage compartments from being completely refilled at night before the onset of transpiration early in the day. 3astomatal conductance 3aplant architecture 3aphysiological regulation 3atropics 3aleaf area 3asap flow 3aleaf water potential 3aenvironmental factors 3aseasonal variation 3awoody plants 3asoil water potential 3adiurnal variation 3asapwood 3acerrado 3aleaves 3aBrazil 0anocturnal transpiration 0atranspiration 0aplant-water relations 0aplant physiology1 aGoldstein, G.q(Gary),d1952-1 aMeinzer, F.C.1 aFranco, A.C.1 aCampanello, P.1 aScholz, F.G.0 tTrees.g2005 May, v.  19, no.  3 p.296-304x0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-004-0391-23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/375163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100117b20100205c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/07/10  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle01748naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001900149245009800168300001600266500002000282500001500302520052100317650001200838650001300850650001600863650001300879650004300892650001500935650001400950650001300964650001500977650001400992653001601006773008901022852000901111856011201120930003301232945002501265946001101290961001301301655001201314IND8203154220221120044611.0820416e19820115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND820315422DNAL7 a10113/261342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aF6001 aEldridge, A.C.10aHigh-performance liquid chromatography separation of soybean isoflavones and their glucosides  ap. 494-496.  aIncludes 9 ref.  a2019-12-05  aA procedure for separation of naturally occurring isoflavone glucosides and isoflavone aglycones from soybean with reduced risk of catalytic decomposition is described using HPLC with mild solvents and reversed phase packing.

The effect of sprinkling water on the incidence of zoonotic pathogens has not been previously studied. Four pens of heifers (n = 41) were cooled using sprinklers, and four pens (n = 43) served as controls. Heifers were crossbred Charolais, with white and red hair coats. Sprinkling was initiated when cattle were on full concentrate feed (July). Fecal samples, hide swipes, and BW were collected on d 0, 28, 63, 95, and 98. Average daily gain, DMI, and G:F were calculated, and carcass traits were collected 36 h after processing. Performance data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design, and zoonotic pathogen data were analyzed using [chi]² analysis. Sprinkling tended (P = 0.054) to increase the incidence of fecal Salmonella spp. populations on d 98, but simultaneously tended to decrease (P = 0.058) the Escherichia coli O157:H7 incidence on hides on d 98. The most prevalent Salmonella serovars in this study were Kentucky, Muenster, Meleagridis, and Cerro. Performance measures and carcass traits did not differ between treatments (P > 0.10). Under our conditions, sprinkling cattle with water did not affect the incidence of zoonotic pathogens in feces or on hides. 3aheifers 3acarcass characteristics 3azoonoses 3asprinklers 3aSalmonella 3abody weight 3afeedlots 3afeed conversion 3aserotypes 3abeef cattle 3afeces 3aliveweight gain 3awater 3afeed intake 3aEscherichia coli O157 3ahuman food chain 3adisease incidence 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aEscherichia coli O157xclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFood Contamination 2aHeat Stress Disordersxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aHousing, Animal 2aIncidence 2aSalmonellaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aSeasons 2aSerotyping 2aSkinxmicrobiology 2aTemperature 2aWater 2aZoonoses 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aMitloehner, F.

King was inducted into the ARS Science Hall of Fame, 2007.  a2019-12-05  aAlthough immunity is impaired during severe zinc deficiency, there is limited information about the effects of mild zinc depletion on immune response in humans. We evaluated the effects of a zinc-restricted diet (4.6 mg/d) on several indices of immunity in 8 healthy men. The subjects consumed zinc supplements with 9.1 mg/d during the 5-wk baseline (BL) and 5-wk repletion (RP) periods, and placebos during the 10-wk zinc-restriction (ZR) period. Leukocyte numbers and functions were studied at the end of each metabolic period. After ZR, there were reductions in the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 1.2, 2.5, 5.0, and 20.0 mg/L; P < 0.01) and in the in vitro secretion of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) (PHA, 2.5 mg/L; P = 0.058). These variables remained reduced (P < 0.05) even after 5 wk of zinc repletion. The amount of zinc consumed did not alter the numbers of circulating neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, the in vitro PBMNC secretion of interferon- and tumor necrosis factor- or neutrophil superoxide production. The results suggest that changes in lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2R expression may be early markers of mild zinc deficiency. 3anutrient intake 3amen 3azinc 3amonocytes 3anutrient deficiencies 3aneutrophils 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3areceptors 3alymphocyte proliferation 3adietary mineral supplements 2aAdult 2aCell Division 2aCytokinesxmetabolism 2aDeficiency Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aHumans 2aImmune Systemxphysiopathology 2aLeukocyte Count 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMonocytesxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNeutrophilsxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Interleukin-2xmetabolism 2aReference Values 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 2aZincxdeficiency 0aimmunity 0ainterleukin-2 receptor 0aleukocytes 0amononuclear leukocytes1 aKelley, D.S.1 aTaylor, P.C.1 aKing, J.C.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 July, v.  132, no.  7 p.2033-2036x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/29053Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20130508b20130607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01774naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162100001800171245013300189300001600322500002500338500001500363520054700378650002200925650002300947650001500970653002000985653001201005700001601017773010601033852000901139856008101148856011201229930003301341946001301374961001301387655001201400IND8802655020221122001805.0880714e198807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880265502DNAL7 a10.1093/aesa/81.4.6422doi7 a10113/231532hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aGlancey, B.M.10aEffect of the insect growth regulator fenoxycarb on the ovaries of queens of the red imported fire ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)  ap. 642-648.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-04  aThe insect growth regulator, fenoxycarb, ethyl [2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethyl] carbamate, causes retrogression of the ovaries of mated queens of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren. Fenoxycarb completely suppresses growth of the follicular epithelium, nurse cells, and cytoplasm/yolkplasm. Most developing eggs are resorbed and no new workers are produced. Thus, prolonged exposure of the queen to the compound causes death of the entire colony. The ovaries return to normal if the  queen is removed from exposure to the chemical. 3agrowth regulators 3aSolenopsis invicta 3acarbamates 0agenetic control 0aovaries1 aBanks, W.A.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g1988 July, v.  81, no.  4 p.642-648x0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/81.4.6423Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01759naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002000140245009800160300001600258500002400274520072400298650001801022650001201040650001601052653003201068700001701100700001901117773008001136852000901216856011201225930003301337945001301370946001301383961001301396655001201409IND2040955520221118040144.0940721e199401  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204095552DNAL7 a10113/341922hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aKandala, C.V.K.10aNondestructive moisture determination in small samples of popcorn by RF impedance measurement  ap. 191-194.  aIncludes references  aAn empirical equation was developed earlier for predicting the moisture contents of single kernels of popcorn from radio-frequency (RF) measurements.

The amount of reproduction by two important cotton pathogens, Meloidogyne incognita and Rotylenchulus reniformis, on common weeds in the major crops in the Southeast was not known. This study documented the total reproduction and reproduction relative to cotton by these two nematodes on common southeastern weeds. Final egg counts of M. incognita on the plants tested ranged from 0 to 193% of the number on cotton in one trial and from 0 to 407% in a second trial. Final egg counts of R. reniformis ranged from 0 to 105% in one trial and from 0 to 454% in a second trial. For M. incognita, only prickly sida was consistently a better host than cotton, although ivyleaf morningglory was a better host in one trial. Smallflower morningglory was a moderate host, whereas yellow and purple nutsedge, pigweed, Florida beggarweed, sicklepod, common cocklebur, cutleaf eveningprimrose, and Florida pusley were poor or non-hosts relative to cotton. For R. reniformis, only Florida beggarweed was a consistently good host, although purple nutsedge and sicklepod were good hosts in one trial, and smallflower morningglory was a moderate host in both trials. Pigweed, prickly sida, Florida pusley, cutleaf eveningprimrose, yellow nutsedge, and common cocklebur were poor or non-hosts for R. reniformis. Most of the weeds tested would not maintain high population levels of M. incognita or R. reniformis when non-host or nematode-resistant crops were grown. 3acotton 3areproduction 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aweed hosts 3apopulation density 3ahost preferences 3aRotylenchulus reniformis 3acrops 0anonhosts 0ahost plants1 aWebster, T.M.0 tJournal of cotton science.g2005, v.  9, no.  1 p.291-295wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/17183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.cotton.org/journal/2005-09/1/upload/jcs09-041.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070801b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/04/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04473naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002600177245012900203300001600332500002400348500001500372520209200387650002502479650001802504650002602522650002402548650002502572650002302597650001902620650002502639650002502664650002802689650001902717650006302736650003702799650002702836650003702863650005202900650001702952650003102969650001303000650001403013650002903027650003803056650003003094650003303124650003503157650004603192650002403238650001803262653002803280653002603308653002403334700001803358700001603376700001503392700001603407700001603423773007303439852000903512856011203521930003303633945002503666946001103691961001303702655001203715IND4366231820221122230148.0041227e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436623182DNAL7 a155463492pmid7 a10113/204112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF833 0aF600 0aF2001 aChandra-Shekara, A.C.10aSignaling requirements and role of salicylic acid in HRT- and rrt-mediated resistance to turnip crinkle virus in Arabidopsis  ap. 647-659.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aInoculation of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) on the resistant Arabidopsis ecotype Di-17 elicits a hypersensitive response (HR), which is accompanied by increased expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Previous genetic analyses revealed that the HR to TCV is conferred by HRT, which encodes a coiled-coil (CC), nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class resistance (R) protein. In contrast to the HR, resistance to TCV requires both HRT and a recessive allele at a second locus designated rrt. Here, we demonstrate that unlike most CC-NBS-LRR R genes, HRT/rrt-mediated resistance is dependent on EDS1 and independent of NDR1. Resistance is also independent of RAR1 and SGT1. HRT/rrt-mediated resistance is compromised in plants with reduced salicylic acid (SA) content as a consequence of mutations eds5, pad4, or sid2. By contrast, HR is not affected by mutations in eds1, eds5, pad4, sid2, ndr1, rar1, or sgt1b. Resistance to TCV is restored in both SA-deficient Di-17 plants expressing the nahG transgene and mutants containing the eds1, eds5, or sid2 mutations by exogenous application of SA or the SA analog benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid (BTH). In contrast, SA/BTH treatment failed to enhance resistance in HRT pad4, Col-0, or hrt homozygous progeny of a cross between Di-17 and Col-0. Thus, HRT and PAD4 are required for SA-induced resistance. Exogenously supplied SA or high endogenous levels of SA, due to the ssi2 mutation, overcame the suppressive effects of RRT and enhanced resistance to TCV, provided the HRT allele was present. High levels of SA upregulate HRT expression via a PAD4-dependent pathway. As Col-0 transgenic lines expressing high levels of HRT were resistant to TCV, but lines expressing moderate to low levels of HRT were not, we conclude that SA enhances resistance in the RRT background by upregulating HRT expression. These data suggest that the HRT-TCV interaction is unable to generate sufficient amounts of SA required for a stable resistance phenotype, and the presence of rrt possibly corrects this deficiency. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant viruses 3atranscription factors 3asignal transduction 3aTurnip crinkle virus 3adisease resistance 3asalicylic acid 3aDNA-binding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3ahypersensitive response 3aplant proteins 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxphysiology 2aCell Deathxphysiology 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plant 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxvirology. 2aPlant Virusesxphysiology 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRepressor Proteinsxphysiology 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSignal Transduction 2aUp-Regulation 0amolecular sequence data 0aresistance mechanisms 0aleucine-rich repeat1 aNavarre, D.R.1 aKachroo, A.1 aKang, H.G.1 aKlessig, D.1 aKachroo, P.0 tPlant journal.g2004 Dec., v.  40, no.  5 p.647-659x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/204113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081014b20081101c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/01/05  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02310naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111024002100139040001800160072000900178072000900187100002200196245010400218300001800322500002500340500001500365520092100380650001401301650002301315650001701338650002201355650002201377653001601399653001201415653003001427653001201457700001901469700001701488773008901505852000901594856011201603856007801715930003301793946001301826961001301839655001201852IND8905792420221120092747.0891025e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890579242DNAL7 a242723842pmid7 a10.1007/BF010141132doi7 a10113/231582hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL0011 aVander Meer, R.K.10aChemical mimicry in a parasitoid (Hymenoptera: Eucharitidae) of fire ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)  ap. 2247-2261.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-04  aA wasp (Orasema sp.) parasitic on the fire ant,Solenopsis invicta Buren, develops to the adult stage within the ant colony, where wasp larvae are ectoparasitic on ant pupae. This phase of the parasite's life cycle requires a mechanism of integration into the host colony. Gas Chromatographic profiles of hexane soaks of various stages of the parasite and host suggest that during development within the ant colony the parasite acquires the colony odor of the host through a passive mechanism, based on simple contact and other social interactions. No parasite-specific components were observed. After leaving the host nest as adults, the parasite biosynthesizes a parasite-specific cuticular compound, while retaining residual amounts of the host acquired components. This complicated scenario is consistent with current knowledge of nestmate recognition and the preferential treatment of ant workers to their brood. 3aparasites 3aSolenopsis invicta 3ahydrocarbons 3achemical analysis 3aspectral analysis 0aHymenoptera 0aorasema 0aparasites of insect pests 0amimicry1 aJouvenaz, D.P.1 aWojcik, D.P.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1989 Aug., v.  15, no.  8 p.2247-2261x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF010141133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02820naa a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097024002100114040001800135072000900153100002200162245013100184300001800315500001200333520101300345650000901358650002301367650000901390650002001399650001201419650002101431650000901452650002901461650002001490650002201510650001001532650002601542650003501568650003001603650001101633650002001644650001101664650004001675650000901715650002101724650001201745650002901757651001401786651001401800653001801814653001901832700002101851700001801872700002401890773008401914852000901998856011202007930003302119945000802152946001302160961000902173655001202182991596094170742620221121055325.0800814e197909  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800018322DNAL7 a1135122pmid7 a10113/449512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aSolomons, Noel W.10aStudies on the bioavailability of zinc in man.

The mean fasting zinc levels of the rural Guatemalan population are low. Subjects (many were Americans or Europeans) were given a standard rural meal of Guatemala--120 g corn tortillas, 250 g of coffee sweetened with 15 g of sugar, 40 g sweet rolls, 120 g black bean gruel. Four hours after the meal plasma zinc level was significantly lower than the fasting zinc level. Adding 25 mg of zinc to the bean gruel prevented the decline, but did not raise plasma zinc above fasting level. Fortifying sugar with the iron-fortifying agent, NaFeEDTA, apparently would not influence further the bioavailability of dietary zinc. The basic rural diet of Guatemala probably impairs zinc nutriture, with the major factors being phytates, dietary fiber and calcium and a minor factor being coffee.

One of the limiting factors is nipple waterer flow rate. Research demonstrated a constant water flow rate of 25 mL/min impeded BW by approximately 156 g (0.34 lb) at 6 wk of age compared with those having 75 mL/min through the grow out. A device to measure nipple flow rates was developed from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, pipefittings, aluminum screen, and a centrifuge tube. The instrument is 41 in. tall so that the user stands to obtain a measurement, eliminating the need to kneel in litter while activating the nipple. This water stick features a screened trip plate to activate the nipple, a clear polypropylene measuring tube, and a pour spout for discarding the sample.

A striking finding was that all eight strains of B. nivea examined had identical nucleotide sequences, including those of the two introns present. The length of intron 2 was nearly three times the size of introns in strains of Penicillium expansum and P. griseofulvum, but intron 1 was comparable in size to the number of nucleotides present in introns 1 and 2 of P. expansum and P. griseofulvum. A high degree of amino acid homology (88 %) existed for the idh genes of the strains of B. nivea when compared with sequences of P. expansum and P. griseofulvum. There were many nucleotide differences present, but they did not affect the amino acid sequence because they were present in the third position. The identity of the B. nivea isolates was confirmed by sequencing the ITS/partial LSU (28 S) rDNA genes. Four B. nivea strains were analysed for production of patulin, a mycotoxin found primarily in apple juice and other fruit products. The B. nivea strains produced patulin in amounts comparable to P. expansum strains. Interest in the genus Byssochlamys is related to the ability of its ascospores to survive pasteurization and cause spoilage of heat-processed fruit products worldwide. 3asequence analysis 3aPenicillium griseofulvum 3abiosynthesis 3apatulin 3agenomic libraries 3aribosomal DNA 3astrain differences 3aByssochlamys nivea 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aoxidoreductases 3agene expression 3aPenicillium expansum 3aenzyme activity 0aisoepoxydon dehydrogenase 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aEngberg, A.E.0 tMycological research.g2006 Sept., v.  110, no.  9 p.1111-11187nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/24613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycres.2006.05.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/08/21  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02050naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002000134040001800154072000900172100002000181245006400201300001600265500002400281500001500305520058200320650002700902650001200929650000900941650001600950650003000966650001900996650001001015650002501025651001201050653002801062653002501090653002301115700002101138773012701159852000901286856009201295856011101387930003301498945002501531946001101556961001301567655001201580IND4394804720221116152600.0070906e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439480472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01716.x2doi7 a10113/33102hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aMeerow, Alan W.10aTen microsatellite loci from Zamia integrifolia (Zamiaceae)  ap. 824-826.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aTen microsatellite loci isolated from Zamia integrifolia are described.

Activities for α-galactosidase and α-glucosidase were determined from cell extracts of B. adolescentis grown on 18 test carbohydrates including AOS. α-galactosidase activity was enhanced on a variety of α-linked or β-linked carbohydrates regardless of a galactoside or glucoside. α-glucosidase, however, was enhanced only on α-linked carbohydrates. AOS significantly enhanced enzyme activity compared with most of the carbohydrates tested. Most of the AOS showed significant increases in activity for both enzymes over that displayed by their corresponding acceptor carbohydrates. α-galactosidase may serve as a biomarker for microbial metabolic activity within the large intestine for potential prebiotics composed of α-linked or β-linked oligosaccharides whereas α-glucosidase activity may be restricted to assessing the influence of only α-linked carbohydrates. The AOS synthesis process provided a value-added component to carbohydrates by increasing metabolic activity (via α-galactosidase and α-glucosidase) over certain acceptor carbohydrates. Fundamental knowledge of enzyme activity in Bifidobacterium may aid in the design of more effective prebiotics and may also help identify enzyme indicators of metabolic activity when assessing influence within the intestine. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aglycosidic linkages 3aBifidobacterium adolescentis 3aglycosyltransferases 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aprobiotics 3aalpha-galactosidase 3aenzyme activity 3aoligosaccharides 0acarbohydrates 0aalternansucrase1 aTeresi, J.M.1 aCôté, G.L.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2008 Jan., v.  46, no.  1 p.73-79dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/268543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02266.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/03/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03030naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245006300185300001800248500002400266520138500290650000901675650002301684650001501707650001401722650002601736650002601762650003801788650001601826650001201842650004101854650006601895650001901961650007701980650002302057650001502080650002002095650002502115650003202140653001802172700001802190773008702208852000902295856011202304930003302416945001302449946001302462961001302475655001202488IND2043296820221120171552.0941117e199409  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204329682DNAL7 a79504182pmid7 a10113/246102hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ201 0aQ5011 aMaragos, C.M.10aQuantitation and stability of fumonisins B1 and B2 in milk  ap. 1162-1167.  aIncludes references  aThe well-documented presence of fumonisin mycotoxins B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2) in corn raises the possibility that these toxins are carried over into the milk of animals fed with contaminated feed. The presence of FB1 and FB2 in milk has not been assessed because of the lack of sensitive analytical techniques for this matrix. Two methods, liquid chromatography (LC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were adapted for the analysis of milk. The ELISA, produced commercially for screening corn, required no sample preparation and was reproducible but was of low sensitivity [concentration that inhibits color development by 50% (IC50), 1200-1600 ng FB1/mL]. The more sensitive LC method involves serial extraction of milk with methanol-acetone and strong anion exchange followed by derivatization with naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde. Recoveries of 50 ng FB1 and FB2/mL from unpasteurized and unhomogenized milk were 84 and 83%, respectively (limit of detection, 5 ng/mL). Recoveries of FB1 from whole homogenized milk (76%) were slightly lower. Heating milk for 30 min at 62 degrees C, to mimic pasteurization, did not significantly reduce FB1 or FB2 recovery, nor did storing milk for 11 days at 4 degrees C. The LC method was applied to 165 samples of milk, only 1 of which was positive. This finding suggests that exposure of humans to FB1 and FB2 from milk is low. 3amilk 3afood contamination 3amycotoxins 3adetection 3aquantitative analysis 3aliquid chromatography 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogens, Environmentalxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aDrug Stability 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFood Contamination 2aFumonisins 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0adetermination1 aRichard, J.L.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g1994 , v.  77, no.  5 p.1162-1167x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03588naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092024002100137040001800158072000900176072000900185072000900194100001200203245010600215300001600321500002400337500001500361520200200376650001602378650003102394650002202425650001802447650001102465650000902476650001902485650001702504650002102521653001902542653003602561653003102597700001502628700001802643700001602661773009302677852000902770856011202779856009502891930003302986945002503019946001303044961001303057655001203070IND4402399820221120143253.0080305e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440239982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.10.0362doi7 a10113/110222hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aL200 0aX3801 aGuo, W.10aAvenanthramides, polyphenols from oats, inhibit IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation in endothelial cells  ap. 415-429.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe chronic inflammation of arterial walls is associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Earlier we reported that avenanthramide (Avn)s-enriched extract of oats (AvnsO) significantly suppressed interleukin (IL)-1β-stimulated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, by human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). The main objective of the current study was to determine if the mechanism of inhibitory effect of these polyphenols from oats on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines is mediated through modulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent transcription. Confluent HAEC monolayers were treated for 24 h with AvnsO, and synthetically prepared Avn-c suppressed IL-β-stimulated activation of NF-κB in a concentration-dependent manner. CH3-Avn-c, a synthetically prepared methyl ester derivative of Avn-c with a high biological potency, significantly and dose dependently decreased mRNA expression and secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 by HAEC as determined by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA, and it inhibited IL-1β- and TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation as determined by a NF-κB DNA binding assay and a NF-κB luciferase reporter assay. AvnsO and Avn-c as well as CH3-Avn-c also inhibited the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNFR-associated factor 2 and 6 (TRAF2, TRAF6) and NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK). CH3-Avn-c also significantly and dose dependently decreased the phosphorylation level of IκB kinase (IKK) and IκB, and prevented IκB degradation as measured by Western blotting. In addition, CH3-Avn-c markedly increased the overall levels of high mass ubiquitin-conjugated protein levels while it mildly inhibited proteasome activity. These observations suggest that Avns, unique polyphenols from oats, decrease the expression of endothelial proinflammatory cytokines at least in part through inhibition of NF-κB activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKK and IκB, and by suppressing proteasome activity. 3apolyphenols 3atranscriptional activation 3aendothelial cells 3ainterleukin-1 3ahumans 3aoats 3acultured cells 3aAvena sativa 3aanthranilic acid 0aavenanthramide 0aNF-kappa B transcription factor 0agene expression regulation1 aWise, M.L.1 aCollins, F.W.1 aMeydani, M.0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2008 Feb. 1, v.  44, no.  3 p.415-429x1873-45967nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.10.0363Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/03/11  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03143naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193072000900202072000900211100001800220245006800238300001800306500002400324500001500348520144600363650001701809650002201826650001901848650001901867650001701886650002001903650002801923650002001951650001601971650001501987650002002002650001702022650001902039653002002058653001702078653002302095700001802118700001702136773011002153852000902263856011202272856008502384930003302469945002502502946001302527961001302540655001202553IND4376914520221120180131.0051229s2005    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND437691452DNAL7 a10.1080/001036205003039392doi7 a10113/357792hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aF800 0aF900 0aF6001 aFageria, N.K.10aRole of cover crops in improving soil and row crop productivity  ap. 2733-2757.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  a
Cover crops play an important role in improving productivity of subsequent row crops by improving soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. The objective of this article is to review recent advances in cover crops practice, in the context of potential benefits and drawbacks for annual crop production and sustained soil quality. Desirable attributes of a cover crop are the ability to establish rapidly under less than ideal conditions, provide sufficient dry matter or soil cover, fix atmospheric nitrogen (N), establish a deep root system to facilitate nutrient uptake from lower soil depths, produce organic matter with low-residue carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, and absence of phytoxic or allelopathic effects on subsequent crops. Cover crops can be leguminous or nonleguminous. Leguminous cover crops provide a substantial amount of biologically fixed N to the primary crop, as well as ease of decomposition due to their low C/N ratio. Legume cover crops also possess a strong ability to absorb low available nutrients in the soil profile and can help in increasing concentration of plant nutrients in the surface layers of soil. Some nonleguminous cover crops having high N scavenger capacity compared with leguminous crops and sometimes, the growth of these scavenging grass cover crops is limited by N deficiency, growing grass/legume mixtures appears to be the best strategy in obtaining maximum benefits from cover crops. 3aweed control 3anitrogen fixation 3aorganic matter 3asoil nutrients 3asoil quality 3anutrient uptake 3adry matter accumulation 3adisease control 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3aerosion control 3apest control 3aeutrophication 0acrop production 0asoil biology 0aliterature reviews1 aBaligar, V.C.1 aBailey, B.A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v.  36, no.  19-20 p.2733-2757x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/357793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036205003039393Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/04/12  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02697naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001700149245011300166300001600279500002400295520150200319650001201821650001801833650001501851650001101866650001901877650002401896650002601920651001201946700001701958700001701975773009001992852000902082856011202091930003302203945002502236946001302261961001302274655001202287IND4430889620221122152406.0100108e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443088962DNAL7 a10113/375022hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aX1001 aFlesch, T.K.10aDeducing Ground-to-Air Emissions from Observed Trace Gas Concentrations: A Field Trial with Wind Disturbance  ap. 475-484.  aIncludes references  aInverse-dispersion techniques allow inference of a gas emission rate Q from measured air concentration. In "ideal surface layer problems," where Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) describes the winds transporting the gas, the application of the technique can be straightforward. This study examines the accuracy of an ideal MOST-based inference, but in a nonideal setting. From a 6 m x 6 m synthetic area source surrounded by a 20 m x 20 m square border of a windbreak fence (1.25 m tall), Q is estimated. Open-path lasers gave line-averaged concentration CL at positions downwind of the source, and an idealized backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLS) dispersion model was used to infer QbLS. Despite the disturbance of the mean wind and turbulence caused by the fence, the QbLS estimates were accurate when ambient winds (measured upwind of the plot) were assumed in the bLS model. In the worst cases, with CL measured adjacent to a plot fence, QbLS overestimated Q by an average of 50%. However, if these near-fence locations are eliminated, QbLS averaged within 2% of the true Q over 61 fifteen-minute observations (with a standard deviation sigma Q/Q = 0.20). Poorer accuracy occurred when in-plot wind measurements were used in the bLS model. The results show that when an inverse-dispersion technique is applied to disturbed flows without accounting for the disturbance, the outcome may still be of acceptable accuracy if judgment is applied in the placement of the concentration detector. 3amethane 3agas emissions 3awindbreaks 3afences 3awind direction 3amathematical models 3afield experimentation 3aAlberta1 aWilson, J.D.1 aHarper, L.A.0 tJournal of applied meteorology.g2005 Apr., v.  44, no.  4 p.475-484x0021-89527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/375023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100114b20100205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/01/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01901naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151100001600169245005000185300001600235500002300251500002500274520084100299650003001140650003001170650001001200650001301210773007401223852000901297856011201306856008801418930003301506946001101539961001301550655001201563IND8606540320221120163728.0860917e198608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860654032DNAL7 a10.1016/0261-2194(86)90062-12doi7 a10113/110232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayre, R.M.10aPathogens for biological control of nematodes  ap. 268-276.  aLiterature review.  aIncludes references.  aThis review briefly examines some of the earlier research that lists the natural soil enemies of plant-parasitic nematodes. The major emphasis is on research developments of the past decade that consider biological control of nematodes. The importance of biocontrol has arisen as a consequence of the loss of the two effective but hazardous nematicidal soil fumigants, namely dibromo-chloropropane and ethylene dibromide, and because of the urgent need for new control strategies that their passing has created. Reports of successful biocontrol of plant nematodes by the fungal agents Nematophthora gynophila, Dactylella oviparasitica and Paecilomyes lilacinus and by the bacterial agent Pasteuria penetrans are examined. These recent developments are analysed and their implications on future research of nematode biocontrol discussed. 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3abiological control agents 3afungi 3abacteria0 tCrop protection.g1986 Aug., v.  5, no.  4 p.268-276x0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0261-2194(86)90062-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03443naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131072000900149100001600158245016400174300001800338500002500356500007100381500001500452520148200467650002001949650002201969650001101991650001602002650001702018650001202035650005202047650002302099650002002122650004602142650001102188650002902199650003702228650002502265650003502290650002402325650005902349650003102408650006702439653001302506653002702519653001202546700001702558700001202575773008602587852000902673856011202682930003302794946001302827961001302840655001202853IND9005730020221121224041.0901120e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900573002DNAL7 a22295852pmid7 a10113/331012hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aPaape, M.J.10aEffects of florfenicol, chloramphenicol, and thiamphenicol on phagocytosis, chemiluminescence, and morphology of bovine polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes  ap. 1734-1744.  aIncludes references.  aMax J.

Antibiotics were tested at 4000, 2000, and 10 micrograms/ml of incubation mixture. Percentage phagocytosis was determined by incubations with neutrophils isolated from milk of five cows and 32P-labeled Staphylococcus aureus and 5% skim milk. The effect of 4000 micrograms of each antibiotic on chemiluminescence was determined on neutrophils isolated from mammary secretions of three nulliparous heifers. Morphological evaluation by transmission and scanning electron microscopy was performed on neutrophils isolated from two heifers at antibiotic concentrations of 4000 and 10 micrograms/ml. Chloramphenicol depressed phagocytosis at the high and medium doses and blocked chemiluminescence activity at the high dose. No effects were observed for florfenicol and thiamphenicol. Transmission electron microscopic examination showed that at the high concentration of drugs, 99, 99, 97, and 76% of the neutrophils treated with florfenicol, chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and dimethyl sulfoxide were abnormal. Examination by scanning electron microscopy showed that the percentage of neutrophils without pseudopodia averaged 67, 94, 32, and 16%, respectively. Results indicated that neither florfenicol nor thiamphenicol altered neutrophil function, but they did alter neutrophil morphology, although to a lesser extent than did chloramphenicol. 3achloramphenicol 3achemiluminescence 3acattle 3aneutrophils 3aphagocytosis 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCattleximmunology 2aCells, Cultured 2aChloramphenicolxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aLuminescent Measurements 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytology 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolecular Structure 2aNeutrophilsxdrug effectsximmunologyxultrastructure. 2aPhagocytosisxdrug effects 2aThiamphenicolxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxpharmacology. 0ain vitro 0aanatomy and morphology 0aanalogs1 aMiller, R.H.1 aZiv, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1990 July, v.  73, no.  7 p.1734-1744x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/331013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090914b20091002c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03445naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132024002100164040001800185072000900203072000900212100001700221245009500238300001800333500002400351500001500375506007600390520128300466506003701749650002801786650002801814650001301842650001201855650001501867650001201882650002501894650001401919650000901933650002501942650002301967650001601990650001802006650001602024650001702040650002002057650002802077650002802105650002502133650005702158653001102215653002802226653002902254700001602283700001702299700002002316700001802336700002102354773007302375852000902448856008202457856011202539930003302651945002502684946001302709961001302722655001202735IND4365484920221207144918.0041110e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436548492DNAL7 a153777612pmid7 aPMC5209672pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.104.0257002doi7 a10113/268572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aWilson, L.M.10aDissection of maize kernel composition and starch production by candidate gene association  ap. 2719-2733.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCereal starch production forms the basis of subsistence for much of the world's human and domesticated animal populations. Starch concentration and composition in the maize (Zea mays ssp mays) kernel are complex traits controlled by many genes. In this study, an association approach was used to evaluate six maize candidate genes involved in kernel starch biosynthesis: amylose extender1 (ae1), brittle endosperm2 (bt2), shrunken1 (sh1), sh2, sugary1, and waxy1. Major kernel composition traits, such as protein, oil, and starch concentration, were assessed as well as important starch composition quality traits, including pasting properties and amylose levels. Overall, bt2, sh1, and sh2 showed significant associations for kernel composition traits, whereas ae1 and sh2 showed significant associations for starch pasting properties. ae1 and sh1 both associated with amylose levels. Additionally, haplotype analysis of sh2 suggested this gene is involved in starch viscosity properties and amylose content. Despite starch concentration being only moderately heritable for this particular panel of diverse maize inbreds, high resolution was achieved when evaluating these starch candidate genes, and diverse alleles for breeding and further molecular analysis were identified.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquantitative trait loci 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3ahaplotypes 3aamylose 3acarbohydrate content 3aviscosity 3acorn 3anucleotide sequences 3apasting properties 3amajor genes 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aStarchxbiosynthesis 2aZea maysxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0astarch 0amolecular sequence data 0acarbohydrate composition1 aWhitt, S.R.1 aIbanez, A.M.1 aRocheford, T.R.1 aGoodman, M.M.1 aBuckler, E.S.

The genes for the three enzymes were located on a 3.8-kilobase EcoRI genomic insert and were cloned by using plasmid pUC18. All three activities were expressed in Escherichia coli JM83, and all were cell associated. Expression of the xylanase gene was independent from expression of the xylosidase and arabinosidase genes, whereas expression of the latter two genes appeared to be coordinated. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the arabinosidase and xylosidase genes and partial purification of these enzyme activities from E. coli suggested that these activities were catalyzed by a bifunctional protein or two proteins of very similar molecular weight. All three enzyme activities were regulated in B. ovatus in response to the carbon source used for growth. This is the first report of the cloning and expression of B. ovatus genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase 3axylan 3aBacteroides ovatus 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3aenzyme activity 3arumen bacteria 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 2aBacteroidesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aCloning, Molecular 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Induction 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Weight 2aMultigene Family 2aOligosaccharidesxisolation & purification 2aPlasmids 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aXylan Endo-1,3-beta-Xylosidase 2aXylansxmetabolism 2aXylosidasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0axylanases1 aHespell, Robert B.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1990 May, v.  172, no.  5 p.2408-2412x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/375073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100114b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02756naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149072000900158100001900167245008200186300001400268500002400282500001500306520124100321650001801562650002101580650003001601650002601631650001901657650001901676650001301695650001401708650001601722650002901738653001501767700002001782700001801802700001901820700001601839700001501855700001901870700001901889700001701908773007401925856011201999930003302111945002502144946001102169961001302180852000902193655001202202IND4405665220221116141953.0080514s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440566522DNAL7 a10113/150612hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aR300 0aQ2021 aCallaway, T.R.10aIonophores: Their Use as Ruminant Growth Promotants and Impact on Food Safety  ap. 43-51.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aIonophores (such as monensin, lasalocid, laidlomycin, salinomycin and narasin) are antimicrobial compounds that are commonly fed to ruminant animals to improve feed efficiency. These antimicrobials specifically target the ruminal bacterial population and alter the microbial ecology of the intestinal microbial consortium, resulting in increased carbon and nitrogen retention by the animal, increasing production efficiency. Ionophores transport ions across cell membranes of susceptible bacteria, dissipating ion gradients and uncoupling energy expenditures from growth, killing these bacteria. Not all bacteria are susceptible to ionophores, and several species have been shown to develop several mechanisms of ionophore resistance. The prophylactic use of antimicrobials as growth promotants in food animals has fallen under greater scrutiny due to fears of the spread of antibiotic resistance. Because of the complexity and high degree of specificity of ionophore resistance, it appears that ionophores do not contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance to important human drugs. Therefore it appears that ionophores will continue to play a significant role in improving the efficiency of animal production in the future. 3aanimal growth 3agrowth promotion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aantibiotic resistance 3afeed additives 3arumen bacteria 3amonensin 3aruminants 3afood safety 3aantibacterial properties 0aionophores1 aEdrington, T.S.1 aRychlik, J.L.1 aGenovese, K.J.1 aPoole, T.L.1 aJung, Y.S.1 aBischoff, K.M.1 aAnderson, R.C.1 aNisbet, D.J.0 tCurrent issues in intestinal microbiology.g2003, v.  4 p.43-517nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080522b20080606c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/05/21  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03824naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131072000900149072000900158100001600167245006800183300001600251500015300267500002400420500007100444500001500515520145400530650001501984650001901999650001302018650002002031650001702051650000802068650001002076650001802086650002202104650001602126650001002142650003702152650001902189650001502208650002302223650001202246650003002258650001102288650002002299650006902319650002202388650004402410650002602454650006102480650005902541650003702600650001902637650005502656650001102711650001702722653002302739653001502762700001702777773010302794852000902897856011202906930003303018945001303051946001303064961001303077655001203090IND2058682920221121224004.0970729e199702  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205868292DNAL7 a90514802pmid7 a10113/331032hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL1001 aPaape, M.J.10aCellular defense mechanisms in the udder and lactation of goats  ap. 556-565.  aPresented at the goat symposium session titled "Advances in Physiology and Chevon Technology Research" at the ASAS 87th Annual Meeting, Orlando, FL.  aIncludes references  aMax J.

Evasion of neutrophil defenses provides an opportunity for invading bacteria to become established. Depletion of neutrophils results in a dramatic increase in susceptibility to intramammary infection. Numerous cytoplasmic particles are shed from the apical surface of mammary secretory cells during milk secretion in goats. Only those counting methods that are specific for deoxyribonucleic acid can distinguish cell-like particles from somatic cells and thereby give reliable estimates of somatic cell numbers in goat milk. Unlike in milk from dairy cows, the somatic cell count in goat milk is influenced by the presence of nucleated cytoplasmic particles, stage of lactation, parity, and caprine arthritis-encephalitis. Investigations indicate that a dry period is necessary for optimal milk production in dairy cows but may not be necessary in goats. However, in many other respects regulation of bovine and caprine lactation seems to be quite similar. Studies have demonstrated additive galactopoietic effects of growth hormone and frequent milking in both species and a recently isolated chemical feedback inhibitor of lactation seems effective across both species. Increasing lactational performance has the potential for decreasing milk somatic cell counts in late lactation. 3adairy cows 3amilk secretion 3amastitis 3alactation stage 3asomatotropin 3aDNA 3agoats 3acell division 3amilking frequency 3aneutrophils 3ateats 3atransmission electron microscopy 3amammary glands 3amilk yield 3asomatic cell count 2aAnimals 2aCytoplasmxultrastructure 2aFemale 2aFood, Fortified 2aGoat Diseasesxpathologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aGrowth Hormonexadministration & dosage 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytologyxpathologyxphysiology. 2aMastitisxpathologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aMicroscopy, Electronxveterinary 2aMilkxcytology 2aNeutrophilsxcytologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aParity 2aTime Factors 0aliterature reviews 0adry period1 aCapuco, A.V.0 tJournal of animal science.g1997 Feb., v.  75, no.  2 p.556-565wJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/331033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090914b20091002c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03233naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001600149245005900165300001600224500002400240500001500264520163000279650002401909650001501933650001801948650002101966650001701987650001702004650001002021650001602031650002102047650001702068650001302085650002002098650001802118650002702136650000902163650001702172650001602189650001102205650001002216650001702226650001702243653001602260653002002276653002602296653002302322773008302345852000902428856011202437930003302549945002502582946001102607961001302618655001202631IND4405830920221116141923.0080519s2007    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440583092DNAL7 a10113/150652hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ113 0aQ5031 aJones, D.R.10aEgg Functionality and Quality During Long-Term Storage  ap. 157-162.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aEggs are truly a functional food and the ability of the egg to contribute to food systems is important. The current study was undertaken to determine the changes in functional characteristics and quality factors of commercial shell eggs during 10 wk of 4°C storage. Commercially processed eggs were collected for three consecutive weeks (reps) from an in-line facility. Analyses were conducted the day after collection (0 wk) and each subsequent week. Total solids for the albumen, yolk and whole egg were determined. Functional properties were examined via preparation of angel food cakes, mayonnaise and sponge cakes. Color was also measured for both raw yolks and prepared mayonnaise. Albumen solids were fairly consistent during storage (12.2 to 12.6%). Whole egg solids remained constant. Yolk solids decreased throughout storage (48.2 to 43.2%). Angel food cake volume decreased as the egg aged. Sponge cake volumes were inconsistent throughout testing with no clearly apparent trends. Mayonnaise was tested immediately after preparation (fresh) and incubation at 50°C for 7 d. In both cases, the average force required to compress the mayonnaise decreased with egg age. Differences were detected for changes in color values (L*, a* and b*) for yolks over time, but these changes were not generally of a magnitude great enough to be seen by the human eye. Most of the measured parameters exhibited significant interactions for replicate and egg storage. These interactions show that variability exists within the testing methods and more objective methods for determining shell egg functionality need to be developed. 3abreadmaking quality 3ashelf life 3afood analysis 3afoaming capacity 3adroplet size 3afood storage 3acakes 3aegg albumen 3aleavening agents 3astorage time 3aegg yolk 3aprocessed foods 3arefrigeration 3aemulsifying properties 3aeggs 3agel strength 3adeformation 3avolume 3acolor 3atotal solids 3acold storage 0aconsistency 0astorage quality 0afunctional properties 0aleavening capacity0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2007, v.  6, no.  3 p.157-1627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150653Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080522b20080606c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/05/22  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02942naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111024002100149040001800170072000900188072000900197100001800206245007600224300001600300500002400316500001500340520113400355650001301489650002201502650003001524650002301554650002801577650000901605650001801614650001501632650002301647650002701670650002401697650003501721650001301756650005001769650002701819650004001846650003301886650002501919650002401944653001601968773008901984852000902073856008802082856011202170930003302282945002502315946001102340961001302351655001202364IND4364597320221120190049.0040921e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436459732DNAL7 a153708322pmid7 a10.1080/026520304100017178122doi7 a10113/275942hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aQ2041 aMaragos, C.M.10aDetection of moniliformin in maize using capillary zone electrophoresis  ap. 803-810.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aMoniliformin is a mycotoxin produced by certain fungi pathogenic to maize. It is capable of causing disease in domestic animals, possibly through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Testing for MON commonly involves extraction of maize, isolation of moniliformin using solid-phase extraction columns and detection with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography. A capillary zone electrophoresis-diode array detection (CZE-DAD) method for determination of moniliformin in maize is reported. The extraction and isolation procedures are similar to those of a commonly used HPLC method, while the detection step requires only 10 min. Sixty-three samples of maize were tested by an established HPLC method using absorbance at 229 nm (HPLC-ultraviolet light) and by the CZE-DAD method. The limit of detection of the CZE-DAD method was 0.1 microgram MON g-1 maize compared with 0.05 microgram g-1 for the HPLC-ultraviolet light method. The CZE-DAD method gave good agreement with the HPLC-ultraviolet light method for samples tested at levels up to 1500 microgram g-1, with a linear regression of r2 = 0.996. 3aZea mays 3atoxigenic strains 3afungal diseases of plants 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3acorn 3arapid methods 3amycotoxins 3afeed contamination 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amicrobial detection 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3aFusarium 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aCyclobutanesxanalysis 2aElectrophoresis, Capillaryxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aZea maysxchemistry 0amethodology0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Aug., v.  21, no.  8 p.803-810x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304100017178123Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/275943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090402b20090508c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02864naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150100001300159245011300172300001600285500008100301500002400382500001500406520081600421650001301237650003101250650002201281650002601303650001901329650002801348650002901376650001801405650001301423650003101436650001301467650004301480650003301523650002801556650002101584650003101605650003101636650004501667653002201712653002301734653002101757700001201778700001501790700001201805700001601817700001501833700001301848700001801861700001701879700001701896773007401913852000901987856011201996930003302108945002502141946001102166961001302177655001202190IND4365322520221122180105.0041029e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436532252DNAL7 a153156332pmid7 a10113/204062hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aAlba, R.10aESTs, cDNA microarrays, and gene expression profiling: tools for dissecting plant physiology and development  ap. 697-714.  aIn the special issue: Techniques for Molecular Analysis / edited by H. klee.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aGene expression profiling holds tremendous promise for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional networks that underlie biological processes.

The 37 wasp hydrocarbons identified consisted of a series of n-alkanes (C16 to C33), 3-, 5-, 9-, 10-, 11-, and 12-methyl alkanes and a series of Z-7 and Z-9 monoenes (C23:1 to C27:1). One C25:2 diene was found. No effects of hydrocarbon composition as a function of age, gender, or mating status were found for the wasps. Wasps reared on Hypothenemus hampei, however, had 12/37 significant abundance differences to those reared on Caulophilus oryzae, although all but one of these differences were for components in less than 2% relative abundance. The C25:2 diene from wasps reared on H. hampei was present in about 10% whereas from wasps reared on C. oryzae it was present in about 2%. The hydrocarbons of one host for this wasp, the coffee berry borer (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), have been previously reported [Howard and Infante, Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 89:700-709 (1996)]. The hydrocarbons of the alternative host, C. oryzae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) consists of n-alkanes (C17 to C31), 3-, 4-, 5-, 7-, 9-, 11-, 12-, 13-, 14-, and 15-methyl alkanes, and a series of dimethyl alkanes of the series 3, 17-; 5, 11-; 5, 17-; 7, 11-; 7, 13-; 13, 17-; and 15, 19-. No unsaturated hydrocarbons were found. No significant differences in hydrocarbon composition were found between male and female C. oryzae. Hydrocarbon patterns of four species of Cephalonomia are compared and shown to be species-specific. The data are discussed in terms of ecological and physiological parameters. 3aCephalonomia 3achemical composition 3aparasitoids 3achemical ecology 3ainterspecific variation 3ahydrocarbons 3ahost-parasite relationships 3agender differences 3aanimal cuticle 3asexual reproduction 3aalternative hosts 3astorage pests 3amating behavior 3aHypothenemus hampei 3aCurculionidae 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxchemistryxmetabolismxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHydrocarbonsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aHymenopteraxchemistryxphysiology. 2aMale 0aparasites 0aspecies differences 0aparasites of insect pests 0aage differences1 aPerez-Lachaud, G.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2002 June, v.  50, no.  2 p.75-84x0739-44627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.100343Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/129233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080410b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02546naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001600140245018400156300001300340500002400353520134300377650001101720650001301731650001301744650001701757650001601774650003701790653003101827700001701858700001701875773007701892852000901969856011201978930003302090945001302123946001102136961001302147655001202160IND2203498220221120190006.0000331e199905  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220349822DNAL7 a10113/275992hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aStein, T.M.10aAmino acids as plasticizers. II. Use of quantitative structure-property relationships to predict the behavior of monoammoniummonocarboxylate plasticizers in starch-glycerol blends  ap. 7-16.  aIncludes references  aTwenty natural and synthetic amino acids (5 cyclic and 15 acyclic) were blended with a standard starch-glycerol mixture and extruded as ribbons. Glycerol was present in all blends as a co-plasticizer, permitting observation of both increase and decrease in sample flexibility resulting from amino acids. Mechanical testing of the ribbons revealed that amino acids had a dramatic effect on the percent elongation at break (%E) which varied from 13% to 379%. Tensile strength (TS) of the ribbons also varied considerably from 0.96 to 6.29 MPa. In general, samples displaying the greatest elongation had the lowest TS. FT-Raman spectroscopy indicated that the amino acids in these blends existed predominately as zwitterions. Computational models of all test compounds were therefore generated as zwitterions, and the global minimum-energy conformation of each test compound was used as the basis for calculating molecular descriptors. Surprisingly, only two (sum of absolute values of atomic charges and maximum positive charge on the molecule) of the 17 descriptors evaluated were needed to generate predictive quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) for both %E and TS data. By calculating these two descriptors from computer models, %E and TS can be predicted for blends with unknown or new monoamine-monocarboxyl compounds. 3astarch 3aglycerol 3apolymers 3aplasticizers 3aamino acids 3astructure-activity relationships 0astarch glycerol composites1 aGordon, S.H.1 aGreene, R.V.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1999 May, v.  39, no.  1 p.7-16x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/275993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090402b20090508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01847naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001600149245005700165300001400222500002400236500001500260520062100275650002000896650001200916650001900928650002400947650002200971650001600993651001801009653000901027653001801036700001801054700002101072773011501093852000901208856011201217930003301329945002501362946001301387961001301400655001201413IND4404487720221123034202.0080416e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440448772DNAL7 a10113/136272hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE500 0aX8001 aWojan, T.R.14aThe Emergence of Rural Artistic Havens: A First Look  ap. 53-70.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aNearly all applied research on arts activity has examined phenomena in metropolitan areas.

We document the emergence of these “rural artistic havens” and identify county characteristics associated with the attraction of performing, fine, and applied artists. The implications of these findings for rural development strategies focusing on the arts are discussed. 3aperforming arts 3atourism 3arural programs 3aregression analysis 3arural development 3arural areas 3aUnited States 0aarts 0arural society1 aLambert, D.M.1 aMcGranahan, D.A.0 tAgricultural and resource economics review.g2007 Apr., v.  36, no.  1 p.53-70wJournal:22623x1068-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/136273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080423b20080502c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/04/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle03424naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003500113040001800148100001600166245011300182300001600295500002400311506017300335520142400508650001101932650001301943650001901956650002301975650001001998650001902008650002302027650002102050650002402071650002002095650001402115650001702129650002702146650001102173650002502184650002802209650002402237650001802261650003502279700001502314700001602329700001402345700001902359700001302378700001302391700001602404700002102420700001602441773009802457852000902555856011202564856004802676956007702724961000902801655001202810IND4451501120221119191003.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445150112DNAL7 a10113/543892hdl7 a10.1007/s11032-010-9442-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassman, J.10aGenome-wide association mapping of Fusarium head blight resistance in contemporary barley breeding germplasm  ap. 439-454.  aIncludes references  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aUtilization of quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified in bi-parental mapping populations has had limited success for improving complex quantitative traits with low to moderate heritability. Association mapping in contemporary breeding germplasm may lead to more effective marker strategies for crop improvement. To test this approach, we conducted association mapping of two complex traits with moderate heritability; Fusarium head blight (FHB) severity and the grain concentration of mycotoxin associated with disease, deoxynivalenol (DON). To map FHB resistance in barley, 768 breeding lines were evaluated in 2006 and 2007 in four locations. All lines were genotyped with 1,536 SNP markers and QTL were mapped using a mixed model that accounts for relatedness among lines. Average linkage disequilibrium within the breeding germplasm extended beyond 4 cM. Four QTL were identified for FHB severity and eight QTL were identified for the DON concentration in two independent sets of breeding lines. The QTL effects were small, explaining 1-3% of the phenotypic variation, as might be expected for complex polygenic traits. We show that using breeding germplasm to map QTL can complement bi-parental mapping studies by providing independent validation, mapping QTL with more precision, resolving questions of linkage and pleiotropy, and identifying genetic markers that can be applied immediately in crop improvement. 3abarley 3abreeding 3abreeding lines 3achromosome mapping 3acrops 3adeoxynivalenol 3adisease resistance 3adisease severity 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic markers 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amodels 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3ascab diseases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aCooper, B.1 aHorsley, R.1 aNeate, S.1 aDill-Macky, R.1 aChao, S.1 aDong, Y.1 aSchwarz, P.1 aMuehlbauer, G.J.1 aSmith, K.P.0 tMolecular breeding.g2011 Apr., v. 27, no. 4 p.439-454dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/543893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-010-9442-0  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/111672_238442.pdf  aUSDA 7aarticle03912naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146024002100165040001800186072001700204100002400221245004100245500002400286506007600310520229500386506003702681650001102718650002302729650003502752650002002787650002802807650001902835650003702854650002702891700001902918700002002937700001902957700002302976700002102999700002403020773007703044852000903121856011203130856008203242930003303324945002503357946001103382961001303393655001203406IND4430796320221207124138.0100104s2005    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443079632DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2164-6-742doi7 aPMC11665492pmcid7 a159438752pmid7 a10113/374922hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

These maps have proved valuable for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) to broad regions of the genome, but more closely spaced markers are needed to fine-map QTL, and markers associated with genes and annotated sequence are needed to identify genes and sequence variation that may explain QTL. Results: Bovine expressed sequence tag (EST) and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)sequence data were used to develop 918 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to map genes on the bovine linkage map. DNA of sires from the MARC reference population was used to detect SNPs, and progeny and mates of heterozygous sires were genotyped. Chromosome assignments for 861 SNPs were determined by twopoint analysis, and positions for 735 SNPs were established by multipoint analyses. Linkage maps of bovine autosomes with these SNPs represent 4585 markers in 2475 positions spanning 3058 cM . Markers include 3612 microsatellites, 913 SNPs and 60 other markers. Mean separation between marker positions is 1.2 cM. New SNP markers appear in 511 positions, with mean separation of 4.7 cM. Multi-allelic markers, mostly microsatellites, had a mean (maximum) of 216 (366) informative meioses, and a mean 3-lod confidence interval of 3.6 cM Bi-allelic markers, including SNP and other marker types, had a mean (maximum) of 55 (191) informative meioses, and were placed within a mean 8.5 cM 3-lod confidence interval. Homologous human sequences were identified for 1159 markers, including 582 newly developed and mapped SNP. Conclusion: Addition of these EST- and BAC-based SNPs to the bovine linkage map not only increases marker density, but provides connections to gene-rich physical maps, including annotated human sequence. The map provides a resource for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci and identification of positional candidate genes, and can be integrated with other data to guide and refine assembly of bovine genome sequence. Even after the bovine genome is completely sequenced, the map will continue to be a useful tool to link observable phenotypes and animal genotypes to underlying genes and molecular mechanisms influencing economically important beef and dairy traits.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acattle 3achromosome mapping 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aexpressed sequence tags 3alinkage groups 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3amicrosatellite repeats1 aCasas, Eduardo1 aStone, Roger T.1 aKeele, John W.1 aHarhay, Gregory P.1 aBennett, Gary L.1 aSmith, Timothy P.L.0 tBMC genomics.g2005, v.  6, no.  74wJournal:jnl3943740x1471-21647nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/374923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-6-743Available from publisher's Web site  a20100114b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/13  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02522naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002100120040001800141072001700159072001700176100001700193245010200210300001600312500002400328520118700352650001301539650001301552650001701565650002501582650001001607650002501617650002001642650001401662650002701676653002301703773009101726852000901817856007801826856011201904930003302016945001302049946001302062961001302075655001202088IND2047259320221120205436.0950811e199507  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204725932DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-07172doi7 a10113/430302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCarson, M.L.12aA new gene in maize conferring the "chlorotic halo" reaction to infection by Exserohilum turcicum  ap. 717-720.  aIncludes references  aDuring recurrent selection in the maize synthetic BS19, S1 lines exhibiting a unique lesion phenotype in response to infection with Exserohilum turcicum were observed. This phenotype, dubbed "chlorotic halo," initially appears as dark orange-brown pigmented infection points that are later surrounded by a circular chlorotic halo about 1 cm in diameter. Most infection points retain this phenotype, although some later develop into the elongated, elliptical necrotic lesions typical of northern leaf blight (NLB). An inbred line derived from this initial selection was crossed to the susceptible inbred line A619 and the inheritance of the chlorotic halo reaction studied in advanced generations from this cross. Segregation ratios were consistent with the hypothesis that the chlorotic halo phenotype is controlled by a single recessive gene. This gene appears to be located on the short arm of chromosome 1 near the centromere, based upon reciprocal translocation mapping studies. The chlorotic halo reaction was expressed against races 0,1,23, and 23N of E. turcicum in the field. The effectiveness of the chlorotic halo gene in reducing losses to NLB remains to be demonstrated. 3acrossing 3aZea mays 3ainbred lines 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3agenes 3acytogenetic analysis 3agene expression 3aphenotype 3ainheritance (genetics) 0avarietal reactions0 tPlant disease.g1995 July, v.  79, no.  7 p.717-720wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-07173Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/430303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02730naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100001500131245010400146300001600250500002400266500001500290520129100305650001801596650001401614650001201628650002301640650002001663650001401683650001401697650002301711650003701734650001301771650002301784650002501807653001601832653001001848653002601858700001501884773006501899852000901964856011201973856009302085930003302178945001302211946001102224961001302235655001202248IND2331516620221118000503.0030320s2003    ne |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND233151662DNAL7 a10113/143752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, X.M.10aIdentification of genes for resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei in 18 barley genotypes  ap. 127-145.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aBarley genotypes Hor 1428, Hor 2926, Hor 3209, BBA 2890, Abyssinian 14, Grannelose Zweizeilige, and Stauffers Obersulzer are resistant to all races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei so far detected in the U.S.A. Heils Franken, Cambrinus, Astrix, Emir, Hiproly, Varunda, Trumpf, Mazurka, Bigo, BBA 2890, and I 5 are resistant to some races and susceptible to others. Previous studies showed that Hor 1428, Hor 2926, Hor 3209, Abyssinian 14, Stauffers Obersulzer, I 5, Heils Franken, Emir, Astrix, Hiproly, Varunda, and Trumpf each have two genes, and BBA 2890, Grannelose Zweizeilige, Cambrinus, Mazurka, Bigo, and BBA 809 each have a single gene for resistance. To determine the genes in specific genotypes and their relationships, all possible crosses were made among the 18 genotypes. Seedlings of parents and F2 progeny were tested under controlled conditions for resistance to selected races that were avirulent on both parents. Based on segregation within the individual crosses to selected races, at least 26 of 30 genes detected in the 18 genotypes were different. Allelic and linkage relationships of some of the genes were determined. The genetic information should be useful for understanding the host-pathogen interactions and for control of stripe rust using resistance. 3arust diseases 3acultivars 3aalleles 3agenetic resistance 3aHordeum vulgare 3aseedlings 3avirulence 3adisease resistance 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenotype 3alinkage (genetics) 3aPuccinia striiformis 0asegregation 0agenes 0abiological resistance1 aLine, R.F.0 tEuphytica.g2003, v.  129, no.  1 p.127-145x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0014-2336/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03764naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001800149245012700167300001600294500002400310500001500334520226800349650002302617650001502640650001602655650002302671650001502694650002702709650001502736650002302751650002302774650002302797651001302820653003002833653002002863653001702883653002502900700001302925700001702938700001602955773007202971852000903043856011203052930003303164945002503197946001103222961001303233655001203246IND4372362520221122184410.0050717e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236252DNAL7 a10113/374932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF6001 aWicklow, D.T.12aA protective endophyte of maize: Acremonium zeae antibiotics inhibitory to Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium verticillioides  ap. 610-618.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe maize endophyte Acremonium zeae is antagonistic to kernel rotting and mycotoxin producing fungi Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium verticillioides in cultural tests for antagonism, and interferes with A. flavus infection and aflatoxin contamination of preharvest maize kernels. Chemical studies of an organic extract from maize kernel fermentations of Acremonium zeae (NRRL 13540), which displayed significant antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus and F. verticillioides, revealed that the metabolites accounting for this activity were two newly reported antibiotics pyrrocidines A and B. Pyrrocidines were detected in fermentation extracts for 12 NRRL cultures of Acremonium zeae isolated from maize kernels harvested in Illinois (4/4 cultures), North Carolina (5/5), Georgia (1/2) and unrecorded locations within the USA (2/2). Pyrrocidine B was detected by LCMSMS in whole symptomatic maize kernels removed at harvest from ears of a commercial hybrid that were wound-inoculated in the milk stage with A. zeae (NRRL 13540) or (NRRL 13541). The pyrrocidines were first reported from the fermentation broth of an unidentified filamentous fungus LL-Cyan426, isolated from a mixed Douglas Fir hardwood forest on Crane Island Preserve, Washington, in 1993. Pyrrocidine A exhibited potent activity against most Gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains, and was also active against the yeast Candida albicans. In an evaluation of cultural antagonism between 13 isolates of A. zeae in pairings with A. flavus (NRRL 6541) and F. verticillioides (NRRL 25457), A. zeae (NRRL 6415) and (NRRL 34556) produced the strongest reaction, inhibiting both organisms at a distance while continuing to grow through the resulting clear zone at an unchanged rate. Maximum colony diameters for A. zeae (NRRL 6415) and (NRRL 13540), on potato dextrose agar after 14 d, were attained within the range of 25–30 °C, with less growth recorded at 15° and 37.5° and no growth at 5°. Potential interactions between A. zeae and other maize endophytes are considered and the significance of these interactions relative to the aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination of preharvest maize is presented. This is the first report of natural products from Acremonium zeae. 3afungal antagonists 3aendophytes 3aantibiotics 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3aplant rots 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aAcremonium 3achemical structure 3aAspergillus flavus 3abiological control 3aIllinois 0abiological control agents 0aAcremonium zeae 0apyrrocidines 0aGibberella fujikuroi1 aRoth, S.1 aDeyrup, S.T.1 aGloer, J.B.0 tMycological research.g2005 May, v.  109 p.610-618x0953-75627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/374933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100114b20100205c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/07/27  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02803naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150100001400159245006800173300001600241500002400257500001500281520122500296650001801521650001701539650002401556650001501580650002601595650002001621650001501641650002501656650001801681650004501699650003101744650003001775650002701805650003301832650003001865650001701895653001601912653002401928700001901952700001701971773008001988852000902068856011202077930003302189945001302222946001302235961001302248655001202261IND2330230620221121225300.0021230e200210  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233023062DNAL7 a121925242pmid7 a10113/246042hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3001 aKuo, T.M.10aConversion of fatty acids by Bacillus sphaericus-like organisms  ap. 265-271.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aBacillus sphaericus species are mesophilic round-spored organisms that readily utilize fatty acid-based surfactants during growth, but their ability to modify fatty acids is unknown. Among 57 B. sphaericus-like strains tested for fatty acid transformation activity in Wallen fermentation (WF) medium, ten converted oleic acid to a new product determined by gas chromatography -- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to be 10-ketostearic acid (10-KSA). Additionally, a few other strains converted ricinoleic acid and linoleic acid to new products that remain to be characterized. Unlike most microbial hydrations of oleic acid, which produce a mixture of 10-KSA and 10-hydroxystearic acid, the conversion of oleic acid by B. sphaericus strains was unique in that 10-KSA was the sole reaction product. By replacing dextrose with sodium pyruvate in WF and adjusting to pH 6.5, conversion of oleic acid to 10-KSA by strain NRRL NRS-732 was improved from about 11% to more than 60%. Using the defined optimal conditions, the conversion reaction was scaled up in a stirred-batch reactor by using technical-grade oleic acid as substrate. This is the first report on the characterization of fatty acid conversions by B. sphaericus species. 3alinoleic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aBacillus sphaericus 3aketo acids 3abiological production 3aricinoleic acid 3aoleic acid 2aBacillusxmetabolism 2aCulture Media 2aFatty Acidsxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLinoleic Acidxmetabolism 2aOleic Acidxmetabolism 2aRicinoleic Acidsxmetabolism 2aStearic Acidsxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 0afatty acids 0a10-ketostearic acid1 aNakamura, L.K.1 aLanser, A.C.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2002 Oct., v.  45, no.  4 p.265-271x0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02086naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001700149245004100166300001600207500002400223520106300247650002201310650001301332650002101345650002101366650002901387650002301416773008001439852000901519856011201528930003301640945002501673946001301698961001301711655001201724IND4373598320221122235024.0050825e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437359832DNAL7 a10113/374942hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aQ5001 aFinley, J.W.10aSelenium accumulation in plant foods  ap. 196-202.  aIncludes references  aSelenium (Se) is an essential nutrient, and Se deficiency is associated with disease conditions and general impairment of the immune system. Supplementation of Se to humans already consuming the RDA may help to prevent certain cancers. A convincing argument can be made for augmenting the food supply with Se, and Se-enhanced plants may be the best means of accomplishing this. Plants accumulate varying amounts of Se in different chemical forms; some plants accumulate Se in direct relationship to the amount available from the soil, whereas others (Se-accumulators) may accumulate Se in concentrations many orders of magnitude above that in the soil. There are many different chemical forms of Se in plants, and the form partially dictates the metabolism of Se by the animal that consumes the plant. The Se content and the chemical form of Se within plants may be altered by manipulation of plant genetics or by agricultural production conditions. However, attempts to maximize Se in plants may have unintended consequences and must be carefully monitored. 3aplant-based foods 3aselenium 3adietary minerals 3anutrient content 3adietary nutrient sources 3aplant biochemistry0 tNutrition reviews.g2005 June, v.  63, no.  6(I) p.196-202x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/374943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100114b20100205c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/09/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02864naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002100120040001800141072000900159072000900168100001700177245008400194300001600278500002400294520154400318650001301862650001301875650001701888650002501905650001101930650002301941650001301964650002701977653002202004653002502026653002302051773007302074852000902147856007802156856011202234930003302346945001302379946001302392961001302405655001202418IND2047031120221120205454.0950727e199506  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204703112DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-05812doi7 a10113/430322hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aCarson, M.L.10aInheritance of latent period length in maize infected with Exserohilum turcicum  ap. 581-585.  aIncludes references  aExtended latent period length is an important component of partial resistance of maize to northern leaf blight (NLB) caused by Exserohilum turcicum.

The inheritance of latent period length was studied in F2 and backcross generations of crosses of the experimental inbred line 69-1 (highly resistant, long latent period) and Mo17 (intermediately resistant, intermediate latent period) with the highly susceptible inbred line A632. Studies were conducted under both winter greenhouse conditions and in the field. Differences in mean latent periods between the two parental inbred lines varied from 14.1 days (A632 X 69-1; 1993 field experiment) to 1.8 days (A632 X Mo17; 1993 greenhouse experiment). Analysis of generation means of log-transformed latent periods revealed that over 92% of the variation among generation means could be explained by additive gene action and that dominance and epistatic effects were negligible. Heritability and gene number estimates were in agreement with previously published estimates for partial resistance to NLB measured as reduced disease severity on adult plants. Selection on some sort of progeny mean basis would probably be the most efficient and rapid means of selection for increased latent period and could potentially be more effective than selection for reduced NLB severity after anthesis. 3acrossing 3aZea mays 3ainbred lines 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3ablight 3agenetic resistance 3aduration 3ainheritance (genetics) 0alatent infections 0anorthern leaf blight 0apartial resistance0 tPlant disease.g1995 June, v.  79, no.  6 p.581-585x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-05813Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/430323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03575naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152024002100171040001800192100003200210245005400242246003100296500001500327506007600342506017300418520108500591592002801676506003701704650001701741650001501758650001801773650001401791650001201805650000901817650001701826650000901843650002501852650004901877650002401926650001201950650002301962650001201985650001001997650001802007650002702025653002602052700001802078700001802096700002202114700002202136700002502158700001902183700002102202700002302223700002502246700002102271700002102292700002702313700002202340700003102362700002202393700002702415773007402442852000902516856011202525856008802637956009102725961001302816655001202829IND4462551720221207075728.0120105e20101011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446255172DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00132302doi7 aPMC29525882pmcid7 a209490012pmid7 a10113/539412hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellens, R.

We used the genome sequence of model legumes, together with their known synteny to the pea genome to identify candidate genes for the A and A2 loci in pea. We then used a combination of genetic mapping, fast neutron mutant analysis, allelic diversity, transcript quantification and transient expression complementation studies to confirm the identity of the candidates. We have identified the pea genes A and A2 . A is the factor determining anthocyanin pigmentation in pea that was used by Gregor Mendel 150 years ago in his study of inheritance. The A gene encodes a bHLH transcription factor. The white flowered mutant allele most likely used by Mendel is a simple G to A transition in a splice donor site that leads to a mis-spliced mRNA with a premature stop codon, and we have identified a second rare mutant allele. The A2 gene encodes a WD40 protein that is part of an evolutionarily conserved regulatory complex.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthocyanins 3astop codon 3amessenger RNA 3aflowering 3aalleles 3apeas 3apigmentation 3aloci 3aalternative splicing 3abasic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 3aconserved sequences 3aflowers 3achromosome mapping 3amutants 3acolor 3aPisum sativum 3ainheritance (genetics) 0atranscription factors1 aMoreau, Carol1 aLin-Wang, Kui1 aSchwinn, Kathy E.1 aThomson, Susan J.1 aFiers, Mark W.

Paape was inducted into the ARS Science Hall of Fame, 2009.  aThe study was conducted to determine effects of an abraded intramammary device on milk yield, tissue damage, and milk somatic cells during late lactation. Abraded intramammary devices were inserted into diagonally opposed quarters of 20 cows. One group of 11 cows (devices inserted 30 wk of lactation) was quarter machine milked daily for 2 wk before and for 8 wk after insertion. Nine cows had devices inserted within 4 wk postpartum and were quarter milked at 20 and 40 wk of lactation. Aliquots of quarter bucket milk were obtained for determination of milk somatic cells, red blood cells, and NAGase activity. Stripping milk was obtained for milk somatic cell counts. For both groups, there was no significant effect of the abraded intramammary device on NAGase activity. There was a tendency for quarters with devices to produce less milk than control quarters, but the difference was not significant. Milk SCC were significantly elevated in quarter bucket and stripping milk from quarters containing intramammary devices. Red blood cells were higher in quarters containing intramammary devices when compared with controls. Results indicate that abraded intramammary devices increased concentrations of somatic cells and red blood cells in bucket milk, did not damage tissue as measured by NAGase activity, and loss in milk production was nonsignificant. 3adairy cows 3aEscherichia coli 3abovine mastitis 3adisease control 3aveterinary equipment 3amilk yield 3aerythrocytes 3aenzyme activity 3amilk 3aleukocyte count 2aAnimal Husbandryxinstrumentation 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxphysiology 2aMilkxcytology 2aPregnancy 0amammary tissue 0anagase1 aWeinland, B.T.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1988 Jan., v.  71, no.  1 p.250-256x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/330983Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090914b20091002c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04924naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002000120040001800140100001500158245010900173300001400282500002400296500001500320520203300335650001302368650002302381650002502404650001702429650001802446650002502464650001602489650001902505650001602524651001002540653001602550653001702566653004802583653003202631653001802663700001702681700001802698700001602716700002002732773007102752774017602823774013702999774014803136774013303284774010903417852000903526856011103535856007803646856009603724856009603820856009603916856009604012856009604108930003304204945001304237946001104250961001304261655001204274IND2050827020221119080337.0960416s1995    gw |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND205082702DNAL7 a10.1007/BF001891652doi7 a10113/11022hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolk, J.A.10aRole of transpiration suppression by evaporation of intercepted water in improving irrigation efficiency  ap. 89-95.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aSprinkler irrigation efficiency declines when applied water intercepted by the crop foliage, or gross interception (Igross), as well as airborne droplets and ponded water at the soil surface evaporate before use by the crop. However, evaporation of applied water can also supply some of the atmospheric demands usually met by plant transpiration. Any suppression of crop transpiration from the irrigated area as compared to a non-irrigated area can be subtracted from Igross irrigation application losses for reduced, or net, interception (Inet) loss. This study was conducted to determine the extent in which transpiration suppression due to microclimatic modification resulting from evaporation of plant-intercepted water and/or of applier water can reduce total sprinkler irrigation application losses of impact sprinkler and low energy precision application (LEPA) irrigation systems. Fully irrigated corn (Zea Mays L.) was grown on 0.75 m wide east-west rows in 1990 at Bushland, TX in two contiguous 5-ha fields, each containing a weighing lysimeter and micrometeorological instrumentation. Transpiration (Tr) was measured using heat balance sap flow gauges. During and following an impact sprinkler irrigation, within-canopy vapor pressure deficit and canopy temperature declined sharply due to canopy-intercepted water and microclimatic modification from evaporation. For an average day time impact irrigation application of 21 mm, estimated average Igross loss was 10.7%, but the resulting suppression of measured Tr by 50% or more during the irrigation reduced Igross loss 3.9%. On days of high solar radiation, continued transpiration suppression following the irrigation reduced Igross loss an additional 1.2%. Further 4-6% reductions in Igross losses were predicted when aerodynamic and canopy resistances were considered. Irrigation water applied only at the soil surface by LEPA irrigation had little effect on the microclimate within the canopy and consequently on Tr or ET, or irrigation application efficiency. 3aZea mays 3aevapotranspiration 3awater use efficiency 3amicroclimate 3atranspiration 3asprinkler irrigation 3aevaporation 3avapor pressure 3awater vapor 3aTexas 0asuppression 0ainterception 0alow energy precision application irrigation 0aimpact sprinkler irrigation 0awater balance1 aHowell, T.A.1 aSteiner, J.L.1 aKrieg, D.R.1 aSchneider, A.D.0 tIrrigation science.g1995, v.  16, no.  2 p.89-95x0342-71887nnas0 tEvapotranspiration, Irrigation, Dew/frost - Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets.dAg Data Commonsidataset7nnaso10.15482/USDA.ADC/15263340 tWeighing Lysimeter Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets.dAg Data Commonsidataset7nnaso10.15482/USDA.ADC/15263330 tStandard Weather Data for the Bushland, Texas, Large Weighing Lysimeter Experiments.dAg Data Commonsidataset7nnaso10.15482/USDA.ADC/15263290 tAgronomic Calendars for the Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets.dAg Data Commonsidataset7nnaso10.15482/USDA.ADC/15263310 tThe Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets.dAg Data Commonsidataset7nnaso10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526317  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/11023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001891653Available from publisher's Web site 23datasetzDataset available in Ag Data Commonsuhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526334 23datasetzDataset available in Ag Data Commonsuhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526333 23datasetzDataset available in Ag Data Commonsuhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526329 23datasetzDataset available in Ag Data Commonsuhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526331 23datasetzDataset available in Ag Data Commonsuhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526317  a20070724b20070802c00000000  aINDdTHW  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01798naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164100002100173245003900194300001600233500002500249520060900274650001100883650001700894650001800911650001300929650000900942653001600951653002700967700002500994700001901019773010101038852000901139856011201148856008301260930003301343946001101376961001301387655001201400IND8900825920221120194435.0890202s1988    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND890082592DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.27404402032doi7 a10113/430352hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aR3001 aLyon, Cameron K.10aValue of mesquite leaves as forage  ap. 111-117.  aIncludes references.  aThe nutritive value of six species or cultivars of mesquite (Prosopis) was investigated: viz P alba, P articulata, P chilensis, P nigra, P velutina, and cv 'Ruby'.

The processing waste consisted of fiber, cuticle, and shive fragments generated during the commercial cleaning of retted flax bast fibers. These waste materials were added at 1, 3, or 5 wt% levels to polymer formulations containing either 10% or 20% molar excess acid. The solids were randomly mixed with the polymer and cured at 125˚C. Tensile properties of the resulting biocomposites were determined by ASTM D 3039/D 3039M. Biocomposites formulated with 20% excess acid showed an increase in Young's modulus from 1.44 MPa to 8.56 MPa and ultimate load from 4.50 N to 8.77 N with 5 wt% added solids compared to control specimens. The percent strain values for these samples showed a corresponding decrease as the level of added solids increased. 3aretting 3asolids 3apolyesters 3aglycerol 3amechanical properties 3aadipic acid 3acomposite polymers 3aprocessing waste 3ageotextiles 3aflax 0anonfood plant products0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2009 July, v.  6, no.  3 p.272-2777nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/445563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/154404709031194943Available from publisher's Web site  a20101025b20101108c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/10/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072001700131100002300148245008100171300001600252500002400268520077300292650002001065650002401085650002301109650001801132700001801150773012401168852000901292856011201301930003301413945002501446946001301471961001301484655001201497IND4450450020221118032017.0110308e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445045002DNAL7 a10113/486302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Growth in total factor productivity and intersectoral linkages between the agricultural and processed food sectors are hypothesized as factors explaining this phenomenon. Estimating the neoclassical trade model using an internationally comparable database, we find evidence of (a) Hecksher-Ohlin (factor endowments) and Ricardian-type (technology) effects in agricultural and processed food trade, and (b) transfer of comparative advantage from the primary agricultural sector to the processed food sector. Thus, public policies protecting primary agriculture can adversely affect processed food sectors, while those supporting R&D efforts can bring about dynamic comparative advantage. 3aprocessed foods 3ainternational trade 3aeconometric models 3apublic policy1 aCarver, Jason0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2002 Dec., v.  27, no.  2 p.539-553wJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/486303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110408b20110507c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/04/08  aOther US  aUSDA/FAS 7aarticle03383naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024002100135040001800156072000900174072000900183072000900192100001800201245010300219300001600322500015800338500002400496500001500520520151600535650001402051650002802065650001602093650002302109650001702132650002402149650001702173650002102190650002202211650001902233650002102252650002602273650000902299650002802308653002902336700001402365700001702379700001702396773010802413852000902521856011202530856009302642930003302735945002502768946001102793961001302804655001202817IND4370372320221122031715.0050520e20050415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437037232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2004.10.0292doi7 a10113/393502hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aQ112 0aX1001 aTamplin, M.L.10aModels of the behavior of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in raw sterile ground beef stored at 5 to 46°C  ap. 335-344.  aIn the special issue: Fourth International Conference on Predictive Modelling in Foods / edited by J.

Previous reports describe the behavior of E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef under different storage conditions; however, models are lacking for the pathogen's behavior in raw ground beef stored over a broad range of temperature. Using sterile irradiated raw ground beef, the behavioral kinetics of 10 individual E. coli O157:H7 strains and/or a 5- or 10-strain cocktail were measured at storage temperatures from 5 degrees to 46 degrees C. Growth occurred from 6 to 45 degrees C. Although lag phase duration (LPD) decreased from 10.5 to 45 degrees C, no lag phase was observed at 6, 8, or 10 degrees C. The specific growth rate (SGR) increased from 6 to 42 degrees C then declined up to 45 degrees C. In contrast to these profiles, the maximum population density (MPD) declined with increasing temperature, from approximately 9.7 to 8.2 log cfu/g. Bias (B(f)) and accuracy (A(f)) factors for an E. coli O157:H7 broth-based aerobic growth model (10 to 42 degrees C) applied to the observations in ground beef were 1.05, 2.70, 1.00 and 1.29, 2.87, 1.03, for SGR, LPD and MPD, respectively. New secondary models increased the accuracy of predictions (5 to 45 degrees C), with B(f) and A(f) for SGR, LPD, and MPD of 1.00, 1.06, and 1.00 and 1.14, 1.33, and 1.02, respectively. These new models offer improved tools for designing and implementing food safety systems and assessing the impact of E. coli O157:H7 disease. 3aviability 3abacterial contamination 3aground beef 3afood contamination 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3amodel validation 3afood preservation 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial growth 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aUSDA 3apredictive microbiology 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aPaoli, G.1 aMarmer, B.S.1 aPhillips, J.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 Apr. 15, v.  100, no.  1-3 p.335-344x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2004.10.0293Available from publisher's Web site  a20100315b20100403c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/06/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02735naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176100001900185245008100204300001600285500002400301500001500325520111200340650003001452650001901482650003201501650002401533650002601557650002201583650005201605650001701657650001201674650002001686650001201706653001101718653002801729653002501757700001301782700001601795773011501811852000901926856011201935856008602047930003302133945002502166946001302191961001302204655001202217IND4402384320221121222746.0080304e20080411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440238432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.01.0432doi7 a10113/110202hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF833 0aX3501 aAbraitiene, A.10aNuclear targeting by fragmentation of the Potato spindle tuber viroid genome  ap. 470-475.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aTransient expression of engineered reporter RNAs encoding an intron-containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a Potato virus X-based expression vector previously demonstrated the nuclear targeting capability of the 359 nucleotide Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) RNA genome. To further delimit the putative nuclear-targeting signal, PSTVd subgenomic fragments were embedded within the intron, and recombinant reporter RNAs were inoculated onto Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Appearance of green fluorescence in leaf tissue inoculated with PSTVd-fragment-containing constructs indicated shuttling of the RNA into the nucleus by fragments as short as 80 nucleotides in length. Plant-to-plant variation in the timing of intron removal and subsequent GFP fluorescence was observed; however, earliest and most abundant GFP expression was obtained with constructs containing the conserved hairpin I palindrome structure and embedded upper central conserved region. Our results suggest that this conserved sequence and/or the stem-loop structure it forms is sufficient for import of PSTVd into the nucleus. 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aPotato virus X 3aPotato spindle tuber viroid 3aconserved sequences 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3atransgenic plants 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aRNA splicing 3aintrons 3agenetic vectors 3atobacco 0agenome 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aZhao, Y.1 aHammond, R.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2008 Apr. 11, v.  368, no.  3 p.470-475x1090-21047nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.01.0433Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/03/11  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03076naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002200092024002100114040001800135072000900153072000900162100001600171245017100187300001800358500002400376500002400400500001500424520137300439650001301812650002701825650002501852650001801877650001401895650001801909650002801927650002301955650001601978650002901994650002102023653001702044653001302061653002702074700001902101700002002120700001302140700001602153773007602169852000902245856007202254856011202326930003302438945002502471946001302496961001302509655001202522IND4446958920221120152219.0101229e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444695892DNAL7 a10.1637/60962doi7 a10113/471182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aOkamura, M.10aAntigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin production in chickens immunized with killed Salmonella enteritidis vaccine or experimental subunit vaccines  ap. 1331-1338.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-06  aLymphocyte proliferation and interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-6 levels in serum were measured as indicators of cell-mediated immunity after immunization of chickens with a commercial killed Salmonella enteritidis (SE) vaccine or experimental subunit vaccines of crude protein (CP) extract or the outer membrane protein (OMP). Significantly increased proliferative responses to SE flagella, but not lipopolysaccharide, porin, CP, or OMP, were observed at 1 wk postimmunization in the three vaccination groups. The responses to flagella were specific because flagella-induced proliferation was not seen in chickens immunized with adjuvant alone. Of the three immunization protocols, use of the killed SE vaccine appeared most effective because it induced higher flagella-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation at 1 and 2 wk postvaccination compared with the CP- and OMP-vaccinated groups. Significantly increased IL-2 and IL-6 levels in serum were seen at 1 wk postimmunization in the three vaccination groups compared with adjuvant alone, but there were no differences between the killed vaccine and the subunit vaccines at this time, and the levels of both lymphokines returned to baseline at 2 wk postimmunization. We conclude that cell-mediated immunity to SE after vaccination with the killed bacterial vaccine or subunit vaccines is transient and mainly limited to flagella. 3achickens 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3ainactivated vaccines 3ainterleukin-2 3aflagellum 3ainterleukin-6 3aouter membrane proteins 3abacterial antigens 3avaccination 3alymphocyte proliferation 3asubunit vaccines 0ainterleukins 0avaccines 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aLillehoj, H.S.1 aRaybourne, R.B.1 aBabu, U.1 aHeckert, R.0 tAvian diseases.g2003 Oct., v.  47, no.  4 p.1331-1338x1938-43517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/60963Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/471183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2011/01/12  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01940naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001800140245006600158300001600224500002500240520106100265650000801326650001601334650001501350650001401365773006901379852000901448856011201457930003301569946001101602961001301613655001201626IND9304836120221118050337.0930813s1993    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND930483612DNAL7 a10113/341802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1001 aInglett, G.E.10aAmylodextrins containing beta-glucan from oat flours and bran  ap. 133-136.  aIncludes references.  aAmylodextrins with soluble beta-glucan contents as high as 10% were prepared from milled oat flours and bran. The level of enzymatic conversion was measured by high performance liquid chromatography and gel permeation chromatography. The large molecular weight amylodextrin fragments containing the beta-glucan from low level amylolytic conversions were measured by gel permeation chromatography. The different elution times of the two separate enzyme conversion mixture components suggest different modes of enzyme actions. Lower molecular weight fractions are produced by the action of Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase in contrast to the action of B. stearothermophilus alpha-amylase, due possibly to dissimilar enzyme dosages.

Based on the results of these analyses, we formally describe two novel species (Fusarium vorosii and Fusarium gerlachii) within the Fusarium graminearum species complex (Fg complex), and provide the first published report of Fg complex isolates with either a nivalenol or 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol chemotype within the U.S. In addition, we describe a highly divergent population of F. graminearum from the Gulf Coast of the U.S., and divergent isolates of F. acaciae-mearnsii from Australia and South Africa. 3achemotypes 3aphylogeny 3awheat 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenes 3anivalenol 3amolecular systematics 3ascab diseases 3aTriticum aestivum 3anew species 3anew geographic records 3apathogenicity 3afungal anatomy 3amicrobial genetics 3aFusarium 3aloci 3ageographical variation 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 2aFusariumxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aToxins, Biologicalxchemistry 2aTrichothecenesxchemistry 2aTriticumxmicrobiology 3aUnited States 3aAustralia 3aSouth Africa 0ataxonomy 0amolecular sequence data 0amycotoxins 0aFusarium graminearum species complex 0atrichothecenes1 aWard, T.J.1 aAoki, T.1 aGale, L.R.1 aKistler, H.C.1 aGeiser, D.M.1 aSuga, H.1 aTóth, B.1 aVarga, J.1 aO'Donnell, K.0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2007 Nov., v.  44, no.  11 p.1191-1204x1087-18457nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/275933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2007.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090402b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03235naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164072000900173100001400182245012300196300001400319500002400333500001500357520156500372650002301937650002001960650002701980650001002007650001202017650001102029650002602040650001802066650001702084650003702101650002002138650001502158651001102173653002002184653000802204653002002212653001602232700001902248700001902267700001702286700001702303773006302320852000902383856011202392856008302504930003302587945001302620946001102633961001302644655001202657IND2330348020221119140659.0030110s2002    ne |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND233034802DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10199438055142doi7 a10113/123012hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aR3001 aHicks, C.10aGenetic analysis of feed quality and seed weight of sorghum inbred lines and hybrids using analytical methods and NIRS  ap. 31-40.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aEight lines of grain sorghum and their F1hybrids were evaluated for contents of crude protein (CP), fat (FAT), and starch(STA); protein digestibility (PD); and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD).The effect of seed weight (SW) on these traits and the potential use of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict them also were investigated. The male lines included three normal-seeded lines (TX2737, TX435, and P954063) and two large-seeded lines (PL-1 and Eastin1). The female lines included common U.S. seed parent lines (Wheatland, Redlan, andSA3042). The lines and their hybrids were grown under dry land conditions at Kansas State University experiment fields in Ashland and Belleville, Kansas, in 1999.The experiments were conducted using a randomized complete block design with four replications at each location. The effect of genotype was significant for all measured traits. The male parent lines were highly variable and expressed high levels of genetic variation in combining ability for CP, PD, STA, and SW. The female parents were genetically more uniform; however, significant general combining ability effects were noted for PD and SW. Significant negative correlations were noted between CP and STA and between SW and STA. Significant positive correlations were found between CP and SW and between FAT and IVDMD. Crude protein content was predicted accurately by NIRS. Fat content and IVDMD could not be predicted by NIRS. The NIRS equations based on ground samples were more accurate than those based on whole-seed samples. 3adigestible protein 3adietary protein 3ain vitro digestibility 3afeeds 3ahybrids 3astarch 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3acrude protein 3ainbred lines 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aSorghum bicolor 3aprediction 3aKansas 0anutritive value 0afat 0aprotein content 0aseed weight1 aTuinstra, M.R.1 aPedersen, J.F.1 aDowell, F.E.1 aKofoid, K.D.0 tEuphytica.g2002, v.  127, no.  1 p.31-40x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10199438055143Available from publisher's Web site  a20110706b20110805c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03330naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100002300203245009500226300001600321500002400337500002200361520175300383650001902136650002202155650001002177650002402187650001502211650001302226650002202239650001902261650001702280650002402297650001902321650001202340651001302352700001802365700001702383700002302400773007602423852000902499856011202508856008602620930003302706945002502739946001102764961001302775655001202788IND4433115320221122061553.0100221e20041213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443311532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2004.08.0072doi7 a10113/393392hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aF900 0aP010 0aL5001 aTracy, Benjamin F.10aEffects of plant diversity on invasion of weed species in experimental pasture communities  ap. 543-550.  aIncludes references  aSummary in German  aStudies have shown that weed invasion into grasslands may be suppressed if the resident plant community is sufficiently diverse. The objective of this study was to determine whether increased forage plant diversity in grazed pasture communities might be associated with reduced weed abundance both in the aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank. Data were collected from a pasture experiment established in 1994 in Missouri, USA. The experiment consisted of 15 m×15 m plots sown with Festuca arundinacea Schreb. or Bromus inermis Leysser as a base species in mixtures of 1, 2, 3, 6, or 8 forage species. The plots were grazed by cattle during each growing season from 1998 to 2002. Aboveground plant species composition in each plot was measured using a point step method. Soil cores were collected in 1999 and 2002, and the species composition of germinable weed seeds in plots were evaluated by identifying seedlings as they germinated over an 8-week period. Species diversity was measured using several indices: species richness (S), Shannon–Wiener diversity index (H′), and forage species evenness (J). Aboveground weed abundance in plots was unrelated to forage species richness (S), but weed abundance declined as the evenness (J) of resident forage species increased in mixtures. The species composition of mixtures may have affected weed abundance. Weeds both in the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation were less abundant in mixtures that contained F. arundinacea compared with mixtures that contained B. inermis. Although variables like forage plant productivity may also suppress weed abundance in pastures, our results suggest that maintaining an evenly distributed mixture of forage species may help suppress weeds as well. 3apasture plants 3aspecies diversity 3aweeds 3aecological invasion 3agrasslands 3apastures 3aplant communities 3aforage grasses 3aburied seeds 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aBromus inermis 3agrazing 3aMissouri1 aRenne, Ian J.1 aGerrish, Jim1 aSanderson, Matt A.0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2004 Dec. 13, v.  5, no.  6 p.543-5507nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393393Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2004.08.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100315b20100403c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/03/15  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02465naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149072000900158100001600167245008000183300001200263500002400275500001500299520091200314650002301226650001901249650002201268650002301290650002401313650001901337650003101356650001401387650001501401650002001416650001801436650001901454653003201473653001501505700001701520700001601537700001401553700001301567773013801580852000901718856011201727930003301839945002501872946001301897961001301910655001201923IND4425454620221120180224.0090903s2008    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND442545462DNAL7 a10113/357622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aW000 0aP210 0aJ2001 aYates, S.R.10aReducing Field-Scale Emissions of 1,3-D with Sequential Surface Irrigations  ap. 1-7.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA field experiment was conducted to measure subsurface movement and volatilization of the 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) after shank injection to an agricultural soil. Aerodynamic, integrated horizontal flux and theoretical profile shape methods were used to obtain fumigant flux density and cumulative emission values. The volatilization rate was measured continuously for 16 days and the range in the daily peak volatilization rates for the three methods ranged from 18 to 60 µg m-2 s-1. The total 1,3-D mass that volatilized to the atmosphere was approximately 44-68 kg ha-1, or 10-15% of the applied active ingredient. This represents approximately 30-50% of the total emissions observed in recent field and field-plot studies. Significant reductions in volatilization of 1,3-D are possible when repeated surface irrigations are applied to a field shortly after fumigation and continuing for several days. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil injection 3apollution control 3asurface irrigation 3a1,3-dichloropropene 3avolatilization 3avolatile organic compounds 3afumigants 3asoil water 3asoil fumigation 3agas emissions 3amethyl bromide 0amethyl bromide alternatives 0apesticides1 aKnuteson, J.1 aErnst, F.F.1 aZheng, W.1 aWang, Q.0 tAnnual International Research Conference on Methyl Bromide Alternatives and Emissions Reductions : [proceedings].g2008,  p.1-77nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/357623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091118b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/11/17  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03119naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100001800131245014000149300001600289500002400305520169200329650002202021650001602043650001202059650001302071650001802084650001502102650001402117650002302131650001402154650002102168650002502189650002602214653001102240653001402251700001702265700001802282773006502300852000902365856011202374856009302486930003302579945001302612946001102625961001302636655001202649IND2330318020221118002109.0030108s2002    ne |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND233031802DNAL7 a10113/143692hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRayburn, A.L.10aMitotic analysis of sticky chromosomes in aluminum tolerant and susceptible wheat lines grown in soils of differing aluminum saturation  ap. 193-199.  aIncludes references  aAluminum toxicity of acid soils is an important growth limiting factor which can reduce crop yields. Breeders have used various screening techniques for the rapid selection of Al tolerance lines. Al toxicity is complex having multiple effects on plant growth. The question becomes can plant selection for tolerance at one specific Al saturation result in tolerance at multiple aluminum saturation levels. Six near-isolines and three wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars differing in aluminum response on the basis of Al exclusion in the root cell wall were used in this study. Seeds of each line were planted in three soil treatments, 0.5%, 27% and 65% aluminum saturation respectively. Mitotic analysis was carried out on root tip cells. Soils with aluminum saturation were seen to induce sticky chromosome damage in both tolerant and susceptible lines. Lagging chromosomes, chromosome fragments and anaphase bridges were seen in cells of root tips grown in soils with increased aluminum saturation. The number of cells in susceptible lines exhibited an increase in stickiness as the aluminum saturation of the soil increased. In tolerant lines, the number of cells with stickiness increased at 27% saturation, but then decreased at 65% aluminum saturation. The amount of chromosome stickiness appears to be not only dependent upon the plant response to phytotoxic Al but also the aluminum saturation level at which the plant is grown. Tolerance as measured by reduced chromosomal stickiness did not occur until the plants were grown in very high soil Al saturation, indicating a single selection scheme for Al tolerance may not be adequate to develop the highest degree of tolerance. 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromosomes 3amitosis 3aaluminum 3aphytotoxicity 3acrop yield 3ascreening 3aselection criteria 3aroot tips 3aapplication rate 3aartificial selection 3abiological resistance 0agrowth 0atolerance1 aWetzel, J.B.1 aBaligar, V.C.0 tEuphytica.g2002, v.  127, no.  2 p.193-199x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0014-2336/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01544naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001800149245006900167300001400236500002400250500001500274520032300289650003000612650002700642650002000669650002000689650002700709650002000736653003000756653002700786700001800813700001500831773007300846852000900919856011200928930003301040945002501073946001101098961001301109655001201122IND4402759420221118094708.0080314s2002    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440275942DNAL7 a10113/116642hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF7001 aMercadier, G.10aFirst report of the fungal entomopathogen Paecilomyces in Norway  ap. 71-73.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aA search for natural enemies of the codling moth, Cydiapomonella L., was conducted in Norway in an attempt to find potential biological control agents.

Eighteen primiparous, crossbred beef cows (BW = 411 ± 24 kg; BCS = 5.25) were offered Foxtail millet hay at 1.68% of BW daily and either a low-fat control (n = 9) or a high-linoleate (79% 18:2n-6), cracked safflower seed supplement (n = 9). Diets were isonitrogenous and isocaloric, and the linoleate diet contained 5.4% of DMI as fat. At slaughter (37 ± 3 d postpartum), mammary tissue was sampled and immediately frozen in liquid N₂ before being stored at -80°C. Milk samples were obtained from the same mammary glands and immediately centrifuged at 1,200 x g to pellet somatic cells. A ribonuclease protection assay was used to quantify the mRNA in the mammary gland and milk somatic cells. Effects of diet, tissue, or their interaction were not observed for ACC (P = 0.28, 0.89, and 0.35, respectively), FAS (P = 0.38, 0.66, and 0.20, respectively), LPL (P = 0.09, 0.15, and 0.43, respectively), or SCD (P = 0.45, 0.19, and 0.29, respectively). Dietary effects on fatty acid profile of the milk fat suggested that linoleate supplementation might have decreased de novo lipogenesis while increasing uptake of dietary fatty acids; this effect was consistent with a trend toward greater LPL mRNA for linoleate-fed cows (P = 0.09). Correlations (r values) between mammary tissue and milk somatic cell data for each mRNA for the low-fat control diet were: ACC, 0.76 (P = 0.02); FAS, 0.69 (P = 0.04); LPL, 0.68 (P = 0.04); and SCD, 0.73 (P = 0.05), and for the linoleate diet were: ACC, 0.85 (P = 0.003); FAS, 0.75 (P = 0.02); LPL, 0.90 (P = 0.001); and SCD, 0.73 (P = 0.03). We conclude that milk somatic cells obtained from lactating beef cows can be used as a source of RNA to study nutritional regulation of mammary gland lipogenesis in cows fed dietary fat supplements. 3abeef cows 3alipogenesis 3amammary glands 3amessenger RNA 3amilk 3asomatic cells 3alactation 3afeed supplements 3acow feeding 3alinoleic acid 3asafflower seed 3amilk fat 3alipid composition 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3afatty-acid synthase 3alipoprotein lipase 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3adietary fat 3aquantitative analysis 3anutrient uptake 2aAcetyl-CoA Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCarthamus tinctoriusxmetabolism 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aFatty Acid Synthasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLinoleic Acidxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLipogenesis 2aLipoprotein Lipasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmetabolism 2aMilkxcytology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeeds 2aStearoyl-CoA Desaturasexgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aHess, B.W.1 aScholljegerdes, E.J.1 aEngle, T.E.1 aHossner, K.L.1 aMoss, G.E.1 aRule, D.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2006 Sept., v.  84, no.  9 p.2399-2405dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2005-6773Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071206b20080102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/12  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03202naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024001900133040001800152072000900170072000900179100001500188245010000203300001800303500002400321500001500345520122700360650002201587650001001609650002301619650001201642650001501654650001101669650001401680650001701694650000901711650001401720650002401734650002401758650001701782650001101799650002301810650001201833650002101845653002001866653002601886653002201912653002701934653001901961653003101980653001702011700001302028700001502041700001702056700001802073700001802091700001602109773009602125852000902221856011002230856009202340930003302432945002502465946001302490961001302503655001202516IND4392029420221117222827.0070601e20060904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439202942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2006.02.0222doi7 a10113/2462hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aX3001 aDien, B.S.10aEnzymatic saccharification of hot-water pretreated corn fiber for production of monosaccharides  ap. 1137-1144.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aCorn fiber, currently produced at wet milling facilities, is readily available as a potential feedstock for production of fermentable sugars. Destarched corn fiber (DSCF) can be conveniently prepared for enzymatic saccharification by treating with liquid hot-water. Treating DSCF with hot-water (HW-DSCF) at 160 °C for 20 min dissolved 58% of the solids and 75% of the xylan. Preparations of hydrolytic enzymes were next used to saccharify the cellulose and xylan. The needed enzymes were prepared from culture supernatants of Trichoderma reesei Rut C30 and Aspergillus niger NRRL 2001, each grown on HW-DSCF. The harvested cultures were found to have a broad range of carbohydrase activities. The enzyme profiles varied considerably from one another and the preparations were determined to be most effective for saccharifying HW-DSCF when used in combination. Monosaccharide sugar yields obtained using the blended preparations were 74 and 54% of the available arabinose and xylose, respectively. Arabinose and xylose yields were both further increased to 80% by increasing the hot-water pretreatment time to 30 min and adding a commercial preparation of β-glucosidase, which also contained β-xylosidase side-activity. 3aAspergillus niger 3axylan 3amilling byproducts 3aglucose 3acellulases 3axylose 3aarabinose 3aplant fibers 3acorn 3acellulose 3ahot water treatment 3aenzymatic treatment 3apretreatment 3ayields 3aTrichoderma reesei 3abiomass 3asaccharification 0amonosaccharides 0adestarched corn fiber 0aHypocrea jecorina 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0ahemicellulases 0aenzymatic saccharification 0aglycosidases1 aLi, X.L.1 aIten, L.B.1 aJordan, D.B.1 aNichols, N.N.1 aO'Bryan, P.J.1 aCotta, M.A.0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2006 Sept. 4, v.  39, no.  5 p.1137-1144x0141-02297nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/2463Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2006.02.0223Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070604b20070702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/06/04  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03711naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100002000203245009700223300001600320500002400336520208400360650001402444650001802458650002302476650001902499650002402518650002402542650001302566650000802579650002102587650002302608650002302631650002102654650002202675650001802697651000902715653002302724700002502747773010802772852000902880856011202889856008603001930003303087945002503120946001103145961001303156655001203169IND4414334320221118191721.0090102e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441433432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2008.11.0032doi7 a10113/268452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF130 0aL100 0aW000 0aJ8001 aOwens, Lloyd B.10aRunoff quality evaluations of continuous and rotational over-wintering systems for beef cows  ap. 482-490.  aIncludes references  aOver-wintering cattle out of doors can be detrimental to the areas that cattle occupy and cause increased runoff, sediment loss, and nutrient transport. Two systems of over-wintering cattle were evaluated for their environmental impacts over a 12-year period, November 1974-October 1986. In one system, beef cows were moved on 6-7 day intervals among four pastures during the summer growing season (May-October), rotated through hayed areas to eat fall regrowth, and rotated through these areas to feed on the hay made in those areas. In another system, cows were rotated weekly during summer and then fed hay in one winter area during the dormant season (November-April). Vegetative cover in the continuous wintering area frequently decreased to less than 50% by late winter/early spring while it remained at or near 100% in the rotational system. Monthly runoff averages were greater from the continuous wintering system than the rotational wintering system in 9 out of 12 months (annual runoff of 120.4 and 37.5mm, respectively). Sediment loss was also greater from the continuous system than the rotational wintering system (2.68 and 0.24Mgha⁻¹ annual averages, respectively). Surface runoff losses of N were greater during the dormant season (13.2 and 6.7kgNha⁻¹ annual averages for the continuous and rotational wintering systems, respectively) than the growing season (4.6 and 1.3kgNha⁻¹ annual averages, respectively). Runoff, sediment, and N losses were less with this rotational wintering system than with the continuous occupancy wintering system, but the animal occupancy rate was also much greater in the continuous system compared with the rotational system (1497 and 1860cowdaysha⁻¹ compared with 528 and 576cowdaysha⁻¹). Although a direct comparison cannot be made between these two systems because of differences in vegetation, stocking rate, and fertilization, the rotational wintering system that was evaluated appears to be sustainable. However, more land area per cow was necessary than with the continuous wintering system that was evaluated. 3abeef cows 3aoverwintering 3arotational grazing 3aanimal housing 3aagricultural runoff 3anutrient management 3aregrowth 3ahay 3avegetation cover 3agrazing management 3asediment transport 3anitrogen content 3agrazing intensity 3astocking rate 3aOhio 0acontinuous grazing1 aShipitalo, Martin J.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 Feb., v.  129, no.  4 p.482-490dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/268453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.11.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03401naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100001400200245012600214300001400340500002400354500001500378520140000393650001401793650001201807650001501819650002001834650001201854650004301866650003501909650002101944650002801965650001301993650002502006650002402031650001302055650001902068650002502087650002202112650002602134650002102160650002102181650003102202653003402233653002202267653002002289700001802309700001902327700001302346700001902359773006302378852000902441856011202450856008302562930003302645945002502678946001102703961001302714655001202727IND4361497520221119140607.0040305s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436149752DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10230501269012doi7 a10113/123042hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aX100 0aF4001 aRiday, H.10aComparisons of genetic and morphological distance with heterosis between Medicago sativa subsp. sativa and subsp. falcata  ap. 37-45.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aBiomass yield heterosis has been shown to exist between Medicago sativasubsp. sativa and Medica gosativa subsp. falcata. The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of what morphological and genetic factors were most highly correlated with total biomass yield heterosis. We calculated genetic distances among nine sativa and five falcate genotypes based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) DNA markers. Genetic distance did not correlate with specific combining ability (SCA) or mid-parent heterosis. In contrast, a morphological distance matrix based on seventeen agronomic and forage quality traits was significantly correlated with heterosis; the agronomic traits of maturity, midseason regrowth, and autumn regrowth showed strong association with heterosis. Heterosis was also correlated with subspecies. We suggest that in many cases progeny heterosis can be accounted for by the interaction of genes controlling morphologically divergent traits between the parents. In other cases, progeny heterosis could also be due to divergence between the parents at particular genetic loci that do not control field-level phenotypic differences. Genetic distanceper se between parental genotypes, based on neutral molecular markers, however, does not reflect the potential of individual genotypes to produce heterosis in their progeny. 3aheterosis 3aalfalfa 3acrop yield 3agenetic markers 3ahybrids 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aMedicago sativa subsp. falcata 3agenetic distance 3adry matter accumulation 3agenotype 3agenetic polymorphism 3amathematical models 3aregrowth 3aforage quality 3astatistical analysis 3aDNA fragmentation 3achromosome morphology 3aagronomic traits 3aplant morphology 3aspecific combining ability 0aMedicago sativa subsp. sativa 0amolecular markers 0aMedicago sativa1 aBrummer, E.C.1 aCampbell, T.A.1 aLuth, D.1 aCazcarro, P.M.0 tEuphytica.g2003, v.  131, no.  1 p.37-45x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10230501269013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/03/10  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03911naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024001900125024002000144040001800164072000900182072000900191072000900200100001800209245009100227300001600318500002400334500001500358520147100373650002901844650002701873650002601900650003001926650003101956650001501987650002302002650001902025650002002044650002302064650003402087650001202121650003402133650004002167650003102207650001102238650002902249650001802278650001802296650002002314650002402334650002002358650003002378650003102408650003202439650003502471650003502506650000902541650002902550650004702579650003202626650003002658650002702688653002802715653002302743653001902766773005902785852000902844856011102853856008302964930003303047945002503080946001103105961001303116655001203129IND4395739920221121015818.0071004e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439573992DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10209240284502doi7 a124845332pmid7 a10113/43032hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL200 0aL0011 aHandler, A.M.10aProspects for using genetic transformation for improved SIT and new biocontrol methods  ap. 137-149.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe genetic manipulation of non-drosophilid insect species is possible by the creation of recombinant DNA constructs that can be integrated into host genomes by several transposon-based vector systems. This technology will allow the development and testing of a variety of systems that can improve existing biological control methods, and the development of new highly efficient methods. For programs such as sterile insect technique (SIT), transgenic strains may include fluorescent protein marker genes for detection of released insects, and conditional gene expression systems that will result in male sterility and female lethality for genetic sexing. Conditional expression systems include the yeast GAL4 system and the bacterial Tet-off and Tet-on systems that can, respectively, negatively or positively regulate expression of genes for lethality or sterility depending on a dietary source of tetracycline. Importantly, strains for male sterility must also incorporate an effective system for genetic sexing, since typically, surviving females would remain fertile. Models for the use of these expression systems and associated genetic material come from studies in Drosophila and, while many of these systems should be transferable to other insects, continued research will be necessary in insects of interest to clone genes, optimize germ-line transformation, and perform vector stability studies and risk assessment for their release as transgenic strains. 3asterile insect technique 3agenetic transformation 3atranscription factors 3agreen fluorescent protein 3atranscriptional activation 3abiomarkers 3atransgenic animals 3areporter genes 3agenetic vectors 3abiological control 2aAnimal Identification Systems 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aDNA, Recombinantxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aGenes, Insect 2aGenes, Lethal 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGenetic Engineering 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aInfertility, Malexgenetics 2aInsectaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aMale 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethodsxtrends. 2aSex Determination Processes 2aSex Preselectionxmethods 2aTranscription, Genetic 0ared fluorescent protein 0aliterature reviews 0ainsect control0 tGenetica.g2002 Sept., v.  116, no.  1 p.137-1497nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/43033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10209240284503Available from publisher's Web site  a20071010b20071102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/10/09  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02474naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149072000900158072000900167100001900176245013100195300001600326500002400342500001500366520101100381650001801392650002701410650002501437650002201462650002201484650002601506650001301532650001201545651002601557651002601583653002001609653002001629700001901649700002001668773007601688852000901764856011201773930003301885945002501918946001301943961001201956655001201968IND4444476620221120172716.0101101e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444447662DNAL7 a10113/471082hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP300 0aD500 0aK001 0aP000 0aE5501 aWhite, Eric M.10aSocioeconomic changes and forestland development: commonalities and distinctions between the eastern and western United States  ap. 329-337.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aImpacts of rural land development on natural resources in the United States have been well documented and research on rural land development provides important inputs to land conservation policy and program development.

To provide context for natural resource and land conservation programs and policies, we quantify recent and long-term changes in population and housing, rural development rates, and land-use transitions involving forests for the eastern and western regions. Relative to the West, the East has a more evenly distributed population and has experienced greater population increases, rates of land development, and forestland conversion.

Association mapping on germplasm collections is now being used as an additional approach for the discovery and validation of major genes/QTLs. In this study, a collection of 164 elite durum wheat accessions suitable for association mapping has been tested for leaf rust response at the seedling stage and under field conditions (adult plant stage). Seedling tests were carried out with 25 selected isolates from durum wheat, bread wheat and triticale, while field experiments were carried out in artificially inoculated plots in Italy and in Mexico. The collection has been profiled with 225 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci of known map position and a PCR assay targeting Ppd-A1. Associations showing highly consistent experiment-wise significances across leaf rust isolates and field trials were mainly detected for the 7BL distal chromosome (chr.) region (harbouring Lr14 from cultivar Llareta INIA and QLr.ubo-7B.2 from cultivar Creso) and for two chr. regions located in chrs. 2A and 2B. Additionally, isolate-specific associations and/or associations with smaller effects in the field trials were identified in most of the chromosomes. The chr. 7BL distal region was investigated in detail through haplotyping with 15 SSR markers, revealing that the Creso and Llareta INIA alleles are identical by descent at 6 adjacent SSR loci in the most distal 7BL region spanning 8 cM. Association mapping allowed us to further refine the map location of the Lr14/QLr.ubo-7B.2 resistance gene to the most distal region of the linkage group, tagged by Xcfa2257.2, Xgwm344.2 and Xwmc10. The resistant haplotype is present in a number of accessions (ca. 15% of the accessions included in the collection) from the Italian, CIMMYT and ICARDA breeding programmes. Therefore, this chr. 7BL region can be considered as the most important source of resistance to leaf rust currently exploited by durum breeders in the Mediterranean areas. Furthermore, the field trials at the adult plant stage allowed us to identify marker associations (e.g. chrs. 2BL and 3BS, proximal regions; chr. 7BS, distal region) which suggest the presence of minor QTLs for slow-rusting resistance. 3aPuccinia recondita 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aalleles 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3afield experimentation 3agermplasm conservation 3aleaf rust 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amajor genes 3amature plants 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant breeding 3aplant-incorporated protectants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseedlings 3atriticale 3awheat flour 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 3aMexico1 aSanguineti, Maria C.1 aMantovani, Paola1 aDemontis, Andrea1 aMassi, Andrea1 aAmmar, Karim1 aKolmer, James A.1 aCzembor, Jerzy H.1 aEzrati, Smadar1 aTuberosa, R.q(Roberto)0 tMolecular breeding.g2010 Aug., v. 26, no. 2 p.189-228dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/543723Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-009-9353-0  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/111149_115_Pub_JAK_Log_254712_Durum_WLR_Assoc_map.pdf  aUSDA 7aarticle03179naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001700148245008800165300001600253500002400269520149200293650001801785650001601803650001201819650002601831650002301857650002301880650001801903650003801921650002801959650001901987650003002006653001702036653002302053653002602076653002602102653002702128653002502155653001902180700002002199700001502219773009702234852000902331856011102340856010202451930003302553945002502586946001302611961001302624655001202637IND4369004120221123004912.0050415s2005    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436900412DNAL7 a10113/17162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aF8501 aChun, D.T.W.10aMicrobial activity of stored cotton bales with ambient and moderate moisture levels  ap. 283-291.  aIncludes references  aStudies on moisture augmentation of cotton bales have shown that excessive amounts of water lead to a reduction in fiber quality. To identify an acceptable range of cotton bale moistures that could be used for moisture restoration without degrading fiber quality during long-term bale storage, cotton was treated with moderate amounts of supplementary moisture and examined after storage for 1 yr (6 mo under ambient warehouse conditions and then 6 mo under processing room conditions). The target moisture contents were 10, 8, and 6%, and a non-treated control bale. The actual initial moisture contents were 9.5, 8.0, 5.4, and 5.0%, respectively. When the bales were opened for sampling, the control and low-level moisture treatment bales gained moisture, while the two high-level moisture treatment bales lost moisture. The bale moisture content tended to equilibrate to between 6 and 7% during storage, so bales treated with higher moisture would most likely be delivered a lower weight bale to the end user. Except for a small color grade change and increase in the short fiber index at the highest moisture treatment, cotton dust potential and fiber quality, especially with regard to color grade, reflectance or yellowness, from the different treatments were not significantly different. Lower viable microbial populations were observed with increasing moisture content, but this did not appear to have any practical significance based on the lack of differences in fiber quality. 3awater content 3alint cotton 3astorage 3aprocessing technology 3amicrobial activity 3apopulation density 3afiber quality 3aadvanced fiber information system 3ahigh volume instruments 3adust emissions 3astored product protection 0abale storage 0amoisture treatment 0asupplemetary moisture 0abale moisture content 0aambient moisture level 0amicrobial population 0adust potential1 aMcAlister, D.D.1 aCobb, D.R.0 tJournal of cotton science.g2005, v.  9, no.  1 p.283-291wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/17163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.cotton.org/journal/2005-09/1/upload/jcs09-024.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070801b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/04/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03503naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002700193245023100220300001600451500002400467500001500491520176000506650002702266650002302293650001302316650002202329650002802351650001502379650002202394650002502416650002002441653003902461653002402500653004002524700001802564700002202582773010302604852000902707856008502716856011202801930003302913945002502946946001102971961001502982655001202997IND4415177420221120225215.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441517742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-008-9542-02doi7 a10113/231372hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP000 0aL200 0aL7001 aPiaggio, Antoinette J.10aIntraspecific comparison of population structure, genetic diversity, and dispersal among three subspecies of Townsend's big-eared bats, Corynorhinus townsendii townsendii, C. t. pallescens, and the endangered C. t. virginianus  ap. 143-159.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aTownsend's big-eared bat, Corynorhinus townsendii, is distributed broadly across western North America and in two isolated, endangered populations in central and eastern United States. There are five subspecies of C. townsendii; C. t. pallescens, C. t. australis, C. t. townsendii, C. t. ingens, and C. t. virginianus with varying degrees of concern over the conservation status of each. The aim of this study was to use mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA data to examine genetic diversity, population differentiation, and dispersal of three C. townsendii subspecies. C. t. virginianus is found in isolated populations in the eastern United States and was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1979. Concern also exists about declining populations of two western subspecies, C. t. pallescens and C. t. townsendii. Using a comparative approach, estimates of the genetic diversity within populations of the endangered subspecies, C. t. virginianus, were found to be significantly lower than within populations of the two western subspecies. Further, both classes of molecular markers revealed significant differentiation among regional populations of C. t. virginianus with most genetic diversity distributed among populations. Genetic diversity was not significantly different between C. t. townsendii and C. t. pallescens. Some populations of C. t. townsendii are not genetically differentiated from populations of C. t. pallescens in areas of sympatry. For the western subspecies gene flow appears to occur primarily through male dispersal. Finally, geographic regions representing significantly differentiated and genetically unique populations of C. townsendii virginianus are recognized as distinct evolutionary significant units. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aendangered species 3ataxonomy 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation distribution 3aChiroptera 3agenetic variation 3apopulation structure 3agenetic markers 0aCorynorhinus townsendii pallescens 0awildlife management 0aCorynorhinus townsendii virginianus1 aNavo, Kirk W.1 aStihler, Craig W.0 tConservation genetics.g2009 Feb., v.  10, no.  1 p.143-159dSpringer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-008-9542-03Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231373Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090202b20090301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/02/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03862naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001500150245010700165300001800272500002400290520149200314650001501806650001701821650001701838650001401855650001201869650001301881650001201894650001501906650001401921650001401935650001801949650002101967650002201988650001402010650001702024650001602041650001202057650002902069650001902098650001102117650004002128650003402168650002102202650001902223650003802242650001102280650002602291650003402317650002102351650005202372650002702424650004302451650003602494650002202530650002902552650001402581650002402595650002102619650004502640650002102685650002502706653001502731700001502746700001602761773008602777852000902863856011202872930003302984945001303017946001303030961001303043655001203056IND2328659820221119193221.0020823e200206  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232865982DNAL7 a121464732pmid7 a10113/130342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoff, J.P.10aEffect of mastectomy on milk fever, energy, and vitamins A, E, and beta-carotene status at parturition  ap. 1427-1436.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to compare blood profiles of intact and mastectomized periparturient cows to discriminate those metabolic changes associated with the act of parturition from the metabolic changes caused by lactation. Mastectomized and intact cows had similar increases in plasma estrogens and cortisol concentrations around the time of calving. Mastectomy eliminated hypocalcemia and the rise in 9,13-di-cis retinoic acid observed in intact cows. Mastectomy reduced but did not eliminate decreases in plasma phosphorus, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene associated with parturition in intact cows, suggesting the mammary gland is not the sole factor affecting plasma concentrations of these compounds. Dry matter intake was similar in both groups before calving. The day of calving, dry matter intake was lower in intact cows than in mastectomized cows, but after calving the mastectomized cows exhibited a pronounced decline in feed intake. Plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations rose rapidly in intact cows at calving and did not return to baseline level for > 10 d. In contrast, NEFA concentrations in mastectomized cow plasma rose moderately at calving and returned to baseline level 1 to 2 d after calving. This study provides evidence that hypocalcemia in the cow is solely a result of the calcium drain of lactation. The act of parturition affects blood phosphorus, dry matter intake, and NEFA concentration independent of the effect of lactation. 3adairy cows 3ablood plasma 3aprogesterone 3aestradiol 3aestrone 3acortisol 3acalcium 3aphosphorus 3amagnesium 3avitamin A 3abeta-carotene 3aprepartum period 3apostpartum period 3alactation 3ablood lipids 3afatty acids 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCalciumxblood 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxbloodxmetabolism. 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aEstradiolxblood 2aEstronexblood 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aLactationxbloodxmetabolism. 2aMagnesiumxblood 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMastectomyxveterinary 2aParturient Paresisxbloodxmetabolism. 2aParturitionxbloodxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorusxblood 2aPostpartum Periodxblood 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexblood 2aVitamin Axblood 2aVitamin Dxanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aVitamin Exblood 2abeta Carotenexblood 0amastectomy1 aKimura, K.1 aHorst, R.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 June, v.  85, no.  6 p.1427-1436x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/130343Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080412b20080502c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02832naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001700149245008000166300001600246500002400262500001500286520130000301650002101601650002701622650002801649650002301677650002701700650002101727650001001748650002501758650001801783650002201801650001101823650001501834650001401849650002201863653001901885653002701904653002201931700001501953700002101968700001401989773008402003852000902087856011202096930003302208945002502241946001102266961001302277655001202290IND4404170420221120035308.0080410s2007    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440417042DNAL7 a10113/136122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aQ2031 aCarson, J.A.10aInternal and external carriage of inoculated Salmonella in broiler chickens  ap. 952-954.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aExternal and internal persistence of inoculated Salmonella and spread to uninoculated broiler chicks in the same pens were studied by sampling ceca and rinses of feathered carcasses in two experiments. Half of the day-old chicks in pens were orally inoculated with a nalidixic-acid-resistant strain of Salmonella Typhimurium at three levels of inoculum (0.1 mL delivering approximately 4 x 10², 10⁴, or 10⁶ cfu). At 3, 6, and 8 weeks of age, equal numbers of inoculated and non-inoculated pen mates were individually electrocuted and rinsed in 400 mL of diluent, after which ceca were removed aseptically, with a total of 654 chickens sampled in the two experiments. There were no differences in Salmonella incidence between inoculated and non-inoculated birds at any age, so the marker Salmonella was well distributed within pens. Total incidence was 70%, 86%, and 83% at the 10², 10⁴, and 10⁶ inoculum levels, respectively. Considering both cecal and rinse samples, incidence was 81%, 84%, and 72% at 3, 6, and 8 weeks of age respectively. There were 95 positives in the cecal samples only, 149 positives in the rinses only, and 277 positives in both ceca and rinse samples, so sampling either ceca or carcass rinses alone underestimated the total incidence of the marker Salmonella. 3abroiler chickens 3abacterial colonization 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3ainoculum density 3acecum 3adisease transmission 3asalmonellosis 3achicken carcasses 3achicks 3aanimal age 3ainfection 3adisease incidence 0aoral infection 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0ainternal carriage1 aBuhr, R.J.1 aRichardson, L.J.1 aCox, N.A.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2007, v.  6, no.  12 p.952-9547nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/136123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/04/21  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02731naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143024002100162040001800183072000900201100001900210245006600229500002400295500001500319506007600334520105800410506003701468650001801505650001101523650002401534650002001558650002401578653001301602653002001615653002301635700002401658700002201682700002201704700002401726700001901750700002101769700001901790700001901809773007901828852000901907856011201916856007902028930003302107945002502140946001102165961001302176655001202189IND4447129320221207080822.0110103s2011    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444712932DNAL7 a10.1155/2011/7685422doi7 aPMC30044132pmcid7 a211970952pmid7 a10113/471132hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aWaters, W.

There is a rich history of codiscovery in the development of control measures applicable to both human and bovine tuberculosis (TB) including skin-testing procedures, M. bovis BCG vaccination, and interferon-γ release assays. The calf TB infection model offers several opportunities to further our understanding of TB immunopathogenesis. Recent observations include correlation of central memory immune responses with TB vaccine efficacy, association of SIRPα+ cells in ESAT-6:CFP10-elicited multinucleate giant cell formation, early γδ T cell responses to TB, antimycobacterial activity of memory CD4+ T cells via granulysin production, association of specific antibody with antigen burden, and suppression of innate immune gene expression in infected animals. Partnerships teaming researchers with veterinary and medical perspectives will continue to provide mutual benefit to TB research in man and animals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3acattle 3abovine tuberculosis 3aimmune response 3aMycobacterium bovis 0aimmunity 0acattle diseases 0aliterature reviews1 aPalmer, Mitchell V.1 aThacker, Tyler C.1 aDavis, William C.1 aSreevatsan, Srinand1 aCoussens, Paul1 aMeade, Kieran G.1 aHope, Jayne C.1 aEstes, D.

By measuring the shift in the resonant frequency and the change in the cavity transmission characteristics when a peanut is inserted into the cavity, it is possible to obtain the moisture content of the kernel independent of its mass and apparently independent of peanut type, as far as Runner and Virginia market types are concerned. It is also possible to determine the kernel mass independent of kernel shape simultaneously with the moisture determination. Moisture contents in the range from 4 to 14%, wet basis, were determined with an uncertainty of 0.9% moisture, and the uncertainty in the mass determination was less than 0.05 g. 3amathematical models 3apeanuts 3aseeds 3awater content 3ameasurement 0amethodology 0amicrowave dryers1 aNelson, S.O.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1993 , v.  36, no.  1 p.127-134x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/341773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04635naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024002000141040001800161072000900179072000900188072000900197072000900206100001600215245008800231300001800319500002400337520252900361650001002890650001502900650002002915650001702935650001302952650001102965650002102976650002002997650000903017650001703026650001803043650001603061650001803077650001903095650002403114650002003138650001403158650001603172650004703188650001203235650002103247650002603268650000903294650002003303650003703323650003003360650002903390700001803419700001503437700001703452700001903469773014103488852000903629856008003638856011103718930003303829945002503862946001303887961001303900655001203913IND4382414620221116214443.0060730e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438241462DNAL7 a168648872pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2005-2922doi7 a10113/73622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL800 0aL100 0aQ5021 aGuzik, A.C.10aDietary tryptophan effects on plasma and salivary cortisol and meat quality in pigs  ap. 2251-2259.  aIncludes references  aFour experiments were conducted to determine the effects of supplemental Trp on meat quality, plasma and salivary cortisol, and plasma lactate. Experiment 1 was a preliminary study to measure plasma cortisol concentrations in 4 barrows (50 kg of BW) that were snared for 30 s at time 0 min. Pigs were bled at -60, -30, -15, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. Plasma cortisol was near maximum 10 min after the pigs were snared. In Exp. 2, 20 barrows (50 kg of BW) were allotted to a basal corn-soybean meal diet or the basal diet with 0.5% supplemental L-Trp for 5 d. After the 5-d feeding period, pigs were snared for 30 s and bled at -10, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after snaring. Pigs fed the diet with supplemental Trp had a lower (P < 0.01) mean plasma cortisol than pigs fed the basal diet. Plasma lactate also was decreased (P < 0.07) by supplemental Trp. In Exp. 3, the same pigs and treatments were used as in Exp. 2, but 5 pigs were snared and 15 pigs adjacent to those being snared were bled to determine if pigs are stressed when they are adjacent to pigs being snared. For pigs adjacent to snared pigs, the area under the curve (P < 0.06) and mean for plasma cortisol was lower (P < 0.01) in pigs fed Trp relative to those fed the basal diet. In Exp. 4, 90 barrows (initial BW of 106 kg) were allotted to 6 treatments in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement. Three diets with Trp (basal diet, basal supplemented with 0.5% Trp for 5 d, or pigs fed the basal diet with a 0.1 g/kg of BW Trp bolus given 2 h before slaughter) were combined with 2 handling methods (minimal and normal handling). Dressing percent, 24-h pH, and 24-h temperature were reduced in the minimally handled pigs (P < 0.10) compared with the normally handled pigs. Pigs fed Trp in the diet relative to those fed the basal diet had increased 45-min temperature, Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) values, and drip and total losses (P < 0.10). Tryptophan in bolus form decreased 45-min pH in the minimally handled pigs but increased 45-min pH in the normally handled pigs (handling x Trp bolus interaction, P = 0.08). Tryptophan in the diet increased CIE lightness (L*) in minimally handled pigs but decreased CIE L* in the normally handled pigs (handling x Trp diet interaction, P = 06). No other response variables were affected by handling method or Trp. Results indicate that Trp decreases plasma cortisol but has no positive effect on meat quality. 3aswine 3atryptophan 3ablood chemistry 3ablood plasma 3acortisol 3asaliva 3afeed supplements 3anutrient intake 3apork 3ameat quality 3aswine feeding 3alactic acid 3aanimal stress 3aanimal welfare 3adressing percentage 3aanimal handling 3afinishing 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDietxveterinary 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aSalivaxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aSwinexbloodxphysiology. 2aTryptophanxpharmacology1 aMatthews, Jo.1 aKerr, B.J.1 aBidner, T.D.1 aSouthern, L.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2006 Aug., v.  84, no.  8 p.2251-2259dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2005-2923Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071206b20080102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03178naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001700140245009900157300001600256500002400272500002400296500001500320520179800335650002802133650003802161650001602199650002002215650002202235650002302257650002002280651001102300653001902311700001602330700001402346773008702360852000902447856011202456856008002568930003302648945002502681946001302706961001302719655001202732IND4365641320221121130417.0041118e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436564132DNAL7 a10113/110022hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF1301 aGanskopp, D.10aLivestock forage conditioning: bluebunch wheatgrass Idaho fescue, and bottlebrush squirreltail  ap. 384-392.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-04  aResearch on Anderson and Scherzinger's hypothesis that spring cattle grazing can positively affect subsequent nutritional characteristics of grasses have generated mixed results. Our objectives were: 1) to evaluate fall/winter nutritional indices of bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum [Pursh] Scribn. & Smith), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer), and bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix (Nutt.) Smith) in ungrazed, lightly grazed (33% utilization), or heavily grazed (69% utilization) pastures stocked with cattle at the boot stage of growth; and 2) to quantify opportunity costs of applying those treatments on fall standing crop. Compared with ungrazed stands, light and heavy spring grazing decreased September standing crop by 32 and 67%, respectively. September/December crude protein (CP) among heavily grazed grasses (average = 6.9%) exceeded ungrazed controls (average = 3.9%) for 11 of 12 comparisons. Crude protein of lightly grazed grasses (average = 5.2%) was higher than ungrazed controls for 6 of 12 comparisons. Herbage was more nutritious during the drier of the 2 years sampled. Among grazed treatments, fall/winter CP measures were highest for bottlebrush squirreltail (average = 7.4%), intermediate for Idaho fescue (5.9%), and lowest for bluebunch wheatgrass (average = 4.9%). In fall/winter, herbage was most digestible in heavily grazed paddocks (average = 59%), intermediate in lightly grazed paddocks (average = 53%), and least digestible in ungrazed areas (average = 49%). Light and heavy spring cattle grazing can augment fall/winter forage quality of bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and bottlebrush squirreltail. Spring grazing reduces subsequent standing crop, but remaining forage will be nutritionally superior to herbage in ungrazed stands. 3aPseudoroegneria spicata 3aElymus elymoides subsp. elymoides 3abeef cattle 3anutritive value 3agrazing intensity 3aFestuca idahoensis 3aprotein content 3aOregon 0aforage quality1 aSvejcar, T.1 aVavra, M.0 tJournal of range management.g2004 July, v.  57, no.  4 p.384-392x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://uvalde.tamu.edu/jrm/jrmhome.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/12/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03838naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002000120040001800140072001700158100001500175245014900190300001400339500002400353520251700377650003702894650003002931650003302961650002102994650000903015650000903024700001703033700001903050773008903069852000903158856007803167856011103245930003303356945002503389946001303414961001303427655001203440IND4369208220221116193559.0050423e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436920822DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-00712doi7 a10113/15022hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBock, C.H.10aEffect of simulated wind-driven rain on duration and distance of dispersal of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri from canker-infected citrus trees  ap. 71-80.  aIncludes references  aDynamics of dispersal of the bacteria that causes citrus canker (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri) were assessed in simulated wind-driven rain splash. The wind/rain-splash events were simulated using electric blowers to generate turbulent wind (15 to 20 m s(-1)) and sprayer nozzles to produce water droplets entrained in the wind flow. The splash was blown at an inoculum source of canker-infected trees 1 m downwind. The splash downwind of the source of the infected trees was collected by vertical panel samplers and funnel samplers. The duration over which bacteria were dispersed in spray was assessed in continuous wind at intervals from 0 to 52 h after commencing the simulated rain splash event. In one experiment on 11 February 2003, a total of 1.48 x 10(6) bacteria were collected by panels 1 m downwind from the inoculum source during the first 10 min of dispersal, but the numbers declined to 3.60 x 10(5) bacteria after 1 h and ranged between 1.42 x 10(5) and 1.93 x 10(4) up to 52 h. In a more detailed study (15 July 2003) of dispersal duration over 4 h, the greatest quantity of bacteria collected by panel samplers were dispersed in the first 5-min period (1.01 x 10(8) bacteria collected). By 10 min after initiation of dispersal, approximately one-third (3.09 x 10(7) bacteria collected) of the initial number was being dispersed, and by the end of the first hour, only one-tenth (1.31 x 10(7) bacteria collected) of the initial quantity was dispersed. Funnel samplers placed at ground level under the trees showed a similar trend. The distance to which bacteria were dispersed in wind-blown splash was also tested under simulated conditions: on 18 September 2003, bacteria were collected by panel samplers at all distances sampled (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 m) with the greatest number of bacteria deposited at 1 m (4.93 x 10(6) bacteria collected), while 2.22 x 10(3) bacteria were deposited over a 10-min period 12 m from the inoculum source. Wind speed declined from 19.5 m s(-1) upwind of the trees to 2.8 m s(-1) 1 m downwind, and by 4 m downwind from the inoculum source, movement was similar to the surrounding air. The data on duration and distance of dispersal were best described by power law regression models compared to exponential models. Citrus canker is readily dispersed in wind-driven rain and is dispersed in large quantities immediately after the stimulus occurs, upon which wind-driven splash can disperse inoculum over a prolonged period and over a substantial distance. 3aXanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3abacterial diseases of plants 3acankers (plants) 3awind 3arain1 aParker, P.E.1 aGottwald, T.R.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Jan., v.  89, no.  1 p.71-80wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-00713Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/15023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle05155naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001500139245005500154300001600209500002400225520381500249650001604064650001304080650001304093650001904106650002704125650001704152650003304169650001904202700001704221700001504238700001804253700001604271700001804287700001504305773006304320852000904383856011104392856011004503930003304613945002504646946001304671961001304684655001204697IND4382650920221116213326.0060808s2006    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND438265092DNAL7 a10113/73632hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aStacey, G.10aSoyCAP: Roadmap for Soybean Translational Genomics  ap. 255-260.  aIncludes references  aSoybean is the most valuable legume crop, with numerous nutritional and industrial uses due to its unique chemical composition. Recently, a group of legume specialists voted soybean as the 'representative species' of the phaseoloid legumes, the group that contains most legume crop species. Elucidating the genome sequence of soybean was chosen as the top priority. Through a series of past workshops and discussions, the soybean community developed and refined a cogent plan for soybean genomics. Many of the preliminary goals identified have already been accomplished. Thus, soybean is well positioned as a key model for translational genomics. With this in mind and with funding from the USDA National Research Initiative, a SoyCAP planning conference was held in St. Louis, MO, from December 16-17, 2004. A largely elected steering committee organized the meeting, which was attended by 30 soybean experts, as well as observers representing industry, commodity groups and the USDA. Attendance at the conference was purposely slanted toward soybean breeders, since it is this group that will ultimately develop improved soybean germplasm, aided by genomic tools and information. Over a two-day period, with much give and take, the following three objectives, in order, were chosen as representing the most critical needs, as well as the areas to which translational genomics could be effectively applied: I. Biotic Stress: Efforts should be mounted to develop breeder-friendly molecular markers to identify QTL regions encoding resistance to a variety of soybean diseases and pests. A special focus should be placed on developing markers to aid breeders in developing soybean germplasm with decreased susceptibility to Asian soybean rust. Finally, transgenic approaches should be considered to develop soybean germplasm resistant to priority pathogens and pests, especially in those cases where genetic resistance has proved elusive. II. Seed composition: Breeder-friendly molecular markers also should be developed towards seed target traits, in order to increase seed protein quality and quantity, without reducing seed yield or oil. Given the growing importance of biodiesel and the importance of oil quality in nutrition, efforts should be made to develop markers to allow breeders to engineer soybean with optimal oil composition. Finally, since soybean farmers are paid based on soybean seed yield, there is a need to broaden the soybean genetic base and foster technological innovations for sustainable yield improvements.III. Abiotic stress: Environmental stress is among the leading causes of soybean yield reduction. Drought, iron limitation, heat and cold stress, and flooding were identified as key areas in need of additional research with the goal of developing breeder-based tools for soybean improvement. Among these, increased drought tolerance was chosen as the top priority for soybean improvement through translational genomics. In addition to these research priorities, participants at the SoyCAP planning conference also set priorities with regard to information transfer, outreach, education and extension. Perhaps most notable, the participants called for the development of a novel, Webbased "Soybean Breeder's Toolbox". This resource in envisioned as an interactive database to deliver genomic and genetic information in a manner targeted for and conducive to breeding and crop improvement strategies. The Toolbox also will play an educational role. Specific timelines were set to achieve the consensus goals identified. A management plan was developed, as well as policies on public release of information and intellectual property. A coordination committee was chosen and charged with preparing a SoyCAP grant proposal following the guidelines set during the planning conference. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3agenomics 3aplant genetics 3atranslation (genetics) 3aplant stress 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aabiotic stress1 aDorrance, A.1 aNguyen, H.1 aPantalone, V.1 aParrott, W.1 aShoemaker, R.1 aSleper, D.0 tSoybean genetics newsletter.g2006, v.  33 p.255-2607nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.soygenetics.org/articleFiles/52soycap%20white%20paper.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/10/04  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03149naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001100158245017300169500010400342500002400446500001500470520160000485650001602085650002102101650002102122650003002143650001802173650004102191650002402232650002802256651000902284653001502293653001302308700001402321700001602335700001702351773009402368852000902462856011202471930003302583945002502616946001302641961001302654655001202667IND4420382520221119034005.0090512s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND442038252DNAL7 a10113/290302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aP210 0aW0001 aDu, B.10aApplication of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to Landscapes with Tiles and Potholes.

The model was calibrated during the period of 1992 to 1995 and validated during the period of 1996 to 1999. In addition, comparisons between the modified version and 2000 version (SWAT2000) of SWAT models were conducted. In assessing overall performance of SWAT models, the center location (site 310) and outlet (site 330) of WCW were selected. Nash-Sutcliffe E values of the simulated monthly flows and NO3-N loads were 0.69 to 0.78 and 0.52 to 0.79, respectively, indicating that SWAT-M reasonably well estimated the monthly flows and NO3-N loads in the large flat landscape of WCW with tile drains and potholes. SWAT-M was capable of simulating daily flow and NO3-N loads but with smaller E values (0.31 to 0.50 and 0.20 to 0.46, respectively), compared to the monthly results. By investigating site 210, which was exclusively selected for the evaluation of subsurface tile drain, it was concluded that the simulated monthly subsurface flows and NO3-N loads( E values ranging from 0.71 to 0.79 and 0.72 to 0.78, respectively) were reasonably well matched to the measured values. Nevertheless, SWAT-M's simulations of daily subsurface flows (E values of 0.09 to 0.18) and NO3-N loads (E values of 0.37 to 0.43) were less accurate than monthly results. SWAT-M estimated daily and monthly flows, NO3-N loads, subsurface tile drains and subsurface tile NO3-N loads better than SWAT2000. 3astream flow 3anitrate nitrogen 3amodel validation 3anonpoint source pollution 3atile drainage 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3asubsurface drainage 3aagricultural watersheds 3aIowa 0awater flow 0apotholes1 aSaleh, A.1 aAmold, J.G.1 aJaynes, D.B.0 tPaper.g2003, , no.  032164aAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineers.x0149-98907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/290303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/05/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03842naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024001900134024002100153040001800174072000900192072000900201100002700210245018000237300001600417500002400433500001500457520123100472650002301703650003501726650001101761650002201772650002101794650003001815650001301845650002001858650003101878650001901909650001901928650002301947650004201970650004702012650002102059650007202080650003802152650004802190650003002238650002902268650003502297650002102332650001402353650003002367650004102397650002702438650002502465653003202490653002702522653003002549653002802579700002102607700001802628700001702646700002302663773010302686852000902789856011202798856009202910930003303002945002503035946001103060961001303071655001203084IND4390212120221122042813.0070408e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439021212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2006.00193.x2doi7 a172337652pmid7 a10113/261002hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aX3501 aDunlap, Christopher A.10aOsmotic shock tolerance and membrane fluidity of cold-adapted Cryptococcus flavescens OH 182.9, previously reported as C. nodaensis, a biocontrol agent of Fusarium head blight  ap. 449-458.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aCryptococcus flavescens (previously reported as C. nodaensis), a biological control agent of Fusarium head blight, has been previously shown to have improved desiccation tolerance after cold adaptation. The goal of the current study was to determine the effect of cold adaptation on the physicochemical properties of C. flavescens that may be responsible for its improved desiccation tolerance. The results show that cold adaptation improves liquid hyperosmotic shock tolerance and alters the temperature dependence of osmotic shock tolerance. Fluorescence anisotropy was used to characterize differences in the membrane fluidity of C. flavescens with and without cold adaptation. Force curves from atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the cell wall spring constant after cold adaptation. Cold adaptation of C. flavescens during culturing was shown to produce smaller cells and produced a trend towards higher CFU yields. These results suggest that cold adaptation significantly alters the membrane properties of C. flavescens and may be an effective method of improving the desiccation tolerance of microorganisms. In addition, we provide information on the correct naming of the isolate as C. flavescens. 3afungal antagonists 3aCryptococcus (Tremellomycetes) 3ablight 3amembrane fluidity 3aosmotic pressure 3afungal diseases of plants 3aFusarium 3adisease control 3aphysicochemical properties 3aultrastructure 3afungal anatomy 3abiological control 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aCell Membranexphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aCold Temperature 2aCryptococcusxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFluorescence Polarization 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTerminology as Topic 0aCryptococcus (Hyphomycetes) 0aCryptococcus nodaensis 0abiological control agents 0aCryptococcus flavescens1 aEvans, Kervin O.1 aTheelen, Bart1 aBoekhout, T.1 aSchisler, David A.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2007 May, v.  7, no.  3 p.449-458dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/261003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2006.00193.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090308b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/03/08  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02983naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024001900110040001800129072000900147072000900156100001300165245012800178300001400306500002400320520098600344650001201330650002001342650002801362650002201390650001301412650001201425650006101437650002101498650003001519650002901549650003601578650001801614650002001632650001101652650000901663650001901672650002901691650002401720650002401744650003001768650006001798650002701858650005201885653002401937653003201961700001501993700001602008700001502024700001102039700001502050773005302065856011002118930003302228945002502261946001302286961001302299852000902312655001202321IND4388123820221117222845.0070221e199701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438812382DNAL7 a90102032pmid7 a10113/1232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL8401 aChae, T.10aMice Lacking p35, a Neuronal Specific Activator of Cdk5, Display Cortical Lamination Defects, Seizures, and Adult Lethality  ap. 29-42.  aIncludes references  aThe adult mammalian cortex is characterized by a distinct laminar structure generated through a well-defined pattern of neuronal migration. Successively generated neurons are layered in an "inside-out" manner to produce six cortical laminae. We demonstrate here that p35, the neuronal-specific activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, plays a key role in proper neuronal migration. Mice lacking p35, and thus p35/cdk5 kinase activity, display severe cortical lamination defects and suffer from sporadic adult lethality and seizures. Histological examination reveals that the mutant mice lack the characteristic laminated structure of the cortex. Neuronal birth-dating experiments indicate a reversed packing order of cortical neurons such that earlier neurons reside in superficial layers and later generated neurons occupy deep layers. The phenotype of p35 mutant mice thus demonstrates that the formation of cortical laminar structure depends on the action of the p35/cdk5 kinase. 3aneurons 3acerebral cortex 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3aenzyme activation 3aseizures 2aAnimals 2aCerebral Cortexxembryologyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinases 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Development 2aGene Deletion 2aGenomic Library 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout 2aMice, Neurologic Mutants 2aNeuronsxphysiology 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSeizuresxgeneticsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 0aneocortical laminae 0acortical lamination defects1 aKwon, Y.T.1 aBronson, R.1 aDikkes, P.1 aLi, E.1 aTsai, L.H.0 tNeuron.g1997 Jan., v.  18, no.  1 p.29-427nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/1233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070607b20070702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/02/23  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100002000158245005000178300001600228500002400244520081700268650002401085650001501109650001901124650002501143650002101168650002601189653005101215700001901266700002201285700001701307700001501324700001601339700001701355700001701372773008901389852000901478856011201487930003301599945002501632946001301657961001301670655001201683IND4437605520221123032629.0100525s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443760552DNAL7 a10113/430202hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aX620 0aP2101 aHaberland, J.A.10aAgIIS, Agricultural Irrigation Imaging System  ap. 247-253.  aIncludes references  aAgIIS (Agricultural Irrigation Imaging System, pronounced Ag Eyes), a ground-based remote sensing system, served as a research tool that generated data for research on remotely sensed canopy level water and nitrogen status indices.

As the cart traveled along the rail and the linear move traveled through the field, the sensing unit collected one square meter area reflectance measurements every meter along the rail. Because the system was automated, the remotely sensed data was acquired with low labor cost compared to traditional handheld radiometers, and provided high temporal and spatial resolution.

Treatments consisted of the nontoxigenic strain in the form of (i) conidia-coated hulled barley applied to soil when corn was about 0.8 m tall, (ii) conidia-coated hulled barley applied in plant whorls prior to tasseling, (iii) multiple applications of a spray formulation of conidia during silking, and (iv) untreated control. Treatments were replicated eight times in individual plots consisting of four rows of 18 m each. In year 1, no significant differences were associated with treatments for aflatoxin, total A. flavus colonization, or incidence of nontoxigenic isolates of A. flavus in corn, which were all relatively high, ranging from 83.8 to 93.1%. In year 2, the whorl application produced a significantly lower mean aflatoxin concentration of 49.5 ppb compared with all other treatments, while both the soil (108.3 ppb) and spray applications (173.7 ppb) were significantly reduced compared with the control (191.6 ppb). The whorl application was the only treatment that had a significantly higher incidence (86.5%) of nontoxigenic isolates of A. flavus than the control had, which was still relatively high at 69.1%. Data indicated that applications of the nontoxigenic strain influenced untreated corn, thus reducing the apparent effect of the biocontrol treatments. Larger-scale studies with greater separation between treated and untreated fields are warranted. 3afungal antagonists 3aplant growth 3aZea mays 3abarley 3aapplication timing 3aconidia 3acoatings 3agrowth and development 3acompetitive exclusion 3atoxigenic strains 3acorn 3aaflatoxins 3acorn soils 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil treatment 3anontoxigenic strains 3aAspergillus flavus 3abiological control 2aAflatoxinsxchemistry 2aAspergillus flavusxphysiology 2aPest Control, Biological 2aZea maysxchemistryxmicrobiology. 0abiological control agents0 tJournal of food protection.g2009 Apr., v.  72, no.  4 p.801-804wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/290313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090518b20090608c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/05/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03377naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092024002100136040001800157100001500175245007100190300001600261500002400277500001500301520192500316650001802241650001402259650001602273650001902289650001402308650001102322650001802333650001102351650001702362651001002379653001502389653001402404653001502418700001702433700001802450700001702468773011102485852000902596856009402605856011202699930003302811945001302844946001302857961001302870655001202883IND2329775020221118002122.0021119e200106  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232977502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2001.tb05499.x2doi7 a10113/143682hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, K.W.10aImpact of a turfgrass system on nutrient loadings to surface water  ap. 629-640.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aTurfgrass systems are one of the most intensively managed land uses in the United States. Establishment and maintenance of high quality turfgrass usually implies substantial inputs of water, nutrients, and pesticides. The focus of this work was to quantify the concentration and loading of a typically maintained municipal turfgrass environment on surface water. Water quantity and quality data were collected from a golf course in Austin, Texas, and analyzed for a 13-month period from March 20, 1998, to April 30, 1999. Twenty-two precipitation events totaling 722 mm, produced an estimated 98 mm of runoff. Nutrient analysis of surface runoff exiting the course exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in median nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen (NO3+NO2-N) concentration compared to runoff entering the course, a statistically significant decrease in ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), but no difference in orthophosphate (PO4-P). During the 13-month period, storm runoff contributed an estimated 2.3 kg/ha of NO3+NO2-N and 0.33 kg/ha of PO4-P to the stream. Storm flow accounted for the attenuation of 0.12 kg/ha of NH4-N. Baseflow nutrient analysis showed a statistically significant increase in median NO3+NO2-N, a significant reduction in NH4-N, and no change in PO4-P. Estimated NO3+NO2-N mass in the baseflow was calculated as 4.7 kg/ha. PO4-P losses were estimated at 0.06 kg/ha, while 0.8 kg/ha of NH4-N were attenuated in baseflow over the study period. Even though nutrient concentrations exiting the system rarely exceeded nutrient screening levels, this turfgrass environment did contribute increased NO3+NO2-N and PO4-P loads to the stream. This emphasizes the need for parallel studies where management intensity, soil, and climate differ from this study and for golf course managers to utilize an integrated management program to protect water quality while maintaining healthy turfgrass systems. 3awater quality 3anutrients 3afertilizers 3alawns and turf 3abase flow 3astorms 3asurface water 3arunoff 3agolf courses 3aTexas 0awater flow 0ahydrology 0astorm flow1 aHarmel, R.D.1 aTorbert, H.A.1 aBalogh, J.C.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2001 June, v.  37, no.  3 p.629-640x1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2001.tb05499.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080512b20080606c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04174naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002100133040001800154072000900172100001300181245013800194300001400332500002400346506007600370520169800446506003702144650001302181650001902194650002102213650002002234650001702254650002002271650001802291650001002309650002802319650001902347650000902366650002402375650001202399650002302411650002202434650006302456650002102519650005102540650002402591650002602615650002502641650002502666650001902691650003402710650000902744650002102753650002702774650003302801650002902834650004202863650004702905650001902952700001802971700001202989700001503001700002103016700001903037700001903056700001203075773008803087852000903175856011203184930003303296945002503329946001303354961001303367655001203380IND4430550920221207133400.0091228e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443055092DNAL7 a159729482pmid7 aPMC16034312pmcid7 a10113/374862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3801 aSong, Ye10aCardiac Metallothionein Synthesis in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mice, and Its Protection against Diabetes-Induced Cardiac Injury  ap. 17-26.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. Metallothionein (MT), a stress-response protein, is significantly increased in the liver and kidney of diabetic animals. We examined whether diabetes also induces cardiac MT synthesis through oxidative damage and whether MT overexpression protects the heart from injury. Diabetes was induced in mice by single injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and cardiac MT mRNA and protein levels were measured 2 weeks and 2 months after STZ treatment. Diabetes significantly increased cardiac MT synthesis 2 weeks and 2 months after STZ treatment, with no change in cardiac metals including zinc, copper, and iron. Serum and cardiac vasopeptide endothelin and inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor- were also significantly increased in diabetic hearts, as were the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione and the immunohistochemical staining of 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxynonenal. To explore the biological importance of increased MT synthesis in the heart, MT-overexpressing transgenic mice were treated with STZ and then examined 2 months later. A loss of inotropic reserve, uncovered during ss-adrenergic stimulation, and the presence of cardiac fibrosis, shown by increased Sirius red staining of collagen, were evident in the wild-type diabetic mice but not in the MT-overexpressing transgenic diabetic mice. These results suggest that diabetes-induced cardiac MT expression likely associates with systemic increases in endothelin-1 and tumor necrosis factor- and the resulting cardiac oxidative stress. Overexpressing cardiac MT significantly protects the heart from diabetes-induced injury.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiabetes 3astreptozotocin 3aoxidative stress 3ametallothionein 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aheart 3acardioprotective effect 3aheart diseases 3amice 2aAldehydesxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Western 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aCopperxanalysis 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxcomplications 2aEndothelin-1xblood 2aGlutathionexanalysis 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aIronxanalysis 2aMetallothioneinxbiosynthesis 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMyocardiumxmetabolism 2aOxidative Stressxphysiology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxanalysis 2aTyrosinexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aZincxanalysis1 aWang, Jianxun1 aLi, Yan1 aDu, Yibai.1 aArteel, Gavin E.1 aSaari, Jack T.1 aKang, Y.

The ability of soil microbial communities to recover after treatment with fumigants was examined using culture-dependent (Biolog) and culture-independent (phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [DGGE] of 16S ribosomal DNA [rDNA] fragments amplified directly from soil DNA) approaches. Changes in soil microbial community structure were examined in a microcosm experiment following the application of methyl bromide (MeBr), methyl isothiocyanate, 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D), and chloropicrin. Variations among Biolog fingerprints showed that the effect of MeBr on heterotrophic microbial activities was most severe in the first week and that thereafter the effects of MeBr and the other fumigants were expressed at much lower levels. The results of PLFA analysis demonstrated a community shift in all treatments to a community dominated by gram-positive bacterial biomass. Different 16S rDNA profiles from fumigated soils were quantified by analyzing the DGGE band patterns. The Shannon-Weaver index of diversity, H, was calculated for each fumigated soil sample. High diversity indices were maintained between the control soil and the fumigant-treated soils, except for MeBr (H decreased from 1.14 to 0.13). After 12 weeks of incubation, H increased to 0.73 in the MeBr-treated samples. Sequence analysis of clones generated from unique bands showed the presence of taxonomically unique clones that had emerged from the MeBr-treated samples and were dominated by clones closely related to Bacillus spp. and Heliothrix oregonensis. Variations in the data were much higher in the Biolog assay than in the PLFA and DGGE assays, suggesting a high sensitivity of PLFA analysis and DGGE in monitoring the effects of fumigants on soil community composition and structure. Our results indicate that MeBr has the greatest impact on soil microbial communities and that 1,3-D has the least impact.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afatty acids 3asoil bacteria 3acommunity structure 3aribosomal DNA 3a1,3-dichloropropene 3aadverse effects 3amethyl isothiocyanate 3achloropicrin 3aspecies diversity 3aenvironmental impact 3anontarget organisms 3amethyl bromide 3asoil fumigation 3aphospholipids 2aAllyl Compoundsxpharmacology 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCulture Media 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxmethods 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aHydrocarbons, Brominatedxpharmacology 2aHydrocarbons, Chlorinatedxpharmacology 2aIsothiocyanatesxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPesticidesxpharmacology 2aPhospholipidsxchemistry 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoil Microbiology 0anontarget effects 0aphospholipid fatty acid analysis 0asoil microorganisms 0acommunity ecology1 aPapiernik, S.K.1 aGan, J.1 aYates, S.R.1 aYang, C.H.1 aCrowley, D.E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2001 July, v.  67, no.  7 p.3245-3257x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.67.7.3245-3257.20013Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080512b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03663naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001800148245013800166500012000304500002400424520215600448650002602604650001302630650001902643650003102662650002302693650003002716650001202746650001902758653002002777653002502797653003602822653002102858700001602879700001202895773009402907852000903001856011103010930003303121945002503154946001303179961001303192655001203205IND4394368520221116204318.0070824s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND439436852DNAL7 a10113/26832hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aH0001 aThomson, S.J.10aPerformance Evaluation of Low Cost GPS and WAAS-Corrected Swathing Systems on Agricultural Aircraft Using Precise Position Triggering  aPaper presented at the 2004 ASAE/CSAE Annual International Meeting, held August 1-4, 2004, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  aIncludes references  aA Satloc GPS-based aircraft guidance system and two stand-alone GPS units were tested for position updating accuracy. The Satloc was tested for suitability in a proposed variable-rate aerial application system and provided baseline information for assessing the stand-alone units. To run the accuracy test, a ground-based mirror system reflected sunlight to the belly of the aircraft, triggering a position event in the Satloc output file to 1/100-s accuracy when a ground-referenced point was passed. The stand-alone units were evaluated for use in georeferencing remote sensing images and for a proposed automatic still-digital camera triggering system. For the stand-alone units, the number of output sentences and method of acquiring data were changed to see the effect on position updating. Tests showed the Satloc to be within 6-m of geographically referenced ground position. The Lowrance Airmap stand-alone unit updated position 1.2- to 2.25-s ahead of the Satloc, but differences seen between different runs did not appear to be related to different output sentence configurations. Position updating was about 0.3-s faster when a video mapping system (VMS) was used as the data acquisition system rather than one using a custom-programmed Palmtop. Updating speed for the Lowrance unit was inconsistent over two days of testing, but position was not appreciably affected by changes in ground speed. A Garmin 76S stand-alone unit was found to update 0.5-s slower than the Lowrance on one day of testing. For the Garmin unit, output position changed linearly with increasing ground speed. Over ground speeds ranging from 38 to 69 m/s, output position changed by 27-m. This 27-m difference was equivalent to about a 0.5-s difference in position updating. The Lowrance Airmap appears to be a more suitable choice for use as a parallel GPS, but it is also designed for use in an airplane. More tests on different days need to be conducted to determine reasons for position updating inconsistencies in the stand-alone units. This will be necessary if either of them is to be used successfully for image georeferencing or automatic camera triggering. 3aagricultural aviation 3aaircraft 3aremote sensing 3aglobal positioning systems 3aaerial application 3avariable rate application 3acameras 3ageoreferencing 0adigital cameras 0avideo mapping system 0aSatloc aircraft guidance system 0aswathing systems1 aSmith, L.A.1 aSui, R.0 tPaper.g2004, , no.  041062aAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineers.x0149-98907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/26833Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/31  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03854naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003000132024002200162024001900184024001100203040001800214100002200232245014500254300001600399506007600415506017300491520170000664506003702364650001902401650003302420650001902453650001702472650001902489650001302508650002502521650001402546650000902560650001202569650001002581650001702591650001002608650003002618650002002648650002602668650001602694650002502710650001402735650001202749650001802761650002202779650001002801773015002811856011202961856004303073956010603116961000903222852000903231655001203240IND50089113320221214224416.0140422e20131108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008911332DNAL7 a2955272aris7 a10113/587122hdl7 a10.1128/AEM.03016-132doi7 aPMC39111072pmcid7 a242125762pmid8 ans4368  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiemer, Cherie J.10aNewly cultured bacteria with broad diversity isolated from eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cow feces on complex polysaccharides  ap. 574-585.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aOne of the functions of the mammalian large intestinal microbiota is the fermentation of plant cell wall components. In ruminant animals, the majority of their nutrients are obtained via pregastric fermentation; however, up to 20% can be recovered from microbial fermentation in the large intestine. Eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cattle feces with cellulose and xylan-pectin were used to isolate bacteria from this community. A total of 459 bacterial isolates were classified phylogenetically using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Six phyla were represented: Firmicutes (51.9%), Bacteroidetes (30.9%), Proteobacteria (11.1%), Actinobacteria (3.5%), Synergistetes (1.5%), and Fusobacteria (1.1%). The majority of bacterial isolates had <98.5% identity to cultured bacteria with sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project and thus represent new species and/or genera. Within the Firmicutes isolates, most were classified in the families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Clostridiaceae I. The majority of the Bacteroidetes were most closely related to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, and B. xylanisolvens and members of the Porphyromonadaceae family. Many of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes isolates were related to species demonstrated to possess enzymes which ferment plant cell wall components; the others were hypothesized to cross-feed these bacteria. The microbial communities that arose in these enrichment cultures had broad bacterial diversity. With over 98% of the isolates not represented as previously cultured, there are new opportunities to study the genomic and metabolic capacities of these members of the complex intestinal microbiota.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroides thetaiotaomicron 3aClostridiaceae 3aFusobacteria 3aProteobacteria 3abacteria 3acell wall components 3acellulose 3acows 3aenzymes 3afeces 3afermentation 3agenes 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alarge intestine 3amicrobial communities 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3anutrients 3apectins 3aribosomal RNA 3aspecies diversity 3axylan0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2013 Nov. 8, v. 80, no. 2 p.574-585dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:jnl7018x0099-22407nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/587123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03016-13  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/295527_Ziemer%202014%20AEM.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006900152245007900221520138200300592002801682650001901710650002001729650002101749650001701770650002601787650001001813650001601823650001801839650001101857650001201868650001001880650001101890650002601901650001801927650001801945650001301963650001101976650001501987650001602002650002402018650001602042653001302058653002802071653002702099653001602126653001802142653002602160773010602186856008702292852000902379655001202388IND60654476820221119190548.0200210e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVladisavljević, Goran T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8894-975X10aPreparation of microemulsions and nanoemulsions by membrane emulsification  aThis paper is an overview of the applications of microporous membranes for preparation of micro/nano- emulsions. Membrane emulsification offers compact devices for preparation of nanoemulsions with low energy consumption, tuneable droplet size, monomodal distribution, and high encapsulation efficiency of entrapped functional components without shear or thermal degradation. The properties and wettability modification of Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) membrane, track-etched polymeric sheets, syringe filters, anodic alumina membrane, and nickel-based superalloy membranes were discussed, as well as the design and operation of membrane devices. Particular emphasis was placed on the effect of formulation, operating parameters, and membrane properties on the resulting droplet size in direct and premix membrane emulsification with the examples of nano-sized emulsions produced using different membranes. The application of microemulsions prepared using synthetic membranes for production of solid self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems for enhanced solubility and oral bioavailability of BSC Class II and III drugs was also reviewed, as well as production of solid nanoparticles such as nanogels, solid lipid nanoparticles, synthetic biodegradable polymer nanoparticles, silica and metal oxide nanoparticles from nanoemulsion templates prepared by membrane emulsification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3abioavailability 3abiodegradability 3adroplet size 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aemulsifying 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3afilters 3aglass 3alipids 3amicroporous membranes 3ananoemulsions 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3asilica 3asolubility 3asuperalloys 3athermal degradation 3awettability 0aMembrane 0aMicroemulsion formation 0aNanoemulsion formation 0aSurfactants 0aNanoparticles 0aDrug delivery systems0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Oct. 20, v. 579 p.123709-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013800177300001400315520137400329592002801703650001501731650002101746650001501767650001401782650001101796773010501807856008601912990002301998852000902021655001202030IND60113215620221117082157.0141111e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011321562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieniasz, Lesław K.10aAutomatic solution of integral equations pertinent to diffusion with first order homogeneous reactions at cylindrical wire electrodes  ap. 38-47.  aThe application of the integral equation method to the modelling of controlled-potential transient experiments at cylindrical wire or fibre electrodes under conditions of diffusion coupled with (pseudo-) first order homogeneous reactions, was not attempted thus far. One of the reasons is the lack of simple closed-form formulae for the relevant integral transformation kernels. The algorithm presented in this work allows one to compute accurately (at least 13–15 significant digits) moment integrals of the kernel that most frequently occurs in such cases. It is assumed that the cylinder length to radius ratio is very large. The algorithm is combined with the recently developed adaptive Huber method for solving electrochemical integral equations. The resulting method is tested on example integral equations, including the equations of cyclic voltammetry for the catalytic mechanism, for which no former simulation reports have been available. The method provides automatic solutions with an accuracy that can be effectively achieved by choosing an appropriate value of the error tolerance parameter. Errors as small as 10⁻⁶ (relative to the maximum solution value) or even smaller, are obtainable, at a moderate computational cost. In this way, a variety of integral equations pertinent to cylindrical wire electrodes can now be solved easily and reliably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aequations 3amodels0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2012 June 1, v. 674 p.38-47dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.04.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008900169300001600258520130300274592002801577650001501605650000901620650001101629650001101640650002101651650001701672650001601689650001201705700001901717700001701736700001801753773008601771856008601857852000901943655001201952IND60084889620221119131136.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008488962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalacios, E.10aExperimental analysis of solar thermal storage in a water tank with open side inlets  ap. 401-412.  aThis paper investigates thermal mixing caused by the inflow from one or two round, horizontal, buoyant jets in a water storage tank, which is part of a thermal solar installation. A set of experiments was carried out in a rectangular tank with a capacity of 0.3m³, with one or two constant temperature inflows. As a result, two correlations based on temperature measurements have been developed. One of the correlations predicts the size of a zone of homogenous temperature, referred to herein as the mixing zone, which develops when a single hot inflow impinges on the opposite wall of the tank. The other identifies the degree of mixing resulting from the interaction between a hot inflow and a cold inflow located below the hot one. The correlations are combined with energy balances to predict the amount of hot water available in a tank with open side inlets and the corresponding temperatures of the outflows. Outdoor measurements were also performed in a solar installation, in which a commercial water storage tank with a 1.5m³ capacity, heated by a solar collector array with a useful surface area of 42.2m², drives a LiBr–H₂O absorption chiller. Comparison of the predicted and measured outflow temperatures under a variety of weather conditions shows a maximum difference of 3°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acold 3aenergy 3amixing 3asolar collectors 3asurface area 3atemperature 3aweather1 aAdmiraal, D.M.1 aMarcos, J.D.1 aIzquierdo, M.0 tApplied energy.g2012 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.401-412dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001600271520137900287592002801666650002001694650001101714650001801725650001501743650002001758650002201778653002301800653002201823653002801845653001601873700002001889700001701909773010801926856008202034852000902116655001202125IND60577004220221118001450.0190405e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057700422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2017.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan, Shumaila12aA comparative study of flow properties of basmati and non-basmati rice flour from two different mills  ap. 165-172.  aThe flowability of basmati and non-basmati rice flour from stone and super mill was compared. On comparing, both basmati and non-basmati rice flour from stone mill was found poor flowable. However, non-basmati flour was less flowable than basmati flour. Particle size (stone mill (StM) 114.1–129.6 μm, super mill (SM) 196.4–239.5 μm) of both the flours was significantly different. The flowability of basmati and non-basmati rice flour was significantly affected by properties viz., for non-basmati flour: the particle shape circularity (StM 0.562, SM 0.642), surface roughness (StM 146.36 nm, SM 111.28 nm) and compressibility (StM 26.08%, SM 24.22%), making it less flowable than basmati flour: particle shape circularity (StM 0.661, SM 0.768), surface roughness (StM 122.21 nm, SM 90.67 nm) and compressibility (StM 21.02%, SM 17.18%). Basic flow energy, stability index and specific energy was significantly higher in non-basmati flour, thus required more energy (StM 184.37 mJ, SM 113.15 mJ) to flow than basmati rice flour (StM 151.25 mJ, SM 96.74 mJ). Overall, the flowability was analyzed at three different pressures (3,6 and 9 kPa) and the non-basmati rice flour from stone mill was found less flowable as indicated by the flow function coefficient (1.90 at 3 kPa) in comparison to basmati (2.61 at 3 kPa) creating difficulty in bulk handling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompressibility 3aenergy 3aparticle size 3arice flour 3aspecific energy 3asurface roughness 0aBasmati rice flour 0aSurface roughness 0aParticle size and shape 0aFlowability1 aGhoroi, Chinmay1 aSaxena, D.C.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2017 July, v. 76 p.165-172dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245020200186300001600388520140400404592002801808650002101836650002401857650002901881650001701910650001301927650001401940650001801954650001501972650001301987650003102000650002202031650001602053650003502069650002402104650001102128650005602139650002602195650002902221650004202250650001602292700002202308700002102330700002002351700002502371773010402396856004802500852000902548655001202557IND4472079720221120045327.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447207972DNAL7 a219900022pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-011-0253-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnakpoya, Igho J.14aThe efficacy of long-term conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation on body composition in overweight and obese individuals: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials  ap. 127-134.  aINTRODUCTION: Numerous supplements containing conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) are presently being promoted for body weight reduction. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the evidence for or against the long-term efficacy of CLA. METHODS: Electronic searches were conducted to identify relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs). No restrictions in age, time, or language were imposed. Studies had to be at least 6 months in duration. Three reviewers independently determined the eligibility of studies. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the reporting quality of all RCTs. RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs were identified, and seven were included. Four of the included RCTs had serious flaws in the reporting of their methodology. A meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in weight loss favouring CLA over placebo (mean difference: −0.70 kg; 95% confidence interval: −1.09, −0.32). Our meta-analysis also revealed a small significant difference in fat loss favouring CLA over placebo (MD: −1.33 kg; 95% CI: −1.79, −0.86; I 2 = 54%). The magnitude of these effects is small, and the clinical relevance is uncertain. Adverse events included constipation, diarrhea, and soft stools. CONCLUSION: The evidence from RCTs does not convincingly show that CLA intake generates any clinically relevant effects on body composition on the long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody composition 3aconfidence interval 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aconstipation 3adiarrhea 3alanguages 3ameta-analysis 3aoverweight 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review 3aweight loss 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aDietary Supplements 2aHumans 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxadministration & dosage 2aObesityxdrug therapy 2aOverweightxdrug therapy 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 2aWeight Loss1 aPosadzki, Paul P.1 aWatson, Leala K.1 aDavies, Lucy A.1 aErnst, E.q(Edzard),0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2012 Mar., v. 51, no. 2 p.127-134dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-011-0253-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245009800169300001600267520152700283592002801810650001601838650002201854650001201876650001001888650001701898650001101915650000901926650001101935650001501946650002601961650001301987650002102000653002002021653001602041653002002057653001302077653002102090700001702111700001802128700005802146700001402204700001302218773009002231856009002321852000902411655001202420IND60634565820221119075520.0200210e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063456582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Min10aPredicting the survival of zebrafish larvae exposed to fluctuating pulses of lead and cadmium  ap. 599-607.  aAquatic organisms are often exposed to time-varied concentrations of contaminants due to pulsed inputs in natural water. Traditional toxicology experiments are usually carried out in a constant exposure pattern, which is inconsistent with the actual environment. In this study, a refined toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) model was used to study the toxic effects of Pb and Cd on zebrafish larvae under three pulse exposures with 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively. The parameter sensitivity analysis showed that JM, ₘₐₓ had the greatest impact on the output of the model. Cd or Pb pulse exposure resulted in less death than constant exposure at the same time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations. Survival fraction in larvae under 6 h interval between two pulses of Pb or Cd was larger than that under 2 h and 4 h interval. Toxicity under constant exposure of Cd or Pb was greater than that under 2, 4, and 6 h interval pulse exposure because the cumulative Cd or Pb concentration in the body under constant exposure was greater than that under pulse exposure. The results also showed that the stochastic death (SD) model was more suitable than the individual tolerance (IT) model for predicting the survival fraction of larvae under pulse exposure to Pb and Cd, which was indicated by higher R² (0.670–0.940) in SD model than that (0.588–0.861) in IT model. Our model provides approaches for laboratory toxicity testing and modeling approaches for addressing the toxicity of heavy metal pulsed exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aaquatic organisms 3acadmium 3adeath 3aheavy metals 3alarvae 3alead 3amodels 3aprediction 3atime-weighted average 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 0aPulsed exposure 0aTK-TD model 0aBioaccumulation 0aSurvival 0aZebrafish larvae1 aGao, Yongfei1 aBian, Xiaoxue1 aFeng, Jianfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4003-94581 aMa, Weiqi1 aZhu, Lin0 tChemosphere.g2019 May, v. 223 p.599-607dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001700092024002100109024002500130024001100155040001800166100001900184245006900203300001500272506017300287520146100460650001201921650002501933650002301958650001501981650001801996650001202014650000902026650001102035650001502046650001502061650001902076650001202095650001702107650002002124650001502144650002502159650001802184650002202202700001802224773008702242856011202329856003802441956008602479961000902565852000902574655001202583IND4459279320221214224049.0131105s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445927932DNAL7 a2697012aris7 a10113/580022hdl7 a10.1071/RJ110062doi8 ans3506  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Joel R.12aA site-based approach to delivering rangeland ecosystem services  ap. 99-108.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aRangeland ecosystems are capable of providing an array of ecosystem services important to the wellbeing of society. Some of these services (e.g. meat, fibre) are transported to markets and their quantity, quality and value are established via a set of widely accepted standards. Other services (e.g. climate mitigation, water quality, wildlife habitat) do not leave the land, but are, in fact, most valuable when they remain in situ. Determining their quantity, quality and value presents a challenge that must be met if there is to be a credible, accessible ecosystem services market for rangelands. In this paper we describe some of the ecosystem services that may be extracted from rangelands, discuss their unique ecological nature and relate those unique ecological properties to soil and vegetation attributes that can serve as a basis for measurement, both quality and quantity. We suggest the use of a soil/vegetation-based system in which similar climate, geomorphology and edaphic properties are grouped into ecological sites based on their response to disturbance. Within each ecological site, a unique state and transition model describes the dynamics of vegetation and soil surface properties, provides state indicators (vegetation structure, soil properties), predicts ecosystem services that may be derived at multiple scales, and organizes information related to management to achieve ecosystem service objectives, including sustainability. 3aclimate 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ageomorphology 3amarkets 3ameat 3amodels 3aprediction 3arangelands 3arisk reduction 3asociety 3asoil ecology 3asoil properties 3avegetation 3avegetation structure 3awater quality 3awildlife habitats1 aMacLeod, Neil0 tRangeland journal.g2011, v. 33, no. 2 p.99-108dCSIRO Publishingx1036-98727nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/580023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ11006  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/11-011.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010000168300001600268520102900284592002801313650000801341650002201349650003501371650001601406650001701422650002101439650001501460653002801475653002401503653002201527653001501549700001401564700001401578700001701592700001501609773009201624856008501716852000901801655001201810IND60603251820221120213413.0180713e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060325182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Haiyan10aLabel-free nucleic acids detection based on DNA templated silver nanoclusters fluorescent probe  ap. 163-168.  aBased on DNA templated Ag NCs (DNA/Ag NCs) fluorescent probe, a label-free fluorescent method was developed for the detection of clinical significant DNA fragments from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA. Firstly, a hairpin probe, containing target DNA recognition sequence and guanine-rich sequence, was designed to hybridize with the target DNA and form a blunt 3′-terminus DNA duplex. Then, exonuclease III (Exo III) was employed to stepwise hydrolyze the mononucleotides from formed blunt 3′-terminus DNA duplex, releasing the target DNA and guanine-rich sequence. Finally, DNA/Ag NCs fluorescent probe was introduced to hybridize with the guanine-rich sequence, leading to an enhanced fluorescence signal for detection. The proposed method could detect as low as 2.9×10⁻¹⁰molL⁻¹ HIV-1 DNA and exhibited excellent selectivity against mismatched target DNA. Furthermore, the method possessed perfect recoveries in cells lysate and human serum, showing potential to be used in biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3ablood serum 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ananosilver 0aNucleic acids detection 0aSilver nanoclusters 0aFluorescent probe 0aLabel-free1 aWang, Lei1 aZhu, Jing1 aWei, Haiping1 aJiang, Wei0 tTalanta.g2015 June 01, v. 138 p.163-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245007100170300001400241500001500255520167900270592002801949650001601977650003701993650000902030650001502039650001302054650000902067650001402076650003002090650001902120650001302139650001902152650001402171653001902185653002102204653001502225653001802240653004902258653001102307653001902318700001802337700002102355700001402376700002002390700001802410773007502428856008902503852000902592655001202601IND60545440020221119200343.0160902e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054544002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.03.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yifei10aDechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls by iron and its oxides  ap. 78-86.  a2019-12-06  aThe decomposition efficiency of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was determined using elemental iron (Fe) and three iron (hydr)oxides, i.e., α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and α-FeOOH, as catalysts. The experiments were performed using four distinct PCB congeners (PCB-209, PCB-153, and the coplanar PCB-167 and PCB-77) at temperatures ranging from 180°C to 380°C and under an inert, oxidizing or reducing atmosphere composed of N2, N2+O2, or N2+H2. From these three options N2 showed to provide the best reaction atmosphere. Among the iron compounds tested, Fe3O4 showed the highest activity for decomposing PCBs. The decomposition efficiencies of PCB-209, PCB-167, PCB-153, and PCB-77 by Fe3O4 in an N2 atmosphere at 230°C were 88.5%, 82.5%, 69.9%, and 66.4%, respectively. Other inorganic chlorine (Cl) products which were measured by the amount of inorganic Cl ions represented 82.5% and 76.1% of the reaction products, showing that ring cleavage of PCBs was the main elimination process. Moreover, the dechlorination did not require a particular hydrogen donor. We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to analyze the elemental distribution at the catalyst’s surface. The O/Fe ratio influenced upon the decomposition efficiency of PCBs: the lower this ratio, the higher the decomposition efficiency. X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra showed that α-Fe2O3 effectively worked as a catalyst, while Fe3O4 and α-FeOOH were consumed as reactants, as their final state is different from their initial state. Finally, a decomposition pathway was postulated in which the Cl atoms in ortho-positions were more difficult to eliminate than those in the para- or meta-positions.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aions 3aabsorption 3achlorine 3airon 3acatalysts 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3airon compounds 3ahydrogen 3adechlorination 3amagnetite 0aIron catalysts 0aReaction pathway 0aO/Fe ratio 0aCoplanar PCBs 0aX-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) 0aoxides 0aHydrogen donor1 aLiu, Xiaoyuan1 aKainuma, Masashi1 aWang, Wei1 aTakaoka, Masaki1 aTakeda, Nobuo0 tChemosphere.g2015 Oct., v. 137 p.78-86dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.03.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010200173300001600275520083500291592002801126650000801154650001901162650002301181650002001204650001701224650001901241650001301260773009601273856008501369852000901454655001201463IND60113449120221121042910.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011344912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDictenberg, Jason10aGenetic encoding of fluorescent RNA ensures a bright future for visualizing nucleic acid dynamics  ap. 621-626.  aRecently RNA localization has been appreciated as an essential post-transcriptional mechanism to program local proteome composition and function.

Here, I highlight the strength of MS2 compared to other techniques, and how further evolution of this system will enable the visualization of RNA in the context of complex live-cell dynamics. Although the generation of MS2-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and MS2-bifluorescence complementation (BiFC) will require further development, it has the potential to increase significantly the signal-to-noise ratio, which is the major obstacle to rapid live-cell imaging of RNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3abacteriophages 3acommunity programs 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aproteome0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2012 Dec., v. 30, no. 12 p.621-626dElsevier Ltdx0167-77997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245011800168300001800286500001900304520176100323592002802084650002302112650005202135650001702187650001402204650001102218650001202229650001302241650001202254700001702266700002102283700001802304700003002322700002202352700001902374700001502393773014202408856007402550852000902624655001202633IND60741698920221118113651.0210618e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074169892DNAL7 a10.1039/d1tb00472g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadique, Mohd.

Thus, it has become crucial to avoid this transmission through precautions and keep premises hygienic using high-performance anti-viral nanomaterials to trap and eradicate SARS-CoV-2. Such an antiviral nano-system has successfully demonstrated useful significant contribution in COVID-19 pandemic/endemic management effectively. However, their projection with potential sustainable prospects still requires considerable attention and efforts. With this aim, the presented review highlights various severe life-threatening viral infections and the role of multi-functional anti-viral nanostructures with manipulative properties investigated as an efficient precative shielding agent against viral infection progression. The salient features of such various nanostructures, antiviral mechanisms, and high impact multi-dimensional roles are systematically discussed in this review. Additionally, the challenges associated with the projection of alternative approaches also support the demand and significance of this selected scientific topic. The outcomes of this review will certainly be useful to motivate scholars of various expertise who are planning future research in the field of investigating sustainable and affordable high-performance nano-systems of desired antiviral performance to manage not only COVID-19 infection but other targeted viral infections as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acase studies 3achemistry 3ahumans 3ahygiene 3apandemic 3aviruses1 aYadav, Shalu1 aRanjan, Pushpesh1 aVerma, Sarika1 aSalammal, Shabi Thankaraj1 aKhan, Mohd.

It has been recently shown that (Na,K)ATPase is involved in the exocytic pathway of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), although it is not known that bFGF is secreted to the outside of cell through direct interaction with (Na,K) ATPase. To understand the role for (Na,K)ATPase in the secretory pathway of bFGF, we have sought to identify the cytoplasmic domains of the α1 isoform of (Na,K)ATPase interacting with bFGF by yeast two-hybrid system. We have also investigated the interaction between the α2 isoform of (Na,K)ATPase and bFGF to find out whether the interaction is isorm-specific. We found that none of the cytoplasmic domains of (Na,K)ATPase isoforms interacted with bFGF. The result suggests that the interaction between bFGF and (Na,K)ATPase might be indirect, thus requiring other proteins which are involved in the formation of protein complexes for the interaction, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the interaction requires the element of the whole α subunit structure that was not present in the isolated α subunit cytoplasmic domains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3apotassium 3aproteins 3asodium 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aLee, Kyunglim0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g1998 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.707-711dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029767623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001600257520119200273592002801465650002101493650001801514650001501532650002201547651001001569700002201579773013401601852000901735856008101744930003301825946001101858655001201869IND60439873820221121121313.0151024e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043987382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-007-9123-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Upasna10aMethodology for identifying vulnerability hotspots to tropical cyclone hazard in India  ap. 703-717.  aVulnerability indices are commonly used for characterizing the impacts on a region or comparing relative vulnerability across regions. Such indices are usually computed as a composite/aggregate across different components of vulnerability. Though such a single numerical value can be useful in many situations, a major disadvantage is that it leads to loss of information about how the different factors that went into making the composite index interact with each other, and contribute to making a place vulnerable. In this paper we develop an alternative approach for identifying hotspots, based on cluster analysis that seeks to address this problem by considering the different components of vulnerability separately. We compute different indices for each of the components of vulnerability. Cluster analysis helps in identifying the most vulnerable districts based on different combinations of the components of vulnerability. In addition to being methodologically more robust than the index approach, the clustering approach may have greater policy-relevance as it provides information about which aspects of vulnerability, policy needs to address in the most vulnerable districts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3aglobal change 3ahurricanes 3aissues and policy 3aIndia1 aPatwardhan, Anand0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2008 Aug., v. 13, no. 7 p.703-717dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-007-9123-43Available from publisher's site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01213naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245008800170500002200258520025700280592002800537650001700565650002200582650001700604700001800621700001800639700001900657700001400676700001400690700001800704773006800722856008800790852000900878655001200887IND60577004620221118001142.0170806s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057700462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Lunzhao10aRETRACTION: Recent advances in chemometric methods for plant metabolomics: A review  aPre-press version  aThis article has been withdrawn at the request of the author(s) and/or editor.

Although considerable potential for energy savings can be identified from conventional retrofit approaches, the proposed solutions have rarely been adopted in practice, due to significant topology modifications required and resulting engineering complexities during implementation. The intensification of heat transfer for conventional shell-and-tube heat exchangers can eliminate the difficulties of implementing retrofit in HEN which are commonly restricted by topology, safety and maintenance constraints, and includes high capital costs for replacing equipment and pipelines. This paper presents a novel design approach to solve HEN retrofit problems based on heat transfer enhancement. A mathematical model has been developed to evaluate shell-and-tube heat exchanger performances, with which heat-transfer coefficients and pressure drops for both fluids in tube and shell sides are obtained. The developed models have been compared with the Bell-Delaware, simplified Tinker and Wills–Johnston methods and tested with the HTRI® and HEXTRAN® software packages. This demonstrates that the new model is much simpler but can give reliable results in most cases. For the debottlenecking of HEN, four heuristic rules are proposed to identify the most appropriate heat exchangers requiring heat transfer enhancements in the HEN. The application of this new design approach allows a significant improvement in energy recovery without fundamental structural modifications to the network.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acomputer software 3aenergy recovery 3aengineering 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3apipelines 3atopology1 aPan, Ming1 aBulatov, Igor1 aSmith, Robin1 aKim, Jin-Kuk0 tApplied energy.g2012 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.45-59dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014700167300001800314520139400332592002801726650001701754650002001771650002401791650001501815650002701830650001601857650002101873650001801894650001401912650002601926650000901952650001001961650002301971650001701994650001002011650001102021650001102032650001802043653002502061653002302086653001502109653002502124653002702149653002602176653002602202700002802228700002402256700002002280700002402300773014802324856008602472852000902558655001202567IND60661102620221118141107.0210119e20190908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066110262DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2019.16486572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunir, Alia10aUse of Potassium Fertilization to Ameliorate the Adverse Effects of Saline-sodic Stress Condition (ECw: SARw Levels) in Rice (Oryza Sativa L.)  ap. 1975-1985.  aSalt-affected soils expand around the world and become a critical handicap for high crop yield. Saline-sodic soil contributed a major portion in salt-affected soils. Such types of soils have a sizable amount of Na⁺ in nutrient medium and that reduce the K⁺ uptake in plants. A hydroponic experiment was performed to investigate the ameliorative effect of different doses of potassium fertilizer (K₁ = 0.3, K₂ = 0.6 and K₃ = 1.2 mM L⁻¹) on rice (Oryza sativa L.) under different ECw (6 dS m⁻¹) and SARw [12 and 24 (mmol L⁻¹)¹/²] levels. Application of K⁺ at elevated levels under saline-sodic conditions improved the concentration of anti-oxidant enzymes, plant physiological, and biochemical attributes by improving the K⁺: Na⁺ ratio in plant tissues. Total phenolic content, total soluble protein, and soluble sugar content of rice plant were increased with an increase in potassium dose and saline-sodicity. Maximum K⁺: Na⁺ ratios, 4.13 and 2.0 were observed in shoot and root, respectively upon application of K⁺ at 1.2 mM L⁻¹ in a solution having ECw: SARw level of 6: 12. This study suggested that application of potassium at elevated levels (1.2 mM L⁻¹) has enhanced the rice growth by reducing the harmful effect of Na⁺ salts on plant physiology, biochemical attributes, and anti-oxidant enzymes under specific saline-sodic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acrop yield 3afertilizer application 3ahydroponics 3aplant physiology 3aplant tissues 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3arice 3aroots 3asaline sodic soils 3asaline soils 3asalts 3ashoots 3asodium 3asugar content 0aPotassium fertilizer 0asalt-affected soil 0ahydroponic 0aanti-oxidant enzymes 0atotal phenolic content 0atotal soluble protein 0asoluble sugar content1 aShehzad, Muhammad Tahir1 aQadir, Ayesha Abdul1 aMurtaza, Ghulam1 aKhalid, Hafiza Iqra0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2019 Sept. 8, v. 50, no. 16 p.1975-1985dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.16486573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006500169520092700234592002801161650001201189650003401201650001501235650002001250650001501270650000701285653003501292653003301327653006001360653002301420653003601443700005101479700005501530700001501585700001101600700001901611700005501630773010601685856008701791852000901878655001201887IND60654477420221119190644.0200210e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shanshan10aAqueous electrophoretic deposition of gadolinium doped ceria  aHomogeneous, bubble-free and smooth gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) films were successfully obtained with the application of alternating current electrophoretic deposition (AC-EPD) in the aqueous suspension. GDC particles were well dispersed in the aqueous suspension at a pH of 9.0. The alternating current was achieved through the application of an asymmetric square wave voltage to the electrodes of the deposition cell. An optimum frequency of 1 kHz showed the best balance between the suppression of bubble evolution and enhancement of the particle migration. The deposit yield increased monotonically with increasing time under the AC-EPD with a frequency of 1 kHz, suggesting its great potential to fabricate tunable thicknesses of deposition layers. The quality of the GDC film improved with an increase in frequency. An optimum combination of forward and reverse voltages and half-widths of the pulses was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3agadolinium 3apH 0aSolid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) 0aGadolinium doped ceria (GDC) 0aAlternating current electrophoretic deposition (AC-EPD) 0aAqueous suspension 0aOxygen evolution reaction (OER)1 aLi, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2802-74431 aLi, Wenyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2802-74431 aZhang, Nan1 aQi, He1 aFinklea, Harry1 aLiu, Xingbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8720-71750 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Oct. 20, v. 579 p.123717-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012800157300001800285500001900303520111500322592002801437650001301465650002801478650001701506650001901523650002601542650002601568650001401594650000901608650001201617650001301629700001501642700001801657700001501675773014201690856007401832852000901906655001201915IND60741699220221118121440.0210618e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074169922DNAL7 a10.1039/d1tb00599e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiuxia10aBioadhesive metal–phenolic nanoparticles for enhanced NIR imaging-guided locoregional photothermal/antiangiogenic therapy  ap. 4710-4717.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLocoregional drug delivery has emerged as a promising solution to the problems associated with intravenously administered antitumor agents, such as systemic toxicity and insufficient drug accumulation at tumor sites. Herein, we have developed an adhesive nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery system, using natural bioadhesive tannic acid (TA) and metal ions (Fe³⁺), for locoregional photothermal and antiangiogenic synergistic cancer therapy. In this study, a new near-infrared (NIR) photothermal agent indocyanine green (IR820) and an antiangiogenic agent sorafenib (SRF) were co-encapsulated in a TA–Fe complex (SIF@TA–Fe). The SIF@TA–Fe NPs exhibited super adhesion, antiangiogenesis, and efficient cellular uptake. Moreover, SIF@TA–Fe NPs showed a synergistic antitumor effect in vivo, including high tumor inhibition rate, excellent survival extension, and low risk of recurrence, resulting from the prolonged retention of the NPs in the tumor. Thus, this adhesive SIF@TA–Fe NP-based therapeutic system provides a promising approach for locoregional drug delivery of combined cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aantineoplastic activity 3abioadhesives 3acancer therapy 3adrug delivery systems 3aintravenous injection 3aneoplasms 3arisk 3atannins 3atoxicity1 aLi, Hongyu1 aMeng, Fanling1 aLuo, Liang0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 June 16, v. 9, no. 23 p.4710-4717dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1tb00599e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245010600173300001400279520128900293592002801582650002701610650001801637650002601655650002201681650002001703650001001723650001501733650001901748650001501767650001601782650001801798650001001816650002501826650001801851650001601869650001701885650001701902650002001919650001701939650000901956650003101965650002401996650002902020653001002049653000802059653001402067653001502081653002302096653001002119653000802129653000902137653000802146653001402154653000802168653000702176653000802183653001002191653000702201653000802208653000802216653001202224700001502236700001702251700001802268700005402286773008902340856009002429852000902519655001202528IND60634566320221119075708.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063456632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xiaoting10aExposure to ambient fine particles causes abnormal energy metabolism and ATP decrease in lung tissues  ap. 29-38.  aAirborne fine particles, generating from human activities, have drawn increasing attention due to their potential lung health hazards. The currently available toxicological data on fine particles is still not sufficient to explain their cause-and-effect. Based on well reported critical role of ATP on maintaining lung structure and function, the alterations of ATP production and energy metabolism in lungs of rats exposed to different dosages of seasonal PM2.5 were investigated. Haze dosage PM2.5 exposure was demonstrated to reduce the ATP production. Activity of critical enzymes in TCA cycle, such as malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS), and expression of mitochondrial respiration chain genes were attenuated in groups exposed to haze dosage PM2.5. In contrast, there was prominent augment of glycolytic markers at haze dosage PM2.5, including metabolite contents (pyruvate and lactic acid), enzyme activities (hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PKM)), along with mRNA levels of PKM and LDH. Consequently, sub-chronic exposure to seasonal haze PM2.5 caused reduction in ATP generation and metabolic rewiring from TCA cycle to glycolysis. Our findings can help better understand the toxicological mechanism of lung disease caused by particulate air pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aair pollution 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglycolysis 3ahealth hazards 3ahexokinase 3alactic acid 3alung function 3alungs 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3aparticulates 3apyruvate kinase 3apyruvic acid 3arats 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asubchronic exposure 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aPM2.5 0aATP 0aTCA cycle 0aGlycolysis 0aMetabolic rewiring 0aPM2.5 0aATP 0aQFFs 0aSEM 0aTCA cycle 0aMDA 0aCS 0aMDH 0aGlut1 0aHK 0aPKM 0aLDH 0aqRT-PCR1 aSu, Huilan1 aDing, Guobin1 aSun, Zhendong1 aLi, Zhuoyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2263-54830 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.29-38dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01784naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013600173300001400309520067100323592002800994650001801022650001501040650001201055650000901067650001401076650002201090700001701112700001701129700001601146700001901162700001701181773010601198856008601304990002301390852000901413655001201422IND60113216320221117082021.0141111e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011321632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutta, Gorachand10aTime-dependent decrease in the enhanced electrocatalytic activities observed after three different pretreatments of gold electrodes  ap. 41-46.  aThis study reports how the electrocatalytic activities of gold (Au) electrodes change with aging under ambient conditions.

The surface roughness of the Au electrodes is maintained during the NaBH₄ treatment, whereas it changes substantially during the piranha treatment and mechanical polishing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzoquinones 3aelectrodes 3aglucose 3agold 3aoxidation 3asurface roughness1 aJo, Kyungmin1 aLee, Hyunwoo1 aBoram, Kim,1 aWoo, Han Young1 aYang, Haesik0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2012 June 15, v. 675 p.41-46dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.04.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01616naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245011900159300002000278520060100298592002800899650001200927650002300939650002300962650001200985650002200997700001201019700001701031700001501048700001601063773012101079856008101200852000901281655001201290IND60587130520221120224335.0171215e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058713052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b024612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Ming10aGold(I)-Catalyzed Cyclization/Carbonylation Cascade Reaction of 1,6-Diynes: An Access to β,γ-Unsaturated Ketones  ap. 13386-13395.  aA gold-catalyzed cyclization/carbonylation cascade reaction of 1,6-diynes is reported.

For selective and efficient extraction, vitamins were dissolved in 3.0molL⁻¹ micellar solution of 1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium bromide IL. The extracted vitamins were hydrodynamically injected by 25mbar for 20s into a running buffer of 12.5mmolL⁻¹ phosphate at pH 6.0 followed by electrochemical detection (ECD) on protein/1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate IL/GC sensors. The chemical stability of proposed sensors was achieved up to 7 days without any decomposition of PF6-based IL/protein and adsorption of interfering ions. In the current work, the sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF) up to 5000-fold was achieved using the AFILMC/ECD setup compared to conventional CE/UV. Under optimal conditions, linear calibration graphs were obtained from 0.5, 0.5 and 1.0 to 1500.0µgmL⁻¹ of vitamins B2, B6 and C, respectively. Detection limits of analytes were ranged from 180.0 to 520.0ngmL⁻¹. The proposed AFILMC/ECD setup was successfully applied to the assay of trace level quantification of vitamins in human plasma samples and also their binding constants with HSA and BSA were determined. The concurrent use of IL micelles for the proposed separation and detection processes exhibited some advantages, such as, a reduction of use toxic solvents, an efficient extraction and a direct injection of samples with a short-single run. Furthermore, IL micelles, having variable possibility of interactions, facilitated the successful achievements of AFILMC/ECD setup for the quantification of vitamins in plasma matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abovine serum albumin 3abromides 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphs 3ahuman serum albumin 3aionic liquids 3aions 3aliquids 3amicelles 3apH 3aphosphates 3atoxicity 3awater-soluble vitamins 0aChemical sensors 0aIonic liquid 0aProtein 0aPlasma 0aCapillary electrophoresis 0aVitamins1 aAlbishri, H.M.0 tTalanta.g2015 July 01, v. 139 p.150-158dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010200169300001600271520170200287592002801989650001202017650001902029650001102048650001102059650001502070650001402085650001502099650001102114650001002125651003102135700002502166700001802191773013402209852000902343856008102352930003302433946001102466655001202477IND60439874020221122065911.0151024e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043987402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-007-9124-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshton, Andrew D.12aA discussion of the potential impacts of climate change on the shorelines of the Northeastern USA  ap. 719-743.  aAn increase in the rate of sea-level rise and potential changes in storminess represent important components of global climate change that will likely affect the extensive coasts of the Northeastern USA. Raising sea level not only increases the likelihood of coastal flooding, but changes the template for waves and tides to sculpt the coast, which can lead to land loss orders of magnitude greater than that from direct inundation alone. There is little question that sea-level rise, and in particular an increased rate of rise, will result in permanent losses of coastal land. However, quantitative predictions of these future coastal change remains difficult due in part to the complexity of coastal systems and the influence of infrequent storm events, and is further confounded by coastal science’s insufficient understanding of the behavior of coastal systems over decadal timescales. Recently, dramatic improvements in technology have greatly improved our capabilities to investigate and characterize processes and sedimentary deposits in the coastal zone, allowing us, for the first time, to address some of the over-arching problems involved in shoreline change. Despite advances in many areas of coastal geology, our fundamental understanding of shoreline change has been limited by a lack of a broad and integrated scientific focus, a lack of resources, and a lack of willingness on the part of policymakers who make crucial decisions about human activity along the coast to support basic research in this area. Although quantitative predictions remain constrained, there remains little doubt that the predicted climates changes will have profound effects upon the Northeastern coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3ahumans 3aprediction 3asea level 3ashorelines 3astorms 3atides 3aNortheastern United States1 aDonnelly, Jeffrey P.1 aEvans, Rob L.0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2008 Aug., v. 13, no. 7 p.719-743dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-007-9124-33Available from publisher's site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02969naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014400166520122400310592002801534650002501562650002901587650001901616650001601635650002201651650003001673650001301703650002401716650001901740650000901759650001801768650001501786650001401801653003601815653001801851653001501869700001601884700001801900700009101918700001602009700001702025700001502042700001702057700001702074700001202091700001802103700009102121700001302212773010602225856008702331852000902418655001202427IND60654477620221119191011.0190801e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1103592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qun10aExperimental and simulation studies of strontium/fluoride-codoped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with osteogenic and antibacterial activities  aMultiple ions codoping may effectively modulate physicochemical and biological properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) for diverse biomedical applications. This study synthesized strontium (Sr)-, fluorine (F)- doped, and Sr/F-codoped HA nanoparticles by a hydrothermal method, and investigated the effect of ion doping on characteristics of HA, including crystallinity, crystal size, lattice parameters, and substitution sites by experiments and simulation with density functional theory (DFT) methods. It was found that, Sr doping increased the lattice parameters of HA whereas F doping decreased these parameters. Additionally, F doping enhanced the structural stability of the Sr-doped HA. F doping created excellent antibacterial properties to effectively inhibit growth of Streptococcus mutans. An appropriate Sr doping level endowed HA with optimum osteogenic ability to promote osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. These suggest that, Sr/F codoping is an effective approach to synthesizing HA-based materials with both antibacterial and osteogenic properties. More broadly, HA nanomaterials with specific characteristics may be designed for meeting diverse requirements from biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantibacterial properties 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3acrystal structure 3adensity functional theory 3afluorine 3ahot water treatment 3ahydroxyapatite 3aions 3ananoparticles 3astem cells 3astrontium 0aStrontium and Fluoride Codoping 0aAntibacterial 0aOsteogenic1 aLi, Pengfei1 aTang, Pengfei1 aGe, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4855-5972 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4855-59721 aRen, Fuzeng1 aZhao, Cancan1 aFang, Zhu,1 aWang, Kefeng1 aFang, Liming1 aLi, Yan1 aBao, Chongyun1 aLu, Xiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1581-4691 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1581-46911 aDuan, Ke0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 182 p.110359-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1103593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009900167300001600266500001500282520154400297592002801841650001601869650000901885650001801894650001901912650001101931650001201942650001001954650001801964650001101982650002501993650001102018650002602029650003402055650000902089650002502098650000902123650001202132650005802144651000902202653001902211700002902230700003002259773013402289852000902423856008102432930003302513946001102546655001202557IND60439874120221122065747.0151024e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043987412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-007-9140-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakimoto, Asako10aSocioeconomic potential of carbon sequestration through agroforestry in the West African Sahel  ap. 745-761.  a2019-12-06  aThe recognition of agroforestry as a greenhouse-gas mitigation strategy under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) offers an opportunity to agroforestry practitioners to benefit from the global Carbon (C) credit market. Our knowledge on this important topic from the semiarid regions such as the West African Sahel (WAS) is, however, very limited. In order to fill this gap, this study was undertaken in the Ségou region of Mali (annual temperature, 29°C; annual rainfall, 300–700 mm in 60 to 90 days), focusing on two improved agroforestry systems (live fence and fodder bank) along with traditional parkland agroforestry systems of the region. A cost–benefit analysis was conducted to assess the economic profitability and risks associated with the systems considering them as 25-year projects and their potential for participation in C credit market. The traditional systems had high C stock in their biomass and soil, but little potential for sequestering additional C; on the other hand, the improved systems had low C stock, but high sequestration potential. For the standard size live fence (291 m) and fodder bank (0.25 ha) projects, the estimated net present values (NPV) were $ 96.0 and $158.8 without C credit sale, and $109.9 and $179.3 with C sale, respectively. From the C sale perspective, live fence seemed less risky and more profitable than fodder bank. Carbon credit sale is likely to contribute to economic development of the subsistence farmers in the WAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3arisk 3aprofitability 3acarbon markets 3acredit 3afarmers 3aSahel 3aglobal change 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aforage 3acost benefit analysis 3aparkland agroforestry systems 3arain 3aeconomic development 3asoil 3abiomass 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aMali 0asemiarid zones1 aNair, P.

The DNA–AuNP Clusters-based biocomposite film modified electrode was fabricated through layer-by-layer coating. The morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of the DNA–AuNP Clusters and their biocomposite film were characterized by dynamic light scattering, field emission transmission electron microscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The Mb immobilized in the composite film kept its bioactivity and exhibited greatly enhanced direct electrochemical behavior, which is mainly attributed to the good conductivity and excellent biocompatibility of DNA–AuNP Clusters. The modified electrode displayed good electrocatalytic activity to the reduction of H₂O₂. Therefore, with combining the advantages of the AuNPs and DNA, this DNA–AuNP Clusters-based composite film could be used as a new promising platform for protein immobilization and novel biosensor fabrication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiocompatibility 3abiocomposites 3abiosensors 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adithiothreitol 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alight scattering 3amyoglobin 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Yao1 aSun, Xiumei1 aZhang, Yang1 aCao, Hongmei1 aShen, Hebai1 aJia, Nengqin0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2012 June 15, v. 675 p.5-10dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.04.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009100158300001800249500001900267520158600286592002801872650000801900650001501908650002101923650002601944650002001970650002101990650001502011650001702026650001202043650001302055650001302068650001402081650000702095650001902102650001902121650000902140700001602149700001402165700001402179773014202193856007402335852000902409655001202418IND60741699520221118121445.0210618e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074169952DNAL7 a10.1039/d1tb00913c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Pinghua10aSinglet-oxygen generated by a metal–organic framework for electrochemical biosensing  ap. 4670-4677.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnzyme-based electrochemical biosensors have been widely employed for analyte detection for several years. However, for wide application, there are many challenges to overcome, such as the sensitivity of the catalytic activity, and the reproducibility and stability of enzymes. In this work, an enzyme-free sensing strategy based on two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as photosensitizers and singlet-oxygen (¹O₂) as the oxidant has been designed via photocatalysis and electrochemical analysis. To be specific, MOF sheets (Zn–ZnMOF) were prepared with Zn as the node and zinc(ii)tetraphenylporphyrin (TCPP(Zn)) as the ligand, which could generate ¹O₂ from air under light illumination, and sequentially the generated ¹O₂ could oxidize analytes to form their oxidation state which could be detected and reduced on the electrode, completing a redox cycle and amplifying electrochemical signals. Thanks to the morphology and superior quantum yield of ¹O₂ of the Zn–ZnMOF, this method could overcome the limitation of enzymes and afford selective detection, such as of hydroquinone with a detection limit of 0.8 μM in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4). Furthermore, the method does not require additional reactive reagents but only with air and on/off light switching. Thirdly, the method detects the target without washing and enzyme-labelled. With these merits, this work provides a new platform for MOFs as photosensitizers for electrochemical sensors and further development of sensitive, selective, and stable electroanalytical devices for bio-application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiosensors 3achemical species 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydroquinone 3aligands 3alighting 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3asinglet oxygen 3azinc1 aCheng, Shan1 aChen, Nuo1 aGao, Feng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 June 16, v. 9, no. 23 p.4670-4677dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1tb00913c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012500171300001400296520103200310592002801342650001701370650001401387650002401401650002101425650001201446650002201458650001301480650000901493650002201502650000901524650002101533650001201554650001001566650001401576700001401590700001301604700001901617700001201636700001401648700002001662773009301682856008501775852000901860655001201869IND60087884520221118012510.0141102e20120104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008788452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Rui-hong10aExtraction, characterization and spontaneous gel-forming property of pectin from creeping fig (Ficus pumila Linn.) seeds  ap. 76-83.  aCreeping fig (Ficus pumila Linn.) seeds can be manually rubbed and squeezed to produce a water extract (WE) that can gel at room temperature without any additives. Its gelling material, extraction behavior, and mechanism of spontaneous gel-formation were investigated. Gelling material was extracted from seeds using water, ammonium oxalate and hydrochloric acid, respectively. Results showed the main component of three extracts is low methoxyl pectin. The pectin locates in a transparent layer on the surface of seeds, as revealed by an inverted microscope. Hence, explained the feasibility of the squeezing and rubbing method in traditional handcraft. Comparing with the other methods, water-extracted pectin has high galacturonic acid content, viscosity-average molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity but low degree of methoxylation. This pectin forms the major component of WE, together with the high amount of calcium ions present in WE, it suggests the spontaneous gelation may be based on the ‘egg-box’ formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFicus pumila 3aadditives 3aambient temperature 3aammonium oxalate 3acalcium 3agalacturonic acid 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3amolecular weight 3apectins 3aseeds 3aviscosity1 aChen, Jun1 aLiu, Wei1 aLiu, Cheng-mei1 aYu, Wen1 aYuan, Min1 aZhou, Xiao-qing0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Jan. 4, v. 87, no. 1 p.76-83dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245016600170300001200336520155100348592002801899650001501927650002501942650001601967650004901983650002202032650000902054650000902063650001402072650001502086650001402101650001502115650001602130650001802146653003902164653001502203653001502218653001502233700001902248700001702267700001502284700001602299700001202315700005702327700001802384773008702402856009002489852000902579655001202588IND60634566620221119075821.0190425e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063456662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Dan10aLow-molecular-weight organic acids impede the degradation of naphthol in iron oxides/persulfate systems: Implications for research experiments in pure conditions  ap. 1-8.  aNaphthols are industrial contaminants occurring widely in soils and waters. Remediation of organic pollutants can be done by chemical oxidation using persulfate. However, most research experiments testing degradation of organic pollutants have been done in ideal conditions, e.g. using a pure compound in pure water, and thus are weakly representative of real natural conditions where pollutants occur in complex mixtures of numerous organic compounds. Therefore we tested here the effect of the presence of small organic acids, as typical compounds occurring in natural media, on the degradation of 1-napthol with persulfate and iron oxides. Results show that organic acids decreased naphthol transformation by 3.7% for malic acid, 53.2% for tartaric acid, 72.3% for citric acid and 77% for oxalic acids, in a magnetite/persulfate system during 10 h. Meanwhile, the dissolved Fe species increased gradually with the reaction time; the highest concentration of Fe ions reached to ∼18 μM L−1 in aqueous phase. Electron paramagnetic resonance technique was applied to determine reactive oxygen species (ROS). The spin density of ·OH, detected as the main ROS, decreased initially, followed by gradually increase, suggesting that organic acids might inhibit the degradation of 1-naphthol by competing with ·OH. These findings disclose the high inhibition of the transformation by organic acids, and thus, more generally, imply that studies using only pure contaminants are weakly representative for remediation of real, natural samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-naphthol 3achemical degradation 3acitric acid 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aions 3airon 3amagnetite 3amalic acid 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aremediation 3atartaric acid 0aLow-molecular-weight organic acids 0aIron oxide 0aPersulfate 0a1-Naphthol1 aWang, Tiecheng1 aZhu, Kecheng1 aZhao, Song1 aShi, Yafang1 aYe, Mao1 aWang, Chuanyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7146-115X1 aJia, Hanzhong0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 225 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245019700172300001200369520093700381592002801318650001501346650001601361650001501377650002001392650004101412650001301453650001001466650003701476650001301513653002701526653004301553653003701596653005801633700002201691700001801713700002001731700002201751773008801773856008501861852000901946655001201955IND60603252520221120201011.0180713e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060325252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAragón, Álvaro10aAnalysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in aqueous samples by large volume injection gas chromatography–mass spectrometry using the through oven transfer adsorption desorption interface  ap. 1-5.  aA new procedure for the determination of 17 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in aqueous samples by large volume injection–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (LVI–GC–MS) using the Through Oven Transfer Adsorption Desorption (TOTAD) interface with nitrogen for solvent elimination is developed and validated.

Oil yields ranged between 17.5–37.1%, with an average of 31.8%. The main fatty acids were linoleic (35.50–46.06%), oleic (25.25–45.30%), α-eleostearic (7.43–15.76%) and palmitic (5.06–7.38%), containing 94–96% of total detected fatty acids. The range of total tocochromanols was between 118.2 and 163.6mg/100g of oil. Independent of the cultivar, γ-T was the main tocochromanol and constituted between 61 and 83% of the total identified tocopherol and tocotrienol homologues in all studied samples. The total content of the carotenoids was between 0.51–1.75mg/100g of oil. The concentration of squalene in different sour cherry kernel oils was reached between 65.8–102.8mg/100g of oil. The concentration of sterols varied significantly for all of the studied cultivars and ranged between 313.6–1041.3mg/100g of oil. The β-sitosterol constituted 77–82% of the total sterol content detected in the samples studied. Two significant correlations were found between oil yield and the total content of sterols (r=−0.974, p≤0.001) and carotenoids (r=−0.915, p≤0.01) in sour cherry kernel oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus cerasus 3abeta-sitosterol 3abyproducts 3acarotenoids 3acultivars 3alinoleic acid 3aoils 3aseeds 3asqualene 0aPrunus cerasus L. 0aSour cherry kernel oil 0aFatty acids 0aTocopherols 0aCarotenoids 0aPhytosterols1 aRudzińska, Magdalena1 aRaczyk, Marianna1 aMišina, Inga1 aSoliven, Arianne1 aSegliņa, Dalija0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2016 Apr., v. 82 p.44-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008900168300001600257520048600273592002800759650002500787650001200812650001300824650001100837700002000848700002200868700001800890700002100908773013200929856008201061852000901143655001201152IND60780977120221118090800.0220623e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078097712DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117220200352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabushkin, E.

Bacteria play an irreplaceable role in life. However, some bacteria seriously threaten human health and cause large-scale infectious diseases. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop strategies to accurately monitor bacteria. Technology based on molecular probes and fluorescence imaging is noninvasive, results in little damage, and has high specificity and sensitivity, so it has been widely applied in the detection of bacteria. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in bacterial detection using fluorescence. In particular, we generalize the mechanisms commonly used to design organic fluorescent probes for detecting and imaging bacteria. Moreover, a perspective regarding fluorescent probes for bacterial detection is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3afluorescence 3ahuman health 3amicrobial detection 3apollutants1 aChen, Weijie1 aChung, Jeewon1 aYin, Jun1 aYoon, Juyoung0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 July 5, v. 50, no. 13 p.7725-7744dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs01340d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015800209300001800367520156900385592002801954596002801982650002102010650002002031650002002051650001502071650001402086650000902100650001402109650002602123650001702149650001402166650002302180650002902203650001702232700006302249700002602312700001802338700002202356700006302378700006502441700006802506773013402574856008302708852000902791655001202800IND60758730320221118071411.0220226e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075873032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-021-01007-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapadakē, Maria,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7878-886810aHistological evaluation of sex differentiation and early sex identification in hatchery-produced greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) reared in sea cages  ap. 1777-1792.  aThe histological process of gonadal differentiation, together with the endocrine changes of sex steroid hormones and some of their precursors, was studied in hatchery-produced greater amberjack Seriola dumerili from 101 until 408 days post-hatching (dph), with samplings conducted every 50 days. Histological processing showed that sex differentiation began at 101 dph with the formation of the ovarian cavity in females, while the presumptive males did not yet contain any germ cells in their gonad. At 150 dph, we observed the first germ cells in the developing testes. Sex differentiation in almost all sampled individuals was complete at 408 dph. No size dimorphism was observed between the sexes, and the sex ratio was 1:1, suggesting that there was no influence of early rearing in captivity on sex differentiation. Plasma concentrations of adrenosterone (Ad), androstenedione (Δ4), 11-ketotestosterone (11ΚΤ), testosterone (Τ), estradiol (Ε₂), progesterone (P4) and 17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20βP) were measured in males and females with the use of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to examine their role in the sex differentiation process. From the seven hormones, the only one that exhibited differences between the sexes was 11-KT and the plasma 11-KT concentration was found to be a useful indication of greater amberjack sex. Variations were observed in the mean values of Ad, Δ4, 11-KT, T, P4 and 17,20βP over time in one or both sexes, indicating their involvement in the sex differentiation process.  aPublisher supplied data  aGA 862658cHorizon 2020 3aSeriola dumerili 3aandrostenedione 3acaptive animals 3adimorphism 3aestradiol 3afish 3ahistology 3aliquid chromatography 3aprogesterone 3asex ratio 3asexual development 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atestosterone1 aMandalakis, Manolis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7469-42901 aAnastasiou, Thekla I.1 aPouli, Marina1 aAsderis, Michalis1 aKatharios, Pantelis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9905-50681 aPapandroulakis, Nikos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7109-71321 aMylonas, Constantinos C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1805-43920 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.1777-1792dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-021-01007-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009500157520105400252592002801306650002001334650001601354650000901370650001101379650001201390650001701402650003301419650001301452650001101465700001701476700001901493700001401512700001601526773012701542856007401669852000901743655001201752IND60652623120221122082326.0190713e20180828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065262312DNAL7 a10.3390/su100930502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Weihua10aAssessing Map-Reading Skills Using Eye Tracking and Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling  aMap reading is an important skill for acquiring spatial information. Previous studies have mainly used results-based assessments to learn about map-reading skills. However, how to model the relationship between map-reading skills and eye movement metrics is not well documented. In this paper, we propose a novel method to assess map-reading skills using eye movement metrics and Bayesian structural equation modelling. We recruited 258 participants to complete five map-reading tasks, which included map visualization, topology, navigation, and spatial association. The results indicated that map-reading skills could be reflected in three selected eye movement metrics, namely, the measure of first fixation, the measure of processing, and the measure of search. The model fitted well for all five tasks, and the scores generated by the model reflected the accuracy and efficiency of the participants&rsquo; performance. This study might provide a new approach to facilitate the quantitative assessment of map-reading skills based on eye tracking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acartography 3aeyes 3amodels 3areading 3aspatial data 3astructural equation modeling 3atopology 3avision1 aJiang, Yuhao1 aZheng, Liangyu1 aLiu, Bing1 aMeng, Liqiu0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 28, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100930503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009500169300001800264520154900282592002801831596009901859650001301958650001501971650003201986650002002018650001302038650002202051650002502073700002902098700006502127700002002192773012402212856008302336852000902419655001202428IND60782531520221121022937.0220710e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078253152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07476-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathi, Mohadeseh10aEvaluation of potential of miR-8073 and miR-642 as diagnostic markers in pancreatic cancer  ap. 6475-6481.  aBACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a cancer with an insidious course. Since disease is often diagnosed at advanced stages, clinical outcome is impaired. Thus identification of biomarkers for this malignancy has importance in enhancement of patients’ survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the current study, we assessed expression levels of miR-8073 and miR-642 in the circulation of 50 patients with pancreatic cancer and 50 controls. Plasma levels of miR-8073 and miR-642 were significantly higher in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with controls (P value < 0.0001 and P value = 0.0068, respectively). Plasma levels of miR-642 were inversely correlated with albumin levels (R=-0.28, P value = 0.049), WBC count (R=-0.35, P value = 0.01), as well as CRP level (R=-0.30, P value = 0.035). On the other hand, levels of this miRNA were positively correlated with lipase level (R = 0.29, P value = 0.042). Levels of miR-8073 were not correlated with any of the available parameters. Plasma levels of miR-8073 could separate patients with pancreatic cancer from controls with AUC, sensitivity and specificity values of 0.82, 0.77 and 0.78, respectively. miR-642 could differentiate these two groups with AUC, sensitivity and specificity values of 0.63, 0.58 and 0.78, respectively. Combination of these two parameters resulted in AUC, sensitivity and specificity values of 0.79, 0.77 and 0.78, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these two miRNAs are suggested as possible blood markers for pancreatic cancer.  aPublisher supplied data  ashahid beheshti university of medical sciencescshahid beheshti university of medical sciences 3aalbumins 3abiomarkers 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aleukocyte count 3amicroRNA 3amolecular biology 3apancreatic neoplasms1 aAghdaie, Hamid Asadzadeh1 aGhafouri-Fard, Soudeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0223-499X1 aShams, Roshanak0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 July, v. 49, no. 7 p.6475-6481dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07476-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013100161300001600292500001500308520180500323592002802128650002502156650001702181650001402198650000902212650000902221650001802230650001302248650002402261650002002285650001002305650001602315650001302331650001002344650001902354650001502373650001402388650001202402650001002414650001102424650001502435650002402450653002402474653001502498653002202513653001202535700001702547700001402564700001902578773015102597856007802748852000902826655001202835IND60539460720221118160415.0190318e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053946072DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-71242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarrett, J.P.14aThe effects of forage particle length and exogenous phytase inclusion on phosphorus digestion and absorption in lactating cows  ap. 411-418.  a2019-12-06  aAccurate estimates of phosphorus (P) availability from feed are needed to allow P requirements to be met with reduced P intake, thus reducing P excretion by livestock. Exogenous phytase supplementation in poultry and swine diets improves bioavailability of P, and limited research suggests that this strategy may have some application in dairy cattle rations. The effects of exogenous phytase and forage particle length on site and extent of P digestion were evaluated with 5 ruminally and ileally cannulated lactating cows (188±35d in milk). Cows were assigned in a 2×2 factorial arrangement of treatments in 2 incomplete Latin squares with four 21-d periods. Diets contained P slightly in excess of National Research Council requirements with all P from feed sources. During the last 4d of each period, total mixed ration, refusals, omasal, ileal, and fecal samples were collected and analyzed for total P, inorganic P (Pi), and phytate (Pp). Total P intake was not influenced by dietary treatments but Pp intake decreased and Pi intake increased with supplemental phytase, suggesting rapid action of the enzyme in the total mixed ration after mixing. Omasal flow of Pi decreased with phytase supplementation, but we observed no effect of diet in ileal flow or small intestinal digestibility of any P fraction. Fecal excretion of total P was slightly higher and Pp excretion was lower for cows receiving diets supplemented with phytase. Milk yield and composition were unaffected by diets. When phytase was added to the mixed ration, dietary Pp was rapidly degraded before intake and total-tract Pp digestion was increased. The lack of effect of phytase supplementation on dietary P utilization was probably because these late-lactation cows had a low P requirement and were fed P-adequate diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainorganic phosphorus 3adairy cattle 3adigestion 3amilk 3acows 3adigestibility 3acannulas 3adietary supplements 3abioavailability 3afeces 3aphytic acid 3aphytases 3aileum 3alate lactation 3amilk yield 3aexcretion 3apoultry 3aswine 3amixing 3aabsorption 3atotal mixed rations 0alactating dairy cow 0aphosphorus 0aphytate digestion 0aphytase1 aWilson, J.W.1 aRay, P.P.1 aKnowlton, K.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.411-418dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-71243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245021200156300001600368520144900384592002801833650001301861650001601874650001401890650001201904650000901916650002001925650001101945650001601956650001701972650001201989650001002001650001802011650004802029650001202077653002402089653003902113653005002152700001202202700001702214700001302231773015102244856007802395852000902473655001202482IND60539460820221118160346.0190318e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053946082DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-71612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, X.10aShort communication: The pharmacological peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonist WY-14,643 increases expression of novel organic cation transporter 2 and carnitine uptake in bovine kidney cells  ap. 345-349.  aRecent studies in rodents demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a central regulator of energy homeostasis, is an important transcriptional regulator of the gene encoding the carnitine transporter novel organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2). Less is known with regard to the regulation of OCTN2 by PPARα and its role for carnitine transport in cattle, even though PPARα activation physiologically occurs in the liver of high-producing cows during early lactation. To explore the role of PPARα for OCTN2 expression and carnitine transport in cattle, we studied the effect of the PPARα activator WY-14,643 on the expression of OCTN2 in the presence and absence of PPARα antagonists and on OCTN2-mediated carnitine transport in the Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell line. The results show that WY-14,643 increases mRNA and protein levels of OCTN2, whereas co-treatment of MDBK cells with WY-14,643 and the PPARα antagonist GW6471 blocks the WY-14,643-induced increase in mRNA and protein levels of OCTN2 in bovine cells. In addition, treatment of MDBK cells with WY-14,643 stimulates specifically Na+-dependent carnitine uptake in MDBK cells, which is likely the consequence of the increased carnitine transport capacity of cells due to the elevated expression of OCTN2. In conclusion, our results indicate that OCTN2 expression and carnitine transport in cattle, as in rodents, are regulated by PPARα.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3acarnitine 3acations 3acows 3aearly lactation 3aenergy 3ahomeostasis 3akidney cells 3akidneys 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3arodents 0abovine kidney cells 0anovel organic cation transporter 2 0aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor α1 aWen, G.1 aRingseis, R.1 aEder, K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.345-349dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-71613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009400172300001800266520161300284592002801897596004901925596005301974650001602027650000902043650001402052650002402066650000902090650001702099650001102116650001002127650001102137650001402148650001502162650001702177650001202194650001802206650001602224700002202240700002002262700005802282773013402340856008302474852000902557655001202566IND60758730620221118071522.0220226e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075873062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-021-01015-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragojević, Jelena10aZebrafish (Danio rerio) Oatp2b1 as a functional ortholog of the human OATP2B1 transporter  ap. 1837-1849.  aOATP2B1 belongs to a highly conserved organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family of transporters, involved in the cellular uptake of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. The reported substrates of human OATP2B1 include steroid conjugates, bile salts, and thyroid hormones, as well as pharmaceuticals. Human OATP2B1 has orthologous genes in other vertebrate species, including zebrafish (Danio rerio), a widely used model organism in biomedical and environmental research. Our previous studies showed that zebrafish Oatp2b1 was phylogenetically closest to mammalian OATP2B1/Oatp2b1 and that it shares a similar tissue expression pattern. In this study, we aimed at discovering whether zebrafish Oatp2b1 could be a functional ortholog of human and rodent OATP2B1. To test this hypothesis, our primary goal was to obtain the first in vitro and in silico insights related to the structure and potential substrate preferences of zebrafish Oatp2b1. We generated cells transiently and stably transfected with zebrafish Oatp2b1 cloned from zebrafish liver, constructed an Oatp2b1 homology model, developed transport activity assays with model fluorescent substrate Lucifer yellow, and finally utilized this assay to analyze the interaction of zebrafish Oatp2b1 with both physiological and xenobiotic substances. Apart from structure similarities, our data revealed the strongest interaction of zebrafish Oatp2b1 with bile acids, steroid sulfates, thyroid hormones, and bilirubin, as well as xenobiotics bromosulfophthalein and sulfasalazine, which indicates its functional orthology with human OATP2B1.  aPublisher supplied data  aIP-2019-04-1147cHrvatska Zaklada za Znanost  aKK.01.1.1.01cEuropean Regional Development Fund 3aDanio rerio 3abile 3abilirubin 3acomputer simulation 3afish 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aliver 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aphysiology 3apolypeptides 3arodents 3asulfasalazine 3axenobiotics1 aMarakovic, Nikola1 aPopović, Marta1 aSmital, Tvrtko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2890-33940 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.1837-1849dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-021-01015-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008700164520104400251592002801295650002101323650002001344650002301364650001101387650002401398650002601422650002401448650001101472650002001483700002601503700001601529700002201545700002801567773012701595856007401722852000901796655001201805IND60652623420221122082315.0190713e20180828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065262342DNAL7 a10.3390/su100930532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Romero, Juan10aComfort as a Service: A New Paradigm for Residential Environmental Quality Control  aThis paper introduces the concept of Comfort as a Service (CaaS), a new energy supply paradigm for providing comfort to residential customers. CaaS takes into account the available passive and active elements, the external factors that affect energy consumption and associated costs, and occupants&rsquo; behaviors to generate optimal control strategies for the domestic equipment automatically. As a consequence, it releases building occupants from operating the equipment, which gives rise to a disruption of the traditional model of paying per consumed energy in favor of a model of paying per provided comfort. In the paper, we envision a realization of CaaS based on several technologies such as ambient intelligence, big data, cloud computing and predictive computing. We discuss the opportunities and the barriers of CaaS-centered business and exemplify the potential of CaaS deployments by quantifying the expected energy savings achieved after limiting occupants&rsquo; control over the air conditioning system in a test scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3acloud computing 3aconsumers (people) 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental quality 3ahousehold equipment 3amodels 3aquality control1 aMolina-Solana, Miguel1 aRos, María1 aRuiz, M.

Two aspartate residues (D143, D145) and one tryptophan (W146) in the Lymantria dispar chitinase are highly conserved residues observed within the second conserved motif of the family 18 chitinase catalytic region. In this study, a chitinase cDNA, LdCht5, was cloned from L. dispar, and the roles of the three residues were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and substituting them with three other amino acids. Seven mutant proteins, D143E, D145E, W146G, D143E/D145E, D143E/W146G, D145E/W146G, and D143E/D145E/W146G, as well as the wild-type enzyme, were produced using the baculovirus-insect cell line expression system. The enzymatic and kinetic properties of these mutant enzymes were measured using the oligosaccharide substrate MU-(GlcNAc)₃. Among the seven mutants, the D145E, D143E/D145E, and D145E/W146G mutations kept some extant catalytic activity toward MU-(GlcNAc)₃, while the D143E, W146G, D143E/W146G, and D143E/D145E/W146G mutant enzymes were inactivated. Compared with the mutant enzymes, the wild-type enzyme had higher values of k cₐₜ and k cₐₜ / K ₘ. A study of the multiple point mutations in the second conserved catalytic region would help to elucidate the role of the critical residues and their relationships.  aPublisher supplied data  a31101490cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201603D321094cKey Research and Development Project of Shanxi Province 3aLymantria dispar 3aaspartic acid 3acatalytic activity 3achitin 3achitinase 3acomplementary DNA 3ahydrolysis 3ainsects 3amutants 3aoligosaccharides 3aperitrophic membrane 3apoint mutation 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atryptophan1 aYang, Chun1 aZhang, Chang1 aRen, Hui1 aZhang, Jian-Dong0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 184, no. 1 p.12-24dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-017-2524-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007300139245011700212300001600329500002000345520128000365592002801645650002301673650001001696650002001706650002601726650002501752650001701777650001001794650002101804650002501825650001201850650002301862700005601885700005901941700007102000700005602071773013302127856007402260852000902334655001202343IND60773390920221119211739.0220414e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077339092DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.139932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales‐Mata, José Ignacio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9297-205810aPhenotypic selection on an ornamental trait is not modulated by breeding density in a pied flycatcher population  ap. 610-620.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost studies of phenotypic selection in the wild have focussed on morphological and life‐history traits and looked at abiotic (climatic) variation as the main driver of selection. Consequently, our knowledge of the effects of biotic environmental variation on phenotypic selection on sexual traits is scarce. Population density can be considered a proxy for the intensity of intrasexual and intersexual competition and could therefore be a key factor influencing the covariation between individual fitness and the expression of sexual traits. Here, we used an individual‐based data set from a population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) monitored over 24 years to analyze the effect of breeding density on phenotypic selection on dorsal plumage colouration, a heritable and sexually selected ornament in males of this species. Using the number of recruits as a fitness proxy, our results showed overall stabilizing selection on male dorsal colouration, with intermediate phenotypes being favoured over extremely dark and dull individuals. However, our results did not support the hypothesis that breeding density mediates phenotypic selection on this sexual trait. We discuss the possible role of other biotic factors influencing selection on ornamental plumage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFicedula hypoleuca 3acolor 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolutionary biology 3alife history 3amales 3aornamental value 3aphenotypic selection 3aplumage 3apopulation density1 aPotti, Jaime1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2284-00221 aCamacho, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9704-58161 aMartínez‐Padilla, Jesús1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2956-51631 aCanal, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2875-29870 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2022 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.610-620dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.139933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245009800204300001200302520180600314592002802120650002302148650002402171650001802195650001602213650001102229650001202240650001002252650001602262650000902278650001202287700001602299773013302315856008302448852000902531655001202540IND60758730920221118071450.0211212e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075873092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-021-02985-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇağlı, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8737-129010aDetermination of some body measurements of camels with three-dimensional modeling method (3D)  ap. 554.  aIn this study, the use of the three-dimensional modeling method was tested in taking some body measurements in camels with a practical method and was compared with other measurement methods. As the animal material of the study, 12 single-humped dromedary female camels and 14 double-humped Camelus dromedarius × Camelus bactrianus: F1 male camels, a total of 26 camels, were used in three camel farms in Incirliova district of Aydın province. The body measurements are taken from each animal by using different three methods, namely by the manual method (MM), by the photography method (PM), and by the three-dimensional modeling method (3D) were the withers height (WH), the back height (BH), the rump height (RH), the body length (BL), the brisket height (BRH), the abdominal height (AH), the shoulder width (SW), and the rump width (RW), and these values were compared with each other. As a result of this study, the mean values of MM and 3D measurement values were very close to each other and the difference between them was found to be statistically insignificant (P < 0.05). The difference between the means of PM and MM/3D measurement values was found to be significant (P < 0.05). In the measurements taken by MM, 3D, and PM methods in male camels, the values obtained by MM and 3D methods for WH, BH, RH, BRH, AH, BL, and SW were very close to each other and the differences between them were found insignificant statistically (p < 0.05). On the determined regression graph, a linear was found between MM and 3D measurement values. As a result of this study, it has been determined that the 3D modeling method can be used as a remote and more practical method in determining the morphological features of large-scale animals such as camels more reliably, more easily, and more practically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus bactrianus 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aanimal health 3abody length 3acamels 3afemales 3amales 3aphotography 3arump 3awithers1 aYılmaz, M.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 Dec., v. 53, no. 6 p.554-554dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02985-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245011000213300001800323506007600341520144100417592002801858596009401886596004901980596003302029596004402062506003702106650001902143650001402162650001002176650000902186650001302195650001402208650001902222700002202241773012202263856008502385852000902470655001202479IND60672653320221207113502.0191017e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067265332DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty5592doi7 aPMC61292602pmcid7 a304230772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlshahrani, Mona10aSemantic Disease Gene Embeddings (SmuDGE): phenotype-based disease gene prioritization without phenotypes  ap. i901-i907.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the past years, several methods have been developed to incorporate information about phenotypes into computational disease gene prioritization methods. These methods commonly compute the similarity between a disease’s (or patient’s) phenotypes and a database of gene-to-phenotype associations to find the phenotypically most similar match. A key limitation of these methods is their reliance on knowledge about phenotypes associated with particular genes which is highly incomplete in humans as well as in many model organisms such as the mouse. We developed SmuDGE, a method that uses feature learning to generate vector-based representations of phenotypes associated with an entity. SmuDGE can be used as a trainable semantic similarity measure to compare two sets of phenotypes (such as between a disease and gene, or a disease and patient). More importantly, SmuDGE can generate phenotype representations for entities that are only indirectly associated with phenotypes through an interaction network; for this purpose, SmuDGE exploits background knowledge in interaction networks comprised of multiple types of interactions. We demonstrate that SmuDGE can match or outperform semantic similarity in phenotype-based disease gene prioritization, and furthermore significantly extends the coverage of phenotype-based methods to all genes in a connected interaction network. https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/SmuDGE  aPublisher supplied data  cKing Abdullah University of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004052  cKAUSTdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004052  cOffice of Sponsored Research  aURF/1/3454-01-01aFCC/1/1976-08-01cOSR0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3adatabases 3agenes 3amice 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprioritization1 aHoehndorf, Robert0 tBioinformatics.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 34, no. 17 p.i901-i907dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl56649x1460-20597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty5593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245008300196300001600279500002000295520126700315592002801582596004401610596006201654650002101716650001001737650002501747650001301772650002001785650002501805650001701830700005801847700005801905700006501963700007102028700005902099773013302158856007402291852000902365655001202374IND60773391020221119212127.0220414e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077339102DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.139902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar, Prem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7838-644X10aNo genomic repercussions of assortative pairing in a colour polymorphic lizard  ap. 648-656.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLong‐term maintenance of colour polymorphisms often depends on the interplay of multiple selective forces. In the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), up to three pure and two mosaic ventral colour morphs co‐exist across most of its range. Available evidence suggests that colour morphs in this species are maintained through the interaction between sexual and environment‐dependent selection. In particular, colour‐assortative pairing has been recorded, suggesting some degree of assortative mating. Here, we combined reduced‐representation sequencing (ddRADseq) and fine‐scale distribution data to explore the effects of assortative pairing on the common wall lizard. Overall, our results do not support any population structure (FST = 0 and K = 1) nor a significant effect of colour morph or geographic location on genomic differentiation. Therefore, we argue that assortative pairing may not fully translate into assortative mating and genomic differentiation between colour morphs and discuss possible explanations. Nonetheless, we find potential support for an elevated population size and/or source‐sink dynamics and debate the potential contribution of other forms of selection to the maintenance of colour polymorphisms in lacertids.  aPublisher supplied data  cFundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia  cSpanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Inovación y Universidades 3aPodarcis muralis 3acolor 3aevolutionary biology 3agenomics 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3awall lizards1 aAndrade, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2540-24711 aAfonso, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7212-991X1 aCarretero, Miguel Á.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2335-71981 aPérez i de Lanuza, Guillem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3736-69571 aPinho, Catarina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5150-28500 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2022 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.648-656dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.139903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009600165300001200261520191100273592002802184596007802212596007302290650001902363650001902382650001802401650001502419650001602434650001502450650001402465650001602479650001102495650001302506650001802519650002402537650002802561650001302589650001502602650002602617650001902643650000902662650000902671700001802680700001702698700001802715700001702733700001802750700001802768700001902786700001702805700001802822773013302840856008302973852000903056655001203065IND60758731020221118071552.0211212e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075873102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-021-02996-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhigang10aDynamic distribution of nasal microbial community in yaks (Bos grunniens) at different ages  ap. 555.  aThe significance of microbial community structure has been extensively recognized due to its key roles in metabolism, immunity, and health maintenance. Importantly, increasing evidence indicated that the dynamic distribution of microbial community structure can be used for evaluating the health condition of host. Yaks (Bos grunniens), mainly inhabiting in high-altitude hypoxic environment, are characterized by excellent adaptability and strong resistance. Currently, it has been determined that yaks possessed the complicated gastrointestinal microbial ecosystem, whereas not much is known about the nasal microbial community structure of yaks. Therefore, this study was performed to compare and analyze the differences in nasal microbiota of yaks with different ages by high-throughput sequencing. In this study, a total of 487,168 and 486,498 high-quality sequences were achieved from YYG (1-month-old yaks) and AYG (1-year-old yaks), respectively. Additionally, 5,340 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified and 657 OTUs were in common among all samples. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the two most predominant phyla in all samples. Moreover, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the tertiary dominant phyla in YYG and AYG, respectively. At the level of genus, Moraxella, Faucicola, and Mannheimia were the most preponderant bacterial genera in the young and adult yaks. As compared to the AYG, the proportions of Actinobacillus, Parabacteroides, and Haemophilus in the YYG were significantly increased, whereas the Rhizobacter was decreased. In conclusion, this study firstly compared and investigated the distribution of nasal microbiota in yaks with different ages. Results demonstrated that age was an important factor affecting the nasal microbiota. Moreover, the current study will provide a theoretical basis for the further study on the microbial community structure of yaks.  aPublisher supplied data  aKJ2017A357cUniversity Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province  a201904e01020013cKey Research and Development Plan of Anhui Province 3aActinobacillus 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aHaemophilus 3aMannheimia 3aMoraxella 3aRhizobacter 3aadults 3aaltitude 3aanimal health 3acommunity structure 3agastrointestinal system 3aimmunity 3ametabolism 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3anose 3ayaks1 aSun, Qingsong1 aSu, Zhonghua1 aUllah, Qudrat1 aYang, Weixia1 aYangjin, Lamu1 aLi, Tsze Sun,1 aZhao, Mengmeng1 aLi, Zhongkai1 aZheng, Aifang0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 Dec., v. 53, no. 6 p.555-555dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02996-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245010800162300002000270520129500290592002801585650002201613650001401635650002301649650001201672650001301684650001201697650001501709650002101724650001101745650001101756650001401767650001901781650001301800650001401813650001101827650001401838700001601852700001501868773013401883856007802017852000902095655001202104IND60541676120221120161628.0160822e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054167612DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b103512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Zhongzheng10aFine-Tuning Nickel Phenoxyimine Olefin Polymerization Catalysts: Performance Boosting by Alkali Cations  ap. 15501-15510.  aTo gain a better understanding of the influence of cationic additives on coordination–insertion polymerization and to leverage this knowledge in the construction of enhanced olefin polymerization catalysts, we have synthesized a new family of nickel phenoxyimine–polyethylene glycol complexes (NiL0, NiL2–NiL4) that form discrete molecular species with alkali metal ions (M⁺ = Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺). Metal binding titration studies and structural characterization by X-ray crystallography provide evidence for the self-assembly of both 1:1 and 2:1 NiL:M⁺ species in solution, except for NiL4/Na⁺ which form only the 1:1 complex. It was found that upon treatment with a phosphine scavenger, these NiL complexes are active catalysts for ethylene polymerization. We demonstrate that the addition of M⁺ to NiL can result in up to a 20-fold increase in catalytic efficiency as well as enhancement in polymer molecular weight and branching frequency compared to the use of NiL without coadditives. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic study of the effect of secondary metal ions on metal-catalyzed polymerization processes and offers a new general design strategy for developing the next generation of high performance olefin polymerization catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3aethylene 3alithium 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3aolefin 3aphosphine 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3apotassium 3asodium 3atitration1 aXiao, Dawei1 aDo, Loi H.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 137, no. 49 p.15501-15510dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b103513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01468naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245023300165500002200398520028100420592002800701650005900729650002600788650001500814650002900829650001500858650001200873700001800885700001500903700002400918773010800942856008301050852000901133655001201142IND60714162920221121062648.0210209e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071416292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japr.2020.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, D.V.T.10aWITHDRAWN: Effect of supplementation of a dairy-originated probiotic bacterium, Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii, on the cecal microbiome of turkeys challenged with multidrug-resistant Salmonella Heidelberg  aPre-press version  aThis article has been withdrawn at the request of the author(s) and/or editor.

The objective of this study was to evaluate vegetation-activated sludge process (V-ASP) that simultaneously achieved the improvement of decentralized wastewater treatment performance and reduction of GHGs emission, in contrast to conventional ASP. With the same organic and nitrogen loading rates and operational modes, V-ASP achieved a decreasing of 19.79% for total GHGs emission in comparison to ASP. From the microbial community analysis on activated sludge microbes and plant roots, V-ASP had a much lower abundance of Chloroflexi, and a comparable abundance of denitrifiers, in contrast to conventional ASP, which likely correlated with the differences of CH₄ production and emission. Specifically, it was noted that the relatively higher abundance of mcrA and nirS genes in the V-ASP would take a certain responsible for reducing CH₄ and N₂O emission, respectively. The V-ASP also demonstrated the increased enzymatic activities, such as ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO), which could help to reduce GHGs emission flux. It was proved that V-ASP process, compared to the traditional ASP process, was an effective decentralized wastewater treatment technique for reducing GHGs emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChloroflexi 3aactivated sludge 3aammonia monooxygenase 3adecontamination 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3agreenhouses 3ahydroxylamine 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3awastewater treatment 0aDecentralized wastewater treatment 0aGreenhouse gases (GHGs) 0aVegetation-activated sludge process (V-ASP) 0aDecontaminated plants1 aDong, Zi-Jun1 aLi, Pu1 aYan, Wei-Jia1 aYuan, Jia-Jia1 aDong, Wen-Yi1 aSun, Fei-Yun1 aShao, Yun-Xian0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 362 p.132341-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1323413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001600260520143100276592002801707650002001735650001101755650002401766650001301790650002101803650001101824650001501835650001401850651001501864700002101879700002201900700003001922773010901952856008102061852000902142655001202151IND60579547820221120041457.0170822e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057954782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-017-0361-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustafsson, Erik10aKey processes in the coupled carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling of the Baltic Sea  ap. 301-317.  aIn this study we examine pools of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the Baltic Sea, both simulated and reconstructed from observations. We further quantify key fluxes in the C, N, and P cycling. Our calculations include pelagic reservoirs as well as the storage in the active sediment layer, which allows a complete coverage of the overall C, N, and P cycling on a system-scale. A striking property of C versus N and P cycling is that while the external supplies of total N and P (TN and TP) are largely balanced by internal removal processes, the total carbon (TC) supply is mainly compensated by a net export out of the system. In other words, external inputs of TN and TP are, in contrast to TC, rather efficiently filtered within the Baltic Sea. Further, there is a net export of TN and TP out of the system, but a net import of dissolved inorganic N and P (DIN and DIP). There is on the contrary a net export of both the organic and inorganic fractions of TC. While the pelagic pools of TC and TP are dominated by inorganic compounds, TN largely consists of organic N because allochthonous organic N is poorly degradable. There are however large basin-wise differences in C, N, and P elemental ratios as well as in inorganic versus organic fractions. These differences reflect both the differing ratios in external loads and differing oxygen conditions determining the redox-dependent fluxes of DIN and DIP.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon 3ainorganic compounds 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3asediments 3aBaltic Sea1 aSavchuk, Oleg P.1 aGustafsson, Bo G.1 aMüller-Karulis, Bärbel,0 tBiogeochemistry.g2017 Aug., v. 134, no. 3 p.301-317dSpringer International Publishingx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0361-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245019400207300001600401520242900417592002802846596002802874650001802902650001402920650001602934650001602950650001702966650002102983650001903004650002303023650002003046650001103066650002403077650001403101650001103115650002603126650001903152650001403171650001303185650002203198650002703220650002203247650002503269650001603294650001503310650001803325650001703343650003203360700002103392700002603413700002603439700001803465773012803483856008203611852000903693655001203702IND60588993820221120022813.0201230e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058899382DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-017-2540-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulce Iz, Sultan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9275-627212aA BioDesign Approach to Obtain High Yields of Biosimilars by Anti-apoptotic Cell Engineering: a Case Study to Increase the Production Yield of Anti-TNF Alpha Producing Recombinant CHO Cells  ap. 303-322.  aRecent developments in medical biotechnology have facilitated to enhance the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and recombinant proteins in mammalian cells. Human mAbs for clinical applications have focused on three areas, particularly cancer, immunological disorders, and infectious diseases. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which has both proinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, is an important target in biopharmaceutical industry. In this study, a humanized anti-TNF-α mAb producing stable CHO cell line which produces a biosimilar of Humira (adalimumab) was used. Adalimumab is a fully human anti-TNF mAb among the top-selling mAb products in recent years as a biosimilar. Products from mammalian cell bioprocesses are a derivative of cell viability and metabolism, which is mainly disrupted by cell death in bioreactors. Thus, different strategies are used to increase the product yield. Suppression of apoptosis, also called anti-apoptotic cell engineering, is the most remarkable strategy to enhance lifetime of cells for a longer production period. In fact, using anti-apoptotic cell engineering as a BioDesign approach was inspired by nature; nature gives prolonged life span to some cells like stem cells, tumor cells, and memory B and T cells, and researchers have been using this strategy for different purposes. In this study, as a biomimicry approach, anti-apoptotic cell engineering was used to increase the anti-TNF-α mAb production from the humanized anti-TNF-α mAb producing stable CHO cell line by Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic protein. It was shown that transient transfection of CHO cells by the Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic protein expressing plasmid prolonged the cell survival rate and protected cells from apoptosis. The transient expression of Bcl-xL using CHO cells enhanced the anti-TNF-α production. The production of anti-TNF-α in CHO cells was increased up to 215 mg/L with an increase of 160% after cells were transfected with Bcl-xL expressing plasmid with polyethylenimine (PEI) reagent at the ratio of 1:6 (DNA:PEI). In conclusion, the anti-apoptotic efficacy of the Bcl-xL expressing plasmid in humanized anti-TNF-α MAb producing stable CHO cells is compatible with curative effect for high efficiency recombinant protein production. Thus, this model can be used for large-scale production of biosimilars through transient Bcl-xL gene expression as a cost-effective method.  aPublisher supplied data  a1919B011402737cTUBITAK 3aT-lymphocytes 3aapoptosis 3abiomimetics 3abioreactors 3acase studies 3acell engineering 3acell viability 3acost effectiveness 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3alongevity 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aplasmids 3apolyethyleneimine 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3aresearchers 3astem cells 3asurvival rate 3atransfection 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aInevi, Muge Anil1 aMetiner, Pelin Saglam1 aTamis, Duygu Ayyildiz1 aKisbet, Nazli0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 184, no. 1 p.303-322dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-017-2540-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245003100165300002000196520105600216592002801272650001001300650001301310700001901323700002501342700002301367773013401390856007801524852000901602655001201611IND60541676420221120151655.0160822e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054167642DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b105862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdolf, Cyril

The design and fabrication of complex crystalline systems as networks of crystals displaying task-specific properties is a step toward smart materials. Here we report on isostructural and almost isometric molecular crystals of different colors, their use for fabrication of core–shell crystals, and their welding by 3D epitaxial growth into networks of crystals as single-crystalline entities. Welding of crystals by self-assembly processes into macroscopic networks of crystals is a powerful strategy for the design of hierarchically organized periodic complex architectures composed of different subdomains displaying targeted characteristics. Crystal welding may be regarded as a first step toward the design of new hierarchically organized complex crystalline systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acrystals1 aFerlay, Sylvie1 aKyritsakas, Nathalie1 aHosseini, Mir Wais0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 137, no. 49 p.15390-15393dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b105863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01774naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245009900176300001600275520079300291592002801084650001301112650001801125650001601143650001301159650002201172653002301194653001501217653002201232773010901254856008801363852000901451655001201460IND60691506020221121002400.0200430e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069150602DNAL7 a10.2752/175174410X126339344631962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera, Cristina10a“Delfina, ¡más tacos!”bFood, Culture and Motherhood in Denise Chávez'sA Taco Testimony  ap. 241-256.  aThis paper offers a discussion of A Taco Testimony: Meditations on Family, Food, and Culture, the memoir by Chicana writer Denise Chávez. I argue that Chávez experiences the act of eating and preparing Mexican food as a critique of racism and as a way for her to assert her Mexicanidad or “Mexicanness.” More importantly, it is her mother's food that instills Chávez with pride in her ethnic heritage, providing her with the tools necessary to critique and resist various forms of oppression that she faces as a Chicana. As the paper explains, the food provided by Delfina Rede Faver Chávez feeds her daughter's political consciousness. Chávez's memoir is very recent, yet as I discuss, much food scholarship has not extensively studied the contributions made by Chicana writers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMexicans 3aconsciousness 3afood intake 3apolitics 3atraditional foods 0aChicana literature 0amotherhood 0aChicana daughters0 tFood, culture, & society.g2010 June 1, v. 13, no. 2 p.241-256dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/175174410X126339344631963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011100156520128700267592002801554650001201582650001201594650001101606650005001617650001901667650001501686650001501701650001601716650002101732650001501753651001001768700001701778700001301795700001801808700001401826700001601840700001701856700002101873700001601894700001101910773012901921856007402050852000902124655001202133IND60652624120221122064451.0190713e20180928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065262412DNAL7 a10.3390/su101034592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Shu-Di10aImproving Spatial Soil Moisture Representation through the Integration of SMAP and <i>PROBA-V</i> Products  aTo increase the spatial resolution of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), this study modifies the downscaling factor model based on the Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) using data from the Project for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA-V). In the modified model, TVDI parameters were derived from the temperature-vegetation space and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). This study was conducted in the north China region using SMAP, PROBA-V, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite images. The 9-km spatial resolution SMAP data was downscaled to 0.3-km spatial resolution soil moisture using a modified downscaling method. Downscaling accuracies from the original and modified downscaling factor models were compared based on field observations. The results show that both methods generated similar spatial distributions in which soil moisture estimates increased as vegetation coverage increased from built-up areas to forest. However, based on the root mean square error between observations and estimations, the modified model demonstrated an increased estimation accuracy of 4.2% for soil moisture compared to the original method. This study also implies that downscaled soil moisture shows promise as a data source for subsequent watershed scale studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aforests 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asoil water 3atemperature 3avegetation index 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aHu, Yue-Ming1 aWang, Lu1 aLiu, Zhen-Hua1 aShi, Zhou1 aWu, Wen-Bin1 aPan, Yu-Chun1 aWang, Guang-Xing1 aZhu, A-Xing1 aLi, Bo0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 28, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101034593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003400148245012300182300001100305520163900316592002801955650002801983650001002011650002102021650001602042650001002058650001402068650001002082650001402092650001402106650000902120650001602129650001302145650002402158650001402182650001202196700002702208700002002235700002302255700002302278700002902301700001402330700002002344700006302364773011502427856008302542852000902625655001202634IND60780978420221118090802.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078097842DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-022-01063-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapageorgiou, Konstantinos V.10aBartha-K61 vaccine protects nursery pigs against challenge with novel european and asian strains of suid herpesvirus 1  ap. 47.  aThe present study investigates the pathogenicity of two recently isolated strains of Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV1), the Greek strain Hercules and the Chinese strain HeN1, in unvaccinated pigs and in pigs vaccinated with a Bartha-K61 strain. In an experiment performed in negative pressure kiosks (isolators), 45-day old seronegative pigs previously oronasally /intramuscularly vaccinated with the Bartha-K61 vaccine strain, along with unvaccinated controls, were challenged either with the Hercules strain or the HeN1 strain of SuHV1. All animals were observed daily for clinical signs and body temperature and nasal swabs, faeces, blood and bodyweight were collected up to a maximum period of 20 days post-challenge (dpc). The results showed that, in the unvaccinated pigs, HeN1 strain was more virulent than the Hercules strain, with increased mortality, shorter time to death and higher group clinical score (p < 0.05). However, after vaccination with the Bartha-K61 vaccine, there was a drastic reduction in morbidity, mortality, bodyweight loss and virus excretion to almost a similar extent in both strains (p < 0.05). No significant differences were seen among the pigs of the two vaccinated groups compared to unvaccinated unchallenged controls, except a slight elevation in body temperature and in clinical score in the HeN1 vaccinees at 2 and 3 dpc, while bodyweight gain was similar to that of the negative control pigs. Our study showed that despite differences in virulence, the standard vaccination scheme with the Bartha-K61 strain could equally protect nursery pigs against both the European and Chinese strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3ablood 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3adeath 3aexcretion 3afeces 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anose 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aveterinary medicine 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aMichailidou, Margarita1 aGrivas, Ioannis1 aPetridou, Evanthia1 aStamelou, Efthymia1 aEfraimidis, Konstantinos1 aChen, Lei1 aDrew, Trevor W.1 aKritas, Spyridon K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3540-99280 tBMC veterinary research.g2022 Dec., v. 53, no. 1 p.47-47dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-022-01063-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009800175300001600273520071500289592002801004650001201032650001501044650001101059650002301070653001301093653001401106653001101120653001701131653001901148773010901167856008801276852000901364655001201373IND60691506120221121024330.0200430e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069150612DNAL7 a10.2752/175174410X126339344632312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrangleman, Tim10aFood, Drink and the Cultures of WorkbConsumption in the Life and Death of an English Factory  ap. 257-278.  aThis paper looks at the consumption of food and drink in the context of the workplace.

This study aimed to characterize the elemental and carbonaceous composition of total suspended particles (TSP) and PM₁₀ in Ahvaz, Iran. TSP and PM₁₀ samples were collected using two separate high-volume air samplers. The sampling program was performed according to EPA guidelines and resulted in 72 samples. Twenty-eight elements and two carbonaceous components in TSP and PM₁₀ were measured. Over the entire study period, the mean concentration (SD) of TSP and PM₁₀ was 1548.72 μg/m³ (1965.11 μg/m³) and 1152.35 μg/m³ (1510.34 μg/m³), respectively. The order of concentrations of major species were Si > Al > Ca > OC > Na > B > Zn > Mn > K > Mg and Si > Ca > Al > Na > OC > B > K > Mn > Cu > Mg for TSP and PM₁₀, respectively. Almost all elements (except for Cd, Cr, and Cu) and carbonaceous components (except for organic carbon) had dust days/non-dust days (DD/NDD) ratios higher than 1, implying that all components are somehow affected by dust storms. Crustal elements constituted the major portion of particles for both TSP and PM₁₀ in both DDs and NDDs. The enrichment factor of elements such as Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti was near unity. Species such as Al, Ca, Fe, K, Na, Si, and EC had high correlation coefficients in both TSP and PM₁₀ (except for EC). In conclusion, Ahvaz is exposed to high concentrations of TSP and PM₁₀ during the MED period. Immediate actions must be planned to decrease the high concentrations of particulate matter in Ahvaz’s ambient air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaluminum 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acarbon 3achromium 3acities 3acopper 3acorrelation 3adust 3adust storms 3aguidelines 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aparticulates 3apotassium 3asamplers 3asilicon 3asodium 3azinc 3aIran1 aYarahmadi, Maryam1 aHadei, Mostafa1 aSowlat, Mohammad Hossein1 aNaddafi, Kazem0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 Sept., v. 189, no. 9 p.462-462dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6182-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015900162300001800321520127500339592002801614596005001642596005901692596005901751596009001810596009201900596005301992650002102045650001302066650002502079650001602104650002302120650002202143650001202165650002002177650004302197650001702240650002902257700001302286700001302299700001802312700001602330700001302346700001502359700001402374700001702388700001302405700005402418773012402472856008302596852000902679655001202688IND60782532620221120194546.0220710e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078253262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07277-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Ding10aExpression of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in the hippocampus of lithium-pilocarpine-induced acute epileptic rats  ap. 5805-5810.  aBACKGROUND: Epilepsy is characterised by abnormal neuronal discharges, including aberrant expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and synaptic plasticity stabilisation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) interact to remodel the ECM in the central nervous system (CNS), to modulate synaptic plasticity in epileptogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, the expression of MMP activators (tPA and uPA), 10 MMPs, and 3 TIMPs was detected by western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to assess their potential pathogenetic role in the epileptogenesis in the hippocampus of lithium-pilocarpine hydrochloride-induced epileptic rats. Our results showed that The expression of MMP7 and MMP14 was impeded in the hippocampus of lithium-pilocarpine-induced acute epileptic rats compared with that in controls. The transcriptional level of tPA was enhanced on day 1 post-seizure in the hippocampus, while the levels of several MMPs and TIMPs did not change on days 1 and 3 post-seizure compared with that in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of MMPs and TIMPs reflects a novel feature of epileptogenesis and may offer new perspectives for future therapeutic interventions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019BEB04041cKey R&D Plan Project of Ningxia  a81960232cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a82001282cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXT2019018cYouth Talents Supporting Program of Ningxia Medical University and Ningxia  aTJGC2019081cYouth Talents Supporting Program of Ningxia Medical University and Ningxia  a2018A0597cNatural Science Foundation of Ningxia 3aWestern blotting 3aepilepsy 3aextracellular matrix 3ahippocampus 3ametalloproteinases 3amolecular biology 3aneurons 3aneuroplasticity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics)1 aYang, Lu1 aRen, Jia1 aHuang, Haiyue1 aZhang, Chen1 aChen, Le1 aSu, Xueyao1 aHuang, Qi1 aNiu, Jianguo1 aSun, Tao1 aWang, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8594-37660 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 July, v. 49, no. 7 p.5805-5810dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07277-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002500192100001800217245008300235300001600318506007600334520167500410592002802085596005802113596005802171596005802229596002902287596002702316596005802343596005802401596002702459506003702486650002002523650001902543650001302562650002302575650001802598650001602616650002102632650002402653650002402677650001302701700002102714700002002735700002602755773011802781856008502899852000902984655001202993IND60672653920221207113519.0191017e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067265392DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty5652doi7 aPMC63300072pmcid7 a299823872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumitrașcu, Bianca,1 aHancock, John10aStatistical tests for detecting variance effects in quantitative trait studies  ap. 200-210.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIdentifying variants, both discrete and continuous, that are associated with quantitative traits, or QTs, is the primary focus of quantitative genetics. Most current methods are limited to identifying mean effects, or associations between genotype or covariates and the mean value of a quantitative trait. It is possible, however, that a variant may affect the variance of the quantitative trait in lieu of, or in addition to, affecting the trait mean. Here, we develop a general methodology to identify covariates with variance effects on a quantitative trait using a Bayesian heteroskedastic linear regression model (BTH). We compare BTH with existing methods to detect variance effects across a large range of simulations drawn from scenarios common to the analysis of quantitative traits. We find that BTH and a double generalized linear model (dglm) outperform classical tests used for detecting variance effects in recent genomic studies. We show BTH and dglm are less likely to generate spurious discoveries through simulations and application to identifying methylation variance QTs and expression variance QTs. We identify four variance effects of sex in the Cardiovascular and Pharmacogenetics study. Our work is the first to offer a comprehensive view of variance identifying methodology. We identify shortcomings in previously used methodology and provide a more conservative and robust alternative. We extend variance effect analysis to a wide array of covariates that enables a new statistical dimension in the study of sex and age specific quantitative trait effects. https://github.com/b2du/bth.

Knowing these values would be an important input into the recently developed concept of Soil Security. This paper aimed at closing this gap for a broad set of soil functions valued at the regional level in the Veneto region in Italy and New South Wales in Australia. The study not only elicits non‐market values by a choice experiment but also investigates the impact of personal norm activation and social norms on stated preferences, by a hybrid choice model with multiple latent variables. As the survey was conducted in two countries, our study offers evidence of the external validity of both social norm effects and personal norm activation. The results reveal that respondents positively value the conservation of the soil functions and that both personal norm activation and social norm clearly affect stated preferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystems 3ahybrids 3amodels 3arain 3asoil 3asoil degradation 3asurveys 3aItaly1 aLiebe, Ulf1 aThiene, Mara1 aMeyerhoff, Jürgen1 aField, Damien1 aMcBratney, A.

Signal identification and decomposition are accordingly main objectives in statistical biomedical modeling and data analysis. Existing methods, aimed at signal reconstruction and deconvolution, in general, are either supervised, contain parameters that need to be estimated or present other types of ad hoc features. We here introduce SubMatrix Selection Singular Value Decomposition (SMSSVD), a parameter-free unsupervised signal decomposition and dimension reduction method, designed to reduce noise, adaptively for each low-rank-signal in a given data matrix, and represent the signals in the data in a way that enable unbiased exploratory analysis and reconstruction of multiple overlaid signals, including identifying groups of variables that drive different signals. The SMSSVD method produces a denoised signal decomposition from a given data matrix. It also guarantees orthogonality between signal components in a straightforward manner and it is designed to make automation possible. We illustrate SMSSVD by applying it to several real and synthetic datasets and compare its performance to golden standard methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and SPC (Sparse Principal Components, using Lasso constraints). The SMSSVD is computationally efficient and despite being a parameter-free method, in general, outperforms existing statistical learning methods. A Julia implementation of SMSSVD is openly available on GitHub (https://github.com/rasmushenningsson/SubMatrixSelectionSVD.jl).

To this end, it estimates CoVaR functions for directly linked market pairs (farm–wholesale and wholesale–retail) along the relevant supply chains using quantile regressions. Over the total sample (1980–2020) and two sub‐samples (1980–1999 and 2000–2020), the beef industry appears to exhibit a higher degree of price risk connectedness relative to the pork industry. Positive and negative tail price events are transmitted between markets with the same intensity. However, tail price events (irrespective of sign) are likely to spillover with greater intensity backwards in the supply chain than forwards. This pattern of transmission may be a cause of concern about the efficiency of alternative meat marketing arrangements as risk‐sharing instruments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abeef industry 3amarkets 3apork 3apork industry 3aprices 3arisk 3asupply chain 3atail1 aTzaferi, Dimitra0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2022 Apr., v. 66, no. 2 p.383-399dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55734x1364-985X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.124553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245008500182300001800267520151800285592002801803596006901831596004901900596004401949596003101993596004702024596004102071596006102112650001902173650001102192650001702203700002102220700001802241700002202259700001902281700002302300700001802323773012202341856008502463852000902548655001202557IND60672654120221119120147.0191017e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067265412DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty5672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDadi, Temesgen Hailemariam10aDREAM-Yara: an exact read mapper for very large databases with short update time  ap. i766-i772.  aMapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very large databases (e.g. >10 GB) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full-text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about 1 day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times. To solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time.

Socioeconomic, dietary, lifestyle and environmental factors are considered as influencing factors, whereupon sex differences in predictors of vitamin D status are rarely investigated. The purpose of this study is to identify the main predictors of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ [25(OH)D₃] concentrations in elderly subjects by taking into account potential sex differences. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study in 162 independently living German elderly aged 66 to 96 years. Serum 25(OH)D₃ concentrations were assessed by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of 25(OH)D₃ concentrations stratified by sex. RESULTS: Median 25(OH)D₃ concentration was 64 nmol/L and none of the subjects had 25(OH)D₃ concentrations < 25 nmol/L. In women, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (β = -0.323), % total body fat (β = -0.208), time spent outdoors (β = 0.328), month of blood sampling (β = 0.229) and intake of vitamin D supplements (β = 0.172) were the predominant predictors of 25(OH)D₃, whereas in men, iPTH (β = -0.254), smoking (β = -0.282), physical activity (β = 0.336) and monthly household net income (β = 0.302) predicted 25(OH)D₃ concentrations. The final regression models accounted for 30% and 32% of the variance in 25(OH)D₃ concentrations in women and men, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that 25(OH)D₃ concentrations are influenced by body composition, month of blood sampling, economic factors, lifestyle, supplement intake and iPTH, but may not be associated with age, sex, dietary factors, kidney function and presence of selected chronic diseases in community-dwelling elderly. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for sex-specific determinants of the vitamin D status, which ought to be considered for preventive strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abody fat 3achronic diseases 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3aeconomic factors 3aelderly 3aenvironmental factors 3agender differences 3aimmunoassays 3aincome 3alifestyle 3amen 3ametabolism 3anutrient intake 3aparathyroid hormone 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3arenal function 3avariance 3avitamin status 3awomen1 aNeuhäuser-Berthold, Monika0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.627-627dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-12-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245012100211300001100332520204500343592002802388596011502416650002002531650001302551650001102564650001502575650001402590650001002604650002702614650001802641650001102659650001902670650001302689650000902702650001702711650001602728651001502744700007002759700002502829700006702854773012602921856008303047852000903130655001203139IND60780978820221118090955.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078097882DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-022-00797-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Md.

Government-endorsed recommendations are developed to deliver the best evidence-based advice on balanced fertilizer; however, deviations of farmers’ nutrient use from the recommendations are rarely examined. This study chose the salt-affected coastal zone of the Ganges Delta, where low crop productivity and cropping intensity by smallholders limit their income, to determine current nutrient use gaps for the first time of three cropping patterns in two representative districts of Bangladesh. A total of 246 farms were surveyed from three farm sizes. Farmers’ nutrient use gaps were compared with Fertilizer Recommendation Guides published in 2012 (FRG-2012) and 2018 (FRG-2018). Relative to FRG-2012 recommendations, farmers used 12%, 70%, and 11% overdoses of N, P, and K, respectively, under two fully rice-based cropping patterns, but the level of overdoses increased with farm size. Rates of K (14%), S (28%), and Zn use were below the FRG-2012 recommendations, especially for the smallest category of farms. However, the FRG-2018, increased recommended N (5%), K (62%), S (12%), and Zn rates but reduced P (25%) rates for fully rice-based cropping patterns. In contrast with rice, regardless of farm size, farmers applied overdose nutrients to watermelon but compensated with underdoses in the subsequent monsoon rice implying that farmers prioritized fertilizer expenditure on the most profitable crop. For the cropping pattern with watermelon, farmers could reduce the use of N (69%) and P (46%) and increase the use of K (48%), S (5%), and B. Reducing NPK use gaps can save treasury for both the farmers and the governments by 39.1 and 73.8 USD ha⁻¹, respectively, under fully rice-based cropping patterns. Finally, our findings suggest there is scope to promote crop yields and sustainable intensification through balanced fertilizer use in a vulnerable saline region.  aPublisher supplied data  aACIAR Project LWR/2016/136 & (CN/FRPP):ICP-IIcAustralian Centre for International Agricultural Research & KGF 3aNPK fertilizers 3aagronomy 3acoasts 3acrop yield 3afarm size 3afarms 3afertilizer application 3afood security 3aincome 3amonsoon season 3aoverdose 3arice 3ariver deltas 3awatermelons 3aBangladesh1 aBell, R.

This study assesses the economy-wide and regional effects of climate change-induced productivity and labor supply shocks in Ethiopian agriculture. We pursue a structural approach that blends biophysical and economic models. We consider different crop yield projections and add a regionalization to the country-wide CGE results. The study shows, in the worst case scenario, the effects on country-wide GDP may add up to &minus;8%. The effects on regional value-added GDP are uneven and range from &minus;10% to +2.5%. However, plausible cost-free exogenous structural change scenarios in labor skills and marketing margins may offset about 20&ndash;30% of these general equilibrium effects. As such, the ongoing structural transformation in the country may underpin the resilience of the economy to climate change. This can be regarded as a co-benefit of structural change in the country. Nevertheless, given the role of the sector in the current economic structure and the potency of the projected biophysical impacts, adaptation in agriculture is imperative. Otherwise, climate change may make rural livelihoods unpredictable and strain the country&rsquo;s economic progress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3adeveloping countries 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic impact 3aeconomic structure 3alabor 3alivelihood 3amarketing 3aplanning 3avalue added 3aEthiopia1 aHirte, Georg1 aLotze-Campen, Hermann1 aTscharaktschiew, Stefan0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 28, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101034643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009500166300001600261520079300277592002801070650001201098650002001110650001101130650001801141650001401159650001501173650001701188650002001205700001501225700001601240700001401256700001401270700001501284773007801299856008401377852000901461655001201470IND60095307820221121014847.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009530782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChien, C.C.10aTheoretical and experimental investigations of a two-phase thermosyphon solar water heater  ap. 415-423.  aThis article experimentally and theoretically investigates a two-phase thermosyphon solar water heater. The performance of this innovative solar water heater at different solar radiation intensities and tilt angles are experimentally discussed. The results show the best charge efficiency of the system is 82%, which is higher than the conventional solar water heaters. The theoretical model is also developed using the thermal resistance-capacitor method. The simulation predictions agree well with the experimental data within an average error deviation of ±6%. Two methods for improving the performance of this heater, double fin tubes and nano particle, are proposed. The results show that charge efficiencies can increase 3% and 4%, respectively, according to the theoretical model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheaters 3alight intensity 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3aprediction 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation1 aKung, C.K.1 aChang, C.C.1 aLee, W.S.1 aJwo, C.S.1 aChen, S.L.0 tEnergy.g2011 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.415-423dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014600171300001200317520144100329592002801770650003701798650002101835650001501856650000901871650001501880650001701895650001301912650000701925650001101932650001601943700002201959700002601981773010302007856008602110990002302196852000902219655001202228IND60113213220221117083138.0141111e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011321322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVölker, Edgar10aFormation, characterization and electrocatalytic activity of layer-by-layer self-assembled films containing polyoxomolybdate over Au surfaces  ap. 1-7.  aWe describe a novel strategy for the controlled fabrication of well-defined multilayer films incorporating a polyoxomolybdate anion (PMo₁₂O₄₀ ³⁻, POM) via ion exchange on Au electrodes. Composite films were thoroughly characterized by ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FTIR-ATR, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). XPS and FTIR-ATR measurements showed that the Keggin structure of polyoxomolybdates is maintained as they are incorporated into the film. QCM experiments demonstrated that larger amounts of POM are incorporated into thicker film electrodes. EQCM and XPS measurements further showed that part of the film is delaminated when the modified electrodes were submerged in acid or basic solutions, but after this initial loss of mass the electrodes remain stable in time and with electrochemical use. POM-modified electrodes showed a pH-dependent electrochemical behavior, with peak potentials shifting by −60mVpH⁻¹, characteristic of a 2e/2H⁺ redox process at room temperature. Furthermore, our results suggest that POM molecules in the film are not decomposed when the electrodes are immersed in solutions with pH=4.8 a key finding as POM molecules in solution suffer from complete hydrolysis at this pH value. Finally, the performance of these POM-modified electrodes as electrocatalysts was assessed via the reduction of nitrite, chlorate and peroxodisulfate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahydrolysis 3aion exchange 3anitrites 3apH 3aquartz 3atemperature1 aCalvo, Ernesto J.1 aWilliams, Federico J.0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2012 May 15, v. 673 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245007200168300002000240520119000260592002801450650002201478650002301500650002301523650002101546650002201567650002201589650001301611700002001624700001601644700002001660773012101680856008101801852000901882655001201891IND60587128120221122001038.0171215e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058712812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b023012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimoyama, Daisuke10aSynthesis and Structure of Feet-to-Feet Connected Bisresorcinarenes  ap. 13220-13230.  aBisresorcinarenes 1a–d were obtained in excellent yields, and 1e was finally obtained in 50% yield. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that 1a and 1b adopted helical conformations, whereas the two resorcinarenes of 1c–e were in parallel orientations in which the clefts of the aliphatic chains entrapped one or two solvent molecules. The conformational study revealed that the helix interconversion between the (P)- and (M)-helical conformers depended on the length of the aliphatic chains. 1a had the largest energetic barrier to helix interconversion, while in 1b, its more flexible aliphatic chains lowered its energetic barriers. The P/M interconversion of 1a was coupled with the clockwise/anticlockwise interconversion of the interannular hydrogen bonding of the two resorcinarenes. The large negative entropic contributions indicate that the transition state is most likely more ordered than the ground states, suggesting that the transition state is most likely symmetric and is solvated by water molecules. Calculations at the M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) level revealed that the more stable (P)-conformation has clockwise interannular hydrogen bonding between the two resorcinarenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3ahydrogen bonding 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3asolvents1 aIkeda, Toshiaki1 aSekiya, Ryo1 aHaino, Takeharu0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 82, no. 24 p.13220-13230dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b023013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015400169520175600323592002802079650001002107650001202117650002602129650002302155650002102178650002202199650001302221650002402234650001902258650002302277650000902300650002102309650001802330650002702348650001502375650001402390650001802404650002002422650001302442653000802455653001902463700002002482700002202502700006002524773011702584856008602701852000902787655001202796IND60654474620221119190419.0190807e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.1116002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajeed, Aasim10aTranscriptome characterization and development of functional polymorphic SSR marker resource for Himalayan endangered species, Taxus contorta (Griff)  aTaxus contorta is an important medicinal plant currently listed as endangered in IUCN Red Data List.

Moreover, large scale polymorphic informative codominant marker resource is also scarce which hinders its population and landscape genetic analysis. Here, we generated a reference transcriptome for this species which would facilitate the understanding of the functional elements and promote genomic research in this species. Also, a robust polymorphic SSR marker resource was characterized which can be used in conservation of this species. More than 100 million paired end raw reads were obtained through Illumina sequencing. A total of 129,869 unigenes with mean sequence length of 1244 nt were obtained from 209,860 de novo assembled transcripts. Of these, 35,752 transcripts were assigned 5971 unique GO terms. Around 40,386 transcripts were found to have 2163 unique Pfam Ids. Pathway analysis against KEGG database yielded 3721 unique enzyme numbers. Screening of the transcripts for microsatellite regions yielded 7041 SSRs. Among the 100 SSRs selected for characterization on 30 genotypes, 37 polymorphic markers showed a total of 214 alleles with mean of 5.78 alleles per locus. Mean effective number of alleles (Ne) was found to be 3.64 and average PIC value of 0.64 was observed. Observed heterozygosity (0.57) was found to be lower than expected (0.69). This effective polymorphic SSR marker resource will act as valuable tool for deciphering its genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaxus 3aalleles 3aantineoplastic agents 3aendangered species 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahabitat destruction 3aheterozygosity 3alandscape genetics 3aloci 3amedicinal plants 3amessenger RNA 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apaclitaxel 3ascreening 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 0aSSR 0aRNA sequencing1 aSingh, Amandeep1 aChoudhary, Shruti1 aBhardwaj, Pankaj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9201-16090 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 140 p.111600-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.1116003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005100171300001600222520081200238592002801050650000801078650001301086650001201099650002001111650001001131650002401141650000901165650001201174650001101186650002501197700001801222700002201240773009501262856008501357852000901442655001201451IND60113446720221121012910.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011344672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrels, Wiebke10aPrecision genetic engineering in large mammals  ap. 386-393.  aPrecision genetic engineering based on stable chromosomal insertion of exogenous DNA in the genomes of large mammals is immensely important for the development of improved biomedical models, pharmaceutical research and an accelerated breeding progress.

Here, we present the long-sought high-resolution structure of the yeast PIC and define the mechanism of initial DNA opening. We trap the PIC in an intermediate state that contains half a turn of open DNA located 30–35 base pairs downstream of the TATA box. The initially opened DNA region is flanked and stabilized by the polymerase “clamp head loop” and the TFIIF “charged region” that both contribute to promoter-initiated transcription. TFIIE facilitates initiation by buttressing the clamp head loop and by regulating the TFIIH translocase. The initial DNA bubble is then extended in the upstream direction, leading to the open promoter complex and enabling start-site scanning and RNA synthesis. This unique mechanism of DNA opening may permit more intricate regulation than in the Pol I and Pol III systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3aTATA box 3ahead 3atranscription initiation 3ayeasts 0apre-initiation complex 0atranscription factors 0aRNA polymerase II 0apromoter DNA opening 0apromoter DNA melting 0atranscription bubble 0ain vitro transcription 0acryo-electron microscopy 0astructure1 aAibara, Shintaro1 aDienemann, Christian1 aGrabbe, Frauke1 aCramer, Patrick0 tCell.g2021 July 22, v. 184, no. 15 p.4064-4072.e28dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007000167300001600237520124100253592002801494650002201522650001801544650001701562650001401579650001701593650001801610650001101628650001001639650001901649650001901668650001501687650001601702650000901718650002101727650000901748650001401757700001701771700002201788700001701810773009501827856008501922852000902007655001202016IND60087881820221120092828.0141102e20120104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008788182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKivelä, R.10aOxidation of oat β-glucan in aqueous solutions during processing  ap. 589-597.  aThe study investigated carbonyl group formation along the chain and the chain cleavage of cereal β-glucan during heat treatments, high pressure homogenisation, cold storage and ascorbic acid treatment of aqueous solutions of this soluble dietary fibre. The carbonyl group content and its distribution along the chain were simultaneously determined with the chain cleavage using a HPSEC/labelling method, originally developed for water-insoluble cellulose. Ascorbic acid treatment resulted in a relatively high degree of carbonyl content and extensive degradation of β-glucan, even in concentrations typically found in foods. The thermal oxidation of the β-glucan was considerable at 120°C in a β-glucan solution with co-extracted compounds from oat ingredient, and in the highly purified solutions in presence of ferrous ions. Oxidation also probably contributed to the molecular properties during high pressure homogenisation, even thou the main degradation mechanism is the hydrolysis caused by mechanical energy. In addition to the cleavage of the β-glucan chain, the formation of compact, high molar mass species or molecule clusters were obtained in the study after ascorbic acid, heat (120°C) and homogenisation treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-glucans 3acellulose 3acold storage 3adietary fiber 3aenergy 3afoods 3aheat treatment 3ahomogenization 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3aions 3amolecular weight 3aoats 3aoxidation1 aHenniges, U.1 aSontag-Strohm, T.1 aPotthast, A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Jan. 4, v. 87, no. 1 p.589-597dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168300001600271520144200287592002801729650001301757650001501770650002201785650002101807650002601828650001101854650001301865650001601878650001601894700001501910700001201925700001801937773007801955856008402033852000902117655001202126IND60095308020221121055840.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009530802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, M.H.10aMulti-objective optimization of the airfoil shape of Wells turbine used for wave energy conversion  ap. 438-446.  aWells turbine is one of the technical systems allowing an efficient use of the power contained in oceans’ and seas’ waves with a relatively low investment level. It converts the pneumatic power of the air stream induced by an Oscillating Water Column into mechanical energy. The standard Wells turbines show several well-known disadvantages: low tangential force, leading to low power output from the turbine; high undesired axial force; usually a low aerodynamic efficiency and a limited range of operation due to stall. In the present work an optimization process is employed in order to increase the tangential force induced by a monoplane Wells turbine using symmetric airfoil blades. The automatic optimization procedure is carried out by coupling an in-house optimization library (OPAL (OPtimization ALgorithms)) with an industrial CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code (ANSYS-Fluent). This multi-objective optimization relying on Evolutionary Algorithms takes into account both tangential force coefficient and turbine efficiency. Detailed comparisons are finally presented between the optimal design and the classical Wells turbine using symmetric airfoils, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed solution. The optimization of the airfoil shape leads to a considerably increased power output (average relative gain of +11.3%) and simultaneously to an increase of efficiency (+1%) throughout the full operating range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aalgorithms 3aenergy conversion 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3aoceans 3aturbines 3awater power 3awater waves1 aJaniga, G.1 aPap, E.1 aThévenin, D.0 tEnergy.g2011 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.438-446dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2010.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011900171520137000290592002801660650002101688650001601709650001401725650001701739650000901756650001401765650001701779650002101796650002001817650001501837650002001852650001601872650001401888650001601902653003101918653002401949653001901973653001001992653002702002653002602029700005602055700001802111700001902129773010602148856008702254852000902341655001202350IND60654474920221119190523.0200503e20191105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1236792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Xiaosen10aPerformance and displacement mechanism of a surfactant/compound alkaline flooding system for enhanced oil recovery  aMonoethanolamine and sodium carbonate were simultaneously applied with sulfonate surfactant to form a surfactant/compound alkaline flooding system, whose optimized composition is 0.20% SLPS, 0.15% Na₂CO₃, and 0.10% MEA. This system has better anti-salt performance. It can significantly decrease the oil/water interfacial tension (IFT) to ultra-low (＜10⁻³ mN/m) when NaCl concentration is lower than 40,000 mg/L, CaCl₂ concentration is less than 400 mg/L, and the temperature is below 90℃. Because of the synergistic effect among SLPS, MEA and Na₂CO₃, the flooding system shows obviously higher emulsion stability. Micro displacement experiments were performed to investigate the displacement mechanisms of the system. Results indicate that the oil/water IFT reduction and interfacial film softening are two fundamental micro mechanisms which can make crude oil easy to be emulsified by the flooding system. According to the flow velocity and the contact time between crude oil and the system, turbulent-emulsification and self-emulsification are main emulsification mechanisms. During the migration process of emulsion in porous media, the coalescence-entrainment and the coalescence-dispersion phenomena appear, which both can improve the displacement efficiency of remaining and irreducible oil and ultimately enhance the crude oil recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium chloride 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aethanolamine 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aporous media 3asodium carbonate 3asodium chloride 3asulfonates 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aCompound alkaline flooding 0aInterfacial tension 0aEmulsification 0aMicro 0adisplacement mechanism 0aEnhanced oil recovery1 aBai, Yingrui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6786-68351 aSun, Jinsheng1 aDong, Changyin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Nov. 05, v. 580 p.123679-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1236793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010200190300001600292500002000308520104800328592002801376650002401404650002201428650001101450650001501461650001201476650001501488650001401503650001501517650001101532650001201543650001301555650002801568650001201596650002801608650004001636650003301676650002001709650001301729650005501742650003801797650003101835651001401866700003201880700002401912700001601936700001701952773011801969852000902087856008902096655001202185IND4405398620221116213544.0210417e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440539862DNAL7 a183735172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02417.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreeman, J.

However, the genetic architecture underlying variation in their levels remains poorly understood. • Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for the concentrations of two major FPCs, sideroxylonal A and macrocarpal G, was conducted using juvenile leaves from 112 clonally duplicated progenies from an outcross F₂ of Eucalyptus globulus. • Two unlinked QTL were located for macrocarpal, while another unlinked QTL was located for sideroxylonal. The sideroxylonal QTL collocated with one for total sideroxylonal previously reported using adult Eucalyptus nitens foliage, providing independent validation in a different evolutionary lineage and a different ontogenetic stage. • Given the potential widespread occurrence of these QTL, their ontogenetic stability, and their impact on a range of dependent herbivores, it is possible that they have extended phenotypic effects in the Australian forest landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aEucalyptus nitens 3aadults 3aarthropods 3aforests 3aherbivores 3ajuveniles 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3amammals 3aontogeny 3aquantitative trait loci 2aAnimals 2aBenzofuransxmetabolism 2aEucalyptusxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenotype 2aPhloroglucinolxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSesquiterpenesxmetabolism 3aAustralia1 aO’Reilly‐Wapstra, J.

In the present study, we investigated the antibiotic-resistant phenotypes of cultivable heterotrophic bacteria from influent and effluent water of three WWTPs and analysed thirteen ARGs in ARB and in activated sludge from anoxic, anaerobic and aerobic compartments. From each influent or effluent sample of the three plants, 200 isolates were randomly tested for susceptibility to 12 antibiotics. In these samples, between 5% and 64% isolates showed resistance to >9 antibiotics and the proportion of >9-drug-resistant bacteria was lower in isolates from effluent than from influent. Eighteen genera were identified in 188 isolates from influent (n=94) and effluent (n=94) of one WWTP. Six genera (Aeromonas, Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, Microbacterium, Providencia, and Staphylococcus) were detected in both influent and effluent samples. Gram-negative and -positive isolates dominated in influent and effluent, respectively. The 13 tetracycline-, sulphonamide-, streptomycin- and β-lactam-resistance genes were detected at a higher frequency in ARB from influent than from effluent, except for sulA and CTX-M, while in general, the abundances of ARGs in activated sludge from two of the three plants were higher in aerobic compartments than in anoxic ones, indicating abundant ARGs exit in the excess sledges and/or in uncultivable bacteria. These findings may be useful for elucidating the effect of WWTP on ARB and ARGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas 3aLysinibacillus 3aMicrobacterium 3aProvidencia 3aStaphylococcus 3aactivated sludge 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3agenes 3aphenotype 3apollution 3askidders 3awastewater treatment 0aGram-negative 0aInfluent 0aEffluent 0aMulti-antibiotic resistance index 0aGenera1 aHan, Bing1 aGu, Ju1 aWang, Chao1 aWang, Peifang1 aMa, Yanyan1 aCao, Jiashun1 aHe, Zhenli0 tChemosphere.g2015 Sept., v. 135 p.138-145dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008400167300001600251520199400267592002802261650001602289650001302305650001202318650000902330650001902339650001602358650001402374650001602388650001702404650000902421650001102430650001802441650001302459650001802472650001502490650001402505700002002519700001502539700001702554700001302571773008602584856008602670852000902756655001202765IND60084887720221119125709.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008488772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrussi, M.10aStraight vegetable oil use in Micro-Gas Turbines: System adaptation and testing  ap. 287-295.  aThe aim of this research work is to investigate the use of straight vegetable sunflower oil (SFO), a liquid biofuel, in a Micro-Gas Turbine (MGT). Compared to conventional diesel engines, micro-gas turbines represent a very reliable, clean and performing small scale cogeneration technology. Commercial gas turbines have already been tested with unconventional fuels, such as biomass derived fuels; however, research work on using Straight Vegetable Oil (SVO) as fuel in MGTs are really scarce. The chemical and physical characteristics of SVO are different from fossil diesel oil and rather far from the common technical specifications for gas turbine liquid fuels, not only in terms of kinematic viscosity and Lower Heating Value, but also as regards other issues as contaminant levels and composition, fuel cold properties, ignition properties, etc. Therefore, particular attention has to be given to the atomization and evaporation phases, as these are the most critical steps to achieve stable and efficient long term operation. An analysis based on numerical correlations available from literature was initially adopted for the analysis of the atomization process, supported by CFD modeling to qualitatively investigate the flow pattern. Control parameters were revised and set so to produce a sunflower oil spray having evaporation time comparable to diesel, and minor adaptations to the fuel line were designed and installed on the MGT. Tests with blends and straight vegetable oil were carried out to assess the difference between the standard and the modified machine, fed by diesel, in terms of exhaust emissions, power output and performances, that were similar to the standard diesel-fed MGT. Measured exhaust emissions were as expected well below those typical of diesel engines of the same size fed with VO. The experimental campaign confirmed that it is possible to operate a MGT fed with SVO through the adoption of minor modifications and by adjusting control parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acold 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aevaporation 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3amodels 3asunflower oil 3aturbines 3avegetable oil 3avegetables 3aviscosity1 aChiaramonti, D.1 aRiccio, G.1 aMartelli, F.1 aPari, L.0 tApplied energy.g2012 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.287-295dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014500168300001600313520131700329592002801646650001101674650001901685650000901704650002001713650002201733650002401755650001101779650001701790650002101807650001701828653000901845653002701854653002301881653002301904653002001927700001901947700001801966700002001984700001202004700001802016773009102034856008502125852000902210655001202219IND60577002520221116185244.0180912e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057700252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Woo-Sung10aPerformance, economic and exergy analyses of carbon capture processes for a 300 MW class integrated gasification combined cycle power plant  ap. 731-742.  aThe techno-economic analysis of the CCPs was performed for a 300 MW class integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. In the study, the a-MDEA and Selexol processes were selected for the analysis as the representative of the chemical and physical solvent-based carbon capture process (CCPs). A rigorous evaluation of dual-stage CCPs, including power generation, economic evaluations, and exergy destruction, was performed. The net power of a-MDEA and Selexol processes was 267.3 MW and 291.4 MW, respectively, which corresponded to the thermal efficiencies of the dual-stage a-MDEA process of 32.3% and Selexol process of 35.2%. According to the economic analysis, the CAPEX of the Selexol process was approximately 1.39 times more expensive than that of the a-MDEA process. However, the OPEX of the Selexol process for removing a ton of CO2 was approximately one third of that of the a-MDEA process. The exergy flow and destruction were also discussed to evaluate the associated impact on the major components of CCPs. Based on the exergy analysis, the suggestion to improve thermal efficiency was made and result was also briefly discussed. These results can aid in decision-making and in process development for commercial-scale CCPs with respect to thermodynamic and economic analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3adecision making 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic evaluation 3aexergy 3agasification 3apower generation 3apower plants 0aIGCC 0aCarbon capture process 0aThermal efficiency 0aEconomic evolution 0aExergy analysis1 aLee, Jae-Cheol1 aOh, Hyun-Taek1 aBaek, Seung-Won1 aOh, Min1 aLee, Chang-Ha0 tEnergy.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 134 p.731-742dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011500166300001600281520188500297592002802182650001402210650001702224650001902241650002302260650001302283650002402296650001702320650001802337650001502355650001402370653002602384653001902410653002402429653003502453700002602488700001702514700002502531700002402556773013202580856007802712852000902790655001202799IND60661100620221118140904.0190828s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066110062DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2018-06932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoekstra, Sven P.10aModality-specific training adaptations – do they lead to a dampened acute inflammatory response to exercise?  ap. 965-972.  aWhile adaptations to a short-term training program can dampen the acute inflammatory response to exercise, less is known about the influence of chronic modality-specific adaptations to training. This study compares the acute inflammatory response to upper- and lower-body interval exercise in individuals chronically trained in these respective modalities. Ninety minutes of interval exercise matched for relative power output on an arm-crank (ARM) and cycle ergometer (LEG) was performed by 8 trained paddlers and 8 trained cyclists. Blood samples were taken before and after exercise. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations were analysed in plasma, while the expression of intracellular heat shock protein 72 (iHsp72) was assessed in monocytes. IL-6 was increased following both modalities (fold change – ARM: 7.23 ± 3.56, p < 0.001; LEG: 9.03 ± 4.82, p < 0.001), in both groups (cyclists, p < 0.001; paddlers, p < 0.001), but the increase was smaller in ARM compared with LEG (time × modality, p < 0.001). ARM induced a smaller iHsp72 response compared with LEG (fold change – ARM: 1.07 ± 0.14, p = 0.102; LEG: 1.18 ± 0.14, p < 0.001; time × modality, p = 0.039). Following ARM, iHsp72 expression was increased in the cyclists only (fold change cyclists: 1.12 ± 0.11, p = 0.018; paddlers: 1.03 ± 0.17, p = 0.647), while iHsp72 expression following LEG was increased in both groups (fold change cyclists: 1.14 ± 0.15, p = 0.027; paddlers: 1.22 ± 0.13, p < 0.001). Taken together, the acute inflammatory response to lower-body interval exercise was larger compared with work-matched upper-body interval exercise. Moreover, adaptations to upper-body exercise training dampened the iHsp72 response to this modality. Therefore, exercise may be less effective in reducing chronic low-grade inflammation in individuals relying on their upper body, such as wheelchair users.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicycling 3ablood plasma 3ablood sampling 3aeducation programs 3aexercise 3aheat shock proteins 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ametabolism 3amonocytes 0aheat shock protein 72 0aflow cytometry 0aupper-body exercise 0achronic low-grade inflammation1 aWesterman, Matthew N.1 aBeke, Flavio1 aBishop, Nicolette C.1 aLeicht, Christof A.0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2019, v. 44, no. 9 p.965-972dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2018-06933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008600171520077900257592002801036650002201064650002101086650001601107650004401123650002301167650001601190650002601206653001801232653002101250653002801271653002001299653001501319700001601334700001701350700005201367700001501419700001801434773010601452856008701558852000901645655001201654IND60654475120221119190412.0200210e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065447512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1236832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Huichuang10aSelf-assembly of β-cyclodextrin-derived amphiphile with a photo responsive guest  aHerein, a photo-responsive mono-component self-assembly system based on host-guest inclusion complexation is presented.

In the case of trans-form βCD-C₆-Azo system, intermolecular host-guest complexes between β-CD and azobenzene were formed, which were verified by 2D ¹H NMR analysis, and further self-assembled into curved linear structures in water driven mainly by hydrogen bonding.

High-throughput technologies adapted from other disciplines (e.g., high-throughput chemical screening, genomics) are changing the scale of data acquisition in behavioral neuroscience. Massive behavioral datasets are beginning to emerge, particularly from zebrafish labs, where behavioral assays can be performed rapidly and reproducibly in 96-well, high-throughput format. Mining these datasets and making comparisons across different assays are major challenges for the field. Here, we review behavioral barcoding, a process by which complex behavioral assays are reduced to a string of numeric features, facilitating analysis and comparison within and across datasets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3abarcoding 3adata collection 3adrugs 3agenomics 3amutation 3anervous system diseases 3aneurophysiology 3aphenotype 3ascreening1 aRennekamp, Andrew J.1 aShah, Asmi H.1 aLiebel, Urban1 aPeterson, Randall T.0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2012 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.421-425dElsevier Ltdx0167-77997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016500164300001600329520136600345592002801711650001501739650001501754650003401769650001301803650002801816650003101844650001001875650000701885650004301892650005201935650001101987650002601998700002102024700002102045700001802066773009202084856008102176852000902257655001202266IND60439871720221122222205.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043987172DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617150500572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Surajit10aSurvival and expression of DNA repair genes in marine bacteria Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes NP103 and P. aeruginosa N6P6 in response to environmental stressors  ap. 644-653.  aA comparative response of marine bacteria Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes NP103 and P. aeruginosa N6P6 under pH stress and UV radiation (UVR) revealed that both their survival pattern and repair mechanism are species specific. In case of P. pseudoalcaligenes NP103, the survival was maximum at pH 8, which decreased with decline in pH of the medium. Whereas, in P. aeruginosa N6P6, maximum survival was observed at pH 7. On exposure to UVR at different doses (25–200 mJ/cm²) and increasing concentrations of Na⁺ (1–6%), considerable differences in the recovery (2% for P. pseudoalcaligenes NP103 and 3% for P. aeruginosa N6P6) from UVR induced damage was observed. The qRT-PCR analysis of DNA repair genes (recA and uvrA) of marine bacteria subjected to different pH conditions showed significant (P < 0.05) up-regulation of both genes at pH 6, indicating higher degree of DNA damage at low pH. Furthermore, exposure of UVR irradiated cell suspensions to visible light exhibited greater photo-reactivating capacity in P. pseudoalcaligenes NP103 as compared to P. aeruginosa N6P6. The present findings indicate that pH and UVR exposure have crucial role in dictating the light dependent and independent DNA repair pathway in marine bacteria. Further, we speculate that both these repair response to the environmental stressors varies with bacterial species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aPseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes 3abacteria 3acell suspension culture 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3apH 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asodium 3aultraviolet radiation1 aGaneriwal, Sonam1 aMangwani, Neelam1 aPatel, Bhakti0 tMicrobiology.g2015 Sept., v. 84, no. 5 p.644-653dPleiades Publishingx0026-26177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00262617150500573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01638naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013000167300002000297520054200317592002800859650002000887650001400907650002300921650001300944650001200957650002200969650001400991650001501005700001901020700001901039700001901058773012101077856008101198852000901279655001201288IND60587128720221122233221.0171215e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058712872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b023752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukumoto, Yoshiya10aIr4(CO)12-Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)–H Silylation of 2-Alkylpyridines with Hydrosilanes Leading to 2-(1-Silylalkyl)pyridines  ap. 13649-13655.  aThe iridium-catalyzed C(sp³)–H silylation of 2-alkylpyridines with hydrosilanes at the benzylic position to afford 2-(1-silylalkyl)pyridines is described.

The main objective of this research study was to investigate technologies needed to exploit the large amount of low grade heat available from a flue gas condensing system through industrial condensing boilers. The technology and application of industrial condensing boilers in various heating systems were extensively reviewed. As the condensers require site-specific engineering design, a case study was carried out to investigate the feasibility (technically and economically) of applying condensing boilers in a large scale district heating system (40MW). The study showed that by recovering the latent heat of water vapour in the flue gas through condensing boilers, the whole heating system could achieve significantly higher efficiency levels than conventional boilers. In addition to waste heat recovery, condensing boilers can also be optimised for emission abatement, especially for particle removal. Two technical barriers for the condensing boiler application are corrosion and return water temperatures. Highly corrosion-resistant material is required for condensing boiler manufacture. The thermal design of a “case study” single pass shell-and-tube condensing heat exchanger/condenser showed that a considerable amount of thermal resistance was on the shell-side. Based on the case study calculations, approximately 4900m² of total heat transfer area was required, if stainless steel was used as a construction material. If the heat transfer area was made of carbon steel, then polypropylene could be used as the corrosion-resistant coating material outside the tubes. The addition of polypropylene coating increased the tube wall thermal resistance, hence the required heat transfer area was approximately 5800m². Net Present Value (NPV) calculations showed that the choice of a carbon steel condenser ensured cash return in a relatively shorter period of time (i.e. 2years) when compared to a stainless steel condenser (i.e. 5–7years). Moreover, the NPV for the stainless steel was more sensitive to the change of the interest rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication technology 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acoatings 3acondensers 3aconstruction materials 3acorrosion 3aenergy costs 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy industry 3afuels 3aheat exchangers 3aheat tolerance 3aheat transfer 3aindustrial applications 3amanufacturing 3apolypropylenes 3astainless steel 3awater temperature 3awater vapor1 aFinney, Karen1 aLi, Hanning1 aZhang, Xiaohui1 aZhou, Jue1 aSharifi, Vida1 aSwithenbank, Jim0 tApplied energy.g2012 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.30-36dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014700165300001600312520084300328592002801171650001901199650001301218650002001231650003301251650002501284650001601309650001601325700001901341700002001360700001501380773009501395856008501490852000901575655001201584IND60087882220221118012505.0141102e20120104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008788222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei10aOptimization of ultrasonic-assisted extraction of water-soluble polysaccharides from Boletus edulis mycelia using response surface methodology  ap. 614-619.  aAn ultrasound-assisted procedure for the extraction of water-soluble polysaccharides from the submerged-cultured mycelia of Boletus edulis was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). Three independent variables were ratio of dried mycelia to water (X₁: 1:40–1:60), extraction time (X₂: 6–10min), and ultrasonic temperature (X₃: 50–70°C). The statistical analysis indicated the independent variables (X₂, X₃), the quadratic terms (X₂ ² and X₃ ²) and the interaction between X₃ and X₁ had significant effects on the yield of polysaccharides (p<.05). The optimized conditions were 56°C, 1:55 of ratio of dried mycelia to water, and a time of contact of 8.4min. Under these conditions, the experimental yield of polysaccharides was 15.48%, which was well matched with the predictive yield of 15.53%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoletus edulis 3amycelium 3apolysaccharides 3aresponse surface methodology 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3aultrasonics1 aWang, Wei-Ping1 aZhang, Hua-Shan1 aHuang, Qin0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Jan. 4, v. 87, no. 1 p.614-619dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01714naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006000155245018000215300001600395520051500411592002800926650003700954650001500991650001501006650001201021650001301033650001101046700005801057700006001115700002301175773009101198856009001289852000901379655001201388IND60634564420221119075615.0200607e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063456442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Hai Nguyen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8361-261610aComment on “removal of hexavalent chromium by biochar supported nZVI composite: Batch and fixed-bed column evaluations, mechanisms, and secondary contamination prevention”  ap. 988-990.  aThis article aims to discuss (1) the incorrect identification of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) binding energies in the Cr 2p XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra of the laden adsorbent (the nZVI-BC sample after Cr(VI) adsorption), (2) misconception regarding the Weber–Morris intraparticle diffusion model, and (3) inconsistency between the experiential data and the Thomas adsorption rate constants.

The α-(1→4)-d-galacturonic acid backbone was submitted to a selective hydrolysis with endo-polygalacturonase (EPG) and the fractions with low molecular weight (<1kDa) obtained by size-exclusion chromatography were analysed by mass spectrometry using electrospray ionisation (ESI-MS). The ESI-MS spectra obtained revealed the presence of several [M+Na]⁺ ions of pectic oligosaccharides identified as belonging to different series, including oligosaccharides constituted only by galacturonic acid residues (GalAₙ, n=1–5) and galacturonic acid residues substituted by pentose residues (GalA₃Pentₙ, n=1–2). Surprisingly, it was also observed the occurrence of galacturonic acid residues substituted by hexose residues (GalAₙHexₘ, n=2–4, m=1–2). The fragmentation of the observed [M+Na]⁺ ions, obtained under ESI-MS/MS and MSⁿ allowed to confirm the proposed structures constituent of these pectic oligosaccharides. Furthermore, the ESI-MSⁿ spectra of the ions that could be identified as GalAₙHexₘ (n=2–4, m=1–2) confirmed the presence of Hex or Hex₂ residues linked to a GalA residue. Methylation analysis showed the presence, in all EPG treated samples, of terminally linked arabinose, terminally and 4-linked xylose, and terminally and 4-linked glucose. The occurrence of GalA substituted by Glc, and Glc-β-(1→4)–Glc are structural features that, as far as we know, have never been reported to occur in pectic polysaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aPrunus domestica 3aPyrus communis 3aarabinose 3acell walls 3acellobiose 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3agalacturonic acid 3agel chromatography 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3aionization 3aions 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3apears 3apentoses 3aplums 3apolygalacturonase 3apolysaccharides 3axylose1 aSilva, Lisete1 aFernandes, Ana P.1 aGuiné, Raquel P.F.1 aDomingues, M.

Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) has been used worldwide to assess/monitor the onset, active phase, cessation and severity of drought. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provides a comprehensive vegetation dynamics, which directly linked with rainfall received in a particular region. Indo-Gangetic Region (IGR), providing employment and livelihood to tens of millions of rural families directly or indirectly and rice (Oryza sativa L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (RW) system of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) contributes 80% of the total cereal production and is critical to food security of the region. This study tries to verify the applicability of water-vegetative indices viz., SPI, Rainfall Index (RI) and NDVI for drought assessment of rice–wheat system productivity over IGR-India. The relationship between monsoon rainfall and NDVI shows that at around 1100mm rainfall, the NDVI reached saturation point and no further significant increase in NDVI with increase of rainfall is noticed. Even though, there was a positive correlation of seasonal monsoon rainfall and average NDVI, conflicting results are noticed between monthly distribution of rainfall and monthly anomaly of NDVI over IGR States. It is noticed that June dif NDVI (actual NDVI–mean NDVI) contributes more to rice productivity followed by July. However, the combined effect of June, July and August, explains 15% of the variation of Kharif Rice Productivity Index (KRPI). As far as wheat is concerned, statistically significant relation was found between Wheat Productivity Index (WPI) and anomaly NDVI during December–March. This explains 35% of the variability in WPI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aTriticum aestivum 3adrought 3aemployment 3afood security 3alivelihood 3amonsoon season 3arain 3arice 3arural families 3avegetation 3awheat1 aRam Mohan, H.S.1 aBanukumar, K.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2011 July, v. 77, no. 2 p.175-187dElsevier B.V.x0168-16997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245004500159300001200204520079600216592002801012650003401040650001401074650002501088650001701113650001801130650001801148650001601166650001301182650002201195700002101217700002001238700001801258700001801276773012101294856007401415852000901489655001201498IND60548266120221117195535.0160903e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054826612DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029739472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Hye Sook10aAntioxidant effect ofSalvia miltiorrhiza  ap. 496.  aA strong antioxidant activity, which was measured by the radical scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl(DPPH) radical, was detected in the methanol extract ofSalvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Labiatae).

The Ganga River system in India is a large, complex system consisting of several long tributaries, some >1,000 km, originating from 2 distinct hinterlands—the Himalaya to the north and the cratons to the south. Traversing through a diverse climatic regime across the Plain and through precipitation zones ranging from 600 mm/year near Delhi to 1,200 mm/year in the eastern plains, the Ganga River system has formed very diverse landform assemblages in 3 major geomorphic domains. We have recognized 10 different river classes for the trunk river from Gangotri (source) to Farakka (upstream of its confluence with the Brahmaputra) based on (a) landscape setting, (b) channel and active floodplain properties, and (c) channel planform parameters. The mountainous stretch is characterized by steep valleys and bedrock channels and is dominated by large‐scale sediment production and transport through hill slope processes. The alluvial part of the river is characterized by 8 different river classes of varying reach lengths (60–300 km) many of which show sharp transitions in landscape setting. We have highlighted the application of this approach for the assessment of habitat suitability, environmental flows, and flood risk all of which have been significantly modified during the last few decades due to large‐scale anthropogenic disturbances. We suggest that the diversity embedded in this geomorphic framework can be useful for developing a sustainable river management programme to “work with” the contemporary character and behaviour of rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abedrock 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3ahills 3alandscapes 3arisk 3arivers 3asediments 3atopographic slope 3avalleys 3awatersheds 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aMohanta, H.1 aJain, V.1 aTandon, S.

The application of phytochemical methods to iridoids yielded three novel secoiridoid dimers: sweritranslactones A–C (1–3). These molecules possess a 6/6/6/6/6/6-fused hexacyclic skeleton and were obtained from swertiamarin, one of the major constituents of the genus Swertia, via a [4 + 2] cycloaddition and intramolecular nucleophilic addition under aqueous conditions.

J.10aState-By-State Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Fossil Fuel Use in the United States 1960–2000  ap. 659-674.  aTime series of fossil fuel carbon emissions from 1960–2000 for each of the U.S. states and the District of Columbia are presented and discussed. Comparison of the nationally summarized results with other national datasets shows generally good agreement, usually within 2%, and gives insight into the quality of all the data series. Our extension of the state-by-state emissions estimates back to 1960 reveals patterns of change that are coherent across states and can be related to historic events such as energy crises and federal legislation. Most notable is the changing pattern of coal usage, as coal-producing states produce increasingly more energy (mostly for electricity) for other states so that per capita CO₂ emissions diverge for states that import as opposed to those that export electricity. The decline in carbon emissions from petroleum products following the 1970s is also evident. Per capita emissions range over an order of magnitude for the different states. The data suggest that differences in per capita emissions arise from differences in many technological, physical, resource, social, and economic factors. The data presented here and the few correlations briefly noted pose a challenge for trying to use per capita emissions as a measure of equity or to provide mitigation targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3aeconomic factors 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aexports 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aimports 3alaws and regulations 3apetroleum 3atime series analysis 3aDistrict of Columbia1 aBroniak, Christine1 aMarland, Gregg0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2005 Oct., v. 10, no. 4 p.659-674dKluwer Academic Publishersx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-005-6471-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001800164245009100182300001600273500001500289520117900304592002801483650004201511650000901553650001701562650001401579650001201593650002001605650001201625650006201637650006201699650005601761650003901817650000901856650002701865650001101892650002701903650001801930650000901948650002501957650003501982650004402017653002602061700001902087700001702106700001602123773010602139852000902245856008202254655001202336IND8900147220221118000415.0181009e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890014722DNAL7 a32128932pmid7 a10.1177/0300985888025006132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesfin, G.

Pathologic changes consistent with traumatic injury were in the vena cava and endocardium of the right atrium of 88% of cannulated dogs. Lesions were characterized by surface denudation and diffuse intimal thickening due to myointimal hyperplasia and deposition of extracellular matrix. Affected intima was lined by hyperplastic, poorly differentiated endothelial cells and contained round to oval cells with characteristics of smooth muscle cells. After 9 weeks, thickened intima was vascularized and composed of spindle-shaped cells and fibrillar stroma. Intimal sclerosis and localized proliferative papillary projections in the vena cava cranial to areas of myointimal hyperplasia occurred infrequently. Traumatic lesions, regardless of location or severity, did not extend below the internal elastic membrane. Inflammatory cellular responses, when present, were minimal. The location, distribution, and morphogenesis of catheter-related cardiovascular lesions distinguishes them from those induced by chemical toxicity or pharmacotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3apathological processes and conditions 3adogs 3ajugular vein 3acatheters 3asurgery 3aadverse effects 2aAnimals 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCatheterization, Peripheralxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aCatheters, Indwellingxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxetiologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aEndocardiumxpathology 2aFemale 2aHeart Atriaxpathology 2aJugular Veins 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aVenae Cavaexpathologyxultrastructure. 0acardiovascular system1 aHiggins, M.

MMPs are secreted in a latent form and activated by local and infiltrating cells. MMP-2 and -9 are the most studied in reproduction and have been detected in bovine, ovine, equine and human placenta. There is only one study on MMPs in the equine amniotic fluid (AF) reporting a decrease in the activity of MMP-2 in case of premature delivery. The aim of this study was focused on MMP-2 and -9 activity in AF collected at parturition from mares with normal or high-risk pregnancy. High-risk pregnancy was defined as a history of premature udder development/lactation, increase of combined thickness of the uterus and placenta, vulvar discharge and/or mare's systemic illness. The diagnosis of placental insufficiency was confirmed retrospectively after macroscopic and histopatologic examination of the placenta. AF was collected by needle puncture of the amnion within 5 min after its appearance through the vulva. The activity of MMP-2 and -9 was analyzed by in-gel zymography allowing the evaluation of both latent and active forms. Twenty mares with normal pregnancy (group 1) and 8 mares with high-risk pregnancy (group 2) were included. All mares in group 2 had a high-risk pregnancy with a diagnosis of placental insufficiency associated with placental villous hypoplasia, placentitis or placental edema. The bands relative to latent and active forms of MMP-2 were clearly visible in both groups and the activity of latent (P = 0.010) and active (P = 0.004) forms was lower in the AF samples of group 2. The band of the latent form of MMP-9 was visible in 17/20 samples of group 1, while it was completely absent in all samples of group 2. In contrast, the band of the active form was clearly visible and with a greater activity in AF samples of group 2 (P = 0.002). Placental dysfunction seems to induce a lower MMP-2 activity and a higher MMP-9 activity through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because fetal pulmonary secretions are a likely source of gelatinases in AF during late gestation, the increased MMP-9 activity could be related to fetal distress. These data provide a starting point to better understand the role of MMPs in equine pregnancy, although it should be confirmed in a larger and more homogeneous population of mares with high-risk pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamnion 3aamniotic fluid 3acattle 3acytokines 3adistress 3aedema 3aextracellular matrix 3agelatinase A 3ahumans 3alactation 3amares 3aparturition 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3asheep 3audders 3auterus 3avulva 0aMare 0aHigh-risk pregnancy 0aPlacental insufficiency 0aAmniotic fluid 0aMetalloproteinase 0aZymography1 aLanci, Aliai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9828-43171 aFerlizza, Enea1 aAndreani, Giulia1 aMariella, Jole1 aIsani, Gloria1 aCastagnetti, Carolina0 tTheriogenology.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 172 p.116-122dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2021.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013000166300001600296520106400312592002801376650001601404650002201420650001301442650001501455650001101470650000901481650001601490650002301506650001701529650001401546650003301560650001601593650003701609700001601646700001701662700001401679700001601693700001701709700001701726700001601743700001801759773008601777856008401863852000901947655001201956IND60598975520221120052329.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059897552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Boyang10aLow temperature synthesis and formation mechanism of carbon encapsulated nanocrystals by electrophilic oxidation of ferrocene  ap. 573-582.  aA novel method is developed for low temperature synthesis of carbon encapsulated spherical Fe7S8, equiaxed Fe3O4 and spherical porous FeOOH nanocrystals with a core–shell structure via a solid–solid reaction of ferrocene with (NH4)2S2O8, (NH4)2Cr2O7 and NH4ClO4 in an autoclave, respectively. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It is found that the median size of Fe7S8, Fe3O4 and FeOOH nanocrystals is about 28.99, 52.68 and 25.66nm, respectively. The hollow worm-like carbon shell provides exclusive rooms for tens to hundreds of nanocrystals separated from each other. The cooperative effect of ammonium and strong oxidizing ion on electrophilic oxidation of ferrocene contributes to the in situ formation of carbon shell on the nanocrystals. The metal–π interaction of iron atom with cyclopentadienone oligomers enables ordered self-assembling of carbon rings, resulting in the formation of graphitizable carbon shell with roughly parallel fringes at low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aX-ray diffraction 3aammonium 3aautoclaves 3acarbon 3airon 3airon oxides 3airon oxyhydroxides 3ananocrystals 3aoxidation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhong, Ning1 aFan, Chunhua1 aZhou, Yun1 aFan, Yanhua1 aYu, Shuaiqin1 aZhang, Fuhua1 aDong, Lihua1 aYin, Yansheng0 tCarbon.g2014 Mar., v. 68 p.573-582dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010300209300001800312520142200330592002801752650001301780650001201793650001201805650001301817650001101830650001701841650002001858650001901878650002101897650001501918650001201933650000901945650001701954650000901971650001201980650001301992650001702005700002002022700005802042773012802100856008402228852000902312655001202321IND60598586220180809000000.0180702e20180116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059858622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b037252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodešva, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7083-652210aNanostructured Gold Microelectrode Array for Ultrasensitive Detection of Heavy Metal Contamination  ap. 1161-1167.  aAvailability of potable water is a problem especially in developing countries as their water sources are often contaminated biologically as well as by heavy metals. Electrochemical methods are suitable for field application to monitor heavy metal contents. Noble metal electrodes with large surface areas are the subject of intensive development as they can yield an improved signal-to-noise ratio, enhanced sensitivity, and lower limits of detection (LOD). Here, we present a nanostructured Au microelectrode array subsequently modified by selective electrodeposition in lithographically defined circles within a partially cross-linked gelatin layer. This method increased its surface area by a factor of ≈1440 in comparison with an original lithography-based prepared array. The Au surface properties can be tailored by a degree of gelatin layer cross-linking. We used this array for an ultrasensitive detection of the As³⁺ ions content by stripping voltammetry achieving LOD of ≈0.0212 parts per billion (signal-to-noise ratio = 3.3), 470× below the content limit recommended by the World Health Organization for potable water. These nanostructured arrays were used to detect ions of other metals such as Cr, Cd, Hg, Cu, and Sb. In combination with a portable electrochemical device, we can envision an ultrasensitive heavy metal detection system for field application to monitor heavy metal contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acrosslinking 3adetection limit 3adrinking water 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agelatin 3agold 3aheavy metals 3aions 3amercury 3ananogold 3asurface area1 aGablech, Imrich1 aNeužil, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9040-281X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 90, no. 2 p.1161-1167dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b037253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009900171300001800270500001400288520194100302592002802243650001802271650001502289650002302304650002002327650002302347650001102370650001902381650001602400650002002416650001202436653001202448653000802460653001202468700002002480700002202500700001902522700002502541773009802566856008602664852000902750655001202759IND60724191320221119075822.0210219e20210212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072419132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReemers, Sylvia12aA broad spectrum HVT-H5 avian influenza vector vaccine which induces a rapid onset of immunity  ap. 1072-1079.  aNAL-light  aCurrent methods to combat highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in poultry rely on stamping out and preventive culling, which can lead to high economic losses and invoke ethical resistance. Emergency vaccination could be an alternative as vaccination is one of the most efficient and cost-effective measures to protect poultry from HPAI infection, preventing spreading to other poultry and greatly reducing the potential transmission to humans. Current conventional inactivated AI vaccines may be useful for combating AI outbreaks, but do not fulfil all targets of an ideal AI vaccine, including mass applicability and rapid onset of immunity. We aimed to further investigate the potential of Herpesvirus of Turkeys (HVT) as a vector containing a recombinant H5 hemagglutinin of HPAI H5N1. This HVT-H5 vector was analysed in vitro, tested for onset of immunity against AI challenge, breadth of protection, reduction of virus shedding, and induction of both antibody and cellular responses in SPF layers or broiler chicks containing maternal derived antibodies (MDA+). In SPF layers HVT-H5 provided full protection to lethal challenges with 4 antigenically diverse HPAI H5N1 strains from 2 weeks post vaccination (w.p.v.), while in MDA+ birds full protection was provided from 3 w.p.v. to homologous challenge. Also shedding of challenge virus was reduced in both SPF and MDA+ birds. HVT-H5 induced a protective HI titre (≥4) to 11 HPAI H5N1 strains at 3 w.p.v. in 3-week-old SPF layers and to HPAI H5N8 A/ch/Neth/14015531/2014. Besides inducing a protective antibody response HVT-H5 also induced an influenza-specific T cell response. This data demonstrates that HVT-H5 vaccine appears to fulfil many of the criteria for an ideal AI vaccine including early onset of immunity, a broad protection, reduced virus shedding, protection in presence of AI-MDA and could be a useful tool in the combat of AI outbreaks worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aavian influenza 3acost effectiveness 3aethics 3ahemagglutinins 3avaccination 3avector vaccines 3aviruses 0aVaccine 0aHVT 0aChicken1 aVerstegen, Iwan1 aBasten, Stephanie1 aHubers, Willem1 avan de Zande, Saskia0 tVaccine.g2021 Feb. 12, v. 39, no. 7 p.1072-1079dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245011700185300001600302520168700318592002802005650001402033650001402047650001502061650001902076650001702095650002302112650002902135650001402164650002002178650002402198650001302222650001202235650004602247650003902293650004002332650002102372650005602393650003402449650003002483650003002513650002702543650000902570650001802579650004402597650003002641650005902671650001702730650004902747700001702796773009802813856008402911990002302995852000903018655001203027IND60092082420221122014030.0141103e20111128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009208242DNAL7 a217750532pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Jun-Ho10aSuppression of autophagy sensitizes multidrug resistant cells towards Src tyrosine kinase specific inhibitor PP2  ap. 188-197.  aUpregulated Src activity has been implicated in a variety of cancers. Thus, Src family tyrosine kinase (SFK) inhibitors are often effective cancer treatments. Here, we employed 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), a selective SFK inhibitor, to determine the possible involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in the modulation of autophagy, for overcoming multidrug resistance. We found that multidrug-resistant v-Ha-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (Ras-NIH 3T3/Mdr) were more susceptible to PP2 treatment than were their parental cells (Ras-NIH 3T3). The antiproliferative activity of PP2 appeared to be due to cell-cycle arrest at G₁/S without induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, PP2 preferentially induced autophagy in Ras-NIH 3T3 cells but not in Ras-NIH 3T3/Mdr cells, which implies that a high level of autophagy may protect PP2-treated cells from undergoing cell death. PP2-induced autophagy in Ras-NIH 3T3 cells is accompanied by an inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. However, we found that in Ras-NIH 3T3/Mdr cells, PP2-induced mTOR inhibition was uncoupled from the induction of autophagy—likely due to the hyperactivation of AMPK by delayed Raf activation. We also found that PP2-induced dissociation of Beclin 1 from Bcl-2 leads to autophagy in Ras-NIH 3T3 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that functional autophagy in response to PP2 may lead to cell survival in Ras-NIH 3T3 cells, while defective autophagy may contribute to inhibition of growth in Ras-NIH 3T3/Mdr cells. Thus, modulators of autophagy may be used beneficially as adjunctive therapeutic agents during the treatment of cancers with SFK inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell cycle 3acell viability 3adissociation 3agrowth retardation 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3atyrosine 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteinsxmetabolism 2aAutophagyxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aCell Growth Processesxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21xbiosynthesis 2aDown-Regulationxdrug effects 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasm 2aG1 Phasexdrug effects 2aMice 2aNIH 3T3 Cells 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aPyrimidinesxpharmacology 2aTOR Serine-Threonine Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aTransfection 2asrc-Family Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitors1 aLee, Michael0 tCancer letters.g2011 Nov. 28, v. 310, no. 2 p.188-197dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245012800171300001800299520096800317592002801285650004401313650002201357650003701379650001501416650001101431650001401442650002301456650000901479650001701488650001501505650001301520650002001533650001301553650004401566650001601610650003301626650001201659650002001671650003701691650002001728700002201748700002101770700002401791773014201815856007401957852000902031655001202040IND60670716020221121054818.0191002e20140422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067071602DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00042k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaradwaj, G.

These materials were also extensively characterized by various other characterization techniques like XRD, N₂ adsorption–desorption analysis, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM, etc. This multi-functionalized material was investigated as a heterogeneous catalyst for one-pot deacetalization–nitroaldol (Henry) reaction giving a 99.2% product yield in just 2 h. This material also showed outstanding adsorption capacity for the heavy metal cations and can be utilized as a potential candidate for the remediation of contaminated water. This material is potent enough to carry out the Henry reaction as well as adsorption for many runs without any significant loss of its activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aclay 3aheavy metals 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3amontmorillonite 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aremediation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3astable isotopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater pollution1 aRana, Surjyakanta1 aParida, Kulamani1 aNayak, Binod Bihari0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Apr. 22, v. 2, no. 20 p.7526-7534dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00042k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006500171300001600236520099900252592002801251650001601279650001101295650002501306650000901331650001401340650001201354650001001366650001801376650001301394650001501407650000901422650002101431650001301452650002001465650001101485650001101496650001101507650002001518650001001538653002001548653002201568653002701590653001301617653001601630653002701646653002901673700001801702700001801720700001701738773010901755856008601864852000901950655001201959IND50066219720221119014502.0190319e20130607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006621972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2013.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMimida, Naozumi10aFunctions of the apple TFL1/FT orthologs in phase transition  ap. 106-112.  aApple (Malus×domestica Borkh.) is a perennial tree adapted to temperate climate. It has a long juvenile phase, taking approximately eight years to reach the adult phase. Floral bud formation is initiated in early summer and bloom in the following spring. While the apple genome contains orthologs of most genes known to regulate flowering in Arabidopsis, floral induction in apple is regulated mainly through an autonomous pathway influenced by endogenous developmental cues, including age (juvenility), hormones, and sugars. Recent studies on the molecular basis of floral induction suggest that plant phosphatidyl ethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP)-family genes, orthologs of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 and FLOWERING LOCUS T, are involved in the control of shoot meristem identity and play central roles in the transition from vegetative to reproductive phases. This review summarizes recent progress on plant PEBP-like genes and proposes a model for the seasonal growth cycle in apple shoot apices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aapples 3aasexual reproduction 3abuds 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agenes 3agrowth models 3ahormones 3ajuvenility 3aloci 3aphase transition 3aproteins 3ashoot meristems 3aspring 3asugars 3asummer 3atemperate zones 3atrees 0aAPETALA 1 (AP1) 0aFloral initiation 0aFLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) 0aHormones 0aLEAFY (LFY) 0aMalus×domestica Borkh 0aTERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)1 aKomori, Sadao1 aSuzuki, Akira1 aWada, Masato0 tScientia horticulturae.g2013 June 07, v. 156 p.106-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2013.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010500169300001800274520135800292592002801650650001301678650001401691650000901705650001201714650001101726650001201737650002201749650002601771650001201797700001601809700001601825700001601841700001901857700005601876773012801932856008402060852000902144655001202153IND60598586420221121112222.0180702e20180206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059858642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b037352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Lingpeng10aDifferentiation and Relative Quantitation of Disaccharide Isomers by MALDI-TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1525-1530.  aSaccharide isomer differentiation has been a challenge in glycomics, as the lack of technology to decipher fully the diverse structures of compositions, linkages, and anomeric configurations. Several mass spectrometry-based methods have been applied to the discrimination of disaccharide isomers, but limited quantitative analyses have been reported. In the present study, MALDI-LIFT-TOF/TOF has been investigated to differentiate and relatively quantify underivatized glucose-containing disaccharide isomers that differ in composition, connectivity or configuration. N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC) was used as a highly sensitive matrix without matrix interferences in low mass range, thus yielding intense chloride-attached disaccharide ions [M + Cl]⁻, which could be fragmented to give diagnostic characteristic fragment patterns for distinguishing these isomers. Three different types of disaccharide isomers were successfully relatively quantified in a binary mixture using the specific product ion pairs. Finally, this method was utilized to identify and relatively quantify two disaccharide isomers in Medicago leaf (maltose and sucrose) without numerous preparation steps. In general, this method is a fast, effective, and robust method for rapid differentiation and quantitation of disaccharide isomers in complex medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago 3aglycomics 3aions 3aisomers 3aleaves 3amaltose 3amass spectrometry 3aquantitative analysis 3asucrose1 aXie, Xiaobo1 aLi, Yafeng,1 aLiu, Huihui1 aXiong, Caiqiao1 aNie, Zongxiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8514-63480 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 06, v. 90, no. 3 p.1525-1530dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b037353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007500156520144700231592002801678650001201706650001101718650001501729650001201744650001201756650001101768700001701779700001801796700001601814700001401830700001801844773013001862856007501992852000902067655001202076IND60794329620221119122705.0220922e20220906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079432962DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141844392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Wenqi 10aInversion of Sea Ice Concentration in the Liaodong Bay from MODIS Data  aSea ice concentration is an important observation element and a necessary input parameter for the numerical prediction of sea ice. In this study, a new method is developed for the inversion of sea ice concentration (SIC) in Liaodong Bay from MODIS data based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). By comparing the inverted results of the NDWI method and the WU’s methods, as well as observations from six shore-based observation points on the east coast of Liaodong Bay in the winter of 2016/2017 and Landsat 8 OLI data, the method based on NDWI is shown to be a useful tool to estimate the SIC. The SIC obtained by the NDWI method is in good agreement with the survey data. The mean absolute error between the SIC obtained by the NDWI method and visual observation is about 10%. In the comparison data, 92% of the absolute error values of SIC are less than 20%. The average value of the error of the SIC obtained by the NDWI method is 1%, and that of the WU’s method is about −10%, which means the accuracy of SIC obtained by the NDWI method is better. The mean deviation of the error of the SIC obtained by the NDWI method and the WU’s method is about 9% and 13%, which shows a certain improvement in precision. The validation results with the Landsat 8 OLI data show the precision of the SIC obtained by the NDWI method is better than the WU’s method, which is consistent with the validation result of the survey data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acoasts 3aprediction 3asea ice 3asurveys 3awinter1 aYuan, Shuai 1 aLiu, Chengyu 1 aYuxian, Ma,1 aXu, Ning 1 aLv, Xianqing 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 06, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141844393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010300156300001800259520116200277592002801439650001901467650001901486650001901505650001801524650002101542650001901563650002501582700001701607700001901624700001701643700001701660700001701677700001601694773014001710856007401850852000901924655001201933IND60670716520221121054912.0191002e20140506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067071652DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00053f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Shouli10aSynthesis mechanism and gas-sensing application of nanosheet-assembled tungsten oxide microspheres  ap. 7927-7934.  aNanosheet-assembled tungsten oxide microspheres have been synthesized using rapid sonochemistry followed by thermal treatment. Transient observation of controllable synthesis reveals that the morphological evolution of the product is highly dependent on the ultrasonication time. An assembly mechanism based on oriented attachment and reconstruction is proposed for the sonochemical formation of the nanosheet-assembled microspheres. The obtained samples possess intrinsic non-stoichiometry and a hierarchically porous nano/microstructure, which is beneficial for their utilization in sensing materials and for fast diffusion of gas molecules. The maximum response of the tungsten oxide hierarchical microspheres is 3 times higher than that of commercial nanoparticles for NO₂ gas. The gas adsorption–desorption kinetics during the sensing process were mathematically simulated by a derivative method. The first-principles calculation reveals that the NO₂ molecule is most likely adsorbed at the terminal O₁c site of tungsten oxide, leading to the introduction of new surface states, which are responsible for the intrinsic NO₂-sensing properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat treatment 3amicroparticles 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen dioxide 3atungsten oxide 3aultrasonic treatment1 aZhang, Kewei1 aWang, Liangshi1 aSun, Jianhua1 aLuo, Ruixian1 aLi, Dianqing1 aChen, Aifan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 May 6, v. 2, no. 21 p.7927-7934dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00053f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245014400172300001600316520155300332592002801885650001801913650002201931650001101953650001201964650001601976650001701992650001502009650001402024650001402038650001402052650001802066650002302084650001502107650002002122650001902142650001802161650001502179650002202194700001702216700002102233700001702254700001802271773011302289856008102402852000902483655001202492IND60132683520221121211746.0150511e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013268352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-015-0729-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauhan, Raj Deepika10aImprovements in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) for large-scale production of transgenic plants  ap. 591-603.  aCassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a major staple food crop of the humid tropics. As a heterozygous, vegetatively propagated crop, robust transformation protocols must be developed for elite cultivars that allow predictable production of large numbers of independent transgenic plant lines. A high throughput Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system was developed for the elite East African farmer-preferred cassava cultivar TME 204 using the GFP visual marker gene. Inclusion of the antibiotic moxalactam in culture medium used to produce embryogenic target tissues prior to inoculation with Agrobacterium increased recovery of independent GFP-expressing transgenic callus lines by up to 113-fold compared to the control. Enhanced transformation was also observed when TME 204 tissues were pretreated with other cephalosporins, namely cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefmetazole and cefotaxime. Similar but less dramatic increases in transformation efficiencies were seen for the West African cultivars Oko-iyawo and 60444 when pre-treated with moxalactam. Dilution of Agrobacterium suspensions used for co-culture was found to increase transformation efficiencies, resulting in regeneration at an average of 33 GFP-expressing TME 204 plants per cc settled cell volume at OD₆₀₀0.05, compared to 15 plants at the more commonly used OD₆₀₀0.5. The optimized transformation systems were successfully utilized for the integration of genetic constructs for disease resistance and nutritional enhancement into more than 750 plants of TME 204.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aManihot esculenta 3acallus 3acassava 3acefmetazole 3acefoperazone 3acefotaxime 3acefoxitin 3acoculture 3acultivars 3aculture media 3adisease resistance 3afood crops 3agenetic markers 3aheterozygosity 3ahumid tropics 3amoxalactam 3atransgenic plants1 aBeyene, Getu1 aKalyaeva, Marina1 aFauquet, C.,1 aTaylor, Nigel0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2015 June, v. 121, no. 3 p.591-603dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-015-0729-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008500174300001600259520103000275592002801305650002201333650002101355650001601376650001201392650001601404650001101420650001101431650003301442650001501475650001101490650002101501650001601522650001801538653001401556653001501570653001101585653003401596653001901630700002901649700001701678700002501695773010601720856008701826852000901913655001201922IND60536175620221118234803.0190410e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053617562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazargan, Alireza14aThe effect of alkali treatment on rice husk moisture content and drying kinetics  ap. 468-475.  aThe utilization of rice husks for energy production is often problematic due to their high ash content. A simple method for silica ash removal is the treatment of the husks with sodium hydroxide solutions. The alkali treatment can induce other changes to the husks which need to be investigated. Here, the effects of alkali treatment on the moisture content and drying kinetics of the samples were investigated. The alkali treatment is shown to result in an increase in moisture retention by the as-prepared biomass. Response surface methodology (RSM) using a Box–Behnken design (BBD) is employed to investigate the effects of various input parameters, namely reaction temperature, duration, and alkali mass ratio on moisture uptake of the rice husk. In addition, the drying kinetics of the as-prepared samples are modeled and compared to raw husk prior to treatment. The results show a small increase in the effective diffusivity and a significant decrease in the activation energy required for drying the treated samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalkali treatment 3aash content 3abiomass 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3aenergy 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice hulls 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3awater content 0aRice husk 0aHull/Chaff 0aDrying 0aCombined heat and power (CHP) 0aLignocellulose1 aGebreegziabher, Tesfalet1 aHui, Chi-Wai1 aMcKay, G.q(Gordon),0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2014 Nov., v. 70 p.468-475dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245008600189300001600275520108900291592002801380650003001408650002001438650000801458650001601466650001801482650002101500650002901521650001901550650002301569650000901592650001001601650001401611650003001625650001801655650001001673650006701683650001201750650004901762650003901811650005001850650002301900650004601923650000901969650005801978650001102036650005202047650000902099650002802108650003002136650002702166650005102193650006502244651001102309651001102320700002402331700002002355700001902375700002102394773009702415856004802512852000902560655001202569IND4469619620221120201451.0121003e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446961962DNAL7 a224343632pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-012-2839-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQablan, Moneeb Ahmad10aStray dogs of northern Jordan as reservoirs of ticks and tick-borne hemopathogens  ap. 301-307.  aDogs are competent reservoir hosts of several hemopathogens including zoonotic agents and can serve as readily available source of nutrition for many blood-feeding arthropods. Three hemopathogens had been detected for the first time in Jordan. The PCR prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Hepatozoon canis, and piroplasmid DNA were 39.5%, 28.9%, and 7.9% (n = 38) respectively. Sequencing of amplicons of PCR with universal primers targeting the 18S rRNA gene of piroplasmids shows the highest similarity to equine piroplasmids species Theileria equi from two dogs and Babesia caballi from a single dog. Ticks of two genera Rhipicephalus and Haemaphysalis, were detected in this study (n = 268). The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus was the most abundant species (95.1%, n = 255), followed by Haemaphysalis erinacei (3%, n = 8) and Haemaphysalis parva (1.9%, n = 5). The two Haemaphysalis species were detected for the first time from dogs in Jordan. Regarding its high prevalence, we expect R. sanguineus being a possible vector of detected pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aBabesia caballi 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aHaemaphysalis 3aHepatozoon canis 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aTheileria equi 3adisease reservoirs 3adogs 3agenes 3anutrition 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aticks 2aAnaplasma phagocytophilumxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aAnimals 2aBabesiaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBloodxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aCoccidiaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDisease Reservoirs 2aDog Diseasesxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aDogs 2aEctoparasitic Infestationsxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aIxodidaexclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTheileriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aTick-Borne Diseasesxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 3aJordan 0aJordan1 aKubelová, Michaela1 aŠiroký, Pavel1 aModrý, David,1 aAmr, Zuhair Sami0 tParasitology research.g2012 July, v. 111, no. 1 p.301-307dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-012-2839-4  aDNAL 7aarticle04106naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015000164300001600314520266600330592002802996650002203024650001803046650001603064650001003080650001603090650001003106650002703116650001403143650001303157650001703170650001203187650001003199650001103209650001803220650001803238700001503256700001803271700001803289700001703307700001403324700001403338700001503352700001303367700001703380773011303397856008103510852000903591655001203600IND60132683720221121224738.0150511e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013268372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-015-0732-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Meiping10aHigh-efficiency propagation of Chinese water chestnut [Eleocharis dulcis (Burm.f.) Trin. ex Hensch] using a temporary immersion bioreactor system  ap. 761-772.  aSeveral studies have reported different propagation methods for the Chinese water chestnut [Eleocharis dulcis (Burm.f.) Trin. ex Hensch]. To date, none of these methods have efficiently achieved large-scale plantlet production using minimal labor input. The present study investigated the propagation of Chinese water chestnut shoot tips derived from corm and creeping rhizomes in a temporary immersion bioreactor system (TIBS) compared with propagation using conventional semi-solid medium methods. We evaluated the regeneration capacity of the corm and creeping rhizome shoot tips of E. dulcis Guiti No. 2 sp. nov. and found that culturing under optimized TIBS conditions (15 min of immersion into nutrient medium every 8 h) produced the highest multiplication rate (36.5 times) and shoot-forming capacity (SFC, 68.9), and reduced the vitrification rate. Creeping rhizome shoot tips had slightly higher SFC than corm shoot tips; the highest shoot multiplication rate of 43.7 times in TIBS was obtained using Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium containing 4 mg L⁻¹ 6-benzylaminopurine and 0.5 mg L⁻¹ 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). These optimized conditions were applied to corm shoot tips of E. dulcis Guiti No. 1 var. nov., E. dulcis Guiti No. 2 sp. nov., and E. dulcis Guifengti No. 1 sp. nov. Root formation was observed during the shoot multiplication stage on semi-solid MS medium; however, root formation was not noted during the shoot multiplication stage in TIBS. While TIBS produced a higher multiplication rate and SFC indices, there were no significant differences in average number of shoots per explant between TIBS and semi-solid medium. We also evaluated the effects of different immersion frequencies and NAA concentrations on TIBS propagation of E. dulcis Guiti No. 2 sp. nov. shoot tips by measuring the rooting percentage, average number of roots (length ≥ 3 cm) per explant, maximum root length, and root-forming capacity (RFC). The results showed that the medium containing 2.0 mg L⁻¹NAA at the rooting stage produced the best-developed root systems with the highest rooting percentage, maximum root length, and highest RFC (75.8 %, 8.5 cm, and 3.8, respectively); it also reduced the immersion frequency. The optimized conditions produced plantlets that had a greater capacity to acclimatize after transfer to the greenhouse. E. dulcis Guiti No. 1 var. nov. plantlets had the highest survival rate (95 %), largest diameters, and highest number of creeping rhizomes. The results of this study demonstrate that TIBS is a reliable and efficient method for large-scale propagation of Chinese water chestnut plantlets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleocharis dulcis 3abenzyladenine 3abioreactors 3acorms 3agreenhouses 3alabor 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aplantlets 3arhizomes 3aroot systems 3arooting 3aroots 3ashoots 3asurvival rate 3avitrification1 aJiang, Wen1 aWei, Shaolong1 aLin, Zhicheng1 aCai, Binghua1 aYang, Liu1 aLuo, Cong1 aHe, Xinhua1 aTan, Jun1 aChen, Lijuan0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2015 June, v. 121, no. 3 p.761-772dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-015-0732-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009500163300001800258520081900276592002801095650002201123650002201145650004401167650001301211653003801224653001401262653001501276653002001291653002201311700002201333700002101355700001901376773014001395856007701535852000901612655001201621IND60521749220221119025743.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052174922DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-11072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanich, Jürgen10aCyclothiazeno-Vanadiumdibromid, VBr2(N3S2) / Cyclo-Thiazeno Vanadium Dibromide, VBr2(N3S2)  ap. 1457-1462.  aVBr₂(N₃S₂) was synthesized by reaction of VCl₂(N₃S₂) with Me₃SiBr. It reacts with PPh₄Br in dibromomethane solution to form (PPh₄)₂[VBr₃(N₃S₂)]₂. The compounds were characterized by their IR and ⁵¹V NMR spectra. The crystal structure of VBr₂(N₃S₂) was determined by X-ray diffraction (2060 reflexions. R = 0.114). Crystal data: triclinic, space group P1̄, a = 586.4, b = 794.2, c = 744.6 pm. α - 89.25, β - 108.58, γ = 99.67°. Z = 2. The vanadium atoms form planar, six-membered rings wjith the N₃S₂ groups, with short VN distances (172 and 185 pm). Bromine- bridged dimers are associated via V−N links to form chains in a similar way as in some tetrahalides. The structure is similar to that of VCl₂(N₃S₂), but the chains are rotated by 17° along their axes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3avanadium 0aCyclo-Thiazeno Vanadium Dibromide 0aSynthesis 0aIR Spectra 0a51V NMR Spectra 0aCrystal Structure1 aWilling, Wolfgang1 aMüller, Ulrich,1 aDehnicke, Kurt0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 40, no. 11 p.1457-1462dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1985-11073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012300170300001800293520105100311592002801362596005901390596005301449650004401502650002201546650001801568650001801586650001801604650001501622650001301637650003701650650003701687650001501724700001701739700001601756700001801772700001601790700001901806700001501825773012901840856008301969852000902052655001202061IND60776403520221122060628.0220505e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077640352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-022-03801-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Ravi Kumar10aRole of Bio-Based Synthesized Nanozinc Oxide in Ameliorating the Deleterious Effects Caused by Lead in Vigna radiata L  ap. 2005-2020.  aThe present work describes the bio-based green synthesis and characterization of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using leaf extract of Tridax procumbens; the synthesized nanoparticles were used to study their beneficial effect on the growth and metabolism of Vigna radiata. ZnO NPs were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis spectra). Growth of V. radiata seedlings was measured in terms of shoot length and root length that were treated 20 and 40 mg/L concentrations of green synthesized ZnO NPs and constant concentration (50 mg/L) of PbCl₂. These studies have shown the effect of ZnO NPs in the stimulation of growth as well as physiological and biochemical parameters. Vigna seedlings showed positive effects depending upon the increasing concentrations of ZnO NPs. This study suggests that ZnO NPs can be effectively used to ameliorate the toxicity of Pb in Vigna plants.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 20/12/2015 (ii) EU-Vcuniversity grants commission  aSr. No. 2121530863cuniversity grants commission 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aTridax procumbens 3aVigna radiata 3abiotechnology 3aleaf extracts 3ametabolism 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc oxide1 aSingh, N.

We aimed to examine the association of dietary pattern with subsequent overall mortality in elderly Japanese, and demonstrate the modifiable effect of lifestyle factors on this association.Totally 2949 Japanese community-dwelling residents aged 64 or 65 years were included in the NISSIN Project in 1996–2005. A validated food frequency questionnaire was adopted to collect dietary information and factor analysis was used to extract dietary patterns. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated through the Cox proportional hazard regression model.Over 31,233 person-years, 253 persons died. Three different dietary patterns were identified: meat-fat, healthy, and dairy-bread pattern. Increased risk for all-cause mortality for meat-fat pattern was observed among those who never smoked (HR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.37–5.79); this association for dairy-bread pattern was observed among the never smokers (HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.20–4.06) and occasional drinkers (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.09–2.39). For healthy pattern, decreased overall mortality risk was observed among never smokers (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24–0.80), occasional drinkers (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42–0.93), and those who walked ≥1 h/day (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28–0.77).We found that tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and daily walking duration could modify the associations of three patterns with overall mortality. Healthy eating along with other healthy lifestyle factor among elderly populations can decrease the overall mortality risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3aeating habits 3aelderly 3afactor analysis 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahealthy diet 3alifestyle 3amortality 3anutrition risk assessment 3atobacco use 3awalking 0aDietary pattern 0aAll-cause mortality 0aLifestyle factors 0aElderly population1 aUkawa, Shigekazu1 aOkada, Emiko1 aWakai, Kenji1 aKawamura, Takashi1 aAndo, M.q(Masahiko),1 aTamakoshi, Akiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8263-37030 tClinical nutrition.g2019 Feb., v. 38, no. 1 p.288-296dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008500162300001800247520132700265592002801592650002201620650001501642650002301657650003401680650002801714650001301742650004401755650002401799650001701823650002001840650001101860650001201871650001701883650001601900650001601916650002101932650003701953700001801990700001902008773015502027856008102182852000902263655001202272IND60630615220221122171559.0190213e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063061522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0412-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Jinlan10aSynthesis of 3-dimensional mesoporous silica using a di-block copolymer template  ap. 4461-4469.  aExploring polymeric surfactants as templates for synthesizing ordered mesoporous silicas has become increasingly important for both academic interests and industrial applications. In this work, we employed C₁₆EO₄₀, a di-block copolymer polyethylene-poly(ethylene oxide), as template in an attempt to synthesize a modified 3-dimensional wormhole mesoporous silicas (WMS-39). In addition, various synthesizing conditions were investigated, including pre-hydrolysis time of TEOS, reaction temperatures and the ratios of TEOS to template. The products were characterized using powder XRD, TEM, ²⁹Si MAS NMR and nitrogen adsorption measurements. The characteristics of as-synthesized mesoporous silica were compared with SBA-15, a highly ordered mesoporous silica, prepared using non-ionic tri-block copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) as templates. The WMS-39 materials have a BET surface area of 600–970 m²/g and narrowly distributed pore diameter around 3.9 nm. The morphology of WMS-39 was found to be wormhole framework as indicated in TEM diagrams. Thermal transformation of the as-synthesized mesoporous materials were carefully analyzed with TGA/DTA. Findings obtained from this work enable us to propose a modified assembly mechanism of mesoporous silicas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential thermal analysis 3aindustrial applications 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyethylene glycol 3aporous media 3apropylene oxide 3asilica 3asilicon 3asurface area 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aXiao, Huining1 aZhang, Zisheng0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 June, v. 42, no. 12 p.4461-4469dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-0412-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008300168300001400251520171700265592002801982650001302010650001502023650001602038650001602054650002402070650001202094650002102106650001602127650001302143650001302156650001402169650002102183650001402204650002202218650001502240650001502255650001102270650002402281650000902305650001502314650000902329653002502338653002202363653002602385653002602411700001902437773011702456856008302573852000902656655001202665IND60649548820221122174204.0190830e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064954882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2019.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChua, Jian-Yong10aSoy whey: More than just wastewater from tofu and soy protein isolate industry  ap. 24-32.  aSoy whey is a by-product generated from both tofu and soy protein isolate production. This by-product contains a substantial amount of nutrients consisting of proteins, simple sugars, oligosaccharides, minerals, and soy isoflavones. Soy whey is commonly disposed of into the sewage after it is generated, and this pollutes water bodies.Researchers from various countries have explored the valorization of soy whey for value-add or value creation in addition to mitigate the environmental pollution. This review article aims to evaluate the current status of soy whey valorization research and the learning points that can be adapted from the dairy whey valorization research which are more extensively studied than soy whey valorization research. Various methods of soy whey utilization are discussed, which can be broadly classified into two categories: physical and microbiological/enzymatic. Physical methods include the recovery of the nutrients (eg. isoflavone, protein and minerals) and the production of various functional ingredients (eg. emulsifiers), whereas microbiological/enzymatic methods include the production of functional ingredients using microorganisms and enzymes (eg. prebiotic and citric acid), propagation of microorganisms (eg. probiotics) as well as biofuel production.Even though there have been various efforts in valorizing soy whey, most of these studies still generate a significant amount of waste at the end of the processes. Therefore, there is a need to find an efficient method to significantly valorize soy whey without significant residual waste or generation of new waste and dairy whey valorization technologies may serve as a template for efficient soy whey valorization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abyproducts 3acitric acid 3aemulsifiers 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzymes 3afunctional foods 3aisoflavones 3alearning 3aminerals 3anutrients 3aoligosaccharides 3apollution 3apollution control 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3asewage 3asoy protein isolate 3atofu 3awastewater 3awhey 0aoy whey valorization 0aBiotransformation 0aRecovery of nutrients 0aZero-waste production1 aLiu, Shao-Quan0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2019 Sept., v. 91 p.24-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2019.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245019600168300001100364520146700375592002801842650001201870650002301882650001701905650001901922650001201941650001001953650003701963650002202000650001502022650002702037650001402064650001302078650001902091650001002110650001402120651001802134651001902152651002102171700002002192700002202212700002702234700002502261700002302286700001502309700001902324700001602343773010702359856008102466852000902547655001202556IND60132684020221121101302.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013268402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-015-0879-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeatty, Gemma E.10aLack of genetic structure and evidence for long-distance dispersal in ash (Fraxinus excelsior) populations under threat from an emergent fungal pathogen: implications for restorative planting  ap. 53.  aGenetic analysis on populations of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) throughout Ireland was carried out to determine the levels and patterns of genetic diversity in naturally seeded trees in ash woodlands and hedgerows, with the aim of informing conservation and replanting strategies in the face of potential loss of trees as a result of ash dieback. Samples from 33 sites across Northern Ireland and three sites in the Republic of Ireland were genotyped for eight nuclear and ten chloroplast microsatellites. Levels of diversity were high (mean A R = 10.53; mean H O = 0.709; mean H E = 0.765) and were similar to those in Great Britain and continental Europe, whilst levels of population genetic differentiation based on nuclear microsatellites were extremely low (Φ ST = 0.0131). Levels of inbreeding (mean F IS = 0.067) were significantly lower than those reported for populations from Great Britain. Fine-scale analysis of seed dispersal indicated potential for dispersal over hundreds of metres. Our results suggest that ash woodlands across Ireland could be treated as a single management unit, and thus native material from anywhere in Ireland could be used as a source for replanting. In addition, high potential for dispersal has implications for recolonization processes post-ash dieback (Chalara fraxinea) infection, and could aid in our assessment of the capacity of ash to shift its range in response to global climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChalara 3aFraxinus excelsior 3achloroplasts 3aclimate change 3adieback 3afungi 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3aplanting 3aseed dispersal 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aGreat Britain 3aIrish Republic 3aNorthern Ireland1 aBrown, James A.1 aCassidy, Eamon M.1 aFinlay, Caroline M.

Vertical distribution of phytoplankton revealed that the maximum number of picophytoplankton was always observed near or a little deeper than the oxic-anoxic boundary layer (depth 5–6 m); they were dominant phytoplankton in the water layer deeper than the oxic-anoxic boundary from July to late September 2005. Spectral analysis of autofluorescence emitted from the particle fractions smaller than 5 μm measured with a spectrofluorometer and from individual cells measured with a microscope photodiode array detector revealed that the major component of picophytoplankton was phycoerythrin-rich, unicellular cyanobacteria (picocyanobacteria). Eukaryotic phytoplankton about 2.5 μm in diameter were also found, but the numbers were low. Fluorescence intensity of chlorophyll a at 685 nm (room temperature) emitted from the particle fractions smaller than 5 μm was increased by the addition of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. These observations indicated that at least some picophytoplankton had a functional photosystem II in the halocline where sulfide, the potential inhibitor of oxygenic photosynthesis, was always present. The large abundance together with their physiological potency suggest that picophytoplankton are one of the important primary producers in the halocline of Lake Suigetsu.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3alakes 3aphotosystem II 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3atrophic relationships 3aJapan 3aSea of Japan1 aTaniuchi, Yukiko1 aMurakami, Akio1 aTakaichi, Shinichi1 aOhtake, Shinya1 aOhki, Kaori0 tLimnology.g2007 Dec., v. 8, no. 3 p.271-280dSpringer-Verlagx1439-86217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-007-0213-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245013700175300001200312520150300324592002801827650002001855650001301875650000901888650001401897650002601911650004301937650002201980650001402002650001602016650001402032650002102046650002502067650002302092650001702115650001002132700002202142700002102164700002702185773011302212856008102325852000902406655001202415IND60132684120221121101248.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013268412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-015-1850-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKołodziejczyk, Izabela14aThe levels of melatonin and its metabolites in conditioned corn (Zea mays L.) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seeds during storage  ap. 105.  aThe efficiency of pre-sowing conditioning/priming methods used to apply melatonin into seeds was verified: osmopriming in the case of dicot Cucumis sativus and hydropriming of monocot Zea mays seeds. Both priming techniques were selected experimentally as optimal for the studied plant species. Four different seed variants were compared: control non-treated ones, and seeds conditioned with water or with 50 or 500 μM melatonin water solutions. The HPLC–MS quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to determine the content of melatonin and of its potential metabolites in the seeds during 1 year following the conditioning. The control seeds and those conditioned with water contained small amount of endogenous melatonin in both species. However, the level of this indoleamine increased markedly in cucumber and corn seeds primed with exogenous melatonin and it was always correlated with the concentration of melatonin applied. It was noted that melatonin was metabolized during seed storage by its gradual oxidation, thus it protects dry seeds against oxidative stress, prevents potential injuries and significantly increases seeds quality. Interestingly, in the control and water-primed seeds, seasonal fluctuations of endogenous melatonin concentration were noted and significant increase in this indoleamine in the winter month was observed. This suggests that in seeds endogenous melatonin could play a crucial role in seasonal rhythms independently of environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acucumbers 3aenvironmental factors 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amelatonin 3ametabolites 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aqualitative analysis 3aseasonal variation 3aseed storage 3aseeds1 aBałabusta, Marta1 aSzewczyk, Rafał1 aPosmyk, Małgorzata M.0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2015 June, v. 37, no. 6 p.105-105dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-015-1850-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009600159300001800255520123400273592002801507650002501535650001701560650002501577650002301602650002701625650001401652650002601666650001801692650001301710650002101723650002401744650002501768650002501793650001801818700001601836700001601852700001701868700001401885700001201899773013101911856007402042852000902116655001202125IND60671307220221120094620.0191002e20190924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067130722DNAL7 a10.1039/c9bm00991d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shaohan10aPolydopamine/puerarin nanoparticle-incorporated hybrid hydrogels for enhanced wound healing  ap. 4230-4236.  aOxidative damage generated by various biochemical pathways can disrupt the oxidant/antioxidant balance in cells, causing slow wound healing and tissue regeneration; in this regard, a hydrogel dressing with antioxidant properties can promote wound healing; however, its design is still a challenge. Herein, a polydopamine/puerarin (PDA/PUE) nanoparticle-incorporated polyethylene glycol diacrylate hybrid hydrogel (PEG-DA/PDA/PUE) with antioxidant properties was prepared and used as a wound-healing material. Experimental observations indicated that the PEG-DA/PDA/PUE hydrogel possessed excellent swelling capacity and mechanical property. Moreover, the antioxidant capability was enhanced with an increase in the concentration of polydopamine/puerarin nanoparticles in the hydrogel. The hydrogel presented good cell proliferation and antioxidant activity, including a decrease in ROS and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity under oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, the full-thickness skin-defect-regeneration process could be accelerated via the antioxidant hydrogel treatment. This study validated the potential applications of an antioxidant hydrogel for wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical pathways 3acell proliferation 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahydrogels 3amechanical properties 3ananoparticles 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3apolyethylene glycol 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aswelling (materials) 3atissue repair1 aOu, Qianmin1 aXin, Peikun1 aYuan, Qijuan1 aWang, Yan1 aWu, Jun0 tBiomaterials science.g2019 Sept. 24, v. 7, no. 10 p.4230-4236dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9bm00991d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245013800216300001600354520151000370592002801880650001101908650001901919650002001938650001101958650001601969650001001985650002101995650001202016650001202028650001902040653002102059653001702080653002902097653001902126653002402145700002002169700002102189700006002210773010602270856008702376852000902463655001202472IND60536176420221118232629.0190410e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053617642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellani, Beatrice1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5546-656X10aHydrate-based removal of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide from biogas mixtures: Experimental investigation and energy evaluations  ap. 330-338.  aThis paper presents an experimental study on the application of gas hydrate technology to biogas upgrading. Since CH4, CO2 and H2S form hydrates at quite different thermodynamic conditions, the capture of CO2 and H2S by means of gas hydrate crystallization appears to be a viable technological alternative for their removal from biogas streams. Nevertheless, hydrate-based biogas upgrading has been poorly investigated. Works found in literature are mainly at a laboratory scale and concern with thermodynamic and kinetic fundamental studies. The experimental campaign was carried out with an up-scaled apparatus, in which hydrates are produced in a rapid manner, with hydrate formation times of few minutes. Two types of mixtures were used: a CH4/CO2 mixture and a CH4/CO2/H2S mixture. The objective of the investigation is to evaluate the selectivity and the separation efficiency of the process and the role of hydrogen sulphide in the hydrate equilibrium. Results show that H2S can be captured along with CO2 in the same process. The maximum value of the separation factor, defined as the ratio between the number of moles of CO2 and the number of moles of CH4 removed from the gas phase, is 11. In the gas phase, a reduction of CO2 of 24.5% in volume is achievable in 30 min.Energy costs of a real 30-min separation process, carried out in the experimental campaign, are evaluated and compared with those obtained from theoretical calculations. Some aspects for technology improvement are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3agas hydrate 3agases 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amethane 3astreams 3athermodynamics 0aBiogas upgrading 0aGas hydrates 0aHydrate-based separation 0aWater spraying 0aUp-scaled apparatus1 aRossi, Federico1 aFilipponi, Mirko1 aNicolini, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4026-05630 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2014 Nov., v. 70 p.330-338dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245005200178300001600230520181800246592002802064650002402092650001402116650001402130650001702144650001402161650002902175650002402204650001502228650001302243650001002256651001602266653001902282653001102301653002802312653001702340653000902357653000802366653001102374653000802385653000802393653000702401700002302408700006402431773011002495856008302605852000902688655001202697IND60630948020221121205556.0190325e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063094802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2018.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalatbari-Soltani, Saman10aSixteen years trends in reported undernutrition  ap. 271-278.  aHow undernutrition is reported in hospital discharge data is not understood. To assess trends in reported undernutrition and its management among hospitalized patients in Switzerland, and the association between reported undernutrition and in-hospital mortality, acquired infection, intensive care unit stay (ICU), and length of hospital stay (LOS).Data from the Swiss hospital discharge databases from 1998 to 2014 (n = 13,297,188 hospitalizations, 52.2% women, 48.4% aged 65+, and 85% Swiss national). Reported undernutrition was defined by the presence of any undernutrition-related International Classification of Diseases 10th revision code. Nutritional management was defined by the presence of any nutritional intervention code.Prevalence of reported undernutrition increased from 0.32% in 1998 to 3.97% in 2014 in Switzerland, and similar but varying trends were found for each of the seven Swiss administrative regions: ranging from 0.18% to 2.13% in Ticino and from 0.23% to 5.63% in Mittelland. Undernutrition management of hospitalizations with reported undernutrition increased from 0.6% in 1998 to 57.8% in 2014, with wide variations according to administrative region: from 0% to 32.9% in Ticino and from 0% to 68.9% in Central Switzerland. After multivariable adjustment, reported undernutrition was positively associated with in-hospital mortality: odds-ratio and (95% confidence interval): 2.30 (2.26–2.34); acquired infection: 3.57 (3.46–3.70); ICU stay: 1.65 (1.63–1.68) and longer LOS: 19.6 ± 0.2 vs. 13.0 ± 0.1 days.Undernutrition is increasingly reported in Switzerland; still, over 40% of undernourished hospitalizations don't benefit from nutritional support. Reported undernutrition is associated with increased in-hospital mortality, acquired infection, ICU stay, and LOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3amortality 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional support 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3awomen 3aSwitzerland 0aUndernutrition 0aTrends 0aHospital discharge data 0aEpidemiology 0aCHOP 0aDRG 0aICD-10 0aICU 0aLOS 0aOR1 ade Mestral, Carlos1 aMarques-Vidal, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4548-85000 tClinical nutrition.g2019 Feb., v. 38, no. 1 p.271-278dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011400171300001400285520106800299536008801367592002801455596006201483650002401545650001401569650002301583650001401606650001501620650001301635650002301648650002001671650001501691650002701706650001801733650001501751650001001766653001101776653001501787653001301802653001501815653002401830653000901854653003301863653002401896700002001920773011001940856008502050852000902135655001202144IND60635303520221118121150.0190329e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063530352DNAL7 a10.1080/00049158.2019.15745402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBligård, L.-O.10aCCPE – the use of an analytical method to evaluate safety and ergonomics in maintenance of forest machinery  ap. 29-34.  aMany of the hazards in forestry are due to the handling of large trees and large machinery in rough terrain and remote areas. Activities such as maintenance and repair work have been identified as especially hazardous in the highly mechanised cut-to-length method. Accidents are under-reported, which emphasises the need for a systematic approach for accident prevention. A possible procedure is the use of an analytical evaluation method to identify presumptive hazardous situations and ergonomic issues before accidents can occur. Safety-critical sectors such as nuclear power and health care have invested many resources in these types of methods. The aim of this paper is to put one of those methods to test in a forestry context in a study evaluating maintenance of forest machinery. A framework for evaluation, Combined Cognitive and Physical Evaluation, known as CCPE, was selected and adapted for the study. The evaluation was successful in systematically predicting what could happen in hazardous situations with regard to use error and ergonomic issues.  aThis work was supported by the Kungl.

Until now, studies have proved only a few proteins to be associated with such pathogenic diseases. The two-component system is one of the most prevalent forms of bacterial signal transduction related to intestinal diseases. Here, we report a novel, recombinant, two-component, response regulator protein ArlR from the genome of F. nucleatum strain ATCC 25,586. We optimized the expression and purification conditions of ArlR; in addition, we characterized the interaction of this response regulator protein with the corresponding histidine kinase and DNA sequence. The full-length ArlR was successfully expressed in six E. coli host strains. However, optimum expression conditions of ArlR were present only in E. coli strain BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) RIL that was later induced with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 8 h at 25 °C. The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the molecular weight of the recombinant protein as 27.3 kDa with approximately 90% purity after gel filtration chromatography. Because ArlR was biologically active after its purification, it accepted the corresponding phosphorylated histidine kinase phosphate group and bound to the analogous DNA sequence. The binding constant between ArlR and the corresponding histidine kinase was about 2.1 μM, whereas the binding constant between ArlR and its operon was 6.4 μM. Altogether, these results illustrate an effective expression and purification method for the novel two-component system protein ArlR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFusobacterium nucleatum 3abiotechnology 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agel chromatography 3ahistidine kinase 3aintestines 3amolecular weight 3anucleotide sequences 3aoperon 3aperiodontitis 3aphosphates 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apurification methods 3arecombinant proteins 3aregulatory proteins 3asignal transduction1 aLi, Zhuting1 aShi, Xian1 aWang, Lulu1 aZhang, Xuqiang1 aDong, Yuesheng1 aQuan, Chunshan0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2022 May, v. 194, no. 5 p.2093-2107dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-021-03785-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01644naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010100161300001800262520060700280592002800887650001800915650002200933650001400955650001000969650001300979650001100992650001401003700001601017700001401033700001401047773015501061856008101216852000901297655001201306IND60630615620221122171625.0190213e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063061562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0676-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yun10aPreparation of carbon nanofibers over carbon nanotube-nickel catalyst in propylene decomposition  ap. 4240-4244.  aA variety of structural and morphological forms of carbon nanofibers, which comprise perpendicularly and obliquely stacking graphite fibers and the two composite forms made of outer coaxial graphite tubes and inner perpendicularly or obliquely stacking fibers, were fabricated in catalytically decomposing propylene–hydrogen mixture over carbon nanotube-supported nickel catalysts.

Current A. mearnsii planting stock cannot tolerate temperatures below −4°C, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop frost-tolerant seed. This study investigated the frost hardiness of seedlots from six South African A. mearnsii seed orchards located at altitudes of 1120–1458 m asl and latitudes of 26.7–29.8°S that were established with cold-hardy Australian provenances and/or local landraces from cold sites. Frost damage was assessed in four field trials established on two different dates in 2015. Three sites experienced extensive frost events, with frequency and intensity varying among sites. Minimum temperatures ranged from −6.4°C to −7.7°C across sites. The seedlot from the coldest, highest altitude orchard showed superior frost hardiness to other seedlots from lower altitude and warmer orchards of similar genetic origin. Thus, site climatic characteristics are important for the development of cold hardiness in A. mearnsii seed orchards. Frost hardiness in young A. mearnsii trees was significantly related to age and tree size. At four months of age, trees were highly susceptible to frost damage irrespective of tree size and orchard origin (60–71% frosted trees). Frost hardiness increased with age and was very high at c. nine months across orchards (1–8% frosted trees at one site and 0–2% at another site). At nine months, although the extent of frost damage was low, this was inversely related to tree size. The percentage of trees that recovered from frost damage also increased with age of frost damage, this being 21% at the site frosted at four months of age and 65–67% at the sites frosted at nine months of age. Finally, there were no differences in tree growth at 14 months suggesting that, unlike cold hardiness, the differences in environment between the orchards did not affect the growth performance of the offspring.  aThis work was supported by the NTE Company Ltd; NCT Forestry Co-operative Ltd and UCL Company Ltd; TWK Agri Ltd.  aPublisher supplied data  cNTE Company Ltd  cNCT Forestry Co-operative Ltd  cUCL Company Ltd  cTWK Agri Ltd 3aAcacia mearnsii 3aaltitude 3acold 3afield experimentation 3aforestry 3afrost 3afrost injury 3afrost resistance 3agrowth performance 3alandraces 3alatitude 3anursery stock 3aprogeny 3aprovenance 3arisk 3aseed orchards 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atrees 3aSouth Africa 0afrost hardiness 0aseed orchards 0aprovenances 0alandraces 0aadaptive traits 0aafter effects 0aAcacia mearnsii0 tAustralian forestry.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 82, no. 1 p.35-47dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11662x2325-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2019.15831123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011000167300001400277520150700291592002801798650001701826650002001843650002001863650002501883650001301908650001501921650001201936650001101948650001501959650002201974650001301996650001302009651001102022653002402033653003802057653003002095653003202125653004302157653003302200653003702233700002602270700002302296773012802319856008202447852000902529655001202538IND60516559720221117205835.0190730e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051655972DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929120003312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJANTKE, KERSTIN10aBenefits of earth observation data for conservation planning in the case of European wetland biodiversity  ap. 37-47.  aTo evaluate the status of biodiversity and to determine how current conservation efforts can be improved, biodiversity monitoring is crucial. An important aspect of data quality lies in its spatial resolution. It is unclear how finer scale land cover and land value information might further benefit biodiversity conservation. This paper aimed to assess the impacts of scale by modelling the conservation of endangered European wetland species and their corresponding habitats. Fine-scale datasets were derived by integrating existing geographical, biophysical and economic data. A habitat allocation model, based on principles from systematic conservation planning and economic theory, was developed to estimate area requirements and opportunity costs of habitat protection in Europe. Coarse-scale and fine-scale simulations were compared by inputting both resolutions into the model. Habitat locations were restricted either only by historical species occurrence data at UTM 50 resolution or additionally by explicit wetland data at 1-km² resolution. Coarse country-average land rents were contrasted with spatially detailed land rent estimates at a 5ʹ resolution. Costs of habitat protection and area requirements for reserves may be severely underestimated when conservation planning relies only on coarse-scale data, which may result in notable shortcomings in conservation target achievement. Improvements in conservation benefits far outweigh the additional costs of acquiring fine-scale data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3aeconomic theory 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3aleasing 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aopportunity costs 3aplanning 3awetlands 3aEurope 0abiodiversity policy 0aearth observation data resolution 0ahomogenous response units 0aland use optimization model 0amixed integer mathematical programming 0aspatial wetland distribution 0asystematic conservation planning1 aSCHLEUPNER, CHRISTINE1 aSchneider, Uwe A.,0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2013 Mar., v. 40, no. 1 p.37-47dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929120003313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009500207300001800302520124400320592002801564650001801592650001501610650001801625650001401643650001001657650002301667650002001690650001301710650001201723650002001735650002001755650001501775700005901790773012901849856008301978852000902061655001202070IND60776404120221121013731.0220505e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077640412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-022-03817-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllameh, Samira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8787-137212aA Distance-Based Microfluidic Paper-Based Biosensor for Glucose Measurements in Tear Range  ap. 2077-2092.  aThe prevalence of diabetes has increased over the past years. Therefore, developing minimally invasive, user-friendly, and cost-effective glucose biosensors is necessary especially in low-income and developing countries. Cellulose paper–based analytical devices have attracted the attention of many researchers due to affordability, not requiring trained personnel, and complex equipment. This paper describes a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) for detecting glucose concentration in tear range with the naked eye. The paper-based biosensor fabricated by laser CO2; and glucose oxidase/horseradish peroxidase (GOx/HRP) enzyme solution coupled with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) were utilized as reagents. A sample volume of 10 μl was needed for the biosensor operation and the results were observable within 5 min. The color intensity–based and distance-based results were analyzed by ImageJ and Tracker to evaluate the device performance. Distance-based results showed a linear behavior in 0.1–1.2 mM with an R² = 0.9962 and limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1 mM. The results could be perceived by the naked eye without needing additional equipment or trained personnel in a relatively short time (3–5 min).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3abiosensors 3abiotechnology 3acellulose 3acolor 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahuman resources 3aperoxidase1 aRabbani, Mohsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9187-076X0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2022 May, v. 194, no. 5 p.2077-2092dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-022-03817-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010500165300001800270520116200288592002801450650001601478650001501494650001401509650001001523650001001533650001601543650001401559650001501573650001401588650001101602650001601613700001901629773015501648856008101803852000901884655001201893IND60630615720221122171549.0190213e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063061572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0682-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Jiawei10aX-ray irradiation induced optical absorptions in silver and manganese doped soda-lime silicate glass  ap. 4170-4176.  aSilver nanoclusters formation was observed in Ag-doped or Ag–Mn-doped soda-lime silicate glasses after X-ray irradiation followed by thermal annealing. Silver nanoclusters were formed with mean-size of about 3 nm after heating at 420 °C for 1 h in Ag-doped glass, and were disappeared after heating at 600 °C for 1 h. Mn³⁺ was formed in Mn-doped glass after X-ray irradiation followed by heating at 400 °C for 1 h, and was reduced to Mn²⁺ upon subsequently heating at 600 °C for 1 h. The presence of Mn³⁺ led to a purple color, while the silver nanoclusters provided a yellow color in the glass. The Ag-doped or Mn-doped glass may be viable as recyclable coloration glasses. In Ag–Mn-doped glass silver nanoclusters were formed only after heating at a high temperature of 600 °C following the irradiation. In addition, manganese showed a similar X-ray-induced behavior in the Mn-doped glass and the Ag–Mn-doped glass. In contrast, silver behaved differently in the Ag-doped glass and the Ag–Mn-doped glass. Unlike those in Ag-doped glass, the silver nanoclusters would not be dissolved in Ag–Mn-doped once they were formed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3aannealing 3acolor 3aglass 3airradiation 3amanganese 3ananosilver 3asilicates 3asilver 3atemperature1 aJiang, Liqiang0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 June, v. 42, no. 12 p.4170-4176dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-0682-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245014200205506011700347506007600464520164900540592002802189506003702217650002702254650001102281650001302292650001602305650001502321650001202336650001002348650002102358650001802379653003302397653003702430653001102467653001102478653002102489700001802510700006002528700006502588700001902653700001602672773011402688856008402802852000902886655001202895IND60770078620221207083349.0220809e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077007862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.1017832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUenal, Fatih1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8155-306614aThe roots of ecological dominance orientation: Assessing individual preferences for an anthropocentric and hierarchically organized world  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEcological dominance is a central concept in the study of interspecies and species-environment relations. Yet, although theoretical and empirical work on ecological dominance has progressed in many scientific disciplines, the psychology of ecological dominance remains understudied. The present research advances theoretical and empirical inquiry on ecological dominance as a psychological construct, examining how it relates to humans’ attitudes, beliefs, and behavior across different relational domains (i.e., intraspecies, interspecies, human-environment). To this end, we validate a novel measure, the Ecological Dominance Orientation (EDO) scale, based on the popular iconic depiction of ecocentric versus anthropocentric arrangements of the relationship between humans, nonhuman animals, and the natural environment. In five pre-registered studies across two countries (N = 2407), we demonstrate that EDO a) relates to various attitudes in a similar fashion both within and between different relational domains, b) is uniquely associated with socially consequential attitudes (i.e., modern sexism, speciesism, dehumanization) above established measures of personal ideology, c) is reliable over time, d) relates to a distinct set of personality correlates, and e) uniquely predicts pro-environmental behavior. This research extends classical Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) by theorizing about the socio-ecological roots of intergroup, interspecies, and human-environment relations as hierarchically structured power relations. Theoretical implications of social and ecological dominance orientations are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aattitudes and opinions 3ahumans 3ajournals 3apersonality 3aprediction 3arooting 3aroots 3asocial dominance 3asocial impact 0asocial Dominance orientation 0aEcological dominance orientation 0aRacism 0aSexism 0aAnthropocentrism1 aSidanius, Jim1 aMaertens, Rakoen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8507-53591 aHudson, Sa-kiera T.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6607-17041 aDavis, Gregory1 aGhani, Asma0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2022 June, v. 81 p.101783-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.1017833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03895naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012600163300001400289520226400303592002802567650002302595650001802618650001102636650001002647650002302657650002102680650001702701650002502718650001502743650002602758650002102784650001302805650001402818650001802832650001302850650001402863650001202877650001802889650001902907653001702926653001802943653002602961653001902987653002103006653002103027700001803048700002103066700002303087700002203110773010203132856008603234852000903320655001203329IND60570611520221121010111.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057061152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Fan10aUptake and toxicity of CuO nanoparticles to Daphnia magna varies between indirect dietary and direct waterborne exposures  ap. 78-86.  aResearch examining the direct and indirect ecological effects of nanomaterials in aquatic ecosystems is important for developing a more realistic understanding of the environmental implications of nanotechnology. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are being used extensively in many industries but are considered highly toxic to aquatic species residing in surface waters. Few studies have addressed whether CuO NPs can be transferred through the aquatic food chain, and if such indirect exposure to nanomaterials impacts their toxicity. We investigated the uptake and trophic transfer of CuO NPs from the algae Chlorella vulgaris to the crustacean Daphnia magna and assessed bio-partitioning and resulting toxicity. We hypothesized that CuO NPs can be associated with algal cells and be transported to predators through feeding, and that the chronic toxicity can be altered in comparison to direct CuO NP exposure. For the indirect feeding exposure, algae pre-incubated with CuO NPs (Cu-algae) were washed to remove loose NPs and fed to D. magna while Cu uptake and toxicity were evaluated. For the direct waterborne exposures, a parallel group of D. magna were exposed to equivalent concentrations of CuO NPs while being fed unexposed algae. Using hyperspectral imaging we observed strong surface associations between pre-incubated CuO NPs and algae used in the feeding exposure, and quantified the average Cu content (0.15mg Cu/L) with ICP-OES. Cu accumulated in daphnid bodies to a greater extent in direct exposures, whereas molted carapaces and neonate offspring had more copper following the indirect feeding exposure, implying that D. magna may regulate internal Cu differently depending on the method of CuO NP delivery. Significantly higher D. magna mortality was observed following direct exposure relative to feeding exposure, and neonate production from adult daphnids exposed indirectly to CuO NPs was significantly reduced. Thus, nanoparticle interaction with biota at one trophic level may alter the biological response at the next trophic level in a way that is dependent on the delivery scenario. This study highlights the importance of evaluating potential ecological impacts of nanomaterials in more relevant, complex exposure scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aDaphnia magna 3aadults 3aalgae 3aaquatic ecosystems 3achronic toxicity 3acupric oxide 3aenvironmental impact 3afood chain 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aindirect contact 3aindustry 3amortality 3ananoparticles 3aneonates 3apredators 3aprogeny 3asurface water 3atrophic levels 0aCopper oxide 0aDaphnia magna 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aExposure route 0aChronic toxicity 0aTrophic transfer1 aBortvedt, Amy1 aHarper, Bryan J.1 aCrandon, Lauren E.1 aHarper, Stacey L.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 190 p.78-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014200163300001600305520165000321592002801971650001201999650002502011650002302036650002002059650001102079650001302090650001402103650001302117650001002130650001502140650001102155650002502166650001402191650003002205650001802235650002202253650001002275650001302285651001602298653001802314653000902332653000902341653001202350653001302362653003402375700001302409700001302422700001502435700001102450700001802461773012202479856008502601852000902686655001202695IND60635303820221118121220.0190329e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063530382DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2019.15801672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOn, SLW10aIsolation and genotyping of Campylobacter species from kiwi (Apteryx spp.) in captivity: implications for transmission to and from humans  ap. 134-137.  aAims: To investigate the presence of Campylobacter spp. in captive kiwi (Apteryx spp.) and compare their genotypic profiles with those of human and animal origin, in order to assess their potential for zoonotic or zooanthroponotic transmission. Methods: Conventional selective enrichment and filter-based isolation methods were applied to isolate Campylobacter spp. from fresh faecal samples from 12 North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) and one great spotted kiwi (A. haastii), housed in one of five different areas in a kiwi sanctuary in Christchurch, New Zealand. Isolates were identified using multiplex PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. High-resolution rapid genotyping using multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification-based binary typing (MBiT) was applied and profiles compared with similar results from 2,165 Campylobacter spp. isolates contained in a database derived from human clinical, veterinary and environmental samples. Results: One isolate of C. jejuni, and one belonging to the C. lari phylogenetic group were recovered from faeces from two kiwi. High-resolution rapid genotyping by MBiT demonstrated these to be indistinguishable from isolates obtained previously from human cases of diarrhoea, and others from chicken, cattle, sheep and water. Conclusions: These data provide evidence for potential zoonotic or zooanthroponotic transmission of Campylobacter spp. in kiwi with implications for management of birds kept in captivity. We believe this is the first formal report of C. jejuni and a C. lari-like organism in kiwi.

The effect of thermophilic bacterium, Bacillus licheniformis was evaluated to control Pythium aphanidermatum induced damping off in chilli (Capsicum annuum L.) under laboratory as well as pot culture conditions. B. licheniformis suppressed the growth of P. aphanidermatum equally as Trichoderma harzianum under laboratory conditions by dual culture technique. B. licheniformis treatment was at par with T. harzianum when studied in pot cultures. There was 81.18% and 83.16% inhibition of disease causing P. aphanidermatum with respect to infected control pots with B. licheniformis and T. harzianum, respectively. B. licheniformis used in present study is thermophilic in nature and hence the study has relevance in the context of failure of T. harzianum at higher temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aCapsicum annuum 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3abiological control 3adamping off 3afield crops 3afungi 3apot culture 3atemperature 3athermophilic bacteria 0aBacillus licheniformis 0abio-control 0abio-pesticide 0athermophilic bacteria 0aTrichoderma harzianum1 aKale, Sharad P.0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2011 July 1, v. 44, no. 11 p.1068-1074dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235401003755262  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245014600189300001600335520162000351592002801971650001801999650002202017650001402039650001702053650002202070650001102092650002802103650000902131650001602140650002402156650001202180650002402192650005802216650002402274650002502298650005602323650002202379650001602401651001302417700003602430700001902466700003602485700002502521700002402546773009702570856004802667852000902715655001202724IND4469602720221121232911.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446960272DNAL7 a217798612pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2545-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProphiro, Josiane S.10aFirst report on susceptibility of wild Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) using Carapa guianensis (Meliaceae) and Copaifera sp. (Leguminosae)  ap. 699-705.  aOils of Carapa guianensis and Copaifera spp. are well known in the Amazonian region as natural insect repellent, and studies have reported their efficiency as larvicide against some laboratory mosquito species. However, in wild populations of mosquitoes, these oils have not yet been evaluated. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate their efficiency as larvicide in wild populations of Aedes aegypti with a history of exposure to organophosphate. The susceptibility of larvae was determined under three different temperatures, 15°C, 20°C, and 30°C. For each test, 1,000 larvae were used (late third instar and early fourth instar—four replicates of 25 larvae per concentration). Statistical tests were used to identify significant differences. The results demonstrated that as the laboratory A. aegypti, the wild populations of A. aegypti were also susceptible to C. guianensis and Copaifera sp. oils. The lethal concentrations for Copaifera sp. ranged from LC50 47 to LC90 91 (milligrams per liter), and for C. guianensis, they were LC50 136 to LC90 551 (milligrams per liter). In relation to different temperature, the effectiveness of the oils on larvae mortality was directly related to the increase of temperature, and better results were observed for temperature at 25°C. The results presented here indicate the potential larvicidal activity of C. guianensis and species of Copaifera, in populations of A. aegypti from the wild. Therefore, the results presented here are very important since such populations are primarily responsible for transmitting the dengue virus in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aCarapa guianensis 3aCopaifera 3aDengue virus 3ainsect repellents 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3aoils 3atemperature 2aAedesxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aInsecticidesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aMeliaceaexchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTemperature 3aAmazonia1 ada Silva, Mario Antonio Navarro1 aKanis, Luiz A.1 ada Rocha, Louyse Caroline B.

C. J.10aPre-yield tensile set of a semi-crystalline polymer, its blend and composite  ap. 4131-4135.  aTensile set was studied at low strains on polypropylene, aliphatic polyketone, rubber toughened blends and CaCO₃ particle toughened composites. The rubber in the rubber toughened blends had a particle size of 0.7 μm. The CaCO₃ particles had a size of 0.7 μm and had been coated with stearic acid. Step-cyclic loading was applied in 1% strain incrementals at a strain rate of 10⁻² s⁻¹. The maximum strain applied was 20%. The temperature of the test bar was studied with an infra-red camera. Pre-yield deformation is normally assumed to take place in a nonlinear elastic manner. However, for polypropylene and polyketone elastoplastic deformation starts at low strains. For PP the onset of tensile set is at very low strains and increases with strain. The tensile set at the yield point was only 50% and at the drawing strain 100%. Polyketone had a similar tensile set development but shifted to slightly higher strains. Here too the tensile set at the yield point was about 50% and at the drawing strain 100%. The temperature of the non yielded material was found to rise in polyketone a 7 °C.The rubber toughened blends had at low strains a higher tensile set, but after the yield strain the set was similar to the base polymer. At 5% strain the tensile set increased with rubber content. The sub micron CaCO₃ particle toughened composites increased the tensile set too. The tensile set is a simple technique for studying the pre-yield behaviour of multi phase systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3acameras 3adeformation 3aparticle size 3apolypropylenes 3arubber 3astearic acid 3atemperature1 aHuétink, J.1 aGaymans, R.

Although these two concepts are frequently used as synonyms, they are immersed in debates regarding their meaning and their possibilities for application to real systems. This review analyzes the main theoretical definitions of both concepts, together with their potentials and limitations, emphasizing the differences between their meanings. A bibliographic search was carried out in the Web of Science database and other sources from official organizations of international relevance and authors referenced by them. The works providing substantive definitions of sustainability and sustainable development from a complexity theory perspective were selected for discussion throughout the article. The main results showed a strong criticism of the concept of sustainable development due to its imprecise definition, the emergence of the concept of sustainability in the debate of the 1990s and its consolidation in certain fields of knowledge, and the emergence of new alternatives to sustainable development such as degrowth and buen vivir. The results also show the potential of the concept of sustainability as a still-developing framework for scientific research and environmental management.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental management 3asustainable development 0aSustainability 0aSustainable development 0aGreen economy 0aCircular economy 0aDegrowth 0aBuen vivir0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 786 p.147481-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1474813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100004000148245009200188300001200280520149000292592002801782650002301810650002301833650002901856650005201885650001101937650002001948650004301968650001302011700003002024700003802054700004802092700003002140700002602170700003602196700004202232700003502274700003702309700003202346700002902378773011002407856008302517852000902600655001202609IND60779555620221119073133.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077955562DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-022-01828-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarneiro, Vanessa Cristine de Souza10aHerpesvirus and neurological manifestations in patients with severe coronavirus disease  ap. 101.  aBACKGROUND: Certain clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mimic those associated with human herpesvirus (HHV) infection. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of herpesvirus in patients with COVID-19 and determined if coinfection is associated with poorer outcomes and neurological symptoms. METHODS: We analyzed samples of 53 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The samples were evaluated for the presence of alphaherpesviruses, betaherpesviruses, and gammaherpesviruses, and the viral loads were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. RESULTS: Among the patients, in 79.2% had detection at least one type of herpesvirus. HHV-6 (47.2%), cytomegalovirus (43.3%), and HHV-7 (39.6%) showed the highest detection rates. Patients with a high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) load were more likely to show herpes simplex virus 1 detection (p = 0.037). Among patients coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and HHVs, 26.4% showed central nervous system-associated neurological symptoms and herpetic manifestations. A statistically significant association was observed between neurological changes and HHV-6 detection (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed a high prevalence of herpesvirus in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, even though SARS-CoV-2 and HHV coinfection was not associated with poorer outcomes, the findings demonstrated the association between neurological symptoms and HHV-6 detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aGammaherpesvirinae 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3ahumans 3amixed infection 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3avirology1 aAlves-Leon, Soniza Vieira1 aSarmento, Dmitry José de Santana1 aCoelho, Wagner Luis da Costa Nunes Pimentel1 aMoreira, Otacilio da Cruz1 aSalvio, Andreza Lemos1 aRamos, Carlos Henrique Ferreira1 aRamos Filho, Carlos Henrique Ferreira1 aMarques, Carla Augusta Barreto1 ada Costa Gonçalves, João Paulo1 aLeon, Luciane Almeida Amado1 ade Paula, Vanessa Salete0 tVirology journal.g2022 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.101-101dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-022-01828-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245019000190300001400380500001500394520070700409592002801116650001701144650001001161650001101171650002401182650000901206650001401215650001201229650006901241650008601310650003801396650004601434650002101480650001501501650005901516650003501575650004201610650002601652650000901678650005701687650000901744650002201753650002501775650002201800650003701822653001701859653001501876700001701891700002601908700002101934700002201955700002001977773009501997856008402092990002302176852000902199655001202208IND60092080020221120043419.0141103e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009208002DNAL7 a217630692pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Taigen10aLocal convection-enhanced delivery of chemotherapeutic agent transiently opens blood–brain barrier and improves efficacy of systemic chemotherapy in intracranial xenograft tumor model  ap. 77-83.  a2019-12-06  aRecently, local chemotherapy proved its efficacy against malignant gliomas. Under the hypothesis that local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into the brain parenchyma induce opening of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), we evaluated the opening of BBB after convection-enhanced delivery of nimustine hydrochloride into the brain parenchyma. Local convection-enhanced delivery of nimustine hydrochloride transiently opened the BBB from about 7–12days after delivery in normal rodent brain. Systemic chemotherapy during this period of BBB disruption had synergistic effects resulting in prolonged survival of tumor-bearing rats. The present strategy may provide a new approach for glioma chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3abrain 3amodels 3ablood-brain barrier 3arats 3asynergism 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aAntineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocolsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aBlood-Brain Barrierxdrug effects 2aBrain Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aConvection 2aDoxorubicinxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDrug Delivery Systemsxmethods 2aGliosarcomaxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aKaplan-Meier Estimate 2aMale 2aNimustinexadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTreatment Outcome 2aXenograft Model Antitumor Assays 0achemotherapy 0aparenchyma1 aSaito, Ryuta1 aSugiyama, Shin-ichiro1 aSonoda, Yukihiko1 aKumabe, Toshihiro1 aTominaga, Teiji0 tCancer letters.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 310, no. 1 p.77-83dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008700153300001600240500002000256520155000276592002801826596005901854596005401913650001501967650001801982650001702000650002002017650000702037650001402044650001602058650000902074650002002083650002302103650002302126650002102149650001302170650002102183700001702204700001802221700001402239700001402253700001702267700006502284700005602349773013802405856007502543852000902618655001202627IND60777799620221119050433.0220521e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077779962DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.203872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xing10aToxicity of antimony in 18 soils of China evaluated by soil dehydrogenase activity  ap. 703-713.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAntimony (Sb) contamination has attracted global attention due to the elevated Sb entering the environment and threatening human health. Dehydrogenase activity (DHA) has been used as a sensitive bioindicator to assess Sb toxicity. However, only total Sb content and a few types of soils were used so far, which ignored the effect of Sb adsorption characteristics and soil heterogeneity in the Sb toxicity assessment. This study used 18 soil samples varying in their properties to explore the Sb adsorption behavior and the subsequent effects on Sb toxicity using DHA as an indicator. The adsorption isotherm parameters of Sb in 18 soils showed that acidic and neutral soils favored Sb adsorption (nₐ > 2) over alkaline soils (1 < nₐ < 2), and the adsorption process tended to be irreversible (RL close to 0). The solid binding force (kL) of Sb to alkaline soils is less than that of acidic and neutral soils; therefore, alkaline soils pose a higher risk of secondary pollution. Variation partitioning analysis showed that water‐soluble Sb was the predominant factor responsible for the observed decrease in DHA. Ecological doses (ED₁₀) based on water‐soluble Sb fluctuated from 3.4 to 360 mg kg⁻¹ in soils. Soil properties, such as pH, total phosphorus, amorphous Fe, and clay content, played a crucial role in Sb toxicity to DHA. This study highlighted the importance of water‐soluble Sb while evaluating the Sb toxicity in soils. Thus, the study is useful in risk assessment and remediation of Sb‐contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data  a41571245cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019YFC1804101cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aadsorption 3aclay fraction 3ahuman health 3aoxidoreductases 3apH 3apollution 3aremediation 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil heterogeneity 3asorption isotherms 3atotal phosphorus 3atoxicity 3awater solubility1 aTian, Haixia1 aLiao, Maoyuan1 aHuang, Yi1 aYang, Rui1 aGuo, Zhaohui1 aMegharaj, Mallavarapu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6230-518X1 aHe, Wenxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0242-57340 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2022 May, v. 86, no. 3 p.703-713dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.203873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006000174300001300234520153400247592002801781650001101809650002301820650002201843650001101865650001801876650001301894650001301907650001301920650001101933700001901944700002701963773008301990856008402073852000902157655001202166IND60598972320221120112821.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059897232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiciński, Wojciech10aSulfur-doped porous carbons: Synthesis and applications  ap. 1-32.  aHeteroatom doping of carbon materials may become the “Next Big Thing” in materials science further enhancing research concerning carbon nanostructures. In particular, the S-doped porous carbons have gained a great deal of attention in the last few years. They are already proven to be versatile functional materials with a wide range of potential applications, including heterogeneous catalysis, sorption, as well as in the areas of energy conversion and storage. To date, a few approaches have been developed to intrinsically blend sulfur into the carbon matrix. Yet there is still a need to design new porous structures with controllable porosity and well defined chemical status of sulfur doped into the carbon matrix. In this review, we summarize recent reports on the preparation of S-doped carbons, with special emphasis on porous carbons with intrinsically doped sulfur. The effect of S-doping on the properties determining applications is delineated. Special attention is paid to differentiate between elemental sulfur impregnation, intercalation, surface functionalization and S bulk doping of porous carbons. To this end, synthesis and applications of S-impregnated, S-functionalized and S-intercalated carbons are shortly discussed before the intrinsically S-doped carbons are presented in detail. The importance of the sulfide –C–S–C– system for the properties of S-doped carbon is stressed. At the very end, Se-doped carbons are shortly presented as a promising next generation of chalcogen-doped carbon.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy conversion 3amixing 3ananomaterials 3aporosity 3asorption 3asulfides 3asulfur1 aSzala, Mateusz1 aBystrzejewski, Michał0 tCarbon.g2014 Mar., v. 68 p.1-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011000173300001600283520186700299592002802166650001502194650001602209650001502225650001102240650001402251650001502265651001602280653001802296653003102314653001702345653001202362653003602374653001602410700005802426700002002484700006202504700002402566700002102590700002202611700006102633700005802694700006002752700001802812700001802830700006502848700002402913700002902937773011802966856008803084852000903172655001203181IND60628108520221118054037.0190326e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062810852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSternai, Pietro10aPresent-day uplift of the European Alps: Evaluating mechanisms and models of their relative contributions  ap. 589-604.  aRecent measurements of surface vertical displacements of the European Alps show a correlation between vertical velocities and topographic features, with widespread uplift at rates of up to ~2–2.5 mm/a in the North-Western and Central Alps, and ~1 mm/a across a continuous region from the Eastern to the South-Western Alps. Such a rock uplift rate pattern is at odds with the horizontal velocity field, characterized by shortening and crustal thickening in the Eastern Alps and very limited deformation in the Central and Western Alps. Proposed mechanisms of rock uplift rate include isostatic response to the last deglaciation, long-term erosion, detachment of the Western Alpine slab, as well as lithospheric and surface deflection due to mantle convection. Here, we assess previous work and present new estimates of the contributions from these mechanisms. Given the large range of model estimates, the isostatic adjustment to deglaciation and erosion are sufficient to explain the full observed rate of uplift in the Eastern Alps, which, if correct, would preclude a contribution from horizontal shortening and crustal thickening. Alternatively, uplift is a partitioned response to a range of mechanisms. In the Central and Western Alps, the lithospheric adjustment to deglaciation and erosion likely accounts for roughly half of the rock uplift rate, which points to a noticeable contribution by mantle-related processes such as detachment of the European slab and/or asthenospheric upwelling. While it is difficult to independently constrain the patterns and magnitude of mantle contributions to ongoing Alpine vertical displacements at present, future data should provide additional insights. Regardless, interacting tectonic and surface mass redistribution processes, rather than an individual forcing, best explain ongoing Alpine elevation changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3adeformation 3aglaciation 3amodels 3atectonics 3atopography 3aAlps region 0aEuropean Alps 0aVertical displacement rate 0aDeglaciation 0aErosion 0aLithospheric structural changes 0aMantle flow1 aSue, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2472-50011 aHusson, Laurent1 aSerpelloni, Enrico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1822-403X1 aBecker, Thorsten W.1 aWillett, Sean D.1 aFaccenna, Claudio1 aDi Giulio, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0893-759X1 aSpada, Giorgio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7615-47091 aJolivet, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2596-20171 aValla, Pierre1 aPetit, Carole1 aNocquet, Jean-Mathieu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3436-93541 aWalpersdorf, Andrea1 aCastelltort, Sébastien,0 tEarth-science reviews.g2019 Mar., v. 190 p.589-604dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011500162300001800277500002000295500001500315520150700330592002801837650001301865650001401878650001201892650001301904650002801917650001201945653002401957700002301981700002202004700002402026700001802050700002202068700002702090700003102117700002402148700002302172773010102195856007302296852000902369655001202378IND60572235220221119105205.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057223522DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.139532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPokalyuk, Cornelia10aCharacterizing human cytomegalovirus reinfection in congenitally infected infants: an evolutionary perspective  ap. 1980-1990.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aGiven the strong selective pressures often faced by populations when colonizing a novel habitat, the level of variation present on which selection may act is an important indicator of adaptive potential. While often discussed in an ecological context, this notion is also highly relevant in our clinical understanding of viral infection, in which the novel habitat is a new host. Thus, quantifying the factors determining levels of variation is of considerable importance for the design of improved treatment strategies. Here, we focus on such a quantification of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) – a virus which can be transmitted across the placenta, resulting in foetal infection that can potentially cause severe disease in multiple organs. Recent studies using genomewide sequencing data have demonstrated that viral populations in some congenitally infected infants diverge rapidly over time and between tissue compartments within individuals, while in other infants, the populations remain highly stable. Here, we investigate the underlying causes of these extreme differences in observed intrahost levels of variation by estimating the underlying demographic histories of infection. Importantly, reinfection (i.e. population admixture) appears to be an important, and previously unappreciated, player. We highlight illustrative examples likely to represent a single‐population transmission from a mother during pregnancy and multiple‐population transmissions during pregnancy and after birth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aviruses 3ahabitats 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3ainfants 0aHuman herpesvirus 51 aRenzette, Nicholas1 aIrwin, Kristen K.1 aPfeifer, Susanne P.1 aGibson, Laura1 aBritt, William J.1 aYamamoto, Aparecida Y.1 aMussi‐Pinhata, Marisa M.1 aKowalik, Timothy F.1 aJensen, Jeffrey D.0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 7 p.1980-1990dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.139533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100003200169245008000201300001600281520218600297592002802483653001202511653001002523653002202533653001802555653002102573700002002594700002002614700002402634700001902658700002402677700002102701773010202722856011702824852000902941655001202950IND60125345120221120171319.0151103e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012534512DNAL7 a10.1646/0006-3606(2001)033[0324:CAEOCL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPéérez-Salicrup, Diego R.10aCost and Efficiency of Cutting Lianas in a Lowland Liana Forest of Bolivia1  ap. 324-329.  aLiana cutting is a commonly suggested silvicultural practice aimed at reducing the negative impacts of lianas on timber production, but few experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the cost and efficiency of this practice. In this study, we estimated the cost of cutting lianas in 12 plots of 0.25 ha each in a densely liana-infested forest of lowland Bolivia, and evaluated the efficiency of this silvicultural treatment in terms of the proportion of lianas missed, the density of resprouting liana stumps, and the number of liana-infested trees after two years of an experimental liana treatment.The cost of cutting lianas in this forest by locally hired laborers was 23.6 (SE == 2.48) person-hours//ha. Considering local cost of labor and the U.S.––Bolivian currency exchange rate at the time of the study, this figure translates to ca $$15//ha. Liana density decreased from 2471 (SE == 104.3) to 130 (SE == 24.2) liana stems ≥≥2 cm//ha immediately after cutting, because 5.5 percent of lianas were left uncut (missed). Slender lianas were missed more often than lianas with large-diameter stems. Liana species that grow 2––3 m before they start to twine were also frequently missed. Twenty-two percent of liana stumps ≥≥2 cm sprouted after cutting. Liana stumps with larger diameters sprouted more than stumps with smaller diameters. Most liana stumps produced only two sprouts. Two years after cutting, 78 percent of trees had no living lianas in their crowns, in contrast to only 13 percent liana-free trees in the control plots. Sixty-four percent of trees still had hanging dead lianas two years after cutting, but only 23 percent of trees were reinvaded by lianas using dead liana stems as trellises.Liana cutting can efficiently reduce the number of lianas in liana-infested forests, and the effects of cutting lianas last for at least two years; however, the treatment is expensive. Thus, we recommend that it is better to view liana cutting as a preventive activity to avoid liana infestation, rather than as a corrective measure after poor management. Liana cutting can be easily conducted along with other reduced-impact logging practices.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBolivia 0acosts 0aforest management 0aliana cutting 0atropical forests1 aClaros, Alberto1 aGuzmáán, Rudy1 aCarlos Licona, Juan1 aLedezma, Fredy1 aPinard, Michelle A.1 aPutz, Francis E.0 tBiotropica.g2001 June, v. 33, no. 2 p.324-329dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F0006-3606%282001%29033%5B0324%3ACAEOCL%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008900171300001300260520135200273592002801625650001301653650003101666650001101697650002001708651002201728653002801750653002701778653002401805653001901829700001501848700001601863773010501879856008701984852000902071655001202080IND60581142120221121194015.0190402e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058114212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Forgia, G.10aLaboratory investigation on internal solitary waves interacting with a uniform slope  ap. 4-18.  aInternal solitary waves (ISWs) propagating in a two layer stratified fluid system are studied by laboratory experiments through the standard lock-release method. We investigated the generation, propagation, and breaking phases of large amplitude internal solitary waves of depression, propagating horizontally in a wave tank. ISWs main features depend on the geometrical parameters that define the initial experimental setting. Relations between ISWs geometric and kinematic features and the initial setting parameters are analyzed and empirical relations are developed. The approach of the ISWs towards a uniform slope is investigated. Depending on both wave properties and slopes values, different physical processes characterize the shoaling phase, causing different breaker type. Following a qualitatively analysis of the different breaking mechanisms, collapsing-plunging breakers show the larger contribution in terms of mixing. The characteristics of the breaking events affecting internal wave packets propagating towards the North of the Messina Strait (Mediterranean Sea) are discussed. Additional laboratory experiments are performed to investigate how the pycnocline thickness is affected by the breaking of plunging ISWs. The consequent increase of the pycnocline thickness results to be nonlinearly related with the Iribarren number.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3alaboratory experimentation 3amixing 3awater resources 3aMediterranean Sea 0aInternal solitary waves 0aLaboratory experiments 0aBreaking mechanisms 0aMixing process1 aAdduce, C.1 aFalcini, F.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2018 Oct., v. 120 p.4-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009000157300001800247500002000265520189500285592002802180650003102208650001902239650001202258650002202270650002602292650001402318650001502332650001302347650003202360650000902392650001702401650001102418650001402429650002702443650001502470650002802485650002402513650001402537650001002551650001602561700002302577773010102600856007302701852000902774655001202783IND60572235320221119105112.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057223532DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.138702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCroll, Daniel14aThe genetic basis of local adaptation for pathogenic fungi in agricultural ecosystems  ap. 2027-2040.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLocal adaptation plays a key role in the evolutionary trajectory of host–pathogen interactions. However, the genetic architecture of local adaptation in host–pathogen systems is poorly understood. Fungal plant pathogens in agricultural ecosystems provide highly tractable models to quantify phenotypes and map traits to corresponding genomic loci. The outcome of crop–pathogen interactions is thought to be governed largely by gene‐for‐gene interactions. However, recent studies showed that virulence can be governed by quantitative trait loci and that many abiotic factors contribute to the outcome of the interaction. After introducing concepts of local adaptation and presenting examples from wild plant pathosystems, we focus this review on a major pathogen of wheat, Zymoseptoria tritici, to show how a multitude of traits can affect local adaptation. Zymoseptoria tritici adapted to different thermal environments across its distribution range, indicating that thermal adaptation may limit effective dispersal to different climates. The application of fungicides led to the rapid evolution of multiple, independent resistant populations. The degree of colony melanization showed strong pleiotropic effects with other traits, including trade‐offs with colony growth rates and fungicide sensitivity. The success of the pathogen on its host can be assessed quantitatively by counting pathogen reproductive structures and measuring host damage based on necrotic lesions. Interestingly, these two traits can be weakly correlated and depend both on host and pathogen genotypes. Quantitative trait mapping studies showed that the genetic architecture of locally adapted traits varies from single loci with large effects to many loci with small individual effects. We discuss how local adaptation could hinder or accelerate the development of epidemics in agricultural ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aagroecosystems 3aclimate 3adisease outbreaks 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3afungicides 3agenotype 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aloci 3amelanization 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apleiotropy 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3avirulence 3awheat 3awild plants1 aMcDonald, Bruce A.0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 7 p.2027-2040dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.138703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245014500193300001600338520198600354592002802340653001202368653001402380653002102394653002002415653001402435653002202449653002302471653003502494653002702529653001502556773010202571856011702673852000902790655001202799IND60125345220221120181901.0151103e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012534522DNAL7 a10.1646/0006-3606(2001)033[0330:PAPLFS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathcke, Beverly J.10aPollination and Predation Limit Fruit Set in a Shrub, Bourreria succulenta (Boraginaceae), after Hurricanes on San Salvador Island, Bahamas1  ap. 330-338.  aHurricanes have been assumed to reduce the reproduction of plants, either directly by leaf stripping and stress or indirectly by reducing pollinators. I examined the pollination and fruit set of a common shrub, Bourreria succulenta, after hurricanes on San Salvador island, Bahamas. Contrary to the assumption of resource limitation, B. succulenta showed unusually prolific flowering after Hurricane Lili stripped leaves from most of the plants in October 1996. I predicted that the abundant flowering would saturate pollinators and that fruit set would be pollination-limited. Fruit set was strongly pollination-limited by 71 percent. Butterflies are probably the major pollinators and were present at the site, but they rarely visited B. succulenta flowers even though flowers were brimming with nectar. Nectarivorous birds (Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars) visit B. succulenta flowers, but their populations were decimated by Hurricane Lili and they rarely visited flowers during this time. Fruit set was also severely predation-limited; a moth caterpillar (Gelechiidae) was extremely abundant and ate buds, flowers, and fruits, causing a further 68 percent reduction in fruit set. Together, pollination limitation and predation limitation reduced fruit set to only 7 percent or less. Predation was also intense in 1999 after Hurricane Floyd and resulted in 11 percent fruit set or less. Whether or not hurricanes were the cause of limited pollinators or abundant predators, the resulting low fruit set could have population effects because hurricanes can provide opportunities for the recruitment of new plants. These results emphasize that understanding plant––animal interactions may be necessary for predicting the effects of hurricanes on plant reproductive success, which may affect subsequent recruitment. Species on small islands like San Salvador (150 km²) with relatively few species may be especially vulnerable to environmental disturbances such as hurricanes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBahamas 0aBourreria 0aflower predation 0afruit predation 0afruit set 0ahurricane effects 0aisland pollination 0aplant––animal interactions 0apollination limitation 0ascrublands0 tBiotropica.g2001 June, v. 33, no. 2 p.330-338dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F0006-3606%282001%29033%5B0330%3APAPLFS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012700154300001800281520075800299592002801057650001701085650000901102650001701111650001901128650001801147650001901165650002201184700001701206700001601223700001601239700001801255700001301273700001801286700001801304773014101322856007401463852000901537655001201546IND60670713320221121044337.0191002e20140409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067071332DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb21844a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Si12aA bright red fluorescent cyanine dye for live-cell nucleic acid imaging, with high photostability and a large Stokes shift  ap. 2688-2693.  aMany probes for nucleic acids are available, but few of them satisfy multiple criteria, particularly high photostability to endure laser scanning. We report a cyanine dye TO3-CN for the first time, synthesised by introducing a CN group to the trimethine chain of the classical red emitting TO-3 dye to improve its photostability, as well as their spectral properties and interaction with nucleic acids. TO3-CN shows excellent light fastness and a large fluorescence Stokes shift (more than 40 nm). Because of its sensitive fluorescence response to nucleic acids with a large fluorescence quantum yield (more than 0.7) and low cytotoxicity, this dye may be a potential candidate for nucleic acid detection in vitro and intracellular fluorescence imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3adyes 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3anucleic acids 3aphotostability 3aspectral analysis1 aFan, Jiangli1 aLi, Zhiyong1 aHao, Naijia1 aCao, Jianfang1 aWu, Tong1 aWang, Jingyun1 aPeng, Xiaojun0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Apr. 9, v. 2, no. 18 p.2688-2693dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21844a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245008500199300001600284500002000300520159000320592002801910650002301938650001301961650002201974650001301996650001902009650001402028650001702042650001102059650001602070650001202086650002402098650001102122650002202133650002502155650001902180650003002199650002002229650001702249651001602266700006002282700005402342700005702396700002302453773013802476856007502614961001302689852000902702655001202711IND60777799920221119050134.0220521e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077779992DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.203412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeli, Ardeshir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3512-861610aIntegration of pelleted biosolids with cover crops for improving soil properties  ap. 728-741.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMeasuring and assessing soil properties is critical for understanding how changes in agronomic practices affect the capability of soil to support cropping systems. A field study was conducted on a Marietta silt loam soil at the Plant Science Center at Mississippi State University to determine the effects of pelleted biosolids (PBS) relative to poultry litter (PL) and inorganic N fertilizer applied to corn (Zea mays L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in the presence of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover crop (WCC) and winter fallow (WF) on soil properties. Experimental design was a split‐plot randomized complete block with three replications. The whole plots were WCC and WF and the subplots were fertilization. Fertilization treatments included PBS and PL at 11.2 Mg ha–¹ and 6.7 Mg ha–¹ applied to corn and cotton, a one‐time single application at 37 Mg PBS ha–¹ to corn in 2016, inorganic N fertilizer at the recommended rate, and an unfertilized control. Soil cores were collected after harvest and analyzed for nutrient concentrations, water stable aggregate (WSA), and enzyme activities. The WCC reduced bulk density (ρb) and penetration resistance (PR) and increased soil total C (TC), WSA, and infiltration rate, as compared with winter fallow (WF). Relative to inorganic N fertilizer, application of PBS decreased soil ρb and PR by 3 and 20%, respectively, and increased soil TC, WSA, and infiltration by 19, 23, and 45%, respectively. A combination of PBS and WCC improved soil physical and chemical properties under southeast agroecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aMarietta 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aagroecosystems 3abiosolids 3abulk density 3acotton 3acover crops 3aenzymes 3aexperimental design 3afallow 3ainfiltration rate 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apoultry manure 3aresistance to penetration 3asilt loam soils 3awinter wheat 3aMississippi1 aBrooks, John P.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6142-64301 aFeng, Gary1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7783-16441 aMozaffari, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9584-43421 aJenkins, Johnie N.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2022 May, v. 86, no. 3 p.728-741dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.203413Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001300169245010000182300001500282520089600297592002801193650001601221650003101237650002401268650001001292650002301302650001101325650002101336650001501357650000901372650002401381650001201405650002201417650005301439650002101492650001801513650002301531650004301554650001101597650003001608650000901638650004301647650004301690650000901733650002401742650001501766650002901781650002601810650002901836650005801865650001701923650003401940650002701974650005302001700001602054700001602070700001502086700001202101700001602113700001302129700001802142700001902160700001302179700001502192773009602207856008402303990002302387852000902410655001202419IND60092080320221123031445.0141103e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009208032DNAL7 a217411662pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Lei10aSuppression of invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells by overexpression of NDRG2 gene  ap. 94-100.  aN-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is involved in invasion and metastasis of cancer, furthermore it is frequently down-regulated in prostate cancer. Herein we evaluated the effect of NDRG2 overexpression on invasiveness and bone destruction in prostate cancer. The human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and DU145 were infected with Ad-NDRG2 or Ad-LacZ. Overexpression of NDRG2 not only inhibited the growth of the cells, but also suppressed invasiveness of the cells in an in vitro assay. PC-3 cells infected with Ad-NDRG2 or Ad-LacZ were injected into the tibias of nude mice. Four weeks later, we found the mice injected with PC-3 cells overexpressing NDRG2 had smaller tumors and less bone destruction.

However, relatively few references have been focused on this process in long‐term cultivation of black paddy soil. In this study, we investigated the effect of microbial community and phoD gene on changes in soil P fractions in a black paddy soil. The results showed that, compared with 1‐yr soil, long‐term cultivation (35‐yr rice growth) significantly increased the concentration of soil P pool (P < .05). In detail, the soil available‐P increased from 15.4 to 34.8 mg kg⁻¹, and primary‐P, secondary‐P, occluded‐P and organic‐P increased from 41.4 to 73.6 mg kg⁻¹, 7.60 to 18.9 mg kg⁻¹, 57.6 to 106.1 mg kg⁻¹, and 13.7 to 29.1 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. Notably, the microbial biomass C/P ratio decreased from 190.8 (1‐yr) to 56.2 (35‐yr), indicating that the mineralization of organic P (Po) by microorganisms played a dominant role in long‐term cultivation. The results were further verified by significantly increased soil microorganism concentration, copy number of phoD gene, and strong interaction in phoD‐harboring bacteria. The change of soil P pool was significantly affected by soil properties and phoD gene community through variance partitioning analysis, and Streptomyces and Cupriavidus were the main biomarkers affecting Po mineralization through linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis. The results will be helpful to understand the microbial process of P transformation (especially for Po) and to guide the management of P fertilizer in black soil area.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA28090300cThe Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41601314cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXLYC1802044cScience and Technology Innovation Talents Training Project of Liaoning Province 3aCupriavidus 3aOryza sativa 3aStreptomyces 3abiomarkers 3adiscriminant analysis 3agenes 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3apaddy soils 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arice 3asoil microorganisms 3avariance1 aTong, Deli1 aWang, ShenQiang1 aWang, Dengjun1 aXu, Lu1 aLi, Bo1 aSun, Wentao1 aWang, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1329-82080 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2022 May, v. 86, no. 3 p.540-551dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.203843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245008800165500001400253520161400267592002801881650001501909650003001924650001301954650002201967650001301989650000902002650001102011650001602022650001202038650002402050650001102074650001002085653003202095653002102127653001302148653001502161700001402176700001402190700001402204700001502218773011602233856008702349852000902436655001202445IND60724189020221122145816.0210212e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072418902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1138212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Z.Y.10aEnergy grade splitting of hot water via a double effect absorption heat transformer  aNAL-light  aEnergy level mismatch between waste heat and energy users poses huge barrier for local waste heat recovery. To tackle this challenge, an energy grade splitting strategy of hot water via absorption heat transformer is proposed. In this strategy, the hot water is separated into two branches. An absorption heat transformer extracts waste heat from the colder branch, and delivers heat output to increase the temperature of hotter branch. This process could deliver high temperature output and decrease the temperature of waste heat simultaneously, which meets the local waste heat recovery demand. Both experimental and modeling researches are carried out to investigate this strategy. Firstly, double effect LiBr-water absorption heat transformer is adopted for performance enhancement, and experimental investigation was carried out. Testing results showed that 391.4 kW heat output and COP of 0.618 were achieved, under colder branch temperature of 149.7 → 128.1 °C and hotter branch temperature of 151.0 → 128.1 °C. Secondly, modeling framework was built and used to evaluate the energy grade splitting performance under different conditions. Results showed that the proposed energy grade splitting strategy is effective under waste heat source temperatures of 130.0–160.0 °C, temperature lift of 5.0–20.0 °C, mass split ratio of 0.10–1.60 and temperature split ratio of 2.00–20.00. Such an effective and flexible strategy could further be promoted to other scenarios with different heat conversion technologies, and contribute to the wide application of local waste heat recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadministrative management 3abranches 3aenergy conversion 3aextracts 3amass 3amodels 3atemperature 3atesting 3awaste heat recovery 3awastes 3awater 0aAbsorption heat transformer 0aHigh temperature 0aModeling 0aExperiment1 aGao, J.T.1 aMao, H.C.1 aLiu, D.S.1 aWang, R.Z.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 230 p.113821-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1138213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013300172300001800305520217000323592002802493650002002521650002402541650002902565650001402594650002502608650002202633650001002655650001302665650001102678650003502689650001502724650001802739650001802757650001202775650001002787651002102797700002202818700001902840700002002859700001902879700001902898773012602917856008503043852000903128655001203137IND60560047720221120154321.0161218e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056004772DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2016.12153572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarkey, Divya A.10aMulti-Criteria Decision Analysis for Recreational Trout Fisheries in British Columbia, Canada: A Bayesian Network Implementation  ap. 1457-1472.  aOne of the key challenges in recreational fisheries management is to provide a rational basis for decisions in the face of conflicting objectives, such as improving angling opportunities, maintaining satisfaction across a diverse fishing client base, controlling costs, and conserving wild populations. We developed a multi-criteria decision analysis approach for managing recreational trout fisheries (e.g., Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss). The approach was implemented in a Bayesian decision network. The decision support tool, called “Stock-Optim,” provides a user-friendly interface for predicting fishery performance from alternate stocking prescriptions. The tool integrates survey information on angler typology and satisfaction with previously developed models for fish biology and fishery dynamics to more fully consider the biological and social outcomes of management decisions. Specifically, the tool evaluated alternative stocking options given three performance criteria: angler effort, angler satisfaction, and the cost of the stocking program. Predicted effort was highest for fish that were released in the size range of 8–20 g and at stocking densities of 200–500 fish/ha. Effort maximization at these rates and sizes is a result of compromise between the conflicting preferences of Rainbow Trout enthusiasts and occasional anglers toward fish size and harvest. Furthermore, lowering the stocking program’s costs will lead to lower stocking rates and thereby favor the enthusiasts. Currently, stocking levels in British Columbia are lower than levels that would maximize effort and are most consistent with a policy of maximizing satisfaction for Rainbow Trout enthusiasts and minimizing costs. Stock-Optim will allow managers to compare predicted outcomes from the current and alternative regimes with stated lake-specific or region-specific management objectives and regional averages and thereby more closely meet these objectives in the future. Lastly, the model was validated by comparing predicted effort with observed effort in stocked lakes.

Di-peptide Phe–Phe was shown previously to self-assemble into nanotube like structures. In this work, we studied the affect of peptide backbone length and conformational flexibility on the self assembly process by using two dipeptides based on the Phe–Phe backbone (βPhe–Phe and βPhe–ΔPhe): one containing a flexible βPhe amino acid, and the other containing both a flexible βPhe as well as a backbone constraining ΔPhe (α,β-dehydrophenylalanine) amino acid. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that these new di-peptides can self-assemble into nanotubes having different properties than the native Phe–Phe nanotubes. These nanotubes were stable over a broad range of temperatures and the introduction of non-natural amino acids provided them with stability against the action of nonspecific proteases. Moreover, these dipeptides showed no cytotoxicity towards HeLa and L929 cells, and were able to encapsulate small drug molecules. We further showed that anticancerous drug mitoxantrone was more efficient in killing HeLa and B6F10 cells when entrapped in nanotubes as compared to free mitoxantrone. Therefore, these β-phenylalanine and α,β-dehydrophenylalanine containing dipeptide nanotubes may be useful in the development of biocompatible and proteolytically stable drug delivery vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiomedical research 3achemistry 3acytotoxicity 3adipeptides 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3aelectron microscopy 3ananotubes 3aphenylalanine 3aproteinases 3atemperature1 aMisra, Anurag1 aRamakumar, Suryanarayanarao1 aChauhan, Virander Singh0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Apr. 23, v. 2, no. 20 p.3096-3106dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21856b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245014000169300001800309520218100327592002802508596008802536650001602624650001702640650002302657650001302680650001102693650001302704650001402717650001202731650001102743650001502754650002202769650001102791700005902802700006402861773013502925856008103060852000903141655001203150IND60779556420220610000000.0220610e20220524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077955642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c014842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGisdon, Florian J.10aSerine and Cysteine Peptidases: So Similar, Yet Different. How the Active-Site Electrostatics Facilitates Different Reaction Mechanisms  ap. 4035-4048.  aThe catalytic mechanisms of serine and cysteine peptidases are similar: the proton of the nucleophile (serine or cysteine) is transferred to the catalytic histidine, and the nucleophile attacks the substrate for cleavage. However, they differ in an important aspect: cysteine peptidases form a stable ion-pair intermediate in a stepwise mechanism, while serine peptidases follow a concerted mechanism. While it is known that a positive electrostatic potential at the active site of cysteine peptidases stabilizes the cysteine anion in the ion-pair state, the physical basis of the concerted mechanism of serine peptidases is poorly understood. In this work, we use continuum electrostatic analysis and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations to demonstrate that a destabilization of an anionic serine by a negative electrostatic potential in combination with a compact active site geometry facilitates a concerted mechanism in serine peptidases. Moreover, we show that an anionic serine would destabilize the protein significantly compared to an anionic cysteine in cysteine peptidases, which underlines the necessity of a concerted mechanism for serine peptidases. On the basis of our calculations on an inactive serine mutant of a natural cysteine peptidase, we show that the energy barrier for the catalytic mechanism can be substantially decreased by introducing a negative electrostatic potential and by reducing the relevant distances indicating that these parameters are essential for the activity of serine peptidases. Our work demonstrates that the concerted mechanism of serine peptidases represents an evolutionary innovative way to perform catalysis without the energetically expensive need to stabilize the anionic serine. In contrast in cysteine peptidases, the anionic cysteine is energetically easily accessible and it is a very efficient nucleophile, making these peptidases mechanistically simple. However, a cysteine is highly oxygen sensitive, which is problematic in an aerobic environment. On the basis of the analysis in this work, we suggest that serine peptidases represent an oxygen-insensitive alternative to cysteine peptidases.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFBc/ C03 , Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaftdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001659 3aLewis bases 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3acysteine 3aenergy 3ageometry 3ahistidine 3amutants 3aoxygen 3apeptidases 3aquantum mechanics 3aserine1 aBombarda, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1385-37101 aUllmann, G.

We collected charcoal from the A2 soil horizon of each plot for radiocarbon dating. Although fires have been very rare in this forest during historic times, the presence of charcoal in these soils indicates fire at some earlier period. The ages (conventional radiocarbon age adjusted to 1997) of the charcoal ranged from 177 to 1547 years. These ages, however, did not correlate significantly with any of several measures of biodiversity or stand characteristics. The relative uniformity of the current old-growth forest indicates that either the prehistoric fires were of such low intensity that they had little long-term effect on the vegetation or that the present stands have progressed to near steady state.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAmazon 0afire 0aold-growth forest 0aradiocarbon 0aslash-and-burn agriculture 0asuccession1 aKnowles, Oliver Henry0 tBiotropica.g2001 July, v. 33, no. 3 p.385-392dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F0006-3606%282001%29033%5B0385%3AAOAHCA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245010300213300001400316520149400330592002801824650002901852650001701881650002901898650001901927650001801946650002301964650001101987650001401998650003102012650000902043650001502052650001702067653002402084653002102108653002702129653001902156653002602175700002902201700002202230700002002252700002502272700002602297700006302323700002402386700006002410700005702470700003502527773010902562856008602671852000902757655001202766IND60612116520221122004434.0190705e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061211652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenzo, José M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7725-929410aInfluence of pitanga leaf extracts on lipid and protein oxidation of pork burger during shelf-life  ap. 47-54.  aThe effect of pitanga leaf extracts, as source of natural antioxidants, on physicochemical properties as well as lipid and protein oxidation of pork burgers during storage at 2 ± 1 °C, packed under modified atmosphere, was assessed. Formerly, the in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities as well as the phenolic profile of pitanga leaf extracts were also studied. Thereafter, five samples were prepared, including control (without antioxidants), commercial synthetic antioxidant (BHT at 200 mg/kg) and three concentrations of pitanga leaf extracts: PLL (at 250 mg/kg), PLM (at 500 mg/kg) and PLH (at 1000 mg/kg). The predominant phenolic compounds identified in pitanga leaf extracts were hydroxycinnamic acids, followed by tyrosol and other phenolics (alkylmethoxyphenols, hydroxycoumarins and hydroxyphenylpropenes). Pitanga leaf extracts showed a high antioxidant and antimicrobial in vitro activity. The addition of pitanga leaf extracts improved the redness of pork burgers during the whole display. On the other hand, the addition of natural antioxidants decreased the lipid oxidation from day 7 till the end of storage period. Burgers with antioxidant showed a similar protein oxidation level, observing an inhibition between 36% and 49% compared to control treatment. From the results, it can be concluded that pitanga leaf extract is a good alternative to commercial synthetic antioxidants to improve the quality and extend the shelf-life of pork burgers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acoumaric acids 3aleaf extracts 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3aoxidation 3aphysicochemical properties 3apork 3ashelf life 3astorage time 0aEugenia uniflora L. 0aPhenolic profile 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aUHPLC-ESI/QTOF 0aHydroxycinnamic acids1 aVargas, Flávia Carolina1 aStrozzi, Isabella1 aPateiro, Mirian1 aFurtado, Marianna M.1 aSant'Ana, Anderson S.1 aRocchetti, Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3488-45131 aBarba, Francisco J.1 aDominguez, Ruben1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2764-504X1 aLucini, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5133-94641 aSobral, Paulo José do Amaral,0 tFood research international.g2018 Dec., v. 114 p.47-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.07.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011500170300001600285520139400301592002801695650002301723650003701746650001101783650002101794650001301815650001601828650002201844700002001866700002101886700002901907773008601936856008402022852000902106655001202115IND60598973220221122170222.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059897322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChizari, Kambiz14aThe effect of temperature on the morphology and chemical surface properties of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes  ap. 369-379.  aOne of the most effective ways to tune the physical and chemical properties of CNTs is to dope them with a foreign element, such as nitrogen. Nitrogen atoms that are incorporated into the CNT structure can drastically change the properties of CNTs. The properties of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) originate from their structure; thus, it is practical to create a desired structure during synthesis. We have investigated the effects of synthesis parameters, mainly temperature, on various characterizations of N-CNTs, such as their morphologies, dimensions (diameter and length), defects, nitrogen inclusions and thermal stability. The results revealed strong correlations between the synthesis parameters and the properties of the synthesized N-CNTs. XPS characterization indicated that the percentage of nitrogen inclusion decreased with increasing synthesis temperature up to 850°C and then increased at 950°C. Raman spectroscopy showed a decrease in the number of defects in the N-CNT structure with increasing synthesis temperature. Finally TGA demonstrated a trend of increasing thermal stability of N-CNTs with increasing synthesis temperature, up to 850°C then a reduced thermal stability at 950°C. Based on these results, one can control the properties of N-CNTs and obtain materials with the desired characteristics by choosing the appropriate synthesis conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3anitrogen 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aVena, Alexander1 aLaurentius, Lars1 aSundararaj, Uttandaraman0 tCarbon.g2014 Mar., v. 68 p.369-379dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012600167500001400293520150000307592002801807650003001835650000801865650002401873650001101897650001201908650001201920650001201932650001901944650001601963650001101979650001301990650002002003650001102023650001302034650001202047650002402059650001202083650001002095650001102105650001102116650001002127653002402137653002002161653002002181653004802201700001802249700001902267700001302286700001602299700001602315773011602331856008702447852000902534655001202543IND60724189220221122145827.0210212e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072418922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1138242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yang10aEnergy and exergy performance comparison of conventional, dew point and new external-cooling indirect evaporative coolers  aNAL-light  aExternal-cooling indirect evaporative cooling is an effective energy saving technology, where air–water finned coils are linked with packed cooling tower by water pipes. However, external-cooling indirect evaporative coolers with different configurations and working air sources are incomprehensively analyzed and compared. This study presented an energy and exergy analysis of five external-cooling indirect evaporative coolers, including conventional configuration, dew point configuration, newly patented dew point configuration, and energy recovery forms of the first two. In order to analyze the evaporative cooler and its hybrid system combined with mechanical vapor compression system, the numerical model and experimental correlation are used. The effect of four selected parameters (ambient temperature, ambient humidity ratio, total number of transfer units and fresh air flowrate), and the summer energy saving potential in three different cities are studied. The analysis results show that the new dew point configuration has the best performance under the conditions of high temperature, high humidity, and high fresh air flowrate. This new dew point cooler’s hybrid system achieves the best energy saving rate in humid and arid climates, between 19.1% and 48.5% compared with the pure mechanical vapor compression system. In this study, the advantages and disadvantages of presented designs are established and their application potential under different climates is estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acities 3aclimate 3acoolers 3acooling 3acooling towers 3acorrelation 3adesign 3adewpoint 3aenergy recovery 3aexergy 3ahumidity 3ahybrids 3amathematical models 3apatents 3apipes 3asummer 3avapors 3awater 0aEvaporative cooling 0aEnergy analysis 0aExergy analysis 0aSeasonal energy saving potential evaluation1 aRen, Chengqin1 aYang, Congcong1 aDu, Min,1 aLuo, Baojun1 aFu, Jianqin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 230 p.113824-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1138243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009000160300001800250500002000268520185200288592002802140650002802168650002602196650001302222650001902235650001102254650001402265650002002279650001302299650001402312650002202326650001702348700001802365700002202383700002002405700001602425773010102441856007302542852000902615655001202624IND60572235820221119110059.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057223582DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.139502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCairns, Johannes10aGenomic evolution of bacterial populations under coselection by antibiotics and phage  ap. 1848-1859.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBacteria live in dynamic systems where selection pressures can alter rapidly, forcing adaptation to the prevailing conditions. In particular, bacteriophages and antibiotics of anthropogenic origin are major bacterial stressors in many environments. We previously observed that populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 exposed to the lytic bacteriophage SBW25Φ2 and a noninhibitive concentration of the antibiotic streptomycin (coselection) achieved higher levels of phage resistance compared to populations exposed to the phage alone. In addition, the phage became extinct under coselection while remaining present in the phage alone environment. Further, phenotypic tests indicated that these observations might be associated with increased mutation rate under coselection. In this study, we examined the genetic causes behind these phenotypes by whole‐genome sequencing clones isolated from the end of the experiments. We were able to identify genetic factors likely responsible for streptomycin resistance, phage resistance and hypermutable (mutator) phenotypes. This constitutes genomic evidence in support of the observation that while the presence of phage did not affect antibiotic resistance, the presence of antibiotic affected phage resistance. We had previously hypothesized an association between mutators and elevated levels of phage resistance under coselection. However, our evidence regarding the mechanism was inconclusive, as although with phage mutators were only found under coselection, additional genomic evidence was lacking and phage resistance was also observed in nonmutators under coselection. More generally, our study provides novel insights into evolution between univariate and multivariate selection (here two stressors), as well as the potential role of hypermutability in natural communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3aclones 3aevolution 3agenetic factors 3amutation 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3astreptomycin1 aFrickel, Jens1 aJalasvuori, Matti1 aHiltunen, Teppo1 aBecks, Lutz0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 7 p.1848-1859dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.139503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012700159300002000286520094300306592002801249650002701277650001301304650002301317650001401340650001801354650001301372650000901385650002401394650001901418650001301437650002001450700001401470700001701484700001901501700001901520773012501539856007401664852000901738655001201747IND60664608620221119151352.0190912e20130917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066460862DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43209b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dong-Gyun10aBio- and oil-fouling resistance of ultrafiltration membranes controlled by star-shaped block and random copolymer coatings  ap. 18071-18081.  aA series of star-shaped block (SBC) and random (SRC) copolymers containing poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) moieties were prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), and used as membrane coating materials to investigate the effects of polymer structure and monomer content on the antifouling properties of the membranes. Polysulfone (PSf) ultrafiltration membranes coated with SBCs showed noticeably higher bio- and oil-fouling resistance than the bare PSf membrane. In addition, the SBC-coated membranes exhibited better antifouling properties than the SRC-coated membrane during both BSA solution and oil/water emulsion filtrations. The enhanced antifouling properties of the SBC-coated membrane compared to the SRC-coated one were ascribed to the larger content of denser PEG segments on the membrane surface, resulting in decreased interactions with proteins and oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifouling activities 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3aemulsions 3amethyl ethers 3amoieties 3aoils 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3aultrafiltration1 aKang, Hyo1 aHan, Sungsoo1 aKim, Hee Joong1 aLee, Jong-Chan0 tRSC advances.g2013 Sept. 17, v. 3, no. 39 p.18071-18081dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra43209b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014300160300002000303520140400323592002801727650001201755650001601767650001601783650001101799650002101810650004601831650001101877650001501888650001701903650001201920650001201932650001301944650004401957650001402001650002202015650001402037650001402051700001602065700001802081700002102099700002202120700002302142773012502165856007402290852000902364655001202373IND60664608720221119151251.0190912e20130927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066460872DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43211d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Dipendu10aSynthesis and sensing properties of 1,1′-disubstituted unsymmetrical ferrocene-triazole derivatives: a multichannel probe for Hg(ii) ion  ap. 18614-18625.  aTriazole-based unsymmetrically 1,1′-disubstituted ferrocene derivatives 4 and 5 have been synthesized using “click chemistry” with sequential functionalization at the cyclopentadienyl rings. The cation complexation properties of these ferrocene derivatives have been studied using electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. The exceptional structural features present in these ligands are the presence of one cholesterol moiety, connected to the 1-position of the ferrocene center through a 1,2,3-triazole ring, and a fluorescent moiety, linked to the 1′-position of such a core through another triazole-ether linkage. Both the receptors experience perturbation of the CV in the presence of Hg²⁺ with a change of electrochemical potential (the large anodic shift ΔE₁/₂ = 129 mV for 4 and ΔE₁/₂ = 140 mV for 5). The changes in the absorption spectra are accompanied by the appearance of a new high energy (HE) peak at ca. 206 nm for 4 and 202 nm for 5 (4: ε = 3123 × 10² M⁻¹ cm⁻¹, 5: ε = 3140 × 10² M⁻¹ cm⁻¹) in the presence of Hg²⁺ ion. In addition, receptors 4 and 5 show colorimetric response and act as a selective “turn off” fluorescent receptor for Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺ ions. On the basis of the ¹H NMR titration, ESI-MS and DFT study, probable binding modes of 1,1′-disubstituted ferrocene derivatives 4 and 5 with Hg²⁺ have been proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3acholesterol 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenergy 3aferrocenes 3afluorescence 3aligands 3amercury 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areceptors 3aspectral analysis 3atitration 3atriazoles1 aDeb, Pranab1 aMondal, Bijan1 aThakur, Arunabha1 aPonniah S, Joseph1 aGhosh, Sundargopal0 tRSC advances.g2013 Sept. 27, v. 3, no. 40 p.18614-18625dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra43211d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009100158520232900249592002802578650000802606650001902614650001602633650001102649650001902660650001502679650001102694651001002705700001502715700002102730700001902751700001402770700001702784700001402801700001502815773012902830856007502959852000903034655001203043IND60784210720221117162838.0220726e20220711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078421072DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaoyun 10aEffect of Vertical Wind Shear on PM2.5 Changes over a Receptor Region in Central China  aVertical wind shear (VWS) significantly impacts the vertical mixing of air pollutants and leads to changes in near-surface air pollutants. We focused on Changsha (CS) and Jingmen (JM), the upstream and downstream urban sites of a receptor region in central China, to explore the impact of VWS on surface PM₂.₅ changes using 5-year wintertime observations and simulations from 2016–2020. The surface PM₂.₅ concentration was lower in CS with higher anthropogenic PM₂.₅ emissions than in JM, and the correlation between wind speed and PM₂.₅ was negative for clean conditions and positive for polluted conditions in both two sites. The difference in the correlation pattern of surface PM₂.₅ and VWS between CS and JM might be due to the different influences of regional PM₂.₅ transport and boundary layer dynamics. In downstream CS, the weak wind and VWS in the height of 1–2 km stabilized the ABL under polluted conditions, and strong northerly wind accompanied by enhanced VWS above 2 km favored the long-range transport of air pollutants. In upstream JM, local circulation and long-range PM₂.₅ transport co-determined the positive correlation between VWS and PM₂.₅ concentrations. Prevailed northerly wind disrupted the local circulation and enhanced the surface PM₂.₅ concentrations under polluted conditions, which tend to be an indicator of regional transport of air pollutants. The potential contribution source maps calculated from WRF-FLEXPART simulations also confirmed the more significant contribution of regional PM₂.₅ transport to the PM₂.₅ pollution in upstream region JM. By comparing the vertical profiles of meteorological parameters for typical transport- and local-type pollution days, the northerly wind prevailed throughout the ABL with stronger wind speed and VWS in transport-type pollution days, favoring the vertical mixing of transported air pollutants, in sharp contrast to the weak wind conditions in local-type pollution days. This study provided the evidence that PM₂.₅ pollution in the Twain-Hu Basin was affected by long-distance transport with different features at upstream and downstream sites, improving the understanding of the air pollutant source–receptor relationship in air quality changes with regional transport of air pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair quality 3abasins 3awind direction 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina1 aZhou, Yue 1 aZhao, Tianliang 1 aBai, Yongqing 1 aHuo, Tao 1 aLeng, Liang 1 aHe, Huan 1 aSun, Jing 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 11, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008100172300001800253520133800271592002801609650001401637650001001651650001801661650001201679650001801691650001001709651001301719700002301732700001701755773012601772856008501898852000901983655001201992IND60560048120221120154332.0161218e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056004812DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2016.12210032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyman, Amanda A.10aDispelling Assumptions about Stocked-Trout Fisheries and Angler Satisfaction  ap. 1395-1404.  aWe investigated three assumptions about stocked-trout fisheries: (1) stocking densities (trout/km or trout/ha) correlate with angler catch rates, (2) catch rates decline with time after stocking, and (3) angler satisfaction correlates with catch rates. We interviewed 5,689 anglers on 14 put-and-take trout waters in Virginia from October 2013 to May 2014 and from October 2014 to May 2015 to assess their fishing effort for stocked trout, catch, and level of satisfaction with their fishing experience that day. Stocking density did not affect the stocked-trout catch rate on streams or lakes, and catch rates remained relatively constant from the day after stocking up to 1 month after stocking. The type of water body affected both angler effort and catch rate. We found that catch rates above thresholds (0.46 trout/angler-hour on lakes; 1.21 trout/angler-hour on streams) had minor effects on angler satisfaction, but below those threshold values, satisfaction increased greatly with increasing catch rates on both lakes and streams. Given the concerns over increasing costs to maintain stocking programs, our results suggest that agencies could reduce their stocking densities and frequencies without appreciably reducing angler satisfaction.

It is traditionally known as chagual. The tender basal part of the leaves, just starting from the meristem, are consumed as a salad. The aim of this work was to describe the phenolic content and composition of the meristem and leaves of chagual, as well as their antioxidant capacity and inhibitory activity against metabolic syndrome-associated enzymes. Samples of chagual, including two cultivated and three wild growing plants, were analyzed and compared for composition and bioactivity. From the phenolic enriched extract of the plant (PEE), 26 compounds were tentatively identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn, including 12 hydroxycinnamic acids and 14 flavonoids. The main compounds were identified as diferuloyl hexaric acid isomers and 5-p-Coumaroylquinic acid. The compounds were quantified in both meristem and leaves. The PEE content was up to ten times higher in the meristem than in the leaves, ranging from 0.18 to 124.08 mg/g PEE. The samples inhibited α-glucosidase, but did not show effect on α-amylase and pancreatic lipase. This is the first report on the polyphenol composition and bioactivity of the edible components of the chagual food plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromeliaceae 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3acoumaric acids 3aenzyme inhibition 3aflavonoids 3afood plants 3aisomers 3aleaves 3ameristems 3apolyphenols 3asalads 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aChile 0aPuya chilensis 0aAntioxidant activity 0aPhenolic profile 0aHPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn 0aα-Glucosidase 0aSalad 0a3-Caffeoylquinc acid (PubChem CID: 1794427) 0a4-Caffeoylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 9798666) 0a4-p-Coumaroylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 5281766) 0a5-p-Coumaroylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 6441280) 0a4-O-Feruloylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 131851860) 0a5-O-Feruloylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 9799386) 0aApigenin (PubChem CID: 5280443) 0aDPPH 0aFRAP 0aORAC 0aPEE 0aTE 0aTEAC1 aTheoduloz, Cristina1 aGómez-Alonso, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2358-66361 aHermosín-Gutiérrez, Isidro1 aReyes, Marisol1 aSchmeda-Hirschmann, Guillermo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9228-53780 tFood research international.g2018 Dec., v. 114 p.90-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.07.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245008700207300001600294520127900310592002801589650002301617650002201640650002801662650001101690650001301701650000901714650001301723650001101736700002101747700001701768700002001785700001901805773008601824856008401910852000901994655001202003IND60598973920221122170258.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059897392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Otakar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9661-625010aInteraction between graphene and copper substrate: The role of lattice orientation  ap. 440-451.  aWe present a comprehensive study of graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition on copper single crystals with exposed (100), (110) and (111) faces. Direct examination of the as-grown graphene by Raman spectroscopy using a range of visible excitation energies and microRaman mapping shows distinct strain and doping levels for individual Cu surfaces. Comparison of results from Raman mapping with X-ray diffraction techniques and atomic force microscopy shows it is neither the crystal quality nor the surface topography responsible for the specific strain and doping values, but it is the Cu lattice orientation itself. We also report an exceptionally narrow Raman 2D band width caused by the interaction between graphene and metallic substrate. The appearance of this extremely narrow 2D band with full-width-at-half maximum (FWHM) as low as 16cm⁻¹ is correlated with flat and undoped regions on the Cu(100) and (110) surfaces. The generally compressed (∼0.3% of strain) and n-doped (Fermi level shift of ∼250meV) graphene on Cu(111) shows the 2D band FWHM minimum of ∼20cm⁻¹. In contrast, graphene grown on Cu foil under the same conditions reflects the heterogeneity of the polycrystalline surface and its 2D band is accordingly broader with FWHM >24cm⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3acopper 3acrystals 3afoil 3agraphene 3avapors1 aVejpravova, Jana1 aHoly, Vaclav1 aKavan, Ladislav1 aKalbac, Martin0 tCarbon.g2014 Mar., v. 68 p.440-451dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245013700203300001600340500002000356520195000376592002802326596007702354596007702431596007702508596007702585596008502662650002002747650001402767650002502781700007802806700006902884700005602953773011003009856007403119852000903193655001203202IND60777800720221121033608.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077780072DNAL7 a10.1111/cla.124962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob Machado, Denis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9858-451513aAn empirical test of the relationship between the bootstrap and likelihood ratio support in maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis  ap. 392-401.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn maximum likelihood (ML), the support for a clade can be calculated directly as the likelihood ratio (LR) or log‐likelihood difference (S, LLD) of the best trees with and without the clade of interest. However, bootstrap (BS) clade frequencies are more pervasive in ML phylogenetics and are almost universally interpreted as measuring support. In addition to theoretical arguments against that interpretation, BS has several undesirable attributes for a support measure. For example, it does not vary in proportion to optimality or identify clades that are rejected by the evidence and can be overestimated due to missing data. Nevertheless, if BS is a reliable predictor of S, then it might be an efficient indirect method of measuring support—an attractive possibility, given the speed of many BS implementations. To assess the relationship between S and BS, we analyzed 106 empirical datasets retrieved from TreeBASE. Also, to evaluate the degree to which S and BS are affected by the number of replicates during suboptimal tree searches for S and pseudoreplicates during BS estimation, we randomly selected 5 of the 106 datasets and analyzed them using variable numbers of replicates and pseudoreplicates, respectively. The correlation between S and BS was extremely weak in the datasets we analyzed. Increasing the number of replicates during tree search decreased the estimated values of S for most clades, but the magnitude of change was small. In contrast, although increasing pseudoreplicates affected BS values for only approximately 40% of clades, values both increased and decreased, and they did so at much greater magnitudes. Increasing replicates/pseudoreplicates affected the rank order of clades in each tree for both S and BS. Our findings show decisively that BS is not an efficient indirect method of measuring support and suggest that even quite superficial searches to calculate S provide better estimates of support.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012/10000‐5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2013/05958‐8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2015/18654‐2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/15425‐0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a306823/2017‐9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3adata collection 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis1 aPortella de Luna Marques, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4281-87111 aJiménez‐Ferbans, Larry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5710-22651 aGrant, Taran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1726-999X0 tCladistics.g2022 June, v. 38, no. 3 p.392-401dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39879x0748-30077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cla.124963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011200173300001300285520082900298592002801127650002601155650001301181650001101194650001401205650001801219650001501237650001301252650001301265650001101278650001101289650001601300650001101316650001701327651001701344653002401361653001301385653001501398653001001413653001001423773010501433856008601538852000901624655001201633IND60691492520221118024513.0200430e20100401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069149252DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2010.116572492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodgson, Alan N.10aReproductive seasonality of southern African inshore and estuarine invertebrates – a biogeographic review  ap. 1-17.  aA literature review reveals that reproductive seasonality of less than 1% of South Africa’s inshore marine invertebrates has been studied. Approximately 95% of studies have been on large, long-lived, gonochoristic, iteroparous species, and nearly 50% on molluscs. There is only a weak relationship between biogeographic region and timing of reproduction. Nevertheless, a relatively large proportion of west coast species studied breed in winter, whereas south coast species tend to have breeding peaks in spring/summer, although many nearly always have mature gametes and probably reproduce year-round. East coast species are mainly continuous or summer breeders. The factors that control gametogenesis and trigger spawning are largely unresolved, although temperature and food are thought to be important in many species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abreeding 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3agametogenesis 3agerm cells 3amolluscs 3aspawning 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3azoogeography 3aSouth Africa 0aTrachylepis sulcata 0aMelanism 0aSubspecies 0aKIF24 0aEXPH50 tAfrican zoology.g2010 Apr. 1, v. 45, no. 1 p.1-17dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2010.116572493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245012200215300001600337520183400353592002802187650001902215650002002234650001402254650002802268650001902296650003002315650001402345650001902359650001202378650001102390650001902401650001702420650001502437650002402452650001302476650000902489650001002498650001202508650001502520653001102535653001402546653002602560653002802586653002202614653000902636653000802645653000802653653000802661653000802669653000702677653000702684653000802691653001002699653000902709700001602718700002302734700001802757700001402775700001602789700003802805700002002843773012102863856008302984852000903067655001203076IND60724189820221122145844.0210513e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072418982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMhatre, Priyank Hanuman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5205-817010aEvaluation of trap crop, Solanum sisymbriifolium and antagonistic crops against potato cyst nematodes, Globodera spp.  ap. 242-248.  aThe potato cyst nematodes are the most wilful and difficult to manage pests of potato crop. Due to the regulatory considerations and potential risk involved in environmental and health hazards, the options for controlling this nematode are becoming increasingly limited. Among the available management options, trap and antagonistic crops offer viable alternative for controlling PCN species. Therefore the present experiments were conducted to determine the effect of locally available nematode trap crop, Solanum sisymbriifolium and antagonistic crops against potato cyst nematodes. Initially, S. sisymbriifolium was evaluated for its trap crop potential against PCN and the results showed that S. sisymbriifolium acts as a resistant crop for both the species of PCN, as no females were observed on the roots of the trap crop up to the end of the crop season. In addition to this, in the subsequent season negligible populations of PCN females with improved plant growth parameters were observed in susceptible potato cv. Kufri Jyoti. In another experiment, its efficiency was compared with antagonistic crop species viz., Tagetes patula (marigold), Allium sativum (garlic) and Brassica juncea (mustard) on the population decline of PCN. From the study, it was observed that minimum populations of both the species of PCN (0.6 and 33.4 female's plant⁻¹ respectively) were supported in two succeeding seasons of susceptible potato cultivar where S. sisymbriifolium was grown in the preceding season which was followed by marigold, garlic and mustard-based sequences. Therefore, S. sisymbriifolium can be used as a potential trap crop for the management of PCN; however, future studies on its suitability in field conditions are required for its effective utilization under field condition for the management of this nematode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aBrassica juncea 3aGlobodera 3aSolanum sisymbriifolium 3aTagetes patula 3aadministrative management 3acultivars 3acyst nematodes 3afemales 3agarlic 3ahealth hazards 3aplant growth 3apopulation 3apopulation dynamics 3apotatoes 3arisk 3aroots 3aseasons 3atrap crops 0aPotato 0aTrap crop 0aPotato cyst nematodes 0aSolanum sisymbriifolium 0aAntagonistic crop 0aICAR 0aPCN 0aRKN 0aJ2s 0aJ3s 0aGr 0aGp 0aDAP 0aANOVA 0aITCs1 aDivya, K.L.1 aVenkatasalam, E.P.1 aBairwa, Aarti1 aSudha, R.1 aSaranya, C.1 aGuru-Pirasanna-Pandi, Govindharaj1 aSharma, Sanjeev0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 May, v. 138 p.242-248dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245010400186300001400290520070300304592002801007650001801035650001901053650002001072650003501092650001301127650001901140650001001159650001501169650000901184650001501193650001301208650001901221650001201240650002101252650007301273650002101346650002301367650001101390650003001401650001701431650001101448650002501459650003401484650006301518650004801581650003801629650000901667650000901676650002301685650002101708650003101729650004001760650005201800650003301852700001901885700001801904700001701922700002001939700002001959700002001979700002001999700001802019700001902037773009502056856008402151990002302235852000902258655001202267IND60092081120221122042756.0141103e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009208112DNAL7 a217411672pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Ju Hui10aNon-invasive monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma in transgenic mouse with bioluminescent imaging  ap. 53-60.  aA small animal imaging system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific reporter gene expression will enable monitoring of carcinogenesis or therapeutic intervention in vivo.

Whereas traditional near-infrared spectroscopy is an attractive technique for water content determination and solid-state investigation of lyophilized products, chemical imaging opens up possibilities for assessing the homogeneity of these critical quality attributes (CQAs) throughout the entire product. In this contribution, we aim to evaluate NIR-CI as a process analytical technology (PAT) tool for at-line inspection of continuously freeze-dried pharmaceutical unit doses based on spin freezing. The chemical images of freeze-dried mannitol samples were resolved via multivariate curve resolution, allowing us to visualize the distribution of mannitol solid forms throughout the entire cake. Second, a mannitol-sucrose formulation was lyophilized with variable drying times for inducing changes in water content. Analyzing the corresponding chemical images via principal component analysis, vial-to-vial variations as well as within-vial inhomogeneity in water content could be detected. Furthermore, a partial least-squares regression model was constructed for quantifying the water content in each pixel of the chemical images. It was hence concluded that NIR-CI is inherently a most promising PAT tool for continuously monitoring freeze-dried samples. Although some practicalities are still to be solved, this analytical technique could be applied in-line for CQA evaluation and for detecting the drying end point.  aPublisher supplied data 3acakes 3afreeze drying 3afreezing 3aimage analysis 3aleast squares 3amannitol 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprocess monitoring 3aspatial data 3asucrose 3awater content1 aMeyer, Laurens de,1 aVanbillemont, Brecht1 aVan Bockstal, Pieter-Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0363-36181 aLammens, Joris1 aMortier, Séverine1 aCorver, Jos1 aVervaet, Chris1 aNopens, Ingmar1 aDe Beer, Thomas0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 12, v. 90, no. 7 p.4354-4362dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b036473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013900160300001800299500002000317520170700337592002802044650002802072650001802100650002702118650001302145650001102158650001802169650001402187650001002201650001402211650001402225650002002239650001302259650001702272700002202289700002002311700001702331700002102348700001902369700002602388700001902414700002102433700003102454773010102485856007302586852000902659655001202668IND60572236520221119110408.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057223652DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.138952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchetti, Marta10aExperimental evolution of rhizobia may lead to either extra‐ or intracellular symbiotic adaptation depending on the selection regime  ap. 1818-1831.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExperimental evolution is a powerful approach to study the process of adaptation to new environments, including the colonization of eukaryotic hosts. Facultative endosymbionts, including pathogens and mutualists, face changing and spatially structured environments during the symbiotic process, which impose diverse selection pressures. Here, we provide evidence that different selection regimes, involving different times spent in the plant environment, can result in either intra‐ or extracellular symbiotic adaptations. In previous work, we introduced the symbiotic plasmid of Cupriavidus taiwanensis, the rhizobial symbiont of Mimosa pudica, into the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and selected three variants able to form root nodules on M. pudica, two (CBM212 and CBM349) being able to rudimentarily infect nodule cells and the third one (CBM356) only capable of extracellular infection of nodules. Each nodulating ancestor was further challenged to evolve using serial ex planta–in planta cycles of either 21 (three short‐cycle lineages) or 42 days (three long‐cycle lineages). In this study, we compared the phenotype of the 18 final evolved clones. Evolution through short and long cycles resulted in similar adaptive paths on lineages deriving from the two intracellularly infectious ancestors, CBM212 and CBM349. In contrast, only short cycles allowed a stable acquisition of intracellular infection in lineages deriving from the extracellularly infecting ancestor, CBM356. Long cycles, instead, favoured improvement of extracellular infection. Our work highlights the importance of the selection regime in shaping desired traits during host‐mediated selection experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCupriavidus taiwanensis 3aMimosa pudica 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aancestry 3aclones 3aendosymbionts 3aevolution 3ahosts 3amutualism 3aphenotype 3aplant pathogens 3aplasmids 3aroot nodules1 aClerissi, Camille1 aYousfi, Yasmine1 aGris, Carine1 aBouchez, Olivier1 aRocha, Eduardo1 aCruveiller, Stéphane1 aJauneau, Alain1 aCapela, Delphine1 aMasson‐Boivin, Catherine0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 7 p.1818-1831dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.138953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012800160300001800288520176800306592002802074650002202102650003702124650002302161650002002184650002402204650001302228650002802241650002102269650001502290650001002305650001202315650001102327650001802338650001102356650001302367650003302380650001602413650001702429650001602446700001802462700001802480700001902498700001502517700001802532773014202550856007402692852000902766655001202775IND60670714620221121034139.0191002e20140325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067071462DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00011k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuang, Hui-Min12aA coral-like film of Ni@NiS with core–shell particles for the counter electrode of an efficient dye-sensitized solar cell  ap. 5816-5824.  aA coral-like film of nickel@nickel sulfide (Ni@NiS) was obtained on a conducting glass through an electrochemical method, in which the Ni functioned as a template. Three types of Ni thin films were electrodeposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by a pulse current technique at the passed charge densities of 100, 200, and 300 mC cm⁻², which rendered custard apple-like, coral-like, and cracked nanostructures, respectively. Subsequently, nickel sulfide films were coated on these Ni films by using a pulse potential technique. Due to the template effect of the Ni films, the composite films of Ni@NiS also assumed the same structures as those of their nickel templates. In each case of the films the particle of the film assumed a core–shell structure. The Ni@NiS coated FTO glasses were used as the counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The DSSC with the coral-like Ni@NiS film on its counter electrode exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.84%, while the DSSC with platinum film on its counter electrode shows an η of 8.11%. The coral-like Ni@NiS film exhibits multiple functions, i.e., large surface area, high conductivity, and great electrocatalytic ability for iodine/triiodine (I⁻/I₃⁻) reduction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and four-point probe technique were used to characterize the films. The photovoltaic parameters are substantiated using incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization plots. The IPCE curves were further used to calculate theoretical short-current densities of the cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3acustards 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aglass 3aiodides 3aiodine 3ananomaterials 3anickel 3aplatinum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolar cells 3asurface area 3atin dioxide1 aLi, Chun-Ting1 aYeh, Min-Hsin1 aLee, Chuan-Pei1 aVittal, R.1 aHo, Kuo-Chuan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Mar. 25, v. 2, no. 16 p.5816-5824dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00011k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002900169245010000198300001600298520186400314592002802178653001902206653001702225653002702242653002102269653003002290653001902320653002302339653001302362653001102375700002802386773010202414856011702516852000902633655001202642IND60125346620221120064224.0151103e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012534662DNAL7 a10.1646/0006-3606(2001)033[0487:SDOTMP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Buen, Lorena Lóópez10aSeed Dispersal of the Mistletoe Psittacanthus schiedeanus by Birds in Central Veracruz, Mexico1  ap. 487-494.  aMistletoes are hemiparasitic plants that frequently depend on frugivores for seed dispersal; yet their seed dispersal ecology is still poorly known. The mistletoe Psittacanthus schiedeanus (Loranthaceae) was studied for a five-month period in cloud forest remnants in central Veracruz, Mexico, to determine its seed dispersal ecology. We hypothesized that dispersal ecology of this mistletoe species is directly affected by the fruit-eating bird abundance, and asked if this species is following the high-investment strategy as suggested by Godschalk (1983). To evaluate this, we determined the morphological and nutritional characteristics of mistletoe fruit, the availability of ripe fruits along the mistletoe fruiting phenology, and the abundance of fruit-eating birds. Because P. schiedeanus is dispersed by generalist rather than specialist birds, we asked if this mistletoe species is ripening fruits during the fruit scarcity time (with highest possibilities of being consumed and dispersed by birds). We compared P. schiedeanus ripe fruit production to the cloud forest tree leaf fall and fruit production. Psittacanthus schiedeanus matures its nutritious fruits from November to April, with a peak of abundance in January and February. We found a synchrony between the abundance of P. schiedeanus ripe fruits and the abundance of Gray Silky-flycatchers (Ptilogonys cinereus) and Social Flycatchers (Myiozetetes similis); however, this was not the case with Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum), although these birds play an important role in the mistletoe dispersal. The fruiting pattern of P. schiedeanus, together with the fact that it is an important food resource for generalist rather than specialist frugivorous birds, suggest that this mistletoe is using the nutrient investment strategy to attract dispersers during a time of fruit scarcity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCedar Waxwings 0acloud forest 0aGray Silky-flycatchers 0amistletoe fruits 0aPsittacanthus schiedeanus 0aseed dispersal 0asocial flycatchers 0aVeracruz 0aMexico1 aOrnelas, Juan Francisco0 tBiotropica.g2001 July, v. 33, no. 3 p.487-494dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F0006-3606%282001%29033%5B0487%3ASDOTMP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245017000205300001600375500002000391520162800411592002802039596012502067650000802192650002102200650002102221650001702242650001402259650001202273650001302285700001802298700002002316773011002336856007402446852000902520655001202529IND60777800920221121033619.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077780092DNAL7 a10.1111/cla.124932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtiz Angleró, David,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7904-646310aPhylogenomics and loci dropout patterns of deeply diverged Zodarion ant‐eating spiders suggest a high potential of RAD‐seq for genus‐level spider phylogenetics  ap. 320-334.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRAD sequencing yields large amounts of genome‐wide data at a relatively low cost and without requiring previous taxon‐specific information, making it ideal for evolutionary studies of highly diversified and neglected organisms. However, concerns about information decay with phylogenetic distance have discouraged its use for assessing supraspecific relationships. Here, using Double Digest Restriction Associated DNA (ddRAD) data, we perform the first deep‐level approach to the phylogeny of Zodarion, a highly diversified spider genus. We explore the impact of loci and taxon filtering across concatenated and multispecies coalescent reconstruction methods and investigate the patterns of information dropout in reference to both the time of divergence and the mitochondrial divergence between taxa. We found that relaxed loci‐filtering and nested taxon‐filtering strategies maximized the amount of molecular information and improved phylogenetic inference. As expected, there was a clear pattern of allele dropout towards deeper time and mitochondrial divergences, but the phylogenetic signal remained strong throughout the phylogeny. Therefore, we inferred topologies that were almost fully resolved, highly supported, and noticeably congruent between setups and inference methods, which highlights overall inconsistency in the taxonomy of Zodarion. Because Zodarion appears to be among the oldest and most mitochondrially diversified spider genera, our results suggest that ddRAD data show high potential for inferring intra‐generic relationships across spiders and probably also in other taxonomic groups.  aPublisher supplied data  aCZ.02.2.69/0.0/0.0/16_027/0008360cMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic, and the European Union 3aDNA 3aallelic dropouts 3agenetic distance 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny 3aspiders 3ataxonomy1 aPekár, Stano1 aDianat, Malahat0 tCladistics.g2022 June, v. 38, no. 3 p.320-334dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39879x0748-30077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cla.124933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006500172300001800237520214700255592002802402650001502430650003502445650001102480650000902491650001602500650001802516650001502534650000902549650001202558650001502570650001502585651001202600700002102612700002102633700001802654773012602672856008502798852000902883655001202892IND60560048620221120154417.0161218e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056004862DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2016.12274022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReeves, David B.10aResponse of Imperiled Okaloosa Darters to Stream Restoration  ap. 1375-1385.  aThe Okaloosa Darter Etheostoma okaloosae is a small percid endemic to six stream drainages in northwestern Florida. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed Okaloosa Darters as endangered in 1973 and downlisted them to threatened in 2011 because of habitat improvements and increasing abundance across much of their geographic range. Delisting is possible if remaining recovery criteria are met, including restoration of degraded stream reaches. Impounded reaches of Anderson Branch, Mill Creek, and Toms Creek were restored by removing impediments to water flow, draining impoundments, and reconstructing stream reaches. Restorations of Anderson Branch and Mill Creek were designed to rehabilitate populations of Okaloosa Darters without significantly affecting popular recreational activities at these locations. Restorations were evaluated from 2007 to 2013 by comparing counts of Okaloosa Darters and the composition of microhabitats in restored and nearby undisturbed reference sites. Okaloosa Darters were absent from degraded stream reaches at the beginning of the study, but they rapidly colonized once restorations were completed. Counts of Okaloosa Darters in reference and restoration sites in Anderson Branch were similar by the end of the study, whereas counts in restoration sites were significantly lower than nearby reference sites in Mill and Toms creeks. Restoration sites tended to have lower coverage of sand and root and higher coverage of macrophytes. As riparian vegetation surrounding restoration sites matures to a closed canopy that reduces excessive growth of macrophytes, stream microhabitats and numbers of darters will probably become similar to reference sites. Restoration of degraded stream sites increased abundance and distribution of Okaloosa Darters and reconnected formerly isolated upstream and downstream populations. These projects demonstrated that restoration is a useful conservation tool for imperiled fishes such as Okaloosa Darters and can be undertaken without interfering with popular recreational activities.

Several studies suggest that effects of PIT tagging may be species dependent and these effects should be addressed prior to conducting large-scale tagging studies. In a series of laboratory experiments, we tested factors influencing survival and tag retention in Southern Redbelly Dace Chrosomus erythrogaster . In the first experiment, we tested the effects of tagger and fish length on survival and retention over 30 d for dace tagged with 9-mm PIT tags. Survival was high (84%) while retention of tags was low (30%). We detected no significant effect of tagger experience on survival or tag retention. Logistic regression determined that tag retention increased with fish length. A second experiment showed similar trends for survival (80%) and retention of 9-mm tags (25%) as observed in experiment 1, but retention (86%) was significantly higher for dace tagged with 8-mm tags over the same period. All dace in our sham-injection treatment (needle puncture of the peritoneal cavity) survived, eliminating needle puncture as a source of mortality. Our study, combined with a literature review of PIT-tagging studies, suggests that dace and other cyprinids greater than 60 mm can be tagged reliably with 9-mm tags and individuals greater than 50 mm can be tagged with 8-mm tags.

Although it is known that this material is rich in flavanols and alkaloids, to date, a study has not been conducted that has quantitatively identified these compounds in CS. Thus, the aim of this work was to characterize CS in terms of its composition, regarding catechin, epicatechin, procyanidin B2, caffeine and theobromine, and to evaluate the extraction kinetics of the total flavanols using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with absolute ethanol. For the determination of the extraction kinetic data, the DMAC method was used, while each compound was quantified using a UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The major compounds found were theobromine and epicatechin (mean values of 9.89 and 3.5 mg/g CS, respectively). PLE proved to be quite effective; the flavanols extraction yield was enhanced by increasing the temperature and extraction time however, high extraction times and temperatures degraded the procyanidins B2. Peleg's model applied to extraction data description provided a reasonable agreement with the experimental results, which allows their application in modeling and optimization of solid-liquid extraction of the total flavanols from cocoa bean shell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboilers 3acaffeine 3acatechin 3acocoa beans 3acocoa industry 3acoproducts 3aepicatechin 3aethanol 3afeeds 3afertilizers 3afuels 3aliquids 3amodels 3aprocyanidins 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atheobromine 0aCocoa hull 0aCocoa by-product 0aTheobromine 0aEpicatechin 0aProcyanidin B2 0aExtraction kinetic 0aThermogravimetric analysis 0aAntioxidant activity1 aSoares, Ingrid D.1 aCuevas, Maitê S.1 aCrevelin, Eduardo J.1 aMoraes, Luiz A.B.1 aMelo, Mariza P.1 aOliveira, Alessandra L.1 aRodrigues, Christianne E.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5456-97080 tFood research international.g2018 Dec., v. 114 p.20-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.07.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006100137245011900198300001600317520174400333592002802077653002902105653001402134653001602148653002602164653001802190653002402208773011702232856007202349852000902421655001202430IND60679876420221120142826.0200102s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067987642DNAL7 a10.1071/SB180422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutherford, Susan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9723-079010aInsights into speciation and species delimitation of closely related eucalypts using an interdisciplinary approach  ap. 110-127.  aSpeciation is a central process in evolutionary biology and is responsible for the diversity of life on Earth. Although there has been much progress in evolutionary research over the past 150 years, understanding the many facets of speciation remains a challenge. In this synthesis, I focus on the use of an interdisciplinary approach to examine speciation and species delimitation in a group of closely related eucalypts called the green ashes (Eucalyptus subgenus Eucalyptus section Eucalyptus). The green ashes comprise tall trees on fertile soils (e.g. the tallest angiosperm in the world, E. regnans), as well as medium trees and mallees on low-nutrient soils. Previous phylogenetic and population-genetics analyses based on genome-wide scans showed that species boundaries in the green ashes are not always consistent with classifications based on morphology and there was evidence of gene flow across lineages. Genomic analyses also suggested that the green ashes were at varying stages of speciation, with some species being highly genetically differentiated, whereas others were at earlier stages on the speciation continuum. A previous common garden study showed that inter-specific differences in seedling traits were significant, with traits such as leaf width being highly plastic across resource treatments for most species. Overall, this synthesis demonstrated that an interdisciplinary approach incorporating phylogenomics, population genomics and a common garden experiment can provide insights into speciation and species delimitation in the green ash eucalypts. Such an approach may be useful in understanding the evolutionary history of other closely related species in Eucalyptus, as well as other groups of organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 0acommon garden experiment 0aevolution 0agreen ashes 0aphenotypic plasticity 0aphylogenomics 0apopulation genetics0 tAustralian systematic botany.g2020, v. 33, no. 1 p.110-127dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl43314x1030-18877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SB180423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04982naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007100168520292300239592002803162650001603190650000803206650002103214650002603235650002003261650001603281650002603297650001403323650002903337650001203366650001803378650002503396650003003421650001503451650001703466650001803483650002103501650001003522650002503532650002203557650001203579650001803591650002603609650001103635650001603646650002803662650002203690651001303712653001903725653003003744653002503774653001903799653003103818653001703849653003203866700002703898700005803925700001903983700001804002700001804020700001804038700002304056773009904079856008504178852000904263655001204272IND60630945820221122155314.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063094582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatloob, Amar10aChallenges and prospects for weed management in Pakistan: A review  aWeed management has become increasingly important in the backdrop of sustainable crop production, uncertain climatic patterns and food security concerns in Pakistan. Due to diverse agro-climatic conditions, 267 weed species have been identified to be responsible for causing monetary loss worth 3 billion USD annually. Weed competition for resources, interference with crops, weed-related increased incidence of pests and diseases in different crops, and high management costs incurred in controlling weeds make weed management a critical task for the farmers. Moreover, herbicide resistant weeds, labor shortage, higher wages, weed population shifts, changing climatic optima, unavailability of proper and timely inputs, ever increasing threats of invasive weeds, lack of knowledge and training regarding herbicides, and the poor financial resources of the small land holders are major hurdles towards effective weed management in Pakistan. These multi-dimensional problems need holistic line of action with multi-disciplinary collaboration. Improved knowledge of weed ecology, biology, genetics and molecular biology is essential for developing sustainable weed control practices. Some advances are already commercialized, and others are in the process of development. Advancements like vision guided machines for site-specific weed management, recognition and application modules, development of air inclusion nozzles, nanoherbicides, water based formulations with fewer hydrocarbons, herbicide-resistant transgenic crops, robotics to monitor and spray weeds, decision support systems and predictive modeling can be adopted to foster modern weed management in the country. Various conventional weed management approaches like narrow row spacing, row orientation, increased crop density, use of cover crops, intercropping, development of weed-competitive crop cultivars, and their integration can help reduce herbicide input under a given scenario. There is dire need to establish regional weed research institutes under various cropping systems to carry out strategic and applied research in weed science. Innovative teaching and training practices are needed to tackle complex weed management challenges. Effective linkages between academia-research-industry-extension services could play a pivotal role to reframe technological advancements and legislation and to advocate innovations to the farmers. Capacity building, more research fund allocation, and reorienting educational system seem indispensable. Here, we have presented a broad review to summarize the current state of knowledge about the problems and prospects of sustainable weed management approaches in Pakistan. Advanced weed management approaches keeping in view the local agro-ecological conditions have also been discussed in this review to improve the scientific knowledge so that the discipline gets stronger and more focused than ever before.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3aair 3aapplied research 3achemical weed control 3acontrol methods 3acover crops 3acrop-weed competition 3acultivars 3adecision support systems 3afarmers 3afood security 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3aherbicides 3ahydrocarbons 3aintercropping 3ainvasive species 3alabor 3alaws and regulations 3amolecular biology 3anozzles 3aplant density 3aresearch institutions 3arobots 3arow spacing 3asustainable agriculture 3atransgenic plants 3aPakistan 0aClimate change 0aEconomic and yield losses 0aHerbicide resistance 0aInvasive weeds 0aIntegrated weed management 0aWeed ecology 0aWeed research and education1 aEhsan Safdar, Muhammad1 aAbbas, Tasawer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9533-07951 aAslam, Farhena1 aAbdul Khaliq,1 aTanveer, Asif1 aRehman, Abdul1 aRaza Chadhar, Asim0 tCrop protection.g2020 Aug., v. 134 p.104724-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015400166300001600320520135200336592002801688650001301716650001801729650001401747650001901761650000901780650001501789650001201804650001901816700001601835700001701851700001701868700001901885773011301904856008102017852000902098655001202107IND60132681920221121211702.0150511e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013268192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-015-0721-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Myeong-Je10aImprovement of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation frequency in multiple modern elite commercial maize (Zea mays L.) inbreds by media modifications  ap. 519-529.  aThe current study describes a robust, high-frequency Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol suitable for multiple recalcitrant modern elite commercial maize inbreds employing media modifications with glucose, cupric sulfate and a cytokinin, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). An optimal combination of these three key elements in the co-cultivation, resting, and selection media resulted in 4- to 14-fold improvements in transformation frequencies at the T₀plant level of 9.7, 31.9, 9.6 and 10.0 % for PH4CN, PH12BN, PHW0V and PH17R8, respectively. Transformation frequency in PH1CP1 was also improved at the T₀tissue level from 2.5 to 8.3 %. The addition of cupric sulfate and BAP in the co-cultivation medium improved transformation frequency in all inbreds except PH4CN. The use of cupric sulfate and BAP in combination with additional glucose in the selection medium was especially important, significantly improving the transformation frequency in 3 (PH4CN, PHW0V and PH1CP1) out of 5 inbreds by increasing the proliferation of high quality regenerable tissue. It was observed that the amount/ratio of these three components needed to be optimized for each inbred. The results in this study can be applied to optimize the tissue culture response and improve transformation frequency in other recalcitrant elite commercial maize inbreds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abenzyladenine 3acoculture 3acopper sulfate 3acorn 3acytokinins 3aglucose 3atissue culture1 aBanh, Jenny1 aYu, Maryanne1 aKwan, Jackie1 aJones, Todd J.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2015 June, v. 121, no. 3 p.519-529dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-015-0721-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04156naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014700170300001600317520184400333592002802177596015402205596013402359596008602493596005902579596012602638650002902764650002102793650001502814650001302829650001002842650002002852650002202872650000902894650001402903650001902917650000902936650001302945650001902958650001902977650001102996650001103007650001803018650001703036650002003053650001203073650001803085650001403103650001603117700001303133700001403146700005903160700001403219700001603233700002003249700001903269700002003288773010603308856008303414852000903497655001203506IND60776401520221122134836.0220505e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077640152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-022-09716-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Guangshuang10aEffects of Pine Needle Essential Oil Combined with Chitosan Shellac on Physical and Antibacterial Properties of Emulsions for Egg Preservation  ap. 260-272.  aIn this study, the structural changes of chitosan- (C) shellac (S) bio-based emulsions induced by the incorporation of pine needle essential oil (PNEO) were investigated, in addition to, the effect of enhancements in physical, functional, and antibacterial properties of coatings on egg preservation. The ability of emulsion-based coatings to combine the structural strength of the hydrophilic phase with the hydrophobicity of the lipid was interpreted. Rheological analysis indicated that an appropriate amount of PNEO endowed the coating-forming emulsions (CFE) with proper viscosity and gel properties. The C-S-PNEO₃ combined with 0.6 g PNEO had the optimal application and storage stability reflected by the lowest particle size and potential. SEM observed a flatter surface morphology of the coatings with the addition of 0.4 and 0.6 g PNEO, while XRD and FTIR also revealed that PNEO improved the biocompatibility by reducing the crystallinity of the coating, while hydrogen bonds were formed between chitosan, shellac. Furthermore, the physical properties of the coating, such as water vapor permeability (WVP), gas permeability, light transmittance, and color parameters were affected by the PNEO. The results showed that the uniform texture, excellent water vapor, oxygen, ultraviolet (UV) barrier performance, and bacteriostatic effect of the C-S-PNEO₃ coating contributed to egg packaging. HIGHLIGHTS: PNEO incorporation affected the properties of emulsions as well as the properties of coatings. Coating-forming emulsions have good structural properties and storage stability. C-S-PNEO₃ was endowed with strong barrier properties and antibacterial activity for eggs preservation. PNEO had good biocompatibility with C and S determined by XRD. Prepared bio-based emulsion coatings were an emerging egg packaging material.  aPublisher supplied data  aZYZCDFGX202115cTalent training project supported by the central government for the reform and development of local colleges and universities in 2021  aSQ2021YFE011327cNational key R & D Program - intergovernmental international scientific and technological innovation cooperation  aGDKTP2020028900cGuangdong enterprise science and Technology Commissioner project  a31101386cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a54941112csupported by the discipline team of food based functional active packaging of Northeast Agricultural University 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiophysics 3achitosan 3acolor 3aconifer needles 3acrystal structure 3aeggs 3aemulsions 3aessential oils 3agels 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3astorage quality 3atexture 3atransmittance 3aviscosity 3awater vapor1 aSun, Rui1 aLi, Hanyu1 aZhang, Huajiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1051-84201 aXia, Ning1 aGuo, Panpan1 aJiang, Long Wei1 aZhang, Xiaonan1 aRayan, Ahmed M.0 tFood biophysics.g2022 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.260-272dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3949866x1557-18587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-022-09716-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010200165500001900267520169000286592002801976650001202004650001202016650002202028650002502050650002202075650001302097650002002110650002102130650001302151650001402164650002202178650001302200650001102213650001602224650001502240650001002255653003402265653003302299653002102332653002302353653002402376700005802400700001502458700002002473700001702493700001702510773009702527856008502624852000902709655001202718IND60704727220221121220839.0201216e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070472722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jianna10aSupercritical water oxidation and process enhancement of nitrogen-containing organics and ammonia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSupercritical water oxidation (SCWO), as a promising technology for treating organic wastewater and sludge, has attracted the attention of many scholars. Nitrogen-containing organics are refractory substances that widely exist in industrial waste, and their effective degradation is of great significance to the environment. In this paper, the treatment effects, reaction kinetics, and migration and transformation pathways of various nitrogen-containing organics (amino group, nitro group, mixed group, and nitrogen heteroatom) under SCWO conditions are summarized, and the influences of the reaction temperature, oxidant type and concentration, residence time, and initial concentration of organics on the degradation of organics are also discussed. NH₃-N is the primary intermediate product produced during the oxidation process of the amino group and nitrogen heteroatom organics, and the further degradation of NH₃-N is the limiting step for the whole reaction. This paper focuses on the relevant strengthening technologies used to enhance the degradation of NH₃-N, including heterogeneous catalytic oxidation with reactor wall or metal oxides; co-oxidation with auxiliary fuels such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and glycol; strong oxidation with NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻; and segmented oxidation by multi-injection of oxidants or fuels. In addition, in order to achieve the complete removal of NH₃-N and COD synergistically under relatively mild SCWO conditions, avoid the formation of NOₓ, NO₃⁻, and NO₂⁻, and convert organic nitrogen into environmentally friendly products such as N₂ and N₂O, further research requirements and challenges are introduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aethanol 3aindustrial wastes 3aintermediate product 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3anitro compounds 3aorganic nitrogen 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3areaction kinetics 3aresearch 3asludge 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awater 0aSupercritical water oxidation 0aNitrogen-containing organics 0aAmmonia nitrogen 0aReaction mechanism 0aProcess enhancement1 aWang, Shuzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0384-89931 aLi, Yanhui1 aJiang, Zhuohang1 aXu, Tiantian1 aZhang, Yishu0 tWater research.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 185 p.116222-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012600162300001600288520248600304592002802790650001502818650001602833650001602849650001702865650001602882650001002898650001702908650001302925650001902938650001902957650001702976650001802993650002203011650001903033650000703052650001803059650002403077650002003101650001703121650001603138700002203154700001403176700002303190700002103213700005703234773010603291856008303397852000903480655001203489IND60776401620221122134817.0220505e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077640162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-022-09719-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jiuk10aEffect of Process and Formulation Variables on the Structural and Physical Properties in Cream Cheese using GDL Acidulant  ap. 273-287.  aWe report on the properties of analogue cream cheeses prepared using glucono delta-lactone (GDL) acidulant, notably the impact of particular processing and formulation variables, (homogenisation pressure, coagulation pH and temperature, and stabiliser level) on cream cheese physical, material and microstructural properties. Protein–protein and protein-fat interactions were seen to be the primary structural contributors to the physical properties of cream cheese. Cream cheese microstructure and its properties demonstrated well-defined correlations to specific and controllable processing elements within the manufacturing process, showing significance in interactions between parameters in multivariable linear regression analysis (P < 0.05). Summarising the effect of processing variables on key cheese properties, we observed that a progressive reduction in fat particle size of cheese milk arising from increasing homogenisation pressures was seen to increase the total surface area of fat that could be incorporated into the curd during coagulation. The greater extent of fat-fat and fat-proteins interactions during coagulation provided a reinforcing effect on the microstructure of the final cream cheese, with a corresponding increase in compressive fracture stress, shear storage modulus (G′) and shear loss modulus (G″). In terms of other processing variables, cream cheese firmness was also observed to progressively increase through lowering of coagulation pH from 5.13 to 4.33. Increasing coagulation temperature from 58 °C to 78 °C similarly caused an increase in cheese firmness. Finally, increasing the levels of added stabiliser were shown to correlate with increasing cheese firmness. Similar correlations could be observed in relation to physical properties, notably forced expressible serum separation. This model cream cheese preparation method has provided a useful model system for relating food structure to material and functional properties. In addition, it has the advantage of being able to rapidly screen many formulation and process variables because it is faster than the traditional cheesemaking. This study showed that the adjustment of process and formulation variables, either in isolation or in combination, in the manufacture of cream cheese can significantly influence the final material and textural properties of the product, thereby enabling controllable functional attributes capable of meeting different customer needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3ablood serum 3acheese milk 3acheesemaking 3acoagulation 3acream 3acream cheese 3afirmness 3agluconolactone 3ahomogenization 3aloss modulus 3amanufacturing 3amechanical stress 3amicrostructure 3apH 3aparticle size 3aregression analysis 3astorage modulus 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aWatkinson, Philip1 aLad, Mita1 aMatia-Merino, Lara1 aSmith, Jeremy R.1 aGolding, Matt1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9383-71570 tFood biophysics.g2022 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.273-287dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3949866x1557-18587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-022-09719-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009100177300001800268520143300286592002801719650002401747650001301771650002801784650000901812650002001821653002301841653001501864653001701879653002301896653001701919653002601936653001701962653002401979653001102003653002002014653001702034653001802051773012502069856008602194852000902280655001202289IND60778511720221119025100.0220528e20220603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077851172DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2020.18111862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalcıoğlu, H.

Natural fiber-reinforced composites have a low resistance to applied loads and chemical effects compared to synthetic fiber-reinforced composites. For this reason, researchers have aimed to increase the strength of natural fiber-reinforced composites with a variety of applications. In this study, the fracture toughness of jute/epoxy laminated composites, which were filled with silicon carbide (SiC) particles, were investigated. In this context, natural jute/epoxy laminated composites were filled in different ratios (3%, 6%, and 9%) with SiC particles having different granule sizes (4.5 μm, 9.3 μm, and 53 μm). Fracture toughness of filled and unfilled natural jute/epoxy composites in the loading state of Mod I, Mod I/II and Mode II were investigated by using the Arcan test apparatus. Also, the fracture behavior of filled and unfilled jute/epoxy laminated composites was analyzed by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). It was found that the analysis results were compatible with experimental results. The test results showed that the fracture toughness of SiC filled jute/epoxy laminated composites was higher than that of pure jute/epoxy composites. Also, the fracture toughness of the natural composite material varies according to the filling percentage and granule size.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3afinite element analysis 3ajute 3asilicon carbide 0aFracture toughness 0ajute/epoxy 0aSiC particle 0afilling percentage 0agranule size 0afinite element method 0a断裂韧性 0a黄麻/环氧树脂 0a颗粒 0a填充百分比 0a颗粒大小 0a有限元法\0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2022 June 03, v. 19, no. 6 p.2338-2355dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2020.18111863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008300164300001600247520127500263592002801538650002401566650001701590650001101607650002301618650001501641650001301656650002501669650001101694650001501705650001601720651001501736773013101751856008201882852000901964655001201973IND60516557320221117213231.0190730e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051655732DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929110006832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHILBORN, RAY14aThe role of science in MPA establishment in California: a personal perspective  ap. 195-198.  aCalifornia has now largely completed a process for establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) that may be considered a model for other jurisdictions seeking to meet obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. In the Californian process, a team of scientists established guidelines on the size and spacing of MPAs, as well as requirements for habitat representation and replication. The final outcomes, in terms of proportion of the coast encompassed by MPAs and the distribution and sizes of MPAs, were largely a result of decisions taken by the advisory scientists, rather than by the designated decision makers. Future legislation must recognize the uncertainties associated with benefits of MPAs and specifically allow for adaptive management including explicit experimental tests of uncertainties. The science team should define at the outset the major uncertainties about impacts, and deliberate experimentation and adaptive management should be essential parts of each design. Future legislation should be much more specific about the objectives of the MPAs and specify the percentage of the area that should be set aside as MPAs. Finally, quantitative models rather than guidelines should be used to evaluate the consequences of alternative designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3aguidelines 3ahabitats 3alaws and regulations 3amodels 3ascientists 3auncertainty 3aCalifornia0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2012 Sept., v. 39, no. 3 p.195-198dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929110006833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245010200176300001600278520141600294592002801710650002901738650002301767650002001790650001101810650001701821650001201838651001001850653003801860653005801898773013201956856008202088852000902170655001202179IND60623065520221119014950.0181127e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062306552DNAL7 a10.1177/0973005210005002022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKisekka-Ntale, Fredrick10aCarnage in ParadisebLaw and Decision-making Rights in Protected Area Management in Western Kenya  ap. 145-173.  aDifferent perceptions and claims lead to conflicts over environmental outcomes. By elucidating the role of the state and its relationship to local institutions, one can better understand contemporary institutional conflict and the need to create mechanisms for inter-institutional cooperation in environmental decision making, particularly in the realm of protected area management. The article is based on findings from one of the remaining few Afro-tropical rainforests. Located in western Kenya, Kakamega forest is under immense threat of survival. The forest is located in a densely populated area and inhabited by poor farming communities, largely of Luhya descent. The study analyses varied notions related to local people’s perception of institutional regimes. The aim of the article is to shed more light on what is meant by institutions, institutionalism and point to some common misleading notions associated with the terms; explain the institutional dimensions of environmental decision making in the context of shifting discourses in protected area management; explain the most common basis of institutional conflict over the environment and summarize by drawing emphasis on how comanagement in protected reserves requires the recognition of local institutional rights and how this can both reduce institutional conflict to achieve a sustainable relationship between societies and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollaborative management 3aconservation areas 3adecision making 3apeople 3arain forests 3asociety 3aKenya 0aInstitutions and institutionalism 0aresource rights framing and protected area management0 tInternational Journal of Rural Management.g2009 Oct., v. 5, no. 2 p.145-173dSAGE PublicationswJournal:27062x0973-00527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0973005210005002023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015800168520135000326592002801676650001901704650001701723650002501740650002301765650002101788650002001809650001201829650002101841650001201862650002201874650001801896650000901914650002201923650001701945650001001962653001901972653001801991653002902009653003602038653002602074653003002100773010202130856008702232852000902319655001202328IND60649547020221122205651.0201104e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064954702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.1063802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan, Ram10aDeriving double dividends through linking payments for ecosystem services to environmental entrepreneurship: The case of the invasive weed Lantana camara  aA payment for ecosystem services mechanism is designed to support an environmental enterprise aimed at controlling Lantana camara, an invasive weed that is costly to eradicate. A forest reserve manager engages the local community in lantana control efforts. The community converts the weeds into household durable items for sale. However, as markets for such products may not account for the environmental services generated through weed control, the enterprise could fail for want of additional financial support. The challenge addressed in this paper is to incorporate the full environmental benefits of the weed-based enterprise and provide adequate compensation to the local community. An optimal compensation mechanism is derived through linking the ecological dimension of weed growth to its impact on biodiversity values within the reserve. Results indicate that optimal payments to the community would need to take into consideration both the value addition to the environment from controlling the invasive weed and the opportunity cost of participation by the community. When there exists a risk of enterprise failure due to low profitability, higher payments by the manager are required. However, the best environmental outcomes are obtained when the manager incorporates the welfare of the local community within the utility function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLantana camara 3abiodiversity 3abusiness enterprises 3aecosystem services 3aentrepreneurship 3aforest reserves 3afunding 3ainvasive species 3amarkets 3aopportunity costs 3aprofitability 3arisk 3autility functions 3aweed control 3aweeds 0aLantana camara 0aInvasive weed 0aEnvironmental enterprise 0aPayments for ecosystem services 0aEnvironmental service 0aBiodiversity conservation0 tEcological economics.g2019 Oct., v. 164 p.106380-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.1063803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014500175300001600320520115800336592002801494650001101522650002701533650001701560650001501577650002101592650001501613650001301628650001101641650001601652650001001668651001001678653001701688653002001705653002101725773013201746856008201878852000901960655001201969IND60623065720221119015238.0181127e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062306572DNAL7 a10.1177/0973005210005002042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Debadutta Kumar10aAssessing the Impact of Participation in Women Self-help Group-based MicrofinancebNon-experimental Evidences from Rural Households in India  ap. 197-215.  aA quasi-experimental design was made under which the target group was compared with a selected control group across a set of household variables like income, assets positions, savings, consumption, employment, literacy and migration. A multistage random sampling was used to select 150 cross-sectional samples from Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh states of India. Descriptive statistics, test of significance by z-statistics and probit model under econometrics were used to measure the impact of participation in the self-help group-based microfinance. The distribution of household income and assets was measured by Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. The ‘household’ was taken as the unit of analysis. The study concluded with the positive impact on the increase in income, assets position, savings and literacy and in the reduction of migration of rural households. Weak evidence of significant impact of the group-based microfinance on the distribution of household income and assets was found.

When the total amount of Bi₂O₃ and ZnO was below 30 mol%, a phase separation occurred and homogeneous glass was not obtained. The fraction of four-coordinated borons (BO₄) was highest when the total amount of Bi₂O₃ and ZnO was 50mol%. Further addition over 50 mol% induced a borate anomaly phenomenon in the glass, which resulted in the decrease in BO₄ fraction. The sintering temperature and glass transition temperature decreased as the amount of Bi₂O₃ and ZnO increased. The thermal expansion coefficient and dielectric constant of the specimens were also examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aborates 3adielectric properties 3aglass 3aglass transition temperature 3aseparation 3athermal expansion 3azinc oxide1 aLim, Eun-Sub1 aLee, Joonhyung,1 aKim, Jeong-Joo0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 June, v. 42, no. 12 p.4260-4264dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-0638-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012900156300001600285520203500301592002802336650001302364650001602377650002102393650002002414650001402434650001102448650001302459650001502472650000902487650001102496650002202507650002602529650002002555650001302575650002302588650001602611650001002627650000902637650001602646650001202662650002002674653001302694653001202707653001102719653002502730653002002755700001302775700005502788773010902843856007402952852000903026655001203035IND60673770320221120202240.0210209e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067377032DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pex3782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeGroot, A A10aEfficacy of guanidinoacetic acid on growth and muscle energy metabolism in broiler chicks receiving arginine-deficient diets  ap. 890-900.  aGuanidinoacetic acid (GAA) is formed from arginine (Arg) and is the immediate precursor to creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr), which are important compounds involved in muscle energy homeostasis. This study sought to determine whether GAA could spare Arg in broiler chicks fed an Arg-deficient practical diet. A basal [0.84% standardized ileal digestible (SID) Arg] was supplemented with combinations of L-Arg (0 or 0.16%) and GAA (0, 0.06, or 0.12%) to form a factorial arrangement of diets; the unsupplemented basal served as the negative control (NC). Additionally, the basal was supplemented with 0.32% Arg to generate an Arg-adequate positive control (PC). Mash diets were fed to 8 replicate pens of 5 chicks per treatment from d 8 to 22 posthatch, with measurements including growth performance, blood GAA metabolites, muscle cellular energy markers, and clinical outcomes. Supplementation of 0.16% Arg increased (P < 0.05) BW gain from d 15 to 22 posthatch, while graded addition of GAA tended to improve BW gain (P < 0.094). Supplementation of either Arg or GAA increased (P < 0.05) feed efficiency from d 15 to 22 and d 8 to 22 posthatch. Birds fed the PC diet had greater (P < 0.05) responses for nearly all blood and tissue outcomes compared with NC-fed birds. Serum GAA was more responsive to supplementation of GAA in the presence versus absence of supplemental Arg (interaction, P < 0.001). Interactions (P < 0.05) were also observed for concentrations of muscle total Cr, creatinine, and most serum essential amino acids, notably Arg. Serum Cr, as well as muscle PCr, total Cr, and glycogen were increased (P < 0.05) independently by Arg and GAA supplementation, with highest levels achieved via combined addition of 0.12% GAA and 0.16% Arg. Minimal effects were detected on hematological and clinical chemistry outcomes. Overall, we conclude that GAA supplementation can spare Arg in broiler chicks fed Arg-deficient practical diets as evidenced by improvements in growth performance and muscle energy stores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3ablood serum 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3achemistry 3achicks 3acreatine 3acreatinine 3adiet 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aessential amino acids 3afeed conversion 3aglycogen 3agrowth performance 3ahomeostasis 3aileum 3amash 3ametabolites 3amuscles 3aphosphocreatine 0aarginine 0abroiler 0agrowth 0aguanidinoacetic acid 0aphosphocreatine1 aBraun, U1 aDilger, R N1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2538-28450 tPoultry science.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 97, no. 3 p.890-900dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex3783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010600168300001300274520195400287592002802241650002602269650002002295650001602315650002102331650001202352650001102364650002002375650002102395650001702416650002102433650001302454650001402467650001202481650001402493650001802507650001302525651001202538653002502550653000802575653002602583653002602609653004202635653003102677700001802708700001402726700002202740773009602762856008502858852000902943655001202952IND60630946320221122031851.0200106e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063094632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qingchun10aEvaluation of a small molecule compound 3-indolylacetonitrile for control of bacterial spot on tomato  ap. 7-12.  aBacterial spot, caused by Xanthomonas perforans, is one of the major diseases in fresh market tomato production in Florida. It is reported that X. perforans has developed resistance to copper, an element of major bactericides used for management of this disease in Florida and worldwide. Continuous efforts are necessary for providing the tomato industry with new effective approaches to managing this important disease. A small molecule 3-indolylacetonitrile (IAN) that can inhibit biofilm formation has been reported to be effective against many medical bacterial pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of IAN in planta for the control of bacterial leaf spot on tomato, the effectiveness of IAN when applied at different times from pathogen inoculation, how IAN efficacy compared to a copper bactericide (Kocide 3000), and if IAN could be applied as a tank mixture with copper bactericide. In vitro testing in liquid media was also completed to further investigate observations made in planta. Our results showed that IAN was effective in reducing disease severity of bacterial leaf spot on tomato between 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml. However, phytotoxicity to tomato plants occurred when the concentration was higher than 1.0 mg/ml. IAN significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the disease when it was foliar applied during the period from 3 days prior to inoculation to 1 day after inoculation. When IAN was applied in combination with a copper bactericide Kocide 3000, additive effect was observed in reducing both disease severity and bacterial growth, compared to either IAN or copper alone, for both copper-sensitive and copper-resistant X. perforans strains. Results from this study indicated that IAN significantly reduced bacterial leaf spot on tomato and enhanced the efficacy of copper against X. perforans. Specifically, IAN significantly improved the control of bacterial leaf spot caused by a copper-resistant X. perforans strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXanthomonas perforans 3aadditive effect 3aantibiotics 3abacterial growth 3abiofilm 3acopper 3acrop production 3adisease severity 3afresh market 3ain vitro studies 3aindustry 3aleaf spot 3aliquids 3apathogens 3aphytotoxicity 3atomatoes 3aFlorida 0a3-Indolylactonitrile 0aIAN 0aXanthomonas perforans 0aTomato bacterial spot 0aBiofilm-formation inhibiting compound 0aIntegrated pest management1 aZhang, Shouan1 aHuang, Yi1 aJones, Jeffrey B.0 tCrop protection.g2019 June, v. 120 p.7-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245010600185300001800291520146400309592002801773650002101801650001601822650001401838650002001852650001001872650001601882650001201898650001201910650001801922650001801940650001401958650005601972650005302028650004202081650003902123650002402162650006102186700001702247700001202264700001502276700001902291700001702310773011502327856004802442852000902490655001202499IND4473048620221123010725.0130325e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447304862DNAL7 a221597362pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3752-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tengjiao,10aCombinatorial modulation of galP and glk gene expression for improved alternative glucose utilization  ap. 2455-2462.  aPhosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is an important precursor for anaerobic production of succinate and malate. Although inactivating PEP/carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTS) could increase PEP supply, the resulting strain had a low glucose utilization rate. In order to improve anaerobic glucose utilization rate for efficient production of succinate and malate, combinatorial modulation of galactose permease (galP) and glucokinase (glk) gene expression was carried out in chromosome of an Escherichia coli strain with inactivated PTS. Libraries of artificial regulatory parts, including promoter and messenger RNA stabilizing region (mRS), were firstly constructed in front of β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) in E. coli chromosome through λ-Red recombination. Most regulatory parts selected from mRS library had constitutive strengths under different cultivation conditions. A convenient one-step recombination method was then used to modulate galP and glk gene expression with different regulatory parts. Glucose utilization rates of strains modulated with either galP or glk all increased, and the rates had a positive relation with expression strength of both genes. Combinatorial modulation had a synergistic effect on glucose utilization rate. The highest rate (1.64 g/L h) was tenfold higher than PTS⁻ strain and 39% higher than the wild-type E. coli. These modulated strains could be used for efficient anaerobic production of succinate and malate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3achromosomes 3agalactose 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucokinase 3aglucose 3amalates 3amessenger RNA 3asuccinic acid 3asynergism 2aEscherichia colixenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGlucokinasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aMonosaccharide Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aTang, Jinlei1 aLiu, Yi1 aZhu, Xinna1 aZhang, Tongcun1 aZhang, Xueli0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Mar., v. 93, no. 6 p.2455-2462dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3752-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010900153300001800262520152300280592002801803650002901831650001601860650001201876650002801888650001401916650001801930650001801948650001501966650001401981650000901995650001302004650002102017700001602038700001802054700001802072700001602090700001602106700002002122700001902142773013102161856007402292852000902366655001202375IND60671305820221120074246.0191002e20190924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067130582DNAL7 a10.1039/c9bm00862d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Baoe10aSelf-adjusting antibacterial properties of Ag-incorporated nanotubes on micro-nanostructured Ti surfaces  ap. 4075-4087.  aTitanium (Ti) is a widely used implant material in clinics; however, failures still frequently occur due to its bioinertness and poor antibacterial capability. Post-implant infections most likely occur within the first two weeks. Thereafter, the host immune system lowers the infection risk, and biosafety becomes the first consideration. Therefore, endowing biomedical Ti with a time-dependent bactericidal effect is of considerable interest. In this study, Ag nanoparticles (NPs) as the antibacterial agent were incorporated deeply into TiO₂ nanotubes prepared on the sandblasted and etched (SLA) Ti surface. The incorporated Ag NPs were verified to automatically transform from a free state to an immobilized state, rendering the constructed platform exhibit a self-adjusting antibacterial effect. It showed strong “release bactericidal” activity in the early phase that gradually changed to the “contact bactericidal” ability. Such a smart alteration could satisfy the varied antibacterial requirements in different periods after biomaterial implantation. Moreover, the nanotubular structure could accelerate apatite formation and improve cell adhesion and proliferation when compared with those of commercially used SLA implants. Based on these results, it can be concluded that Ag-NP-incorporated micro-nanostructured Ti has worthwhile biological and time-dependent antibacterial properties, and it can have promising applications in orthopedics, dentistry, and fabrication of other biomedical devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aapatite 3abiocompatible materials 3abiosafety 3acell adhesion 3aimmune system 3ananosilver 3ananotubes 3arisk 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide1 aMa, Jianwei1 aWang, Donghui1 aLiu, Xuanyong1 aLi, Haipeng1 aZhou, Linxi1 aLiang, Chunyong1 aWang, Hongshui0 tBiomaterials science.g2019 Sept. 24, v. 7, no. 10 p.4075-4087dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9bm00862d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012200175300001600297520158500313592002801898650001601926650001601942650001201958650001301970650001201983650001501995650001402010650003302024650001202057650001302069650001502082650001102097650001402108650001202122650002002134650001302154650002002167650001002187650001502197650001802212650001402230650001302244650001002257650002602267650001502293650001702308651001102325653001802336653003002354653001902384653002802403653002502431653002202456700002102478773010602499856008702605852000902692655001202701IND60536174420221118231823.0190410e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053617442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerasino, Leonardo10aAllocation of five macroelements and quality of fuels derived from Norway spruce wood obtained by thinning operations  ap. 553-556.  aThe use of forest biomass for energy production is growing in Europe and biomass energy plants market is constantly increasing. However, there is the need to define the environmental sustainability issues dealing with the emerging renewable energy scenario. In particular, the polluting emissions (i.e. PMx, NOx and ozone) caused by the biomass combustion heavily impact on the air quality. In this context, the elemental characterization of the wood and the element allocation in the different tree organs, can provide important information about the quality of the derived wood fuels and give hints about the choice of the most appropriate combustion technique and/or the right wood fuel for a given combustion technique. Moreover, since elements have different concentrations in the different plant tissues, the preventive knowledge of the elements allocation can lead to the identification of the best harvesting strategy aimed at producing wood fuel with the lowest possible ash forming elements and environmental impact.This work focuses on the allocation in three tree compartments (foliage, branches and stem) of five important macroelements (K, Mg, Ca, N and P) in Norway spruce (Picea abies), and points out the possible effects of different harvesting strategies and tree age on the quality of the wood fuels. Results suggest that the Stem Only Harvesting is preferable to Whole Tree Harvesting system in terms of prevention of mineral content loss, as well as is preferable to avoid forest biomass from young trees because of the poorer fuel quality of the wood chips.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aair quality 3abiomass 3abranches 3acalcium 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aforests 3afuelwood 3aharvesting 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amarkets 3amineral content 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3aozone 3aphosphorus 3aplant tissues 3apotassium 3atree age 3atrees 3awhole tree harvesting 3awood chips 3awood quality 3aEurope 0aWood minerals 0aEcological sustainability 0aSoil fertility 0aTree harvesting systems 0aTree mass allocation 0aFuel chip quality1 aLa Porta, Nicola0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2014 Nov., v. 70 p.553-556dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245009400162300001600256500001500272520120400287650001501491650001901506650001801525650000901543650001701552650001301569650001801582650002001600651001001620653003701630653001701667700001401684700001501698700001801713773008301731852000901814930003301823945002501856946001301881655001201894IND4437258320221118162757.0100521e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443725832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhang, Weihua10aEffect of coexisting lead and phenanthrene on their individual sorption on a clayish soil  ap. 322-337.  a2019-12-04  aThe potential interactive influences between lead (Pb) and phenanthrene commonly coexisting in waste sites were studied by batch sorption experiments on a clayish soil. The results showed that the Pb sorption depends upon the phenanthrene loading: a low loading of the coexisting phenanthrene slightly suppresses the Pb sorption, but a sufficiently high loading substantially enhances the Pb sorption. These contrary phenomena could be ascribed to the different cation-π bond involved with phenanthrene under its different loading. Phenanthrene under low loadings is sorbed mainly via the cation-π bond with cations accumulated on the soil surface, and thus reduces the availability of these cations for ion exchange with Pb2+ in solution. Nevertheless, phenanthrene with a sufficiently high loading is sorbed mainly via hydrophobic forces, and the sorbed phenanthrene can enhance Pb2+ sorption via cation-π bond with Pb2+ in solution. In addition, the coexisting Pb(NO3)2 solution was also found able to enhance phenanthrene sorption, likely due to the decrease in pH of the soil matrix and the similar cation-π bond between sorbed Pb2+ on the soil surface and phenanthrene in solution as well. 3aclay soils 3asoil pollution 3aphenanthrenes 3alead 3aheavy metals 3asorption 3aion transport 3asoil properties 3aChina 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aphenanthrene1 aCao, Jian1 aHuang, Hao1 aZhang, Renduo0 tJournal of soil contamination.g2010 , v. 19, no. 3 p.322-337x1058-83377nnas  aDNAL  a20100526b20100605c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/05/26  aOther US 7aarticle03142naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011200182300001600294520124900310650001601559650001901575650000801594650002101602650001301623650001601636650002801652650001301680650002801693650001401721650001401735650001001749650000901759650001101768650001501779650001101794650003801805650002101843650003601864650003901900650002901939650003601968650004202004650004502046650001402091651001002105653001502115653001602130653002002146700001802166700001502184700001602199700001702215773013402232852000902366856008502375930003302460946001102493655001202504IND4430999120221118163315.0100108e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443099912DNAL7 a192243842pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0761-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonetta, Sa. 10aAssessment of microbiological indoor air quality in an Italian office building equipped with an HVAC system  ap. 473-483.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the level and composition of bacteria and fungi in the indoor air of an Italian office building equipped with a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Airborne bacteria and fungi were collected in three open-space offices during different seasons. The microbial levels in the outdoor air, supply air diffusers, fan coil air flow and air treatment unit humidification water tank were used to evaluate the influence of the HVAC system on indoor air quality (IAQ). A medium-low level of bacterial contamination (50-500 CFU/m³) was found in indoor air. Staphylococcus and Micrococcus were the most commonly found genera, probably due to human presence. A high fungal concentration was measured due to a flood that occurred during the winter. The indoor seasonal distribution of fungal genera was related to the fungal outdoor distribution. Significant seasonal and daily variation in airborne microorganisms was found, underlining a relationship with the frequency of HVAC system switching on/off. The results of this monitoring highlight the role of the HVAC system on IAQ and could be useful to better characterise bacterial and fungal population in the indoor air of office buildings. 3aMicrococcus 3aStaphylococcus 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aair flow 3aair quality 3aairborne microorganisms 3abacteria 3abacterial contamination 3abuildings 3adiffusers 3afungi 3aheat 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3awinter 2aAir Conditioningxadverse effects 2aAir Microbiology 2aAir Pollution, Indoorxanalysis 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFungixisolation & purification 2aMicrococcusxisolation & purification 2aStaphylococcusxisolation & purification 2aWorkplace 0aItaly 0aIndoor air 0aHVAC system 0aOffice building1 aBonetta, Si. 1 aMosso, S. 1 aSampò, S. 1 aCarraro, E. 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Feb., v. 161, no. 1-4 p.473-483dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0761-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02468naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245005400182300001600236520105300252650001901305650002901324650002001353650002201373650001501395650001601410650001101426650001801437650001501455650002901470650001401499650002301513650002201536650004101558651001801599651001201617651001201629651001101641651002001652651001201672653001801684773013401702852000901836856008501845930003301930946001101963655001201974IND4430998220221118163402.0100108e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443099822DNAL7 a192258992pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0753-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiemi, Jorma 10aWater quality of arctic rivers in Finnish Lapland  ap. 359-368.  aThe water quality monitoring data of eight rivers situated in the Finnish Lapland above the Arctic Circle were investigated.

They are part of the European river monitoring network that includes some 3,400 river sites. The water quality monitoring datasets available varied between the rivers, the longest comprising the period 1975-2003 and the shortest 1989-2003. For each river, annual medians of eight water quality variables were calculated. In addition, medians and fifth and 95th percentiles were calculated for the whole observation periods. The medians indicated good river water quality in comparison to other national or foreign rivers. However, the river water quality oscillated widely. Some rivers were in practice in pristine state, whereas some showed slight human impacts, e.g., occasional high values of hygienic indicator bacteria. 3aEuropean Union 3aanthropogenic activities 3adata collection 3aindicator species 3amonitoring 3ariver water 3arivers 3awater quality 3awatersheds 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeography 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aArctic region 3aFinland 3aLapland 3aNorway 0aArctic regions. 0aFinland 0aArctic rivers0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Feb., v. 161, no. 1-4 p.359-368dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0753-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01630naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017300126300001600299520077300315650001701088650003001105650001501135650002101150650001901171700001901190773006501209852000901274930003301283945001301316946001101329655001201340IND2061950820221118162911.0980219s1995    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206195082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḢasan, S.10aSusceptibility of the Australian native, Heliotropium crispatum, to the rust fungus Uromyces heliotropii introduced to control common heliotrope, Heliotropium europaeum  ap. 165-174.  aDuring host-specificity tests of the rust Uromyces heliotropii carried out in Europe against a range of cultivated and wild plants, two species of European heliotropes closely related to the summer annual weed, common heliotrope (Heliotropium europaeum) one native to Australia, H. crispatum, were found to be susceptible.

It has a distribution that spans several distinct drainage basins and biogeographical regions  within semiarid and arid inland Australia. Here we report a study designed to investigate patterns of genetic variation  within the species and hypotheses put forward to account for its extensive distribution using DNA sequences  from the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene region. Results of phylogenetic analyses contradicted previous allozyme data  and revealed relatively deep phylogenetic structure in the form of three geographically correlated clades. The degree  of genetic divergences between clades (8–15 bp) contrasted with the relatively limited haplotype diversity within  clades (1–3 bp). Network-based analyses confirmed these results and revealed genetic structure on both larger and  more restricted geographical scales. Nevertheless some haplotypes and 1-step clades had large distributions, some  of which crossed boundaries between river basins and aquatic biogeographical regions. Thus both older and more  recent historical processes, including fragmentation on a larger geographical scale and more recent range expansion  on a local scale, appear to be responsible for the observed pattern of genetic variation within C. destructor. These  results support elements of alternative hypotheses previously put forward to account for the evolutionary history of  C. destructor  and the origin of its large distribution. 3aCherax destructor 3aDNA 3aallozymes 3afreshwater crayfish 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aribosomal RNA 3awatersheds 3aAustralia1 aAustin, C.

The obtained multi-proxy record, including subfossil diatoms, diatom-inferred variables (index of trophic state, halobic index, TP, and pH), plant macrofossils, and geochemical data, was compared with the δ¹⁸O GISP2 curve. Diatom accumulation zones and subzones established on the basis of a ConSLink cluster analysis corresponded well with the boundaries of the Bölling, Older Dryas, Alleröd, Younger Dryas, and Preboreal periods. The diatom-inferred trophic state and salinity data showed increased values during the colder epochs, which were supported by the findings of low-temperature macrofossil indicators in the corresponding samples. The results of this study document a long-term forcing of a shallow lacustrine ecosystem in central Europe by climatic events of a global scale. 3asediments 3alakes 3asalinity 3acluster analysis 3aaquatic environment 3apH 3aecosystems 3aBacillariophyta 3aCzech Republic 0aDryas1 aŠafránková, Jitka1 aPouzar, Miloslav1 aNovák, Jan1 aNováková, Kateřina0 tHydrobiologia.g2009 Sept., v. 631, no. 1 p.107-120dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9804-y 7aarticle02805naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245007000171300001600241500011700257520137600374650001701750650001301767650002201780650001401802650001301816650001401829650001901843650001301862650002601875650001601901650001501917650001301932650001101945650001801956650001101974650002401985650001302009650001602022650001002038651001002048700001402058700001402072700001602086773014502102856005502247852000902302655001202311IND60616577820221118163420.0181018e20180830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061657782DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1208.292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Q.

The cultivars best suited to greenhouse production are 'Red Lamp', 'Tieton', 'Summit', 'Van', 'Lapins', and 'Santina'. The earliest cultivar is 'Red Lamp' with 45 days from flowering to harvest. October 20-25th was the optimum time for covering greenhouses with thick, light blocking material to induce dormancy and meet the chill requirement of the trees. Depending on the weather conditions, December 10-20th was the usual time for trees to break dormancy. For reliable cropping, three stages for temperature and humidity management were identified: 5-18°C, 70-80% at budding, 17-19°C, 50-60% at flowering, 22-25°C, 50- 60% during fruit development. Humidity control was necessary during fruit ripening to avoid fruit cracking. The yield ranged from 6000 to 7500 kg ha-1. High quality fruit was harvested from the middle of March to the end of April during a time when there are no local or imported fresh cherries available. Consequently market prices were exceptionally high. Gross margin analysis indicated net returns (income - direct costs) to be as high as 975,000 Yuan ha-1. Early sweet cherry production in northern China has the potential to generate high economic returns for producers, strengthen the local economy and meet consumer demands. 3aPrunus avium 3acherries 3acosts and returns 3acultivars 3adormancy 3aflowering 3afruit cracking 3afruiting 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3aharvesting 3ahumidity 3aincome 3amarket prices 3amodels 3aprofits and margins 3aripening 3atemperature 3atrees 3aChina1 aGu, D.

Using full-spectrum spectrometry and  transmission electron microscopy, we compared the colour and morphology of rump feathers of male and female eastern  bluebirds (  Sialia sialis  ). The ultraviolet (UV)-blue feather colour in this species is caused by coherent scattering  of light within the medullary ‘spongy layer’ of feather barbs. This spongy layer lies beneath a keratin cortex and on  top of a layer of melanin granules that surround a hollow central vacuole. Irregularly shaped electron-dense regions  are present within the cortex. Male and female  S. sialis  differed substantially in their plumage colour and feather  structure. A backwards logistic regression predicted sex with 100% accuracy using the colour variables brightness,  UV-violet (UV-V) chroma and spectral saturation. A second backwards logistical regression predicted sex with 100%  accuracy using relative cortex area and size of air spaces. Thus,  S. sialis  are dimorphic both in colour and in the  structures causing this colour. Multiple regression analyses using data pooled from both sexes indicated that multiple  features of feather barb structure contributed to colour variation in complex ways. Brightness was negatively  related to the relative surface area of cortex in barb cross-sections. Hue was positively related and UV-V chroma was  negatively related to the distance between scattering elements (i.e. keratin rods and air spaces) in the spongy layer.  In contrast, hue was negatively related and UV-V chroma was positively related to the thickness of the spongy layer.  UV-V chroma was also negatively related to the relative area of electron-dense regions in the cortex. Spectral saturation  was negatively related to the distance between scatterers and the standard error of the size of air spaces.  These results suggest that the dimensions of spongy-layer elements are critical to colour production, but that UVblue  coloration can also be modified by the cortex and the thickness of the spongy layer. 3aSialia sialis 3aair 3abirds 3acolor 3acortex 3aevolution 3afeathers 3afemales 3agranules 3akeratin 3amales 3amelanin 3aregression analysis 3arump 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avacuoles1 aEstes, Anne M.1 aSiefferman, Lynn1 aHill, Geoffrey E.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2005 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.259-271dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00428.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245012600168300001600294500011700310520100400427650003001431650002201461650001101483650001401494650001501508650001001523650001401533650001201547650001401559650001801573650000801591700001601599700001401615700001401629700001301643700001201656700001301668700001401681773014501695856005501840852000901895655001201904IND60616576620221118163535.0181018e20180830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061657662DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1208.262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Q.

Some factors which affected the result of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of C. sinensis were studied on the basis of GUS transient expression system. The optimum system of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was that the cotyledon callus were pre-cultured for 3 d, and then infected for 15 min by EHA105 followed by 3 d co-culture in the dark on the YEB medium containing 150 μmol L-1 AS. The transient expression rate of GUS gene was 62.6%. An appropriate time of delayed selective culture could improve the conversion rate of the tea callus. After delaying the selective culture for 3 d, infected callus were transferred into the differentiation medium and the root induction medium, both of which were supplemented with 100 mg L-1 Spectinomycin, in the end resistant seedlings of C. sinensis were obtained. The conversion rate was about 3.6%. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aCamellia sinensis 3acallus 3acoculture 3acotyledons 3agenes 3areceptors 3arooting 3aseedlings 3aspectinomycin 3atea1 aChen, C.

The inclusion of the tested oils was 50 g kg⁻¹ (42% total crude lipids in diets). No significant differences were noted in the fish growth performance. The proximate composition of the whole fish bodies and the viscera (water, protein, fat, ash) was similar in all the dietary treatments (P > 0.05). Differences were noted only with regard to the ash content of the fillets (P < 0.05). The analysis of the fatty acids profiles of tench (whole fish) indicated there were significant differences in the total content of monoenoic and polyenoic (PUFA) acids. Significant differences were also noted with regard to n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA. Consequently, the ratio of n-3/n-6 acids ranged from 1.6 (group PO) to 2.08 (group LO; P < 0.05). The feed applied was not confirmed to have had an impact on the fatty acids profile of the tench fillets. There was a statistically significant intergroup difference in the content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in tench viscera. In the fish fed vegetable oils supplemented diets, the level of SFA was lower (P < 0.05). 3aTinca tinca 3aanimal growth 3aanimal organs 3aash content 3abody composition 3adietary fat 3adietary supplements 3afatty acid composition 3afillets 3afish 3afish oils 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3alinseed oil 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apeanut oil 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aproximate composition 3arapeseed oil 3asaturated fatty acids 3avegetable oil 0aGrowth performance 0aNutrients retention1 aJankowska, Barbara 1 aJarmołowicz, Sylwia 1 aŻmijewski, Tomasz 1 aPartyka, Konrad 1 aDemska-Zakęś, Krystyna 0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2010 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.389-401dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-009-9146-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03355naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010800165300001600273520194400289650002402233650001902257650002002276650001602296650002602312650001602338650001602354650001102370650002002381650001402401650001002415650001502425650000902440653001702449653001802466653001402484653003802498653001902536700002602555700002202581700002002603773011202623852000902735856008502744930003302829946001102862655001202873IND4446806420221118163006.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444680642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-010-9391-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkarpaas, Olav 10aAre the best dispersers the best colonizers? Seed mass, dispersal and establishment in Carduus thistles  ap. 155-169.  aNegative correlations between dispersal and establishment are often reported in the plant literature; smaller seeds tend to disperse better but germinate less well, and produce smaller seedlings. However, because dispersal capacity is often quantified using proxies, such as the settling velocity of wind-dispersed seeds, little is known about the exact shape of this negative relationship, and how it is modified by other plant traits and environmental conditions. We studied the dispersal-establishment relationship in two wind-dispersed thistles (Carduus nutans and Carduus acanthoides). We applied a mechanistic wind dispersal model (WALD) to seeds released under a range of environmental conditions, and tested germination and seedling growth under standardized conditions in a greenhouse. Dispersal distance and establishment (germination and seedling growth) were not significantly correlated, although in both species smaller seeds dispersed farther, and showed lower germination and lower seedling growth rates. This apparent paradox can partly be explained by the significant influence of other factors such as release height and environment (wind and vegetation), which explained more variation in dispersal than did terminal velocity. Another potential explanation is the variation in seed traits: germination is strongly positively related to seed mass, weakly positively related to plume loading, but not significantly related to terminal velocity. This weakening of the correlation with germination is due to additional layers of trait (co)variability: for instance, seed mass and pappus size are positively correlated, and thus big seeds partially compensate for the negative effect of seed mass with larger pappi. Our mechanistic approach can thus lead to a better understanding of both potentially opposing selection pressures on traits like seed mass, and diluting effects of other seed, plant and environmental factors. 3aCarduus acanthoides 3aCarduus nutans 3aadverse effects 3acorrelation 3aenvironmental factors 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3amodels 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3avegetation 3awind 0aColonization 0aEstablishment 0aSeed mass 0aDispersal-establishment trade-off 0aWind dispersal1 aSilverman, Edward J. 1 aJongejans, Eelke 1 aShea, Katriona 0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2011 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.155-169dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-010-9391-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02501naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010100163300001600264520108100280650001201361650001301373650001201386650001201398650001201410650001201422650001101434650000901445650001601454650001401470650002001484650001401504650001301518650001201531650001801543650002001561651001301581653002501594653001101619653002201630700001901652700002201671700002001693700002301713773010901736852000901845856008501854930003301939946001101972655001201983IND4440378120221118163013.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444037812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0327-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajor, Julie 10aMaize yield and nutrition during 4 years after biochar application to a Colombian savanna oxisol  ap. 117-128.  aThe application of biochar (biomass-derived black carbon) to soil has been shown to improve crop yields, but the reasons for this are often not clearly demonstrated. Here, we studied the effect of a single application of 0, 8 and 20 t ha⁻¹ of biochar to a Colombian savanna Oxisol for 4 years (2003-2006), under a maize-soybean rotation. Soil sampling to 30 cm was carried out after maize harvest in all years but 2005, maize tissue samples were collected and crop biomass was measured at harvest. Maize grain yield did not significantly increase in the first year, but increases in the 20 t ha⁻¹ plots over the control were 28, 30 and 140% for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The availability of nutrients such as Ca and Mg was greater with biochar, and crop tissue analyses showed that Ca and Mg were limiting in this system. Soil pH increased, and exchangeable acidity showed a decreasing trend with biochar application. We attribute the greater crop yield and nutrient uptake primarily to the 77-320% greater available Ca and Mg in soil where biochar was applied. 3aOxisols 3aZea mays 3aacidity 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acorn 3agrain yield 3amagnesium 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3asavannas 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling 3atissue analysis 3aColombia 0aExchangeable acidity 0aOxisol 0aTropical savannas1 aRondon, Marco 1 aMolina F., Diego.1 aRiha, Susan J. 1 aLehmann, Johannes 0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Aug., v. 333, no. 1-2 p.117-128dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0327-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02470naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245006600189300001600255520112900271650001401400650001001414650002001424650002001444650002801464650003001492650001101522650001701533650001101550650002901561650001501590650003401605653001901639653003401658700001901692700001801711773016901729852000901898856008501907930003301992946001102025655001202036IND4442083620141219000000.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444208362DNAL7 a202174252pmid7 a10.1007/s00403-010-1044-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasperska-Zajac, A. 10aBlood rheological profiles in patients with chronic urticaria  ap. 609-612.  aPsychological factors, such as stress, anxiety, depression, as well as immuno-inflammatory processes may influence blood rheology. On the other hand, these factors may be involved in triggering, aggravating or maintenance of urticaria symptoms. The present study was designed to compare blood rheological properties of patients with chronic urticaria with positive response to autologous serum skin test (ASST) and negative response to ASST. The study comprised 15 female patients with chronic urticaria showing positive response to ASST, 14 female patients with chronic urticaria showing negative response to ASST and 15 healthy subjects. Rheological properties of erythrocytes, such as deformability and aggregation, were measured. Overall blood viscosity measurements were performed with the use of cone-plate Brookfield's viscometer, and plasma viscosity measurement employed capillary Ubbelohd's viscometer. The hemorheological parameters did not differ significantly between the groups. It seems that blood rheological properties do not alter in patients with chronic urticaria, irrespective of their response to ASST. 3aurticaria 2aAdult 2aBlood Viscosity 2aChronic Disease 2aErythrocyte Aggregation 2aErythrocyte Deformability 2aFemale 2aHemorheology 2aHumans 2aInflammationximmunology 2aSkin Tests 2aUrticariaxbloodximmunology. 0aBlood rheology 0aImmuno-inflammatory processes1 aSlowinska, L. 1 aJasinska, T. 0 tArchives of dermatological research Archiv für dermatologische Forschung.g2010 Oct., v. 302, no. 8 p.609-612dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-36967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00403-010-1044-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02302naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013700166300001400303520097200317650001601289650001501305650001501320650002401335650001601359650002601375650000701401650001901408650001201427650002201439653001201461653001301473653003101486700002101517700002001538700001401558700001501572700002001587773011101607852000901718856008501727930003301812946001101845655001201856IND4447262020221118163035.0110107e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444726202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-010-0937-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiu-Qing 10aOverexpression of the Arabidopsis α-expansin gene AtEXPA1 accelerates stomatal opening by decreasing the volumetric elastic modulus  ap. 27-36.  aGuard cell walls of stomata are highly specialized in plants. Previous research focused on the structure and anatomy of guard cell walls, but little is known about guard cell regulation during stomata movement. In this work, we investigate the possible biological role of the Arabidopsis expansin gene AtEXPA1 in stomatal opening. The AtEXPA1 promoter drove the expression of the GUS reporter gene specifically in guard cells. Light-induced stomatal opening was accelerated in 35S::AtEXPA1 lines, whereas the anti-AtEXPA1 antibody decelerated light-induced stomatal opening. The inhibition of the anti-AtEXPA1 antibody on stomatal opening was largely dependent on the environmental pH. The volumetric elastic modulus (ε) was measured as an indicator of changes in the cell wall. The ε value of guard cells in 35S::AtEXPA1 lines was smaller than in the wild types. The putative role of AtEXPA1 as controller of stomatal opening rate and its regulation are discussed. 3aArabidopsis 3aantibodies 3acell walls 3agene overexpression 3aguard cells 3amodulus of elasticity 3apH 3areporter genes 3astomata 3astomatal movement 0aAtEXPA1 0aExpansin 0aVolumetric elastic modulus1 aWei, Peng-Cheng 1 aXiong, Yan-Mei 1 aYang, Yi 1 aChen, Jia 1 aWang, Xue-Chen 0 tPlant cell reports.g2011 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.27-36dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-010-0937-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20110108b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01993naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099024003400116040001800150100002300168245010500191300001400296520072300310650001601033650001201049650001201061650002301073650001101096650001901107650002901126650002101155650001301176650003901189653002301228700002201251700002201273700002101295700002201316773006401338852000901402856008401411939003301495945000801528990002301536655001201559991633523250742620221118163001.0780901e197802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894831182DNAL7 a6244432pmid7 a10.2337/diabetes.27.2.782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoxley, Richard T.10aLoss of insulin response to ingested amino acids after jejunoileal bypass surgery for morbid obesity  ap. 78-84.  aExtract: Preoperatively a 30 gm. mixture of amino acids given orally evoked a larger peak insulin response than an intravenous load yielding comparable plasma amino acid elevations.

Observers were secondary school students aged 7-17 years and adults. Two types of stimuli were used: fragmented line drawing of common objects and discs with deleted sectors which represented illusory Kanizsa contours, when discs were in particular positions. In experiments with fragmented images, we found an improvement in image recognition with observer's age, increasing up to 13-14 years. The probability of recognition of fragmented line drawings increased significantly with decreasing stimulus size for children aged 7-12 years, indicating that size invariance at recognition for fragmented line drawings was absent in these children. However, size invariance was found for observers aged 7-12 years and for adults in this task. Upon the Kanizsa illusion appearance, the ratio of the separation between discs and disc diameter was smaller when we used larger disc diameters. This ratio increased with increasing age of observers. The obtained results provide evidence for the absence of size invariance when perceiving the Kanizsa illusion under our experimental conditions. 3aontogeny 0aKanizsa illusion 0asize invariance 0arecognition 0afragmented contours1 aSemenov, L.

Porosity variation is a result of progressive thickening of skeletal elements away from the apical tip of branches, rather than changes in the spacing of skeletal elements. A linear fit was found to describe the relationship between distance along the tip and both porosity and skeletal thickness. The slope of the line obtained may relate to branch extension rates and allow retrospective data to be obtained from Acropora specimens. Skeletal morphology examined by 2D and 3D imaging shows a progressive gradation in thickness occurring in the axial corallite wall and thickness changes at a site of incipient branch formation. The application of the micro-CT technique to museum and fossil specimens is illustrated. 3aporosity 0aAcropora 0aCT scan 0aSkeletal structure1 aAbel, R. L. 1 aJohnson, K.

In all species, PD densities and frequencies undergo alterations in topologically successive cambial walls reflecting species-specific patterns of PD degradation and PD insertion during cell development. Longitudinal PD fission is responsible for an abrupt increment of PD numbers in specific walls of the youngest derivatives at the xylem and/or phloem side. Here, PDs seem to mediate positional signalling to control tissue fate and early cell determination. PD numbers at all cambial interfaces of A. thaliana correspond to those of the herbaceous tomato, but are higher with the woody poplar. This suggests a positive correlation between PD frequencies and the rapidity of cell division activity. Photoactivated green fluorescent protein (26 kDa) did not diffuse through cambial PDs of A. thaliana. This is in keeping with the common size exclusion limit (SEL) of 8-10 kDa observed for PDs at the youngest interfaces of tomato and poplar which may mediate diffusive exchange of developmental signals of equal molecular size. The regular growth patterns in internodal cambial zones of poplar and tomato result from synchronized cell division activity of neighbouring initials. A. thaliana hypocotyls have an irregular mode of secondary growth. Here, signalling through PDs in misaligned radial walls between non-homologous derivatives may control tissue development. The observed organizational differences between the cambia cast doubts on the suitability of A. thaliana as a model plant for cambial research. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPopulus nigra 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acambium 3acell division 3aelectron microscopy 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahypocotyls 3ainternodes 3amolecular weight 3aphloem 3atomatoes 3axylem 0aCambial zone 0aDetermination 0aDifferentiation 0aGrowth patterns 0aPlasmodesmal fission 0aPositional signalling1 avan Bel, Aart Jan Eeuwe 1 aEhlers, Katrin 0 tProtoplasma.g2011 Jan., v. 248, no. 1 p.141-151dVienna : Springer Viennax0033-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-010-0208-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20110128b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03101naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245010500175300001600280520175900296650001602055650001202071650001102083650001602094650001702110650001002127650001202137650001102149650001302160650001102173650001002184650001402194650001402208650001302222650002202235650001102257650001902268650001102287700002402298700002202322700001802344700002402362773018102386856005502567852000902622655001202631IND60616574720221118163224.0181018s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061657472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00539.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolleman, Freerk10aIs male puddling behaviour of tropical butterflies targeted at sodium for nuptial gifts or activity?  ap. 345-361.  aLepidoptera relates to puddling on mud, dung and carrion. In most butterfly species, puddling is exclusively a male behaviour. A possible explanation for this division in feeding behaviour is that nutrients derived from puddling are transferred to the female in the spermatophore during mating as a nuptial gift. Sodium derived from puddling has been shown to act as a nuptial gift in a few Lepidoptera species. It can also be used for neuromuscular activity in both males and females and may therefore correlate with flight morphology. In this study, we examine the generality of these two hypotheses in comparative work on a community of African fruit-feeding butterflies. We investigated puddling behaviour of males and females on carrion and dung together with sodium preferences, polyandry, relative wing-size, sexual size dimorphism and sodium concentrations in the bodies and spermatophores of several species. The results show that sodium as a nuptial gift can explain the sexual division in puddling in some species, but not in all. Species in which both sexes puddle transfer little sodium in the nuptial gift, which is consistent with the nuptial gift theory. Wing loading and puddling are not significantly correlated, but the trend followed the direction predicted by the activity hypothesis. However, the sodium concentration in the species with the smallest wing area to thoracic volume (WA/TV) ratio (the largest Charaxes spp.), was relatively low. Moreover, in all investigated species, the sodium concentration was higher in the abdomen than in the thorax. The results are discussed in the light of differences between the sexes in foraging behaviour in both larvae and adults, and with respect to alternative explanations for puddling. 3aLepidoptera 3aabdomen 3aadults 3abutterflies 3adead animals 3afeces 3afemales 3aflight 3aforaging 3alarvae 3amales 3anutrients 3apolyandry 3apuddling 3asexual dimorphism 3asodium 3aspermatophores 3athorax1 aGrunsven, Roy H.

The impact of injury on reproduction has been explored in some detail in lizards and salamanders, which have  tails that are adapted for fat storage but are also injured or lost during predatory and social encounters. We synthesize  diverse insights from these studies and propose new hypotheses using graphical models which highlight  three distinct, hierarchical effects of injury on reproduction: reproductive inhibition, reduction in propagule number  and diminished per-propagule investment (PPI), a maternal effect. Previous studies, which involved experimentally  amputating the whole tail, have provided evidence of the first two effects, although there is little evidence of reduced  PPI. We assayed these effects in free-ranging  Desmognathus  salamanders exhibiting naturally occurring injury.  Whereas earlier studies found that tail injury prohibits reproduction (precipitating functional conflict), we found  that females missing 80% of their tails, including the smallest mature individuals, still reproduce. We also detected  a negative correlation between magnitude of injury and PPI, a continuous maternal effect. Continuous (graded)  effects of injury on PPI have not been reported previously; neither discrete nor continuous maternal effects due to  injury have been previously demonstrated in free-ranging vertebrates. The dearth of evidence for such effects may  be due to the design of experimental manipulations that use all-or-nothing treatments. Future studies employing  quantitative field data, or more realistic experimental treatments that mimic the continuous distribution of injury  are likely to detect maternal effects arising from nonlethal injury. Although our comparative and empirical findings  derive from studies of lizards and salamanders, we discuss how they apply in principle to all metazoans. Studies of  these effects in nonvertebrate model systems are sorely needed. 3aDesmognathus 3afemales 3alizards 3amaternal effect 3amodels 3areproduction 3asalamanders and newts 3atail1 aAgosta, Salvatore J.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2005 Nov., v. 86, no. 3 p.309-331dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00532.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003500145245011700180300001600297500002400313520176700337650001602104650002202120650002502142650001802167650001102185650002202196650002302218650001002241650001202251650001102263650005202274650002202326653001802348653000802366653001202374653002302386653001902409653001102428653003002439700002302469700002302492700002502515773011602540852000902656856004802665655001202713IND4449652820221118162643.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444965282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-010-9433-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBheema Lingeswara Reddy, I.

Gaertn)  ap. 315-328.  aIncludes references  aResistance gene homologues were isolated from finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.) using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to the conserved regions of the nucleotide binding site (NBS) of previously cloned plant disease resistance genes (R-genes) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the eleven primer combinations tested, only five showed amplification of resistance gene homologues in finger millet. BLAST search of cloned finger millet DNA fragments showed strong homology to NBS-LRR-type R-genes of other crop species. Of the 107 clones sequenced, 41 showed homology to known R-genes, and are denoted as EcRGHs (Eleusine coracana resistance gene homologues), while 11 showed homology to pollen signalling proteins (PSiPs), and are denoted as EcPSiPs (Eleusine coracana pollen signalling proteins). The cloned EcRGH sequences were classified into four clusters, and EcPSiPs formed two separate clusters based on sequence homology at the amino acid level. The amino acid sequences of the cloned EcRGHs showed characteristic features of non-TIR-type R-genes, which have been identified in all the monocot species studied so far. Six EcRGHs-specific primers were designed based on the sequences obtained in finger millet; reverse transcription PCR was performed on the cDNA and revealed the expression of EcRGHs in finger millet. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution (dN/dS) in the NBS domains of finger millet RGHs varied from 0.3 to 0.7 for the different classes, which suggests a purifying selection, though the LRR region also needs to be considered to make predictions. This is the first report on RGHs in finger millet, which will serve as a valuable resource for finger millet improvement using molecular tools. 3aDNA primers 3aEleusine coracana 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3amillets 3apollen 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 0aFinger millet 0aRGH 0aNBS-LRR 0aDegenerate primers 0aCandidate gene 0aR-gene 0aPollen signaling proteins1 aSrinivas Reddy, D.1 aLakshmi Narasu, M.1 aSivaramakrishnan, S.0 tMolecular breeding.g2011 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.315-328dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-010-9433-1 7aarticle04620naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007600129300001400205500010800219520375400327650002204081650001304103650001204116653002304128653001404151653001004165773007504175852000904250930003304259945001304292946001304305655001204318IND2042331220221118163726.0940929e199002  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204233122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwartz, R.S.10aExercise training in treatment of diabetes mellitus in elderly patients  ap. 77-85.  aIn the special issue: Diabetes mellitus in elderly people / edited by J.B. Halter and N.J. Christensen.  aThere are few data that specifically address the effects of exercise training on elderly patients with diabetes mellitus; thus, much of the information contained herein is extrapolated from studies on young and nondiabetic subjects. With acute exercise, there is a marked enhancement in glucose uptake and utilization despite a decline in plasma insulin concentration. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain this well-described but seemingly paradoxical situation, and most recently, a muscle-contraction-induced increase in membrane-associated glucose-transporter units has been described. In diabetes, there is a breakdown in the usually precise balance between glucose delivery and utilization necessary to maintain stable blood glucose concentrations during acute exercise. In hypoinsulinemic states (untreated diabetes mellitus), glucose production by the liver can be greater than muscle uptake and utilization, resulting in hyperglycemia. Conversely, in hyperinsulinemic conditions (treatment with large doses of subcutaneous insulin), glucose production can be inordinately suppressed relative to uptake and utilization, resulting in hypoglycemia. Therefore, in diabetic patients, adequate glucose control is important before initiating an exercise program. Endurance exercise training has been suggested as an adjunct to diet therapy for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. Although early studies showed improvement in insulin resistance (lower insulin levels) with endurance training, little or no benefit in glucose control was demonstrated. More recent studies have noted improvement in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations and oral glucose tolerance with endurance training. The difference between these studies may be explained by the time at which the tests were conducted relative to the last episode of exercise, because there appears to be a rapid detraining effect on glucose tolerance after short-term endurance training. Even if the effects on plasma glucose levels are limited, there are other important potential benefits of endurance training in elderly diabetic patients. Maximal and submaximal aerobic capacity both decline with age and are at least partially reversible with endurance training. Potentially even more important are the effects of endurance training on risk factors for atherosclerosis. Endurance training may improve lipid profiles by reducing very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Small reductions in blood pressure are also frequently noted with endurance training. The fall in plasma insulin concentration associated with training may by itself also reduce cardiovascular risk. Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and endurance training can be beneficial in producing and maintaining weight loss. This is especially important in the elderly because they are often fatter than their younger counterparts. Recent data suggest that endurance training preferentially reduces central and intraabdominal adiposity in the elderly. This is significant because an increased central distribution of body fat is found in elderly and NIDDM patients. I conclude that, although there is little direct evidence, extrapolated data support a potentially important role for endurance exercise training in the treatment of elderly diabetic patients. The possible benefits are not limited to improvements in insulin and glucose levels but also extend to reduction of important risk factors for atherosclerosis. By following the suggestions contained herein, many elderly diabetic patients can safely benefit from endurance training. 3adiabetes mellitus 3aexercise 3aelderly 0aliterature reviews 0atreatment 0aaging0 tDiabetes care.g1990 Feb., v. 13, no. suppl.2 p.77-85x0149-59927nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle02177naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245012700170300001400297520116500311650001901476650001201495650001401507650001101521650001601532650002501548650002101573650001001594700001601604773017901620856005501799852000901854655001201863IND60616573820221118163515.0181018e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061657382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2006.00555.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartoš, L.10aAntler size and fluctuating asymmetry in red deer (Cervus elaphus) stags and probability of becoming a harem holder in rut  ap. 59-68.  aRed deer hinds play a significant role in selecting stags for mating. We tested the hypotheses that in red deer (  Cervus  elaphus  ) the probability of becoming a harem holder (and hence achieving reproductive success) occurs in stags  bearing larger, branched antlers and showing low fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Eleven antler characteristics were  measured; absolute and relative FA were calculated on 51 cast antler sets from 19 individually recognized stags.  Probability of becoming a harem holder (PBHH) was originally analysed separately, i.e. for antler size and FA of  each antler characteristic and calculated factors for both antler size and FA. If analysed separately, large antler size  and low relative but high absolute FA increased PBHH. When we combined antler size and FA of antler characteristics  in one model using antler size and FA factors, however, PBHH and achieving reproductive success were  mainly dependent on increasing antler size and enhanced antler branching rather than on FA. We conclude that in  contrast to antler size, FA is unlikely to play any significant role in sexual selection as an indicator of individual  quality. 3aCervus elaphus 3aantlers 3abranching 3amodels 3aprobability 3areproductive success 3asexual selection 3astags1 aBahbouh, R.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2006 Jan., v. 87, no. 1 p.59-68dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2006.00555.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245015400187300001600341500002400357520109900381650001501480650001301495650002501508650002101533650001001554650001801564650001201582650001201594650001401606650001201620650002201632650001801654650001201672650001501684650003901699650001101738650001601749650002401765650003401789650001401823650004301837700002301880700002001903700001601923700002301939700001801962773010701980852000902087856008502096655001202181IND4426263120221118162530.0090918s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442626312DNAL7 a196095562pmid7 a10.1007/s00427-009-0295-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurizii, Maria G.10aVasa protein is localized in the germ cells and in the oocyte-associated pyriform follicle cells during early oogenesis in the lizard Podarcis sicula  ap. 361-367.  aIncludes references  aThe vasa gene, first identified in Drosophila, is a key determinant for germline formation in eukaryotes. Homologs of vasa have been identified and linked to germline development, in many invertebrates and vertebrates. Here, we analyze the distribution of Vasa in early germ cells (oogonia and oocytes) and previtellogenic ovarian follicles of the lizard Podarcis sicula. During most of its previtellogenic growth, the oocyte in this lizard species is structurally and functionally integrated through intercellular bridges with special follicle cells called pyriform cells. The pyriform cells function similarly to Drosophila nurse cells, but are somatic in origin. In the oogenesis of P. sicula, Vasa is initially highly detected in the oogonia, but its levels decrease in early stage oocytes before the onset of pyriform cell differentiation. In the later stages of oogenesis, the high level of Vasa is related with the nurse function of the pyriform follicle cells. These observations suggest that cells of somatic origin are engaged in the synthesis of Vasa in the oogenesis of this lizard. 3aDrosophila 3aPodarcis 3acell differentiation 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ainvertebrates 3alizards 3aoocytes 3aoogenesis 3aoogonia 3aovarian follicles 3asomatic cells 2aAnimals 2aCell Shape 2aDEAD-box RNA Helicasesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHibernation 2aLizardsxphysiology 2aOocytesxchemistryxcytology. 2aOogenesis 2aOvarian Folliclexchemistryxcytology.1 aCavaliere, Valeria1 aGamberi, Chiara1 aLasko, Paul1 aGargiulo, Giuseppe1 aTaddei, Carlo0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2009 July, v. 219, no. 7 p.361-367dSpringer-Verlagx0949-944X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-009-0295-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03133naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245015300186300001600339500002400355520164700379650002102026650002402047650002002071650001002091650001202101650001402113650002402127650001202151650002002163650003702183650004602220650004302266650002102309650002402330650004902354650004002403700002302443700002002466773010702486852000902593856008502602655001202687IND4426263220221118162536.0090918s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442626322DNAL7 a197051502pmid7 a10.1007/s00427-009-0299-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolognesi, Renata10aLoss of Tc-arrow and canonical Wnt signaling alters posterior morphology and pair-rule gene expression in the short-germ insect, Tribolium castaneum  ap. 369-375.  aIncludes references  aWnt signaling has been implicated in posterior patterning in short-germ insects, including the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Bolognesi et al. Curr Biol 18:1624-1629, 2008b; Angelini and Kaufman Dev Biol 283:409-423, 2005; Miyawaki et al. Mech Dev 121:119-130, 2004). Specifically, depletion of Wnt ligands Tc-Wnt1 and Tc-WntD/8 produces Tribolium embryos lacking abdominal segments. Similar phenotypes are produced by depletion of Tc-porcupine (Tc-porc) or Tc-pangolin (Tc-pan), indicating that the signal is transmitted through the canonical Wnt pathway (Bolognesi et al. Curr Biol 18:1624-1629, 2008b). Here we show that RNAi for the receptor Tc-arrow produced similar truncated phenotypes, providing additional evidence supporting canonical signal transduction. Furthermore, since in Tribolium segments are defined sequentially by a pair-rule gene circuit that, when interrupted, produces truncated phenotypes (Choe et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 103:6560-6564, 2006), we investigated the relationship between loss of Wnt signaling and this pair-rule gene circuit. After depletion of the receptor Tc-arrow, expression of Tc-Wnt1 was noticeably absent from the growth zone, while Tc-WntD/8 was restricted to a single spot of expression in what remained of the posterior growth zone. The primary pair-rule genes Tc-runt (Tc-run) and Tc-even-skipped (Tc-eve) were expressed normally in the anterior segments, but were reduced to a single spot in the remnants of the posterior growth zone. Thus, expression of pair-rule genes and Tc-WntD/8 are similarly affected by depletion of Wnt signal and disruption of the posterior growth zone. 3aRNA interference 3aTribolium castaneum 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainsects 3aphenotype 3asignal transduction 2aAnimals 2aBody Patterning 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aSignal Transduction 2aTriboliumxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aWnt Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aFischer, Tamara D.1 aBrown, Susan J.0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2009 July, v. 219, no. 7 p.369-375dSpringer-Verlagx0949-944X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-009-0299-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02984naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245011900188300001600307520139600323650002501719650002901744650003701773650006601810650006201876650001601938650001501954650002801969650001101997650003002008650003902038650003202077650003002109653001202139653001802151653001402169700001702183700001602200700001802216700001902234773010402253852000902357856009202366930003302458946001102491655001202502IND4441461020221118162603.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444146102DNAL7 a207187212pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0463.2010.02644.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yinghua.10aTriplex real-time PCR assay for detection and differentiation of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis  ap. 685-691.  aXu Y, Xu Y, Hou Q, Yang R, Zhang S. Triplex real-time PCR assay for detection and differentiation of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. APMIS 2010; 118: 685-91. A triplex real-time PCR assay for detection and differentiation of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis was developed. Three targets were used for amplification in a single tube: the insertion sequence IS481 and the pertussis toxin promoter region (ptxP) for B. pertussis, and the insertion sequence IS1001 for B. parapertussis. The performance of this PCR assay was evaluated in parallel in three single-target real-time PCR assays using DNA extracted from B. pertussis and B. parapertussis reference strains and nasopharyngeal swabs taken from 105 patients who had been coughing for more than 7 days. The minimum detection limit of the triplex PCR was one to five colony-forming units (CFU) of B. pertussis and 1 CFU of B. parapertussis per reaction, and the coefficients of both intra- and inter-assay variation were less than 7%. Results were available within 4 h. Of the 105 nasopharyngeal samples, seven were culture positive and 23 were PCR positive for B. pertussis. All culture-positive samples were also PCR positive. Our single-tube triplex real-time PCR assay proved to be sensitive, specific and suitable for simultaneous detection and discrimination of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. 3aBordetella pertussis 3aBordetella parapertussis 2aBordetella Infectionsxdiagnosis 2aBordetella parapertussisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBordetella pertussisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA Probes 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aHumans 2aNasopharynxxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aWhooping Coughxdiagnosis 0aTriplex 0areal-time PCR 0adiagnosis1 aXU, YUNQIANG1 aHOU, QIMING1 aYang, Rui-fu.1 aZhang, Shumin.0 tAPMIS.g2010 Sept., v. 118, no. 9 p.685-691dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0903-46417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2010.02644.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02701naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009500184300001800279500002400297520138500321650000801706650001401714650001301728650001601741650000901757650001001766650000901776650001201785650003401797650003101831650002601862650002601888700002001914700001901934700002301953700002101976700001901997700001802016700001602034773009902050852000902149856008502158655001202243IND4426252220221118162130.0090918s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442625222DNAL7 a196551702pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-009-1580-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoglia, Dominga10aTwo simple techniques for the safe Sarcoptes collection and individual mite DNA extraction  ap. 1465-1468.  aIncludes references  aAvailability of mites is a recognized limiting factor of biological and genetic investigations of the genus Sarcoptes. Current methods of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction from individual mites also need substantial improvement in efficiency and operator friendliness. We have first developed a technique for efficient and safe extraction of living mites from scabietic skin samples (crusts or deep skin scrapings). Its core device is a large plastic syringe connected with a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The source material is introduced in the syringe and the device in a shoe box with the tip half of the tube emerging. Mites migrate towards a heat source during a minimum of 36 h. Then, the tube is detached and the mites utilized without risks for the operators. A second technique allows operator-friendly manipulation of individual mites for DNA extraction. Fixed mites are isolated by adhesion to a small strip of polyvinyl choride (PVC) adhesive tape operated with tweezers. Then, mite and strip are plunged in the lyses buffer and the sample twice submitted to thermal shock for disruption of the chitinous exoskeleton. Data show that the tape does not interfere with successive DNA extraction with a commercial kit. The corresponding protocol, that we briefly name “PVC adhesive tape + thermal shock + kit DNA extraction,” compares favorably with the available ones. 3aDNA 3aSarcoptes 3aadhesion 3aexoskeleton 3aheat 3amites 3arisk 2aAnimals 2aDNAxisolation & purification 2aMolecular Biologyxmethods 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aSarcoptidaexgenetics1 aRambozzi, Luisa1 aMaione, Sandra1 aSpalenza, Veronica1 aSartore, Stefano1 aAlasaad, Samer1 aSacchi, Paola1 aRossi, Luca0 tParasitology research.g2009 Oct., v. 105, no. 5 p.1465-1468dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-009-1580-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02755naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245006700181300001800248500002400266520089400290650001801184650002101202650002501223650002501248650001101273650001301284650001401297650002101311650001401332650001401346650001401360650001801374650002201392650001101414650001101425650002401436650001201460650007801472650002801550650002101578650001101599650003401610650002301644650002301667650002501690650004401715650002801759650004201787650002301829700002101852700002101873700001801894700002401912773009901936852000902035856008502044655001202129IND4426252420221118162445.0090918s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442625242DNAL7 a196806902pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-009-1587-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Miho10aCloning and characterization of peroxiredoxin in Babesia bovis  ap. 1473-1477.  aIncludes references  aWe have identified the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (Prx) from a bovine Babesia parasite, B. bovis. Prx is a recently described family of antioxidant enzymes that are highly conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. B. bovis 2-Cys Prx (BbTPx-1) contained two conserved cysteine residues that corresponded to Cys47 and Cys170 of the yeast Prx and the amino acid sequences of two catalytic domains showed significant similarities to those of mammalian typical 2-Cys Prx. The antioxidant activity of the recombinant BbTPx-1 protein expressed in E. coli was demonstrated by a thiol mixed-function oxidation assay. Furthermore, we confirmed that BbTPx-1 was expressed in the cytoplasm of intra-erythrocytic B. bovis merozites. These results suggest that B. bovis likely uses TPx-1 as a way to reduce peroxides as a control of its intracellular redox balance so that it can live and grow in the host cell. 3aBabesia bovis 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acid sequences 3aantioxidant activity 3acattle 3acysteine 3acytoplasm 3aeukaryotic cells 3aoxidation 3aparasites 3aperoxides 3aperoxiredoxin 3aprokaryotic cells 3athiols 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBabesia bovisxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBabesiosisxveterinary. 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxparasitology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aCytoplasmxchemistry 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeroxiredoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment1 aSakurai, Tatsuya1 aYokoyama, Naoaki1 aInoue, Noboru1 aKawazu, Shin-ichiro0 tParasitology research.g2009 Oct., v. 105, no. 5 p.1473-1477dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-009-1587-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02666naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245004600190300001800236500002400254520129900278650001301577650001201590650002401602650001501626650002201641650001801663650001801681650002401699650001701723650003201740650002101772650002501793650002601818650002501844650002501869650002501894650003401919700002301953700002001976700002401996773011202020852000902132856005502141655001202196IND4422673320221118162436.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442267332DNAL7 a194536112pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01898.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumont, Maxime10aTowards functional molecular fingerprints  ap. 1717-1727.  aIncludes references  aOne of the most important challenges in microbial ecology is to determine the ecological function of dominant microbial populations in their environment. In this paper we propose a generic method coupling fingerprinting and mathematical tools to achieve the functional assigning of bacteria detected in microbial consortia. This approach was tested on a nitrification bioprocess where two functions carried out by two different communities could be clearly distinguished. The mathematical theory of observers of dynamical systems has been used to design a dynamic estimator of the active biomass concentration of each functional community from the available measurements on nitrifying performance. Then, the combination of phylotypes obtained by fingerprinting that best approximated the estimated trajectories of each functional biomass was selected through a random optimization method. By this way, a nitritation or nitratation function was assigned to each phylotype detected in the ecosystem by means of functional molecular fingerprints. The results obtained by this approach were successfully compared with the information obtained from 16S rDNA identification. This original approach can be used on any biosystem involving n successive cascading bioreactions performed by n communities. 3abacteria 3abiomass 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3amicrobial ecology 3anitrification 3aribosomal DNA 3asystem optimization 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethods 2aEcologyxmethods 2aMathematicsxmethods 2aMetagenomicsxmethods 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics1 aHarmand, Jérôme.1 aRapaport, Alain1 aGodon, Jean-Jacques0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2009 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.1717-1727dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01898.x 7aarticle03657naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245013400197300001600331500001500347520139300362650001301755650001301768650001301781650000901794650002201803650003701825650001201862650001701874650002201891650000901913650002001922650001801942650001001960650002901970650002301999650001502022650001002037650001702047650002302064650002802087650004202115650003802157650002702195650005302222650002302275650005102298650006902349650001402418650004202432650004202474650002602516653003302542653002302575653002402598653002102622700003402643700002402677773011302701852000902814856009202823930003302915946001102948655001202959IND4443075120221118162144.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444307512DNAL7 a206593002pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03386.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos-Soriano, Lidia10aActivation of basal defense mechanisms of rice plants by Glomus intraradices does not affect the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis  ap. 597-614.  a2019-12-04  aArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi establish symbiotic associations with a wide range of plant species. AM fungi must then have the ability to suppress, neutralize or evade the plant defense response. We investigated the physiological and molecular responses of rice to inoculation with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices, focusing on the relevance of the plant defense response during the symbiotic mycorrhizal interaction. Defense gene expression analysis and proteomic approaches were used. The impact of defense gene expression on the mycorrhizal process was analyzed using transgenic PRms (Pathogenesis-Related maize seed) rice plants, the PRms plants exhibiting constitutive expression of endogenous defense genes. Inoculation with G. intraradices stimulated growth and biomass production in wild-type and PRms plants. Evidence is presented on the activation of the basal defense response in mycorrhizal rice roots. Analysis of the symbiotic proteome confirmed the accumulation of stress-related proteins in mycorrhizal roots, including PR proteins and antioxidant enzymes. Although constitutive expression of defense genes occurred in the roots of PRms plants, the symbiotic efficiency of G. intraradices in these plants was not affected. These results suggest that AM fungi have evolved the capacity to circumvent defense mechanisms that are controlled by the plant's immune system. 3aproteins 3aZea mays 3aproteome 3arice 3amycorrhizal fungi 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aenzymes 3aOryza sativa 3atransgenic plants 3acorn 3agene expression 3aimmune system 3agenes 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3abiomass production 3aproteomics 3aroots 3aantioxidants 3adefense mechanisms 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGlomeromycotaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMutationxgenetics 2aMycorrhizaexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aOryzaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSymbiosisxphysiology 0apathogenesis-related protein 0asymbiotic proteome 0aGlomus intraradices 0adefense response1 aGarcía-Garrido, José Manuel1 aSegundo, Blanca San0 tNew phytologist.g2010 Oct., v. 188, no. 2 p.597-614dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03386.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02464naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009000163300001600253520147300269650001201742650002501754653003201779653002601811653001901837653002401856773014401880852000902024856008502033930003302118946001102151655001202162IND4441049320221118162139.0100806e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444104932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10368-010-0164-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalz, Rainer 10aCompetences for green development and leapfrogging in newly industrializing countries  ap. 245-265.  aCompetences for green development and leapfrogging in Newly Industrializing Countries are becoming increasingly urgent from a global perspective. The integration of these innovations into the development process in the rapidly growing economies requires knowledge build-up and technology cooperation. The prospect of exporting sustainability technologies can add an incentive for them to move towards sustainability technologies. These issues also affect innovations to increase material efficiency, which are receiving increasing interest among sustainability innovations. The competences for green development are analyzed with an innovation indicator approach. The general innovation capabilities are evaluated using R&D indicators and survey results about general innovation capabilities. Technological competences in the sustainability fields are a key indicator for the absorptive capacity of sustainability technologies and for the ability to export them. International patents and publications, and successes in foreign trade indicate to what extent a country is already able to participate in global technology markets. The resulting pattern shows various strengths and weaknesses of the analyzed countries. In general, the knowledge build up in material efficiency strategies is above-average in the Newly Industrializing Countries. There is a strong need for strategic positioning of the countries and for coordination of the various policy fields involved. 3apatents 3adeveloping countries 0aSustainability technologies 0aAbsorptive capacities 0aTrade patterns 0aMaterial efficiency0 tInternational economics and economic policy IEEP.g2010 Aug., v. 7, no. 2-3 p.245-265dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-48047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10368-010-0164-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02553naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136245014500154300001600299520161300315650001401928650002301942650001201965650001401977700002001991700003102011773018102042856005502223852000902278655001202287IND60616580120221118162146.0181018s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061658012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2004.00417.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aHigh-frequency calling in Eneopterinae crickets (Orthoptera, Grylloidea, Eneopteridae): adaptive radiation revealed by phylogenetic analysis  ap. 577-584.  aThe dominant frequency (Fd) of the cricket calling song commonly ranges from 2 to 8 kHz because of physical constraints  due to small size and stridulum functioning. However some Eneopterinae crickets are known to call with Fds  of 10–15 kHz, and one species (  Eneoptera guyanensis  ) produces a modulated call with both a low and a high Fd. We  studied Fd evolution with respect to phylogeny in the whole Eneopterinae subfamily to reconstruct its pattern of  transformation. The phylogenetic pattern resulting from the analysis showed that Fd is relatively stable through the  whole clade: the Fd ancestral state (3–7.9 kHz) has been modified only once, with the occurrence of a high Fd in the  clade [  Cardiodactylus  (Lebinthus–Agnotecous)]: high Fd replaced low Fd, resulting in high-frequency calling songs.  In  E. guyanensis  , the pattern of frequency change is different: a high Fd component has been added to the low ancestral  Fd, resulting in frequency modulation. Investigation of cladogenesis rate indicated that the onset of high Fd in  [  Cardiodactylus  (Lebinthus–Agnotecous)] was accompanied by a high cladogenesis rate, supporting a hypothesis of  adaptive radiation for high-frequency calling (phylogeny criterion of adaptation). High frequencies are particularly  problematic for long-range communication, especially for forest-living species, because of the increase of excess  attenuation with frequency. The effectiveness of high-frequency calling is discussed in the clade [Cardiodactylus  (  Lebinthus–Agnotecous)] in relation to the behavioural ecology of the species. 3aGryllidae 3aadaptive radiation 3aecology 3aphylogeny1 aRobillard, Tony1 aDesutter-Grandcolas, Laure0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2004 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.577-584dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2004.00417.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01333naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003300097040001800130100001500148245008400163300001400247500002300261520041300284650002800697650001100725650002300736653002500759773006800784852000900852856008300861939003300944945000800977946001100985990002300996655001201019991633512670742620221118162526.0831108e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830098612DNAL7 a10.1163/187529282X005102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurman, M.10aNeoaplectana carpocapsae: Toxin production by axenic insect parasitic nematodes  ap. 62-70.  aSummary in French.  aNeoaplectana carpocapsae, presence of toxin in axenically cultured worms, correlation between developmental stage and toxin production, partial characterization of toxin, influence of toxin upon Galleria mellonella larvae (as measured by activity, behaviour, and heartbeat frequency), mortality in both G. mellonella and Hylobius abietis following injections with high concentrations of toxic culture extract 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3atoxins 3abiological control 0aLife cycle, Nematoda0 tNematologica.g1982 Nov., v. 28, no. 1 p.62-70x0028-25967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/187529282X005103Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19831108c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03680naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002100193245011100214300001800325506007600343520171100419506003702130650001302167650001502180650002002195650000902215650001902224650001502243650002402258650001302282650001502295650001502310650001102325650001202336650001202348650002802360650004302388650001402431650002402445651001302469651001302482653002702495653001602522653001602538653001702554700002102571700001902592700001902611700002002630700001802650700001902668700001802687700001802705700002502723773012502748852000902873856009202882930003302974946001103007655001203018IND4440853320221207140911.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444085332DNAL7 a206461212pmid7 aPMC32724112pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01717.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurant, Sarah M.10aDoes size matter?

This study utilizes a unique data set covering over 19 000 georeferenced records of species presence collected between 1993 and 2008, to explore the distribution and habitat selectivity of an assemblage of 26 carnivore species in the Serengeti-Ngorongoro landscape in northern Tanzania. 2. Two species, the large-spotted genet and the bushy-tailed mongoose, were documented for the first time within this landscape. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) was used to examine habitat selectivity for 18 of the 26 carnivore species for which there is sufficient data. Eleven ecogeographical variables (EGVs), such as altitude and habitat type, were used for these analyses. 3. The ENFA demonstrated that species differed in their habitat selectivity, and supported the limited ecological information already available for these species, such as the golden jackals' preference for grassland and the leopards' preference for river valleys. 4. Two aggregate scores, marginality and tolerance, are generated by the ENFA, and describe each species' habitat selectivity in relation to the suite of EGVs. These scores were used to test the hypothesis that smaller species are expected to be more selective than larger species [Science, 1989, 243, 1145]. Two predictions were tested: Marginality should decrease with body mass; and tolerance should increase with body mass. Our study provided no evidence for either prediction. 5. Our results not only support previous analyses of carnivore diet breadth, but also represent a novel approach to the investigation of habitat selection across species assemblages. Our method provides a powerful tool to explore similar questions in other systems and for other taxa.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaltitude 3acarnivores 3adata collection 3adiet 3ageoreferencing 3agrasslands 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aprediction 3arivers 3avalleys 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCarnivoraxclassificationxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aSpecies Specificity 3aTanzania 0aTanzania 0acarnivore biodiversity 0acoexistence 0ahabitat use 0amacroecology1 aCraft, Meggan E.1 aFoley, Charles1 aHampson, Katie1 aLobora, Alex L.1 aMsuha, Maurus1 aEblate, Ernest1 aBukombe, John1 aMchetto, John1 aPettorelli, Nathalie0 tJournal of animal ecology.g2010 Sept., v. 79, no. 5 p.1012-1022dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01717.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03284naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245006700164300001800231520227800249650001702527650002502544650002602569650003502595653001502630653001502645653001702660700001902677773012402696852000902820856008502829930003302914946001102947655001202958IND4445201220221118162549.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444520122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-010-9926-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeink, Ulrich 10aWhat criteria should be used to select biodiversity indicators  ap. 3769-3797.  aThe conservation of biodiversity is a major goal in nature conservation, but measuring the total biodiversity of a site or a region is not possible; thus there is a great demand for indicators to represent biodiversity. To be able to make use of indicators, criteria must first be established for their selection, and the degree to which the indicators meet the criteria must be tested. However, the purposes for which indicators are applied—and thus sometimes the criteria themselves—differ between ecological science and environmental policy. As transparency in choosing and testing suitable biodiversity indicators will optimize the results of an indicator, this article first aims to determine if there are common approaches in selecting biodiversity indicators in ecology and environmental policy. Second, we asked which criteria biodiversity indicators were scientifically tested against to determine their suitability. To answer these questions, we analyzed papers on biodiversity indicators referenced in the Web of Science. Our results demonstrate different patterns for selecting biodiversity indicators in the different fields of application. In ecology, the quality of indicators is mainly determined by a close relationship between indicator and indicandum (i.e., indicated phenomenon), while the relevance of an indicator for a given issue, e.g., reserve selection or an assessment of a certain impact, is of paramount importance for conservation policy. Surprisingly, few biodiversity indicators are empirically tested to determine if they meet the criteria by which they were purportedly chosen. We argue that this is due to the different conceptualizations of biodiversity indicators in science and environmental policy. Since the suitability of biodiversity indicators remains untested in many cases, our findings suggest room to make better use of indicators in ecology and environmental policy. As the results of ecological research are put to use to solve environmental problems, the selection of indicators for ecological research should correspond to a large extent with those used in environmental policy. Further, to assess the suitability of a biodiversity indicator, it should be tested against all of the criteria relevant for its selection. 3abiodiversity 3aenvironmental policy 3aenvironmental science 3anatural resources conservation 0aEvaluation 0aIndication 0aConservation1 aKowarik, Ingo 0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2010 Dec., v. 19, no. 13 p.3769-3797dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-010-9926-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02886naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245012100170300001600291520167800307650002201985650003702007650002402044650001002068650001202078650001402090650000902104650001402113650003302127650002002160653001702180700002602197700002502223773011402248852000902362856008502371939003302456946001102489655001202500IND4449513420221118162542.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444951342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-010-0760-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCleland, Timothy P. 10aHistological, chemical, and morphological reexamination of the “heart” of a small Late Cretaceous Thescelosaurus  ap. 203-211.  aA three-dimensional, iron-cemented structure found in the anterior thoracic cavity of articulated Thescelosaurus skeletal remains was hypothesized to be the fossilized remains of the animal's four-chambered heart. This was important because the finding could be interpreted to support a hypothesis that non-avian dinosaurs were endothermic. Mammals and birds, the only extant organisms with four-chambered hearts and single aortae, are endotherms. The hypothesis that this Thescelosaurus has a preserved heart was controversial, and therefore, we reexamined it using higher-resolution computed tomography, paleohistological examination, X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. This suite of analyses allows for detailed morphological and chemical examination beyond what was provided in the original work. Neither the more detailed examination of the gross morphology and orientation of the thoracic “heart” nor the microstructural studies supported the hypothesis that the structure was a heart. The more advanced computed tomography showed the same three areas of low density as the earlier studies with no evidence of additional low-density areas as might be expected from examinations of an ex situ ostrich heart. Microstructural examination of a fragment taken from the “heart” was consistent with cemented sand grains, and no chemical signal consistent with a biological origin was detected. However, small patches of cell-like microstructures were preserved in the sandstone matrix of the thoracic structure. A possible biological origin for these microstructures is the focus of ongoing investigation. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acomputed tomography 3aheart 3amammals 3aostriches 3asand 3asandstone 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athoracic cavity 0aOrnithischia1 aStoskopf, Michael K. 1 aSchweitzer, Mary H. 0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2011 Mar., v. 98, no. 3 p.203-211dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-010-0760-13Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03389naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010500161300001600266520179000282650002002072650001002092650001202102650004302114650001102157650002102168650001402189650001402203650002802217650002602245650002202271650001902293650000902312650002702321650004702348650001402395650001302409653003502422653003302457700002002490700001802510700001502528700001502543700001602558700001902574773012802593852000902721856008502730930003302815946001102848655001202859IND4440099420221118162523.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444009942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-009-9524-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Lihua 10aExploitation of Malus EST-SSRs and the utility in evaluation of genetic diversity in Malus and Pyrus  ap. 841-851.  aA total of 8117 suitable SSR-contaning ESTs were acquired by screening from a Malus EST database, among which dinudeotide SSRs were the most abundant repeat motif, within which, CT/TC followed by AG/GA were predominant. Based on the suitable sequences, we developed 147 SSR primer pairs, of which 94 pairs gave amplifications within the expected size range while 65 pairs were found to be polymorphic after a preliminary test. Eighteen primer pairs selected randomly were further used to assess genetic relationship among 20 Malus species or cultivars. As a result, these primers displayed high level of polymorphism with a mean of 6.94 alleles per locus and UPGMA cluster analysis grouped twenty Malus accessions into five groups at the similarity level of 0.6800 that were largely congruent to the traditional taxonomy. Subsequently, all of the 94 primer pairs were tested on four accessions of Pyrus to evaluate the transferability of the markers, and 40 of 72 functional SSRs produced polymorphic amplicons from which 8 SSR loci selected randomly were employed to analyze genetic diversity and relationship among a collection of Pyrus. The 8 primer pairs produced expected bands with the similar size in apples with an average of 7.375 alleles per locus. The observed heterozygosity of different loci ranged from 0.29 (MES₉₆) to 0.83 (MES₁₃₈), with a mean of 0.55 which is lower than 0.63 reported in genome-derived SSR marker analysis in Pyrus. The UPGMA dendrogram was similar to the previous results obtained by using RAPD and AFLP markers. Our results showed that these EST-SSR markers displayed reliable amplification and considerable polymorphism in both Malus and Pyrus, and will contribute to the knowledge of genetic study of Malus and genetically closed genera. 3aMalus domestica 3aPyrus 3aalleles 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aapples 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3adatabases 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ascreening 3ataxonomy 0aExpressed sequence tags (ESTs) 0aSimple sequence repeat (SSR)1 aZheng, Xiaoyan 1 aCai, Danying 1 aGao, Yuan 1 aWang, Kun 1 aCao, Yufen 1 aTeng, Yuanwen 0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2010 Aug., v. 57, no. 6 p.841-851dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-009-9524-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01412naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003400097040001800131100001500149245016400164300001400328500005700342500003500399520024600434650002400680653002100704700001400725700001500739700001400754700001400768773011200782852000900894856008400903939003300987945000801020946001101028990002301039655001201062991633511060742620221118161932.0831221e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||kor||7 aPAR830109892DNAL7 a10.3347/kjp.1983.21.1.212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhee, J.K.14aThe wormicidal substance of fresh water fishes on Clonorchis sinensis.

Young workers neither hate nor endorse management; they are anti-establishment. Young restaurant employees are usually not long-term career oriented. They want freedom, flexibility and communication. Decertification of labor unions is increasing. Although only employees may initiate union decertification, employers may legally impart information and knowledge about the procedures to the employees. Alert managers now look more to planned prevention to maintain union-free status through development of communication systems with employees. Labor unions are not changing philosophically. Union lawyers maintain former ideologies. Management often does not recognize difficulties with minority group workers or pay attention to their needs until unionization proceedings have already started. It is possible for an operator to maintain a union-free business through responsive, open communication with minority group employee leaders. 3ahuman resources 3afood service management 3alabor relations 3afood service workers 3alabor unions 3aadministrative management 0aCommunication (Thought transfer) 0aEmployer employee relationship 0aMinority groups0 tRestaurant business.g1979 May 1, v. 78, no. 6 p.132,136,140-132,136,140x0097-80437nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19791001c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01327naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245003500135300001200170520050600182650001600688650002000704650001300724650003000737653001500767653003700782653003500819653001800854773007800872852000900950939003300959945000800992946001301000655001201013991633509680742620221118162115.0791001e19790501xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794559512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayes, James L.10aHumility: the vital ingredient  ap. 143.  aThe ability to listen and learn from others is essential for successful working relationships.

S. 10aTwo class-modelling techniques that give families of class-models and their relation with the structure of the data  ap. 1941-1950.  aIn class-modelling problems, which are again becoming increasingly important, there are two parameters to value the quality of the class-model built for a category, namely sensitivity and specificity. Using them as criteria, in this paper, two different approaches to class-modelling problems are presented, approaches that differ from other usual methods in the fact that they provide not just one class-model per category but a set of different class-models that accounts for the possible pairs of sensitivity-specificity values attainable for a given data set. One of the proposals is partial least squares class-modelling (PLS-CM) that, by the joint use of PLS with binary responses and the posterior statistical modelling of the distribution of the computed responses, permits the estimation of the risks related to the decision of assigning a sample into a class, and thus, the values of sensitivity and specificity. The other proposed method, Pareto-optimal front in class-modelling, is an analytical approach posed in a multi-response optimization framework, the one that corresponds to trying to simultaneously maximise the sensitivity and specificity of a class-model. Additionally, the whole family of computed class-models is validated in prediction by using cross-validation, showing the stability of both methods for prediction. The case-studies show the complementariness of both approaches and, in particular, that the joint use of both techniques allows the user to detect possible structures in the data set especially inadequate for PLS. The results, i.e. the whole set of sensitivity-specificity values achievable for a given problem, are graphically represented to improve its study and make it easy to make a decision about the model.

New sludge, sludge stored or kept in the atmosphere and old sludge were studied. It was found that over time the strength of the sewage sludge increased due to self-consolidation and destruction of organic material. The concentration of metals in the sewage extract was considerably lower than in the landfill leachate. It was concluded that if kept in an open polygon for 1-2 years, the sewage sludge can be used as a low permeability landfill cover. 3asewage sludge 3alandfills 0aSlope stability 0aLeachate 0aExtraction of metals1 aDundulis, Kastytis 1 aGadeikis, Saulius 1 aJurevičius, Arūnas.1 aKaminskas, Mykolas 0 tBulletin of engineering geology and the environment.g2010 Nov., v. 69, no. 4 p.575-582dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1435-95297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10064-010-0279-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03135naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012100186300001600307520145400323650002201777650002801799650001401827650002301841650002601864650002001890650002201910650002001932650002501952650001801977650001201995650002902007650003402036650001102070650005802081650002802139650002902167650003002196650002402226653001602250653001302266653001502279700002902294700002002323773012402343852000902467856008502476930003302561946001102594655001202605IND4443682820221118162409.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444368282DNAL7 a204737082pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-010-9364-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkassa, Mireille 10aMorphological and molecular diagnostics of Phytoseiulus persimilis and Phytoseiulus macropilis (Acari: Phytoseiidae)  ap. 291-303.  aThis study focuses on the diagnostics of two natural enemy species, belonging to the genus Phytoseiulus in the family Phytoseiidae (sub-family Amblyseiinae): P. macropilis and P. persimilis. These two species are of primary importance in biological control all over the world. However, they are morphologically very similar and specific diagnostics is difficult. This study utilizes mitochondrial molecular markers (12S rRNA and Cytb mtDNA) to differentiate these two species. Morphological analyses showed significant differences between P. persimilis and P. macropilis for 17 morphological characters of the 32 considered. However, despite these significant differences, the ranges of all characters overlap. Only the serration of the macroseta on the basitarsus (StIV) allows the differentiation between P. persimilis and P. macropilis. Despite these small morphological differences, molecular results, for both mitochondrial DNA fragments considered (rRNA and Cytb mtDNA), showed a clear delineation between the specimens of P. macropilis and P. persimilis. This study emphasizes (i) that only one morphological character (serration of the seta StIV) clearly separates these two species, and (ii) the usefulness of an automatical molecular and simple diagnostic tool for accurate differentiation of the two species and ensure the morphological diagnostics. Further studies are proposed, including more DNA sequences especially for P. macropilis. 3aDNA fragmentation 3aPhytoseiulus persimilis 3aacarology 3abiological control 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenetic markers 3amitochondrial DNA 3anatural enemies 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 2aAnimals 2aCytochromes bxchemistry 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistry 2aFemale 2aMitesxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPest Control, Biological 2aRNA, Ribosomalxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity 0aDiagnostics 0a12S rRNA 0aCytb mtDNA1 aTixier, Marie-Stéphane 1 aKreiter, Serge 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2010 Nov., v. 52, no. 3 p.291-303dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-010-9364-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01654naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024002400099040001800123100002100141245004700162300001600209520075700225650001500982650001600997650001001013650001501023653001401038653001701052653002601069773008601095852000901181856007401190939003301264945000801297990002301305655001201328991633506040742620221118162335.0770701e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799103042DNAL7 a10.1086/2605482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenzweig, M.R.14aThe demand for children in farm households  ap. 123-146.  aA multiperiod household model of fertility behavior applicable to rural agricultural settings in which the pecuniary as well as the psychic returns from children are significant is formulated. implications regarding the effects of variables associated with the market for agricultural labor on the demand for farm children, including technical change, agricultural wage rates, farm value, and nonfarm employment opportunities, derived from the model are tested on U.S. aggregate data covering the period 1939-60. the empirical results obtained appear to support the theoretical model and suggest the importance of the reduction in the value of children as productive assets in agriculture as a factor in the postwar decline in the U.S. farm birth rate. 3abirth rate 3arural areas 3ayouth 3afarm labor 0afertility 0afamily labor 0aFamily operated farms0 tJournal of political economy.g1977 Feb., v. 85, no. 1 p.123-146x0022-38087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1086/2605483Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19770701c00000000  aAGE  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03114naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013200166300001600298520160500314650001601919650001601935650001501951650001701966650002601983650002702009650001102036650002202047650001702069650002402086650002202110650001102132650001102143650001402154650001902168650001102187650001002198651001002208653002002218653003402238700001802272700001902290700002002309700002102329773010802350852000902458856008502467930003302552946001102585655001202596IND4444347920221118162359.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444434792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10265-010-0326-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiao-Shuang 10aRegeneration pattern of primary forest species across forest-field gradients in the subtropical Mountains of Southwestern China  ap. 751-762.  aEvergreen broad-leaved forest is now gradually degraded and fragmented, and there is an increase in the amount of habitat edges as a result of long-term human activity. However, the role of edges in the regeneration of primary forest species is poorly understood. After 20 years of the edge creation, we analyzed primary forest species distribution and abundance, and changes in floristic composition, vegetation structure across forest-field gradients in Ailao Mountain, SW China. Our results revealed that there was a higher abundance and richness of primary species, late secondary species and thorny lianas at the distances 0-50 m than at the distances more than 50 m from the edge into the forest exterior. At the distances >50 m, no individuals of dominant canopy trees Lithocarpus xylocarpus, Castanopsis wattii, and L. jingdongensis were found, whereas the abundance of early pioneer shrub species and herbaceous cover was significantly greater. The richness of primary species showed a decrease with increasing distances from the forest edge to the exterior, particularly of medium-seeded primary species showing a drastic decrease. Moreover, no large-seeded primary species occurred at the distances >60 m. This study indicates that the forest edge as a buffer zone may be in favor of primary species regeneration. A dense shrub and herb layer, and seed dispersal may be the major factors limiting the forest regeneration farther from the forest edge. Therefore, to facilitate forest recovery processes, management should give priority to the protection of buffer zones of this forest edge. 3aCastanopsis 3aLithocarpus 3aXylocarpus 3abiogeography 3abotanical composition 3abroadleaved evergreens 3acanopy 3adeciduous forests 3aedge effects 3aforest regeneration 3aground vegetation 3ahumans 3alianas 3amountains 3aseed dispersal 3ashrubs 3atrees 3aChina 0aPrimary species 0aEvergreen broad-leaved forest1 aLiu, Wen-Yao 1 aChen, Jun-Wen 1 aTang, Cindy Q. 1 aYuan, Chun-Ming 0 tJournal of plant research.g2010 Nov., v. 123, no. 6 p.751-762dJapan : Springer Japanx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-010-0326-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101029b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01786naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003400115040001800149100001600167245014200183300001200325520022900337650002100566650002600587650001800613650001700631650002500648650003500673650001500708650001000723650002500733650001000758650002100768650001100789650001100800650002500811650003900836650001600875650003800891651001000929651001000939653001600949700001800965700001300983773009000996852000901086856008401095939003301179945000801212946001301220990002301233655001201256991633505220742620221118162408.0831201e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830104472DNAL7 a63528292pmid7 a10.1093/infdis/148.3.6092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, M.M.10aSeroepidemiology of malaria in Karnataka state: Longitudinal study of a population from an area with high incidence at Kolar, South India  ap. 609.  aPlasmodium spp., application of serologic methods such as the indirect immunofluorescence test to epidemiologic survey, longitudinal study of population (by age groups) from high incidence malarial area of Kolar, South India 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aserodiagnosis 3aepidemiology 3aprotozoal infections 3afluorescent antibody technique 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAntibodiesxanalysis 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMalariaxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aPlasmodium falciparumximmunology 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aAge of host1 aSrinivasa, H.1 aBhat, P.0 tJournal of infectious diseases.g1983 Sept., v. 148, no. 3 p.609-609x0022-18997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/infdis/148.3.6093Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19831201c00000000  aPAR  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01632naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003400115040001800149100001800167245013900185300001600324500001500340520014700355650002400502650001600526650001100542650002200553650002000575650003800595650001800633650001100651650002600662650001600688650002400704650003900728650002200767651001100789653002500800653001000825700002400835700001900859773009000878852000900968856008400977939003301061945000801094946001301102990002301115655001201138991633505010742620221118162434.0831201e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830104462DNAL7 a66047602pmid7 a10.1093/infdis/148.3.4222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorojevic, R.10aChronic schistosomiasis mansoni: Splenic myelopoiesis and inhibition of neutrophil granulocytopoiesis mediated by the sera of patients  ap. 422-426.  a2019-12-04  aSchistosoma mansoni, patients with chronic infections, associated splenic myelopoiesis and inhibition of neutrophil granulocytopoiesis: Brazil 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aneutrophils 3aspleen 2aBone Marrow Cells 2aCells, Cultured 2aColony-Stimulating Factorsxblood 2aHematopoiesis 2aHumans 2aMacrophagesxcytology 2aNeutrophils 2aSchistosoma mansoni 2aSchistosomiasisxbloodxpathology. 2aSpleenxpathology 3aBrazil 0aPathology, Trematoda 0ablood1 aSantos-da-Silva, C.1 aCarvalho, E.A.0 tJournal of infectious diseases.g1983 Sept., v. 148, no. 3 p.422-426x0022-18997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/infdis/148.3.4223Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19831201c00000000  aPAR  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01149naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003100097040001800128100001700146245008300163300001600246500005700262500003700319520018700356650001200543653004700555773008000602852000900682856008100691939003300772945000800805946001100813990002300824655001200847991633504210742620221118161857.0831103e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||jpn||7 aPAR830097522DNAL7 a10.2331/suisan.49.9192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonagaya, S.10aProtease responsible for jellification of myxosporidia-infected swordfish meat  ap. 919-926.  aTitle in original language could not be transcribed.  aIn Japanese;

Chromaffin cells release catecholamine as well as vaso- and neuro-active peptide transmitters into the circulation through exocytic fusion of large dense-core secretory granules. Under basal sympathetic activity, chromaffin cells selectively release modest levels of catecholamines, helping to set the “rest and digest” status of energy storage. Under stress activation, elevated sympathetic firing leads to increased catecholamine as well as peptide transmitter release to set the “fight or flight” status of energy expenditure. While the mechanism for catecholamine release has been widely investigated, relatively little is known of how peptide transmitter release is regulated to occur selectively under elevated stimulation. Recent studies have shown selective catecholamine release under basal stimulation is accomplished through a transient, restricted exocytic fusion pore between granule and plasma membrane, releasing a soluble fraction of the small, diffusible molecules. Elevated cell firing leads to the active dilation of the fusion pore, leading to the release of both catecholamine and the less diffusible peptide transmitters. Here we propose a molecular mechanism regulating the activity-dependent dilation of the fusion pore. We review the immediate literature and provide new data to formulate a working mechanistic hypothesis whereby calcium-mediated dephosphorylation of dynamin I at Ser-774 leads to the recruitment of the molecular motor myosin II to actively dilate the fusion pore to facilitate release of peptide transmitters. Thus, activity-dependent dephosphorylation of dynamin is hypothesized to represent a key molecular step in the sympatho-adrenal stress response. 0aAdrenal 0aCatecholamine 0aFusion pore 0aNeuropeptide 0aSympathetic stress1 aDoreian, Bryan 1 aSmith, Corey 0 tCellular and molecular neurobiology.g2010 Nov., v. 30, no. 8 p.1351-1357dBoston : Springer USx0272-43407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10571-010-9591-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02238naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010000128300001600228500001500244520110500259650001101364650001201375650001401387650001601401650003101417650002701448650001901475650001101494650002301505653002301528653001101551653003001562653002001592653002301612700001901635700001501654773008101669852000901750930003301759945001301792946001101805655001201816IND2332650920221118162627.0030520e20020201enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233265092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshimoto, Y.10aMolecular structure and some physicochemical properties of waxy and low-amylose barley starches  ap. 159-167.  a2019-12-05  aThe molecular structures and physicochemical properties of starches from an actual waxy (HB 340) and two low-amylose (CDC Candle and Sumiremochi) cultivars of barley were examined and compared with those of a normal cultivar (CDC Dawn). HB 340 starch had no detectable amylose. The amylose content was 2.2 and 11.4% in CDC Candle and Sumiremochi starches, respectively, being much lower than that in CDC Dawn starch (25.4%). The starches of HB 340, CDC Candle and Sumiremochi showed a higher viscosity and breakdown on the viscogram than CDC Dawn starch, and HB 340 starch showed the highest deltaH of peak 1 and no peak 2 on the DSC thermogram. The amylopectins resembled each other in average chain-length (19-20), beta-amylolysis limit (beta-AL 53-54%) and chain-length distribution. The amyloses of CDC Candle and Sumiremochi were larger (DPn 1680 and 1560, respectively) and contained the branched amylose with a lower number of chains (NC 6.1-10.4) than CDC Dawn amylose (DPn 1220, NC 13.8) CDC Candle amylose had a higher molar fraction (45%) of the branched molecule than the others (21-26%). 3abarley 3aamylose 3aviscosity 3aamylopectin 3aphysicochemical properties 3acarbohydrate structure 3aheat treatment 3aiodine 3athermal properties 0aposting properties 0astarch 0achain length distribution 0aiodine affinity 0achemical structure1 aTakenouchi, T.1 aTakeda, Y.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2002 Feb. 1, v. 47, no. 2 p.159-167x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02124naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245015000124300001600274500001500290520084500305650001601150650002401166650003301190650001701223650003801240650001801278650001301296650002001309650002301329653002401352653002001376653002201396653001701418653002901435653002401464700001401488700001501502700001501517773008001532852000901612930003301621945001301654946001101667655001201678IND2333803320221118162648.0030731e20020501enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233380332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorde, B.10aCalorimetric analysis of the structural relaxation in partially hydrated amorphous polysaccharides.

Using Differential Scanning Calorimetry, enthalpy relaxation was studied on a series of hydrated polysaccharides in comparison with synthetic polymers, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). The ageing kinetics were evaluated from the relaxation function based on the fictive temperature evolution. While extruded starch equilibrated apparently within the experimental time, amylopectin and phytoglycogen aged slightly faster than PMMA and hydrated PVP without reaching completely their equilibrium. Ageing effects detected after short ageing at very low temperatures (Tg-100 degrees C) revealed the wideness of the relaxation time spectrum. 3acorn starch 3astorage temperature 3aglass transition temperature 3astorage time 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3awater content 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3athermal properties 0afictive temperature 0astarch products 0awaxy maize starch 0astarch aging 0ahydrated polysaccharides 0aenthalpy relaxation1 aBizot, H.1 aVigier, G.1 aBuleon, A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2002 May 1, v. 48, no. 2 p.111-123x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01570naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005000126300001800176500001500194520064200209650001300851650001000864650001300874650002000887650001700907650001600924653001400940653002300954700001800977700001300995700002201008700001801030773008001048852000901128930003301137945001301170946001301183655001201196IND2044517420221118162047.0950209e199409  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204451742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, B.E.10aMobile soil-tire interface measurement system  ap. 1633-1637.  a2019-12-05  aAn electronic data acquisition system was developed to measure and record soil-tire interface pressures of a rubber-tired skidder during skidding conditions.

The model predicts initiation and subsequent rate of pod detachment on an individual cohort basis. It was tested using five different hypotheses for initiation of pod detachment. Mean square error between predicted and measured overall attached pod mass was used as the criterion for parameter estimation in the detachment model. The best detachment model gave good results in 18 experiments that included irrigated and nonirrigated, disease and control, and artificial shade conditions. The mean square error of prediction was used to select the best detachment hypothesis and the jackknife method was used to obtain confidence intervals of the detachment model parameters. The best model ininated detachment in a pod cohort when it experienced six days without carbohydrate, or when the ratio of leaf mass to pod mass and the slope of leaf mass were less than 0.396 and -0.859 g m-2 d-1, respectively. 3amathematical models 3aabscission 3aphotosynthates 3acarbohydrates 3agrowth models 3aphotosynthesis 3aArachis hypogaea 3apods 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0acropgro model1 aJones, J.W.1 aBoote, K.J.1 aHoogenboom, G.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 5 p.1639-1646x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01600naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008300127300001800210500001500228520074800243650001400991650001001005653001001015653000901025653001801034653001201052700001501064700001601079700001901095773008001114852000901194930003301203945001301236946001301249655001201262IND2044517120221118162108.0950209e199409  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204451712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwab, C.V.10aWheat loads and vertical pressure distribution in a full-scale bin.

The system worked extremely well It has several advantages compared to traditional methods of curtain installation by backhoe. 3adrainage systems 3ahome furnishings 3aplows 3aplastic film 3aQuebec 0aexperimental plots 0adrain laying 0ainstallation 0atrenchless drain plows 0asubsurface plastic curtain barriers 0asubsurface plastic film1 aBroughton, R.S.1 aTait, R.K.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 5 p.1525-1527x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01634naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005600127300001800183500001500201520074400216650002400960650001500984650002500999650002501024650001001049650001501059650001901074653000901093700001601102700001801118773008001136852000901216930003301225945001301258946001301271655001201284IND2044512720221118162513.0950209e199409  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204451272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Siyuan.10aSprinkler distribution patterns in windy conditions  ap. 1481-1489.  a2019-12-05  aWind speed and direction can greatly affect sprinkler distribution patterns. In this article, a mathematical model was developed to represent the nonradially symmetric sprinkler distribution panerns in windy conditions. The model uses an ellipse to represent the base-shape of a pattern, and uses shape functions to represent water distributions across four principal sections of the pattern. A three-dimensional (3-D) water distribution pattern can be generated by the model. Catch-can test data were used to obtain the model coefficients for impact-type sprinklers operating on a 110 kPa to 310 kPa pressure range at wind speed up to 7 m/s. The average error and the mean deviation error of the model are 20.26% and 37.17%, respectively. 3amathematical models 3asprinklers 3aspatial distribution 3asprinkler irrigation 3awater 3awind speed 3awind direction 0awind1 aEvans, R.G.1 aKroeger, M.W.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 5 p.1481-1489x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01190naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004200099040001800141100002500159245002400184300001400208520037200222650001200594650001300606651001800619653001600637773008200653852000900735856009200744939003300836945000800869990002300877655001200900991633498090742620221118162606.0770201e197601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794408172DNAL7 a10.1097/00017285-197601000-000082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnloe, Cortez F.

We hypothesize that a larger number of MSCs might become available, if the bone marrow in the immediate vicinity of the subchondral bone is stimulated for MSCs in advance of the creation of cartilage defects. A trans-medullary passage-way reaching the immediate vicinity of the subchondral bone was created 4 days prior to the creation of cartilage defects. In another setting, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was administered through the trans-medullary passage-way in order to augment the stimulation of MSCs. The rabbits were killed at various times after the creation of cartilage defects. Triple staining of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), CD44 and CD45 and histological evaluation were subsequently performed. A considerable proportion of the proliferating cells were identified as bone-marrow-derived MSCs. Enumeration of BrdU-positive cells demonstrated that trans-medullary stimulation, especially with bFGF, increased the number of proliferating cells. The histological grading score of trans-medullary stimulation with bFGF group was superior to that of the other groups. Thus, in-advance stimulation of the bone marrow effectively increases the number of proliferating cells. The putative progenitor cells for chondrocytes stimulated thereby are likely to be recruited to the osteochondral defects at the appropriate time, contributing to the repair of full-thickness articular cartilage defects at the early follow-up time point. 3abone marrow 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3arabbits 3astaining 3astem cells 3astromal cells 2aAnimals 2aBone Marrowxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCartilage Diseasesxpathologyxrehabilitationxtherapy. 2aCartilage, Articularxdrug effectsxpathologyxphysiology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aFibroblast Growth Factor 2xadministration & dosage 2aGuided Tissue Regenerationxmethods 2aInjections, Intralesional 2aMesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantationxmethods 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPhysical Stimulationxmethods 2aRabbits 2aRegenerationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRemission, Spontaneous 2aStimulation, Chemical 2aTime Factors 2aWound Healingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0aIn-advance trans-medullary stimulation 0aMesenchymal stromal cells 0aArticular cartilage1 aImai, Shinji 1 aMimura, Tomohiro 1 aKubo, Mitsuhiko 1 aAraki, Susumu 1 aShioji, Suguru 1 aTakemura, Yoshinori 1 aMatsusue, Yoshitaka 0 tCell and tissue research.g2010 Sept., v. 341, no. 3 p.371-379dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-010-1020-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100910b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03992naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245011000188300001600298500001500314520173500329650002102064650001002085650008802095650002102183650002302204650003302227650002202260650003002282650001102312650004902323650008502372650001102457650001802468650001402486650000902500650007902509650003902588650007502627650002102702650007102723650001702794650001602811651001202827653001402839653001602853653001702869653001402886653002402900700002402924700002102948700002102969700002502990700001703015700002303032773013703055852000903192856008503201930003303286946001103319655001203330IND4442577520221118161926.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444257752DNAL7 a206977002pmid7 a10.1007/s00228-010-0879-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieminen, Tuija H. 10aOxycodone concentrations are greatly increased by the concomitant use of ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir  ap. 977-985.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose This study aimed to investigate the effect of antivirals ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral oxycodone, a widely used opioid receptor agonist used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Methods A randomized crossover study design with three phases at intervals of 4 weeks was conducted in 12 healthy volunteers. Ritonavir 300 mg, lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg, or placebo b.i.d. for 4 days was given to the subjects. On day 3, 10 mg oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone, noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone were determined for 48 h. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with standard noncompartmental methods. Behavioral effects and experimental cold pain analgesia were assessed for 12 h. ANOVA for repeated measures was used for statistical analysis. Results Ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of oral oxycodone by 3.0-fold (range 1.9- to 4.3-fold; P <0.001) and 2.6-fold (range 1.9- to 3.3-fold; P <0.001). The mean (± SD) elimination half-life increased after ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir from 3.6 ± 0.6 to 5.6 ± 0.9 h (P <0.001) and 5.7 ± 0.9 h (P <0.001), respectively. Both ritonavir (P <0.001) and lopinavir/ritonavir (P <0.05) increased the self-reported drug effect of oxycodone. Conclusions Ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir greatly increase the plasma concentrations of oral oxycodone in healthy volunteers and enhance its effect. When oxycodone is used clinically in patients during ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, reductions in oxycodone dose may be needed to avoid opioid-related adverse effects. 3apharmacokinetics 2aAdult 2aAnalgesics, Opioidxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aArea Under Curve 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aDrug Interactions 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aFemale 2aHIV Infectionsxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aHIV Protease Inhibitorsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLopinavir 2aMale 2aOxycodonexadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aPainxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aPyrimidinonesxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aReference Values 2aRitonavirxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aTime Factors 2aYoung Adult 0aFinland 0aOxycodone 0aInteraction 0apharmacology 0aRitonavir 0aLopinavir/ritonavir1 aHagelberg, Nora M. 1 aSaari, Teijo I. 1 aNeuvonen, Mikko 1 aNeuvonen, Pertti J. 1 aLaine, Kari 1 aOlkkola, Klaus T. 0 tEuropean journal of clinical pharmacology.g2010 Oct., v. 66, no. 10 p.977-985dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0031-69707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00228-010-0879-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02632naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011000160300001800270520137600288650001501664650002101679650001401700650001301714650002601727650002201753650001401775650001101789650001601800653002101816653000901837700002601846700002301872700002201895700003101917773013601948852000902084856008502093939003302178946001102211655001202222IND4449675720221118162406.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444967572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-011-4668-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, Ana 10aInfluence of amino acid relative position on the oxidative modification of histidine and glycine peptides  ap. 2779-2794.  aThe radical oxidation of isomeric peptides containing one reactive amino acid [histidine (H)] and another less reactive amino acid [glycine (G)] in the form of dipeptides (HG and GH) and tripeptides (HGG, GHG, and GGH) was studied by mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS) for detection and LC-MSn for structural characterization. The oxidation products identified were keto, hydroxy, keto-hydroxy, and hydroperoxide derivatives for both di- and tripeptides. Among these, it was found that insertion of oxygen atoms occurred at histidine for HG and HGG, and both histidine and glycine for GH, GHG, and GGH. In addition, oxidation products formed by alkoxyl rearrangement reactions with cleavage of the peptide chain were also identified for GH, GHG, and GGH, corroborating hydrogen abstraction step in G residues. These findings were supported through the identification of radical intermediate species formed and trapped with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine-N-oxide (DMPO) spin trap. The observation of DMPO adducts bearing two spin trap molecules reinforced the abstraction of two hydrogen atoms from the same molecule. Overall, modification sites identified showed that the outcome of oxidative behavior of peptides is influenced not only by the reactivity of the amino acid in the peptide sequence but also by its relative position within the sequence. 3adipeptides 3agreenhouse gases 3ahistidine 3ahydrogen 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atripeptides 0aHydroxyl radical 0aDMPO1 aFonseca, Conceição 1 aMaciel, Elisabete 1 aDomingues, Pedro 1 aDomingues, M.

This gonadotropin plays an essential role in reproduction. Its receptor (FSHR) belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), specifically the family of rhodopsin-like receptors. Agonist binding to the FSHR triggers the rapid activation of multiple signaling cascades, mainly the cAMP-adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A cascade, that impact diverse biological effects of FSH in the gonads. As in other G protein-coupled receptors, the several cytoplasmic domains of the FSHR are involved in signal transduction and termination of the FSH signal. Here we summarize some recent information on the signaling cascades activated by FSH as well as on the role of the intracytoplasmic domains of the FSHR in coupling to membrane and cytosolic proteins linked to key biological functions regulated by the FSH-FSHR system. 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3asignal transduction 3agranulosa cells 2aAnimals 2aCell Membranexphysiology 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexphysiology 2aHumans 2aReceptors, FSHxphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 0aFollicle-stimulating hormone receptor 0aG protein-coupled receptors1 aZariñán, Teresa 1 aPasapera, Ana Ma. 1 aCasas-González, Patricia 1 aDias, James A. 0 tEndocrine.g2007 Dec., v. 32, no. 3 p.251-263dBoston : Springer USx0969-711X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12020-008-9041-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01313naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003400097040001800131100001500149245008500164300001400249500002300263520013700286650001400423651001600437653002300453653003100476653002800507653002600535653003400561653002400595700001400619700001400633773011200647852000900759856008400768939003300852945000800885946001100893990002300904655001200927991633495190742620221118162501.0830913e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830081732DNAL7 a10.3347/kjp.1982.20.2.832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, D.W.10aRecent demonstration of helminth eggs and larvae from vegetable cultivating soil  ap. 83-92.  aSummary in Korean.  ahelminth eggs and nematode larvae in soil used for cultivating vegetables, incidence, monthly distribution: vicinity of Taegu, Korea 3ahookworms 3aSouth Korea 0aAscarid (Nematoda) 0aDisease transmission, Soil 0aLiver fluke (Trematoda) 0aSeasonal distribution 0aTrichostrongylidae (Nematoda) 0aWhipworm (Nematoda)1 aOck, M.S.1 aSuh, J.W.0 tKisaengchunghak chapchi = Korean journal of parasitology.g1982 Dec., v. 20, no. 2 p.83-92x0023-40017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3347/kjp.1982.20.2.833Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19830913c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01263naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097040001800132100001500150245011000165300001600275500002300291500001500314520019800329650002400527650001700551651001600568653001600584653001400600653001600614773011400630852000900744856008500753939003300838945000800871946001100879990002300890655001200913991633494960742620221118162456.0830913e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830081782DNAL7 a10.3347/kjp.1982.20.2.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, S.B.10aEpidemiological studies of Clonorchis sinensis in lower area of Nag Dong River nearby Busan City in Korea  ap. 133-141.  aSummary in Korean.  a2019-12-04  aClonorchis sinensis, prevalence and intensity by age and sex in human inhabitants of 3 towns, infection rates of local fish and snail intermediate hosts, ova not found in stools of dogs or cats 3aClonorchis sinensis 3aepidemiology 3aSouth Korea 0aSex of host 0aTrematoda 0aAge of host0 tKisaengchunghak chapchi = Korean journal of parasitology.g1982 Dec., v. 20, no. 2 p.133-141x0023-40017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3347/kjp.1982.20.2.1333Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19830913c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03818naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003000171245012600201300001800327520170800345650002702053650001602080650001502096650001202111650001202123650004602135650001202181650002002193650004402213650001102257650001302268650000902281650001202290650003502302650006402337650006302401650003002464650004502494650001302539650005502552650002302607650002002630650004402650650003402694650002102728653001302749653001502762653002102777700002202798700002002820700002702840700002602867700002902893773011302922852000903035856009203044930003303136946001103169655001203180IND4437309720221118162142.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443730972DNAL7 a205534892pmid7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07667.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeitoun-Ghandour, Sukaina14aThe two Caenorhabditis elegans metallothioneins (CeMT-1 and CeMT-2) discriminate between essential zinc and toxic cadmium  ap. 2531-2542.  aThe nematode Caenorhabditis elegans expresses two metallothioneins (MTs), CeMT-1 and CeMT-2, that are believed to be key players in the protection against metal toxicity. In this study, both isoforms were expressed in vitro in the presence of either Zn(II) or Cd(II). Metal binding stoichiometries and affinities were determined by ESI-MS and NMR, respectively. Both isoforms had equal zinc binding ability, but differed in their cadmium binding behaviour, with higher affinity found for CeMT-2. In addition, wild-type C. elegans, single MT knockouts and a double MT knockout allele were exposed to zinc (340 μ m) or cadmium (25 μ m) to investigate effects in vivo. Zinc levels were significantly increased in all knockout strains, but were most pronounced in the CeMT-1 knockout, mtl-1 (tm1770), while cadmium accumulation was highest in the CeMT-2 knockout, mtl-2 (gk125) and the double knockout mtl-1;mtl-2 (zs1). In addition, metal speciation was assessed by X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy. This showed that O-donating, probably phosphate-rich, ligands play a dominant role in maintaining the physiological concentration of zinc, independently of metallothionein status. In contrast, cadmium was shown to coordinate with thiol groups, and the cadmium speciation of the wild-type and the CeMT-2 knockout strain was distinctly different to the CeMT-1 and double knockouts. Taken together, and supported by a simple model calculation, these findings show for the first time that the two MT isoforms have differential affinities towards Cd(II) and Zn(II) at a cellular level, and this is reflected at the protein level. This suggests that the two MT isoforms have distinct in vivo roles. 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3aalleles 3acadmium 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aligands 3ametallothionein 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3athiols 3atoxicity 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCaenorhabditis elegans Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGene Knockdown Techniques 2aHelminth Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMetallothioneinxdeficiencyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Isoformsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aX-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy 2aZincxmetabolism 0aaffinity 0aC. elegans 0ametal speciation1 aCharnock, John M.1 aHodson, Mark E.1 aLeszczyszyn, Oksana I.1 aBlindauer, Claudia A.1 aStürzenbaum, Stephen R.0 tFEBS journal.g2010 June, v. 277, no. 11 p.2531-2542dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07667.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03083naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012400162300001600286520131600302650002801618650002001646650001801666650001901684650001201703650002901715650001001744650004201754650002101796650002201817650002101839650002801860650002501888650001101913650001001924650001901934650001101953650002001964650001601984653003902000653002802039653003102067653001902098700001602117700001602133700001902149700001902168700001502187700001902202700001902221773011502240852000902355856008502364939003302449946001102482655001202493IND4449490520221118162147.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444949052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-010-9529-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haiyan 10aAssessment of tolerance to multistresses and in vitro cell adhesion in genetically modified Lactobacillus plantarum 590  ap. 579-589.  aLactobacillus plantarum (Lp) is a lactic acid bacterium that has many excellent traits that meet the needs of industrial production. Genetically modified (GM) Lp590 was obtained from Lp that was modified by the insertion of the gene nisI, which can confer resistance to nisin and play a role as a bio-preservative. Here, explorations were made to assess the safety of GM Lp590 and establish an in vitro evaluation model. The ability of Lp590 to tolerate both environmental stresses (such as temperatures ranging from 52 to 4°C, or exposure to ethanol, oxygen, and osmotic stresses) and gastrointestinal transit was assessed. Lp590 showed a tolerance to 4°C and ethanol (20%) within a period of 240 min that was similar to Lp. Notably, Lp590 can tolerate higher temperature (52°C) and higher levels of H₂O₂ (2%) and NaCl (4.0 M) than Lp. In contrast, Lp590 has the same gastrointestinal transit tolerance as Lp. In addition, Lp590 can adhere to Caco-2 cells, and it has no adverse effect on the cell membrane in vitro. These results indicate that GM Lp590 has many desirable biological characteristics and has good prospects for industrial applications. A useful and comprehensive exploration has been undertaken to establish a new in vitro evaluation model for genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs). 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aadverse effects 3acell adhesion 3acell membranes 3aethanol 3agastrointestinal transit 3agenes 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro studies 3aindustrial applications 3alactic acid bacteria 3amodels 3anisin 3aosmotic stress 3aoxygen 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 0aGenetically modified microorganism 0aEnvironmental tolerance 0aGastrointestinal tolerance 0aIn vitro model1 aXu, Wentao 1 aLuo, Yunbo 1 aTian, Hongtao 1 aWang, Hongxin 1 aGuo, Xing 1 aYuan, Yanfang 1 aHuang, Kunlun 0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2011 Mar., v. 99, no. 3 p.579-589dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-010-9529-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01500naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245003600134300001700170520073400187650001300921650001700934650002300951653003000974653003001004653002301034773009001057852000901147939003301156945000801189946001301197655001201210991633493900742620221118162128.0840719e19831001xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840051852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCummings, Gil.14aThe Efficiency of steam cooking  ap. 186, 188.  aAdvantages and guidelines for cooking with steam are described. Transferring heat energy through steam is the most efficient way to cook and can occur through conduction, convection, or radiation. Steam has 6 times the heat energy found in boiling water at the same temperature. Pure steam is dry and cooks foods quickly, retaining nutrients. Air must be completely excluded from steamers or pressure cookers for efficient performance. Several makes of steamers are described (e.g., forced convection steam cookers and counter units). Variables that affect cooking time in steam are: density, shape, and thickness of foods, food temperature, and doneness desired. All restaurant operations should consider having a steamer.

These obligate ant-plant mutualisms are common model systems for studying factors that allow horizontally transmitted mutualisms to persist since parasites of ant-myrmecophyte mutualisms exploit the rewards provided by host plants whilst providing no protection in return. In pioneer formations in French Guiana, Azteca alfari and Azteca ovaticeps are known to be mutualists of myrmecophytic Cecropia (Cecropia ants). Here, we show that Azteca andreae, whose colonies build carton nests on myrmecophytic Cecropia, is not a parasite of Azteca-Cecropia mutualisms nor is it a temporary social parasite of A. alfari; it is, however, a temporary social parasite of A. ovaticeps. Contrarily to the two mutualistic Azteca species that are only occasional predators feeding mostly on hemipteran honeydew and food bodies provided by the host trees, A. andreae workers, which also attend hemipterans, do not exploit the food bodies. Rather, they employ an effective hunting technique where the leaf margins are fringed with ambushing workers, waiting for insects to alight. As a result, the host trees' fitness is not affected as A. andreae colonies protect their foliage better than do mutualistic Azteca species resulting in greater fruit production. Yet, contrarily to mutualistic Azteca, when host tree development does not keep pace with colony growth, A. andreae workers forage on surrounding plants; the colonies can even move to a non-Cecropia tree. 3aAzteca 3aCecropia 3aHemiptera 3aforage 3afruit growing 3ahoneydew 3ahost plants 3ainsects 3aleaves 3anesting 3anests 3aparasites 3apredators 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aAntsxphysiology 2aCecropia Plantxgeneticsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aGenetic Fitness 2aHemipteraxphysiology 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aPlant Leavesxparasitology 2aPredatory Behavior 2aSocial Behavior 2aTreesxparasitology 3aFrench Guiana 0aAnt-plant relationships 0aBiotic defense 0aParasites of mutualisms 0aTemporary social parasites1 aLeroy, Céline.1 aCorbara, Bruno 1 aCéréghino, Régis.1 aRoux, Olivier 1 aHérault, Bruno.1 aRossi, Vivien 1 aGuerrero, Roberto J. 1 aDelabie, Jacques H.

Following chondroitinase digestion, nonsulfated, monosulfated and disulfated delta-disaccharides, are separated and readily determined within 60 min on an uncoated fused-silica capillary using normal polarity at 20 kV and detection at 230 nm. Comparison was made by separation of these disaccharides in strong-anion exchange-HPLC. The system was applied to the analysis of chondroitin sulfate samples obtained from bovine, porcine and chicken tracheas, from shark cartilage, and of dermatan sulfate from porcine skin. The results indicate the existence of particular electropherographic as well as chromatographic patterns for each sample in the study, with some similitudes and differences. 3achondroitin sulfate 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adisaccharides 0adermatan 0aglycosaminoglycans0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2004 Feb. 25, v. 55, no. 3 p.273-281x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20050422b20050501c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/04/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02064naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001200127245009800139300001600237520119100253650002901444650001201473650001301485653002301498653002101521700001101542700001301553700001201566773008201578852000901660930003301669945002501702946001101727655001201738IND4363218420221118162041.0040701e20040225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436321842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Results showed that complex formed mainly by the electrostatic interaction between NH3+ of CSAC and COO- of AAPDB. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were evaluated against E. coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Results showed that CS/AAPDB solution could or even more strongly inhibit growth of all the tested microorganisms, whereas CSAC could not inhibit growth of C. albicans and AAPDB could not inhibit growth of S. epidermidis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa. Relative inhibition times (RITs) of CS/AAPDB solutions with different concentration and ratio of CSAC and AAPDB were also investigated against the five microorganisms. Results showed that CS/AAPDB solutions with CCSAC+CAAPDB of 0.05%+0.015%, 0.05%+0.0075%, and 0.025%+0.0075% showed higher antimicrobial activity.

  1 aAbu-Jdayil, B.10aRheology of starch-milk-sugar systems: effect of heating temperature  ap. 307-314.  aThis study aims to investigate the effect of heating temperature on the rheological behavior of starch-milk-sugar (SMS) pastes. Different concentrations of corn and wheat starch were heated in liquid skim milk containing 8 wt% sugar at 60, 75, 85 and 95 °C. The sugars used are glucose, sucrose and fructose. The pastes heated at 60 and 75 °C show the same low value of viscosity. As the heating temperature increased to 95 °C, a great increase in the apparent viscosity of the paste was observed. This means that the degree of gelatinization of starch heated at 60 and 75 °C was insignificant. On the other hand, the pastes exhibited a time-independent behavior at low heating temperature (60 and 75 °C) and changed to a thixotropic behavior with increasing the heating temperature. One exception was the 2 wt% wheat-milk-glucose paste, which shows an antithixotropic behavior. The Herschel-Bulkley model was used to fit the flow curves of SMS pastes. The yield stress and the consistency coefficient increased with increasing the heating temperature and starch concentration, reflecting the increase in paste viscosity. 3awheat starch 3acorn starch 3amilk 3asugars 3arheological properties 3agelatinization 3apasting properties1 aMohameed, H.1 aEassa, A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2004 Feb. 25, v. 55, no. 3 p.307-314x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20050422b20050501c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/04/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01594naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245004900142300001600191520083700207650001301044650002301057653002101080653002601101700001701127773008201144852000901226930003301235945002501268946001101293655001201304IND4363216920221118162026.0040701e20040225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436321692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMagnin, D.10aPhysicochemical and structural characterization of a polyionic matrix of interest in biotechnology, in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields  ap. 437-453.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper reports on the swelling degree and the rheological and structural characteristics of a hydrogel composed by chitosan and xanthan. The latter is a polyionic hydrogel obtained by complexation between the both polysaccharides. The swelling degree has been found to be influenced by the time of coacervation, the pH of the solution of chitosan used to form the hydrogel and the pH of the swelling solution. The molecular weight and the degree of acetylation of the chitosan also influence the swelling degree of this matrix. The connectivity between chitosan and xanthan affects the swelling degree of this matrix. A rheological study has been carried out in order to understand the formation of the coacervate and of the subsequent hydrogel. The evolution of the storage modulus with time during the coacervation has allowed to optimize the time of coacervation required for a subsequently hydrogel, with desirable swelling degree. The kinetics has shown that (a) the coacervate is formed in two distinct steps and (b) the storage modulus of the hydrogel reaches a stable plateau. The values of the storage modulus have been correlated with the swelling degree. The microscopic characterization has shown the presence of a porous network with a fibrillar structure. To complete the characterization studies fine powder of this hydrogel has been used to determine the surface, perimeter, Feret diameter and sphericity factor distribution of dry and hydrated (swollen) particles. 3astorage modulus 3achitosan 3ahydrocolloids 3aswelling (materials) 3aultrastructure 3amolecular conformation 3axanthan gum 0arheological properties1 aLefebvre, J.1 aChornet, E.1 aDumitriu, S.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2004 Mar. 15, v. 55, no. 4 p.437-453x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20050506b20050604c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/05/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02631naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008300128300001400211500001500225520140600240650004401646650001901690650001201709650001901721650001601740650002301756650002401779650001501803650002301818653001801841653003401859653002001893653001901913700001601932700001401948700001501962700001601977700001701993700001802010773007902028852000902107930003302116945001302149946001102162655001202173IND2332787320221118162307.0030528e20020401enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233278732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLundqvist, J.10aIsolation and characterization of galactoglucomannan from spruce (Picea abies)  ap. 29-39.  a2019-12-05  aWater-soluble hemicelluloses were extracted from spruce chips by microwave heat fractionation. The chips were impregnated with water at different pH values. Screening of heat-fractionation conditions, i.e. impregnation medium, temperature and residence time was performed with the aim to extract O-acetyl-galactoglucomannan. The impregnation and heat fractionation conditions were evaluated on the basis of the yield of dissolved mannan (oligo- and polysaccharides), molecular weight of the carbohydrates and amount of dissolved lignin. Increasing temperature and residence time increases the yield of mannan and decreases the molecular weight of dissolved carbohydrates. For a structural study of the extracted carbohydrates the chips were impregnated with water and treated at 200 degrees C for 2 min. Oligo- and polysaccharides were fractionated with preparative size-exclusion chromatography from the filtered extract. The structure of the obtained saccharides in two fractions 8 and 9 was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The polysaccharides in the fractions were O-acetyl-galactoglucomannan with a degree of polymerization approximately 20 and approximately 11 for fractions 8 and 9, respectively. The molar ratio for galactose:glucose:mannose was approximately 0.1:1:4. About one-third of the D-mannosyl units are substituted by O-acetyl groups almost equally distributed between C-2 and C-3. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3alignocellulose 3amannans 3apolymerization 3aPicea abies 3agel chromatography 3amicrowave treatment 3aseparation 3achemical structure 0ahemicellulose 0asize exclusion chromatography 0apolysaccharides 0aheat treatment1 aTeleman, A.1 aJunel, L.1 aZacchi, G.1 aDahlman, O.1 aTjerneld, F.1 aStalbrand, H.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2002 Apr. 1, v. 48, no. 1 p.29-39x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02362naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005500129300001400184520142200198650002201620650001201642650001601654650002201670650002001692650002501712650002301737653001701760653002901777700001501806700001701821700001701838773007901855852000901934930003301943945001301976946001101989655001202000IND2332787520221118162312.0030528e20020401enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233278752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyllarinen, P.14aThe crystallinity of amylose and amylopectin films  ap. 41-48.  aX-ray crystallinity of amylose and amylopectin films with 0, 10 and 30% of glycerol and stored at RH 0, 54 and 91% were studied. Films prepared of water cast dilute solutions and dried at 70 degrees C were thin and transparent. Each fresh amylose film showed B-type crystalline structures, and depending on the glycerol and water contents the amount of crystallinity varied from 6 to 32%. No changes in the crystallinity of the amylose films were observed during storage of two months. The fresh amylopectin films were completely amorphous. After storage for two months at the highest humidity the amylopectin film with 30% glycerol showed crystalline structure (19%), but all other amylopectin films remained amorphous during ageing. The crystal formation in the highly plasticised amylopectin film was suggested to be due to its rubbery state under the storage conditions. Amylose films were stable in water unlike amylopectin films that dispersed fast in water. About 35% of the amylose films were resistant to alpha-amylase, whereas amylopectin films were hydrolysed wholly. Also when treated with hydrochloric acid the amylopectin films dissolved totally and fast, while one week was needed to dissolve about 50% of the amylose films. It was concluded that even if part of the amylose films were amorphous, also these amorphous regions were more resistant to hydrolysis than the amorphous amylopectin structures. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamylose 3aamylopectin 3acrystal structure 3aacid hydrolysis 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3astorage conditions 0astarch films 0astarch water dispersions1 aBuleon, A.1 aLahtinen, R.1 aForssell, P.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2002 Apr. 1, v. 48, no. 1 p.41-48x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02294naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008600125300001800211520129100229650002201520650001601542650002301558650002001581650000901601650002401610650001301634650001601647650001101663650002101674650001401695650001901709653001401728700001801742773008001760852000901840930003301849945001301882946001301895655001201908IND2045399020221118162244.0950404e199412  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204539902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhidey, F.10aInterrill erodibility affected by cropping systems and initial soil water content  ap. 1809-1815.  aThe effects of continuous soybean and continuous corn cropping systems and initial water content (IWC) of the soil on runoff soil loss and interrill erodibility were studied in the laboratory. Samples of a Mexico silt loam (Udollic Ochraqualf) were packed in 0.3-m-wide X 1.0-m-long soil beds and subjected to a series of simulated rainfall events. Differences in measured runoff and soil loss between the cropping systems were less than 1.0%. The IWC did not affect soil loss during the initial event but it had a significant effect (p < 0.05) during the following event where an increase in mean IWC from 4 to 15% decreased mean soil loss from 12.9 to 10.7 g min-1 m-2. Cropping did not influence interrill erodibility (Ki) calculated from a power relationship with rainfall intensity. There was a negative linear relationship between Ki and IWC. Calculating Ki from rainfall intensity and runoff rate improved the relationship between Ki and IWC. Our results indicate that interrill soil losses and erodibility are sensitive to IWC and need to be considered in interrill erosion research and modeling, particularly for silt loam soils. Our results also indicate that including a runoff rate term in the equation used to predict interrill erosion will improve its prediction accuracy. 3ainterrill erosion 3aerodibility 3asoil water content 3asilt loam soils 3arain 3acontinuous cropping 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3arunoff 3alosses from soil 3aequations 3arain intensity 0asoil loss1 aAlberts, E.E.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 6 p.1809-1815x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02323naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006500127300001600192500001500208520151400223650002001737650002001757650001601777653003401793653002701827700002101854773008001875852000901955930003301964945001301997946001102010655001202021IND2333804120221118162242.0030731e20020501enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233380412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosalina, I.10aDynamic rheological measurements and analysis of starch gels  ap. 191-202.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of starch modification and concentration on the dynamic shear properties of starch gels in water was studied. The four types of starches used were native corn starch, medium hydroxypropylated distarch phosphate, highly hydroxypropylated distarch phosphate, and distarch phosphate. Concentrations of 4, 6, 8, and 10% (w/w) in distilled water were used for each starch type. All starches showed viscoelastic solid behavior at higher concentrations (6-10% w/w). Critical gelling concentrations were found to be 4, 4, 6, and 6% for native corn starch, medium hydroxypropylated distarch phosphate, highly hydroxypropylated distarch phosphate, and distarch phosphate, respectively. Dynamic measurements were performed to study the effect of concentration and the extent of modification on starch gel properties. The linear viscoelastic region for each type of starch was determined using dynamic strain sweep. Both the elastic and viscous modulus showed only slight dependence upon frequency. The starch gels were classified as weak gels on the basis of their mechanical spectra. Viscous moduli (G'') showed a higher dependence upon frequency compared to elastic moduli (G') for all starch types. Equilibrium shear moduli (Ge) were determined by extending the spectra to zero frequency. Increasing concentration increased the values of Ge. Fractional differential model (FDM) was used to model the frequency dependence of the gels. A higher degree of cross-linking resulted in a more shear-resistant gel. 3amodified starch 3aviscoelasticity 3astarch gels 0afractional differential model 0arheological properties1 aBhattacharya, M.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2002 May 1, v. 48, no. 2 p.191-202x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02091naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011700125300001600242500001500258520105100273650002101324650001301345650001401358650002301372650001101395653002701406653001801433653001601451653002001467653002401487653001501511700001801526700001501544773008001559852000901639930003301648945001301681946001101694655001201705IND2333804220221118162511.0030731e20020501enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233380422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirano, S.10aNovel N-saturated-fatty-acyl derivatives of chitosan soluble in water and in aqueous acid and alkaline solutions  ap. 203-207.  a2019-12-05  aNovel N-saturated fatty acyl derivatives of chitosan soluble in water and in aqueous alkaline and acid solutions were prepared in 45-72% yields by N-deacylation of sodium N-acylchitosan salts, and in 75-85% yields by N-acylation of chitosan.

Infrared heaters were used to raise canopy temperature of New Guinea Impatiens to a literature-based optimum level, which resulted in higher daily water use than plants receiving no radiant heat. The increase in plant water use was proportional to the decrease in the leaf-air temperature difference. Plants with canopy temperature close to 24 degrees C had increased water use of 118%, when air temperature was increased from 8 to 18 degrees C, and 33% when the air temperature was increased to 24 degrees C. A modified Monteith equation using canopy temperature predicted evapotranspiration very well, especially when the leaf-air temperature difference was 6 degrees C or less. Canopy resistance values were predicted to be higher for heated plants at higher leaf-air temperature differences and vapor pressure deficits (VPD) using a separate canopy energy analysis. 3acontainer-grown plants 3aprediction 3acanopy 3aevapotranspiration 3ainfrared heaters 3aImpatiens 3agreenhouse production 3aair temperature 3aequations 3aheat treatment 3aleaves 3agreenhouses 0acanopy temperature 0awater use 0aleaf air temperature difference 0atemperature1 aMeyer, G.E.1 aFitzgerald, J.B.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 6 p.1973-1980x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01911naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245005700124300001800181520098000199650001201179650001901191650002301210650001901233650001201252650001501264650001001279653001201289653001901301653001201320653001801332653002001350700001901370773008001389852000901469930003301478945001301511946001301524655001201537IND2045413320221118162227.0950405e199412  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204541332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, N.10aMachine vision methods for defect sorting stonefruit  ap. 1989-1997.  aA machine vision system consisting of an illumination chamber, monochromatic camera with a near infrared band-pass filter, frame grabber, and microcomputer was developed.

Results showed that grafting and emulsion polymerization processes were strongly related to those variables. In order to elucidate the actual grafting of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) onto wood-fiber, series of analysis were carefully performed. Scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of small agglomerates regularly distributed on the surface of the modified fiber, such agglomerates remained on the fiber surface after 24 h of chloroform extraction and were presumably grafted PMMA. Infrared analysis of the acid hydrolysis products of the modified fiber showed a clear characteristic signal of carbonyl groups at 1734 cm -1. Such signal indicated the presence of fiber-PMMA chemical links, since simple physical interactions would not remain after the cellulose hydrolysis. 3awood fibers 3apolyacrylic acid 3acomposite polymers 3apolymerization 0apolymethyl-methacrylate 0aemulsion polymerization1 aMarquez-Lucero, A.1 aZaragoza-Contreras, E.A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2004 Jan. 22, v. 55, no. 2 p.201-210x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20050506b20050604c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01885naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245008600144300001600230520087900246650001801125650001601143650001701159650001801176650003001194650004801224653002001272700002001292700001801312700001501330700001801345773008201363852000901445930003301454945002501487946001101512655001201523IND4362863320221118162345.0040610e20040122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436286332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The assembly of oligosaccharide chains in protein backbones is the most extensive of all the post-translational modifications, and can play a crucial role in protein folding, oligomer assembly and secretion, in regulating biological activity, as well as in clearance of glycoproteins from the bloodstream. Here, we describe modifications in LCAT-linked carbohydrate structures, arising from site-directed mutagenesis or from use of drugs and specific enzymes, which modify either the structure or the assembly of LCAT glycans, and evaluate how these help define their involvement in and importance to enzyme secretion, stability and activity. 3aglycoproteins 3acholesterol 3alipoproteins 3aglycosylation 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aphosphatidylcholine-choline acyltransferase 0aN-glycosylation1 aCoelho, L.C.B.B1 aKennedy, J.F.1 aOwen, J.S.1 aDolphin, P.J.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2004 Jan. 22, v. 55, no. 2 p.179-181x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20050506b20050604c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01855naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245007100121300001800192520100200210650001201212650001501224650001701239650002401256650002501280650002001305653002101325653002401346700001101370773008001381852000901461930003301470945001301503946001301516655001201529IND2045399920221118162338.0950404e199412  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204539992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, J.10aDroplet size distributions from different shaped sprinkler nozzles  ap. 1871-1878.  aSprinklers with circular and noncircular nozzles were tested to determine their droplet size distributions and water application patterns. Circular nozzles usually produced greater wetted radii and larger droplet diameters than noncircular nozzles, however, noncircular nozzles gave higher overlapped uniformity coefficients. Droplet formations from noncircular nozzles were compared with those from circular nozzles and it was found that noncircular nozzles created greater portion of droplets with diameter less than three millimeters at a given pressure. It is therefore confirmed that noncircular nozzles have the advantages of providing an acceptable water application pattern and a smaller portion of larger droplets over the entire precipitation profile at low operating pressure. A simple exponential model was developed to represent droplet size distributions from both circular and noncircular nozzles. The exponential model gave results similar to an upper limit lognormal (ULLN) model. 3anozzles 3asprinklers 3adroplet size 3amathematical models 3asprinkler irrigation 3adroplet studies 0acircular nozzles 0anoncircular nozzles1 aYu, K.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 6 p.1871-1878x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02244naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007300126300001800199500001500217520107300232650001201305650002601317650000801343650001301351650001801364650001701382650002201399653001801421653002401439653001601463653001001479653001201489653001901501653003601520700001901556700001501575700001601590700001701606700001501623773008001638852000901718930003301727945001301760946001301773655001201786IND2045408020221118162346.0950405e199412  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204540802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNegrini, O.10aEvaluation of laboratory grain cleaning and separating equipment.

The three machines tested were: 1) Dockage Tester (XT3) made by Carter-Day Co. (USA); 2) Mini Cleaner and Grader (Labofix) made by UCK Maschinebau (Germany); and 3) Laboratory Separator Cleaner (NSL) made by Tripette and Renaud (France). The main objective of the study was to compare the grain cleaning performance of the Labofix and NSL models with that of the XT3-model dockage tester. Data on the performance of all three machines were collected and analyzed from tests with five different crops, hard red spring wheat, white wheat, grain sorghum, rye, and flaxseed. Two units of each type of machine were tested with samples prepared at two levels of moisture content (11 and 15% w.b.) and three levels of impurities (5, 10, and 15%). The test results showed that the Labofix model is more feasible for use in grain grading, based on the analyses of impurity removal efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility, applicability, and ease of operation. 3alinseed 3ahard red spring wheat 3arye 3acleaners 3awater content 3awinter wheat 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 0aseed cleaners 0aair screen cleaners 0awhite wheat 0awheat 0agrading 0agrain cleaners 0aindented cylinder seed cleaners1 aSpillman, C.K.1 aWang, Y.J.1 aChung, D.S.1 aSteele, J.L.1 aPosner, E.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 6 p.1913-1918x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01955naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007000130300001800200520107300218650002401291650001201315650001401327650002401341650001301365650001001378653001801388653002301406700002101429700001901450773008001469852000901549930003301558945001301591946001301604655001201617IND2044510920221118162310.0950209e199409  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204451092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevenson, R.F.10aEnergy requirements and quality changes in steam-blanched alfalfa  ap. 1409-1415.  aDirect-cut alfalfa was chopped then blanched in a laboratory scale batch blancher for up to 300 s. Steam flow rate was varied from 55 to 580 kg/h; alfalfa mat thickness in the 0.36 m2 blancher was varied between 5 and 15 cm. The most energy efficient combination was 580 kg steam/h with a 15-cm alfalfa thickness (0.011 kg steam/m3 alfalfa). Energy required to achieve 95 degrees C for blanching was about 16 MJ/kg alfalfa dry matter (DM). Temperature variations due to location within the blancher were frequently significant (p < 0.05) in thin (5 cm) mats, but not in thicker mats. Crude protein (CP) concentration in the alfalfa was not affected by blanching. However, soluble protein dropped from 44.4 to 15.5% of CP as a result of blanching. Protein degradability dropped as much as seven percentage units due to blanching. Short-term heating did not change the acid detergent insoluble fraction of the protein. Steam treatment had mixed effects on acid detergent fiber, but increased neutral detergent fiber concentration unless subsequent fermentation occurred. 3aprotein composition 3aalfalfa 3ablanching 3aenergy requirements 3asteaming 3asteam 0afeed steamers 0aenergy consumption1 aBuckmaster, D.R.1 aAnderson, P.M.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 5 p.1409-1415x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02072naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008800125300001800213500001500231520102900246650002201275650002201297650001401319650002001333650002001353650000901373650001901382650001601401650002101417650002401438651001001462653002401472700001501496700001501511773008001526852000901606930003301615945001301648946001301661655001201674IND2044511620221118162303.0950209e199409  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204451162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoff, B.F.10aInfluence of rainfall intensity on the interrill erodibility of two rangeland soils  ap. 1445-1448.  a2019-12-05  aRangelands are subject to wide variations in rainfall intensity, and rainfall intensity is an important parameter in erosion models. This study measured interrill erosion rates for two rangeland soils for different rainfall intensities using a laboratory rainfall simulator. Both the general power equation E = aIb, and its constant exponent form E = cI2 (where E is interrill erosion rate, I is rainfall intensity, a and b are fitted parameters, and c is an interrill erodibility coefficient), adequately modeled interrill erosion response (r2 > 0.93 and r2 > 0.83 for the two models, respectively). These results indicate that the constant exponent model can be applied to rangeland soils. Interrill erodibility coeffficients, c, for natural rainfall conditions were estimated to be 6.5 X 10(5) kg s m-4 for the sandy loam soil and 8.8 X l0(4) kg s m-4 for the clay loam soil. These values were one to two orders of magnitude lower than those reported for agricultural soils, but were within the range for rangeland soils. 3ainterrill erosion 3asimulation models 3aequations 3aclay loam soils 3arangeland soils 3arain 3arain intensity 3aerodibility 3asandy loam soils 3arainfall simulators 3aIdaho 0amathematical models1 aBent, G.C.1 aHart, G.E.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1994 , v. 37, no. 5 p.1445-1448x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01509naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245005300122300001800175520068300193650001300876650001900889650002200908650001300930653001700943653001100960653001100971700001400982700001300996700001401009773008001023852000901103930003301112945001301145946001301158655001201171IND2044511220221118162345.0950209e199409  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204451122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, M.10aDamage to the surface of potatoes from collision  ap. 1431-1433.  aThe effect of dropping height and impact material on the surface damage of potatoes (Solanum Tuberosum) was experimentally investigated.

The water losses from gellan gels after four months storage at 4 degrees C were only 1-2%, independent of calcium concentrations. The freeze-thaw stability of gellan gels was poor. Water holding capacity of gellan gels, when subjected to centrifugal forces, was dependent on calcium concentrations, and was related to the texture properties. Two discrete pore-size distributions in gel matrix on the order of 0.1 and 1 mu were observed with scanning electronic microscopy. Large pores were formed with thick strings while the small ones were formed by a thin web structure. Defects in the large pore structure were observed at high calcium concentrations. The small pores may be responsible for the water holding capacity during storage, while large pore structures provide the strength of gels. 3agels 3awater holding capacity 3atexture 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3ashear stress 3agel strength 0astress analysis1 aTang, J.1 aSwanson, B.G.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2001 Dec., v. 46, no. 4 p.365-371x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01818naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010100126300001600227520084400243650001301087650001901100650002301119650004401142653001601186653002701202653002601229700001901255700001601274700001801290700001501308773007901323852000901402930003301411945001301444946001101457655001201468IND2330706020221118160653.0030201e200112  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233070602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinaudo, M.10aNMR investigation of chitosan derivatives formed by the reaction of chitosan with levulinic acid  ap. 339-348.  aChitosan derivatives are obtained by reaction of chitosan with a low degree of acetylation and levulinic acid under different experimental conditions.

Finally, conditions are described in which water-soluble N-carboxybutylchitosan is obtained. In particular, the time of the reduction step and the ratio between reagents are investigated. Under mild conditions and short times of reduction there is a very low degree of substitution and only the monocarboxybutylchitosan is formed. The dicarboxylated form is never observed.

The degradation pattern was monitored with size exclusion, with light scattering and viscometry detectors for determination of molecular weight and radius of gyration. Fractions with relatively narrow molecular weight distributions at high yields were obtained as a result of the gradual enzymatic degradation and the subsequent sequential ethanol precipitation technique used. Generally the fractions obtained showed a pattern of both decreasing molecular weight and radius of gyration with increasing enzymatic hydrolysis. Fractions that precipitated with the lowest ethanol concentration had the highest values of both average molecular weight and radius of gyration. The unit chain length distributions of the fractions were analysed and the results showed that the chain length distribution varied with the time of hydrolysis. There was also a decreasing trend in average molecular weight with enzyme degradation time for fractions that precipitated at the same ethanol concentration, indicating that the fractionation was affected by structure and not only by molecular weight. Data from this study could be useful for the production of modified amylopectin molecules that vary in composition and characteristics. 3abarley 3apotato starch 3aamylopectin 3aalpha-amylase 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3aenzymatic treatment 0achain length distribution1 aAndersson, R.1 aAman, P.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2002 Feb. 1, v. 47, no. 2 p.169-179x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02551naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010800163300001400271520141400285650002201699650003301721653003001754653002601784653001501810700001701825700001401842700002001856700001701876700002101893700001801914773011701932852000902049856008502058930003302143946001302176655001202189IND4446864020221118160245.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444686402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12013-010-9111-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Jianjun 10aPositron Emission Tomography with Pittsburgh Compound B in Diagnosis of Early Stage Alzheimer's Disease  ap. 57-62.  aIn order to evaluate the role of positron emission tomography (PET) with N-methyl-[¹¹C]-2-(4′-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole, also known as Pittsburgh compound B (PIB), in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical data were collected, and PIB PET cerebral imaging was performed in patients with AD (n = 6), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 7), and elderly, mentally normal controls (NCs) (n = 7). PET images of the subjects were then analyzed. Visual analysis showed that the radioactivity clearance rate in AD patients was significantly different from that found in the NC group. Furthermore, the radioactivity clearance rate 45 min after PIB injection was significantly lower than the NC group. Images from the MCI group presented heterogeneous results, overlapping with those from both the AD and NC groups. Statistical analysis showed that the radioactivity clearance rate during 5-45 min post-injection was significantly lower in the AD group (41-77%) than the control group (75-81%) (P > 0.05) and the MCI group (59-77%). The radioactivity clearance rate in the bilateral parietal lobes, frontal, temporal, and right occipital lobes, and the bilateral corpora striata in MCI group were lower than that in control group (P < 0.05). PIB PET brain imaging can differentiate early AD patients from NCs and may have certain value in identifying patients progressing to MCI. 3aAlzheimer disease 3apositron-emission tomography 0aMild cognitive impairment 0aPittsburgh compound B 0aβ-amyloid1 aSun, Binbin 1 aGuo, Zhe 1 aZhang, Jinming 1 aTian, Jiahe 1 aTang, Hongchuan 1 aWang, Luning 0 tCell biochemistry and biophysics.g2011 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.57-62dNew York : Humana Press Incx1085-91957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12013-010-9111-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle
